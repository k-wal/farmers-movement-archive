As earlier stories in this series have shown, it has hurt jobs and incomes. There is a view among economists that this strain put on livelihoods by the pandemic, which continues to a lesser degree in even the current financial year because of new variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, can be reduced by the government putting money in the hands of the people. Any government’s capacity to spend, however, depends on how much it earns. The central government’s receipts also took a hit in the last financial year. This is what receipts look like in the current financial year that began in April.

The ZP has also chargesheeted 22 officials involved in this matter and has issued notices to 212 former Panchayat Raj elected members from the concerned villages. This action by the ZP was prompted by the submission of the report by the enquiry committee appointed to investigate allegations of improper recruitment of staff members to 20 gram panchayats, just prior to the villages being included in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. “The report with the list of employees has been submitted to Pune Municipal Corporation for further action. A copy of the report has also been submitted to the Rural Development and Panchayati Raj department of the Government of Maharashtra. Administrative action has been carried out in the Pune Zilha Parishad and departmental enquiry hearings would be held at the Divisional Commissioner’s office, as per the law,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad. In December 2020, the state government issued a draft notification for the merger of 23 villages into PMC limits, after which major recruitments were carried out in the gram panchayats of most of the 20 villages. According to officials, 658 persons were recruited just before these gram panchayats became part of Pune PMC. Also, 44 persons were found to have been recruited by the Manjri Gram Panchayat in an earlier inquiry by the Block Development Officer of Haveli. Gradually the reports of improper recruitments came into the public sphere and the ZP also received few complaints. On June 30, the state government officially merged 23 villages in the PMC, making it the biggest municipal corporation in Maharashtra, with an area of 516 sqkm. An enquiry committee, headed by Dattatraya Munde, was then appointed by the ZP to investigate allegations of improper recruitment of staff members to gram panchayats. The committee started working in July 2020 collecting records from every gram panchayat. The final report was submitted to the ZP on December 17. ZP officials said that of the 23 villages merged with the PMC, no irregularities were found in Pisoli, Shewalewadi and Mahalunge. “A total of 69 employees from these 20 gram panchayats were on their approved Akruti Bandh, 247 persons were recruited earlier and have been working since a long time. But, 658 persons were recruited just before the merger. I would like to appreciate the enquiry committee for showing courage in the face of tremendous pressure and different forms of intimidation. They worked diligently and very hard to study the documents of 60,000 pages,” said Ayush Prasad. According to a member from this enquiry committee, every gram panchayat in question had to be investigated in a different way. Gram sevaks and elected representatives had adopted different methods to make the payments of these new improperly recruited staffers. “In seven gram panchayats, we found that gram sevaks had recruited their own sons. The family members of the elected representatives had also found place in the recruitment list. Different methods were adopted to hide the salary payment records of these staffers. We had to check every document. It was all done so that eventually these staffers would be employees of the Pune Municipal Corporation,” said a committee member, on the condition of anonymity. Though the enquiry report has been submitted and action has been initiated against those who are guilty, the enquiry committee hasn’t been able to verify allegations that the recruitments were done in exchange for money. The committee in its report has asked the administration to carry out this probe by a suitable investigation agency and has mentioned that the allegations could not be verified because this matter was not in its jurisdiction. Pune ZP has sent this report to PMC and now that these villages have been merged with the civic body it would take a decision on the future of the improperly recruited staffers in the Gram Panchayats. “We haven’t received the report yet. We will decide once we get it with proper details and lists,” said Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner PMC .23 villages merged with PMC Mhalunge, Sus, Bavdhan Budruk, Kirkatwadi, Pisoli, Kondhwe-Dhawade, New Kopre, Nanded, Khadakwasla, Manjari Budruk, Narhe, Mantarwadi, Holkarwadi, Autade-Handewadi, Wadachiwadi, Shewalewadi, Nandoshi , Mangdewadi , Bhilarewadi, Gujar Nimbalkarwadi, Jambhulwadi, Kolewadi and Wagholi. • Recruitment scam related action not initiated in Shewalewadi, Mhalunge, Pisoli 11 villages merged with PMC in 2017 Lohegaon, Mundhwa, Hadapsar, Uttamnagar, Shivane, Ambegaon Khurd, Undri, Dhayari, Ambegaon Budhruk, Phursungi and Urli Devachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/recruitment-scam-16-suspended-22-chargesheeted-by-pune-zilla-parishad-101640024848219.html

Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and India- BIMSTEC countries are among those participating in the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/deliberations-ongoing-for-a-global-treaty-to-deal-with-future-pandemics-who-chief-scientist-101640024552284.html
20-12-2021||Pune||Covid-19 pandemic not yet over, says Army chief General Naravane||PUNE Army chief of staff General M M Naravane on Monday said that the outbreak of Covid-19 has taught everyone many lessons and that disaster management against the backdrop of the pandemic is a reality and a major challenge, since the pandemic is not yet over. General Naravane stressed the importance of global and regional cooperation while tackling any pandemic-like situation Speaking at the inauguration of PANEX-21, a trans-national, multi-agency exercise organised in Pune from December 20-22 with a focused aim to “foster jointness and develop capabilities in disaster management aspects for the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) nations”. The Army chief said the fact is that the pandemic is not over as new variants have added realism to the conduct of this exercise. The South Asian region is prone to a large range of natural hazards, including floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, and tsunami, he noted. “Rapidly growing unplanned urbanisation, ecological degradation, and corresponding climate change effects and dynamically varying socio-economic conditions have increased our exposure to various natural hazards,” he said. All have witnessed the rising frequency of disasters with more intense and catastrophic events, he pointed out. “Our response strategies have also evolved aided by rapid improvements in technology, and have become more robust and resilient. Trans-national cooperation between BIMSTEC nations continues to be driven by common and shared challenges,” he said. The pandemic has overwhelmed the national capacity, disrupted the supply chain, and brought everyone back to the drawing board, he said. “Disaster management in the backdrop of the pandemic is a reality and a major challenge and this also forms a basic theme of PANEX-21,” he said. The earlier exercise was conducted in February 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, General Naravane said. “A lot has changed since then. The devastating effects of the pandemic have been witnessed and acknowledged by the world. We have realised that our standard operating procedures which worked well in the past are no longer active and we would need transformative changes,” he said. It was realised that resource preservation in the times of pandemic is as challenging as an application for disaster management, the Army chief said. He said it has become incumbent for the response teams to first protect themselves before being able to assess others. “We have also come to accept that no single agency has the capability or capacity to handle the challenge on their own. Not only that, such has been the strain on the resources that even well-developed countries with modern infrastructure have looked beyond for aid and assistance,” he said. PANEX-21 is unique as it is for the first time the exercise of this magnitude has been undertaken to review the mechanism and streamline the response strategy in the backdrop of pandemics, he said. The BIMSTEC regional organisation comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, besides India.

20-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to implement graded response action plan to combat air pollution||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government has planned to implement an emergency response system, similar to Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi to combat air pollution. This will be done in non-attainment cities that consistently fail to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 10 (Particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) or NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide). The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) drafted this plan and shared it with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) along with other eligible local bodies in September 2020. According to officials, this is likely to be implemented in time for next year’s pollution cycle.The GRAP is a set of measures that are triggered in phases as air quality deteriorates. For example, when the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR hits the ‘severe’ category, concerning municipal corporations in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh impose bans on polluting activities such as construction, operation of cement mix plants and running diesel generators, and step-up patrolling for open burning. The sprinkling of water and road-sweeping to control dust pollution are also activities triggered under the GRAP every winter in the National Capital Region (NCR), when air quality hits the ‘very poor’ AQI category.MPCB has categorised air quality in four stages (from ‘moderate’ to ‘emergency’) based on the daily concentration of particulate matter pollutants PM2.5 and PM10. In Delhi, the pollution control measures range from dust sweeping during ‘moderate’ conditions to imposing odd-even vehicle rationing schemes and blanket bans on construction work when pollution levels touch ‘severe’ classification. These gradations, and the actions mandated under them, are uniform across Maharashtra and will be implemented by municipal bodies when air quality remains within a category for 48 hours.The GRAP will be implemented in 25 non-attainment cities and five cantonment boards across the state. A senior MPCB official informed, “All municipal corporations and councils of non-attainment cities in Maharashtra have been given a copy of the GRAP. They have been told to take appropriate action for the improvement of air quality by implementing it, but this has not happened yet. It is up to the Urban Local Bodies (ULB)s to start doing so. The MPCB will act as the regulator of this plan and seek daily reports from the environment departments of the implementing ULBs.”The official further informed that in a coastal city like Mumbai, where winters are very mild, there may never be a situation when air quality touches the ‘emergency’ category. But in cities like Pune, or further west like Nashik and Nagpur, where winters are much intense, GRAP will play an important role in curbing air pollution.Sunil Godse, who heads the BMC’s environment wing, said that GRAP will be put through a public consultation process in the last week of February 2022, as part of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan which is being developed in partnership with the World Resources Institute (India). “Once the graded action goes through the public consultation process, we will begin implementing it. It should be operational in time for next year’s pollution cycle in Mumbai,” Godse said.The GRAP, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017 — at the instruction of the now-defunct Supreme Court-appointment Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) — has seen little success in north India, where cities like Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Sonipat, continue to see high levels of air pollution during the winter.“The problem with the GRAP is that it is a reactive measure, not pre-emptive. In Delhi-NCR, which has a vast airshed and where the meteorological conditions are not favourable for dispersal, the GRAP has not shown much efficacy. But in cities across Maharashtra, you see a lot more regional variation in pollution levels, and there is a chance that the GRAP may show measurable impact. It will depend entirely on implementation, and ideally should be accompanied by a forecasting system so you can start implementing the measures before the air quality deteriorates irrevocably,” said Sachin Pawar, an independent air quality scientist certified by the Quality Council of India under the union environment ministry.Dr SN Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at IIT-Kanpur and member of the Steering Committee of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), said, “The Maharashtra government is very progressive in its approach to air pollution. But, indeed, the GRAP in Delhi has not had much measurable impact on the overall air quality. It’s a step in the right direction, but every city has widely different sources of air pollution and meteorological conditions, and it would be beneficial for Maharashtra to tailor this policy toward the local realities of its non-attainment cities rather than impose it as a blanket policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-implement-graded-response-action-plan-to-combat-air-pollution-101640023589106.html
20-12-2021||Lucknow||Luckowites seek relief from pollution with air-purifying plants||The high pollution level in the state capital and smog has attracted the attention of citizens towards indoor plants that are said to have high air purifying properties. The nurseries in Lucknow have reported rise in sale of plants such as peace lily, snake plant, syngonium, areca palm, aglaonema, monster and rubber plants. The air quality index in the city remains as poor and severe. Since the lockdown sales of plants have registered substantial growth but it has seen a rapid growth due to social media awareness, says Sandeep Rai who runs a nursery in Mahanagar. “After lockdown the online sale portal propagated a lot about benefits of plants and the NASA survey in which they had named few plants with high air purifying properties and the toxins they remove. It’s a known fact that plants give oxygen and along with it brings us close to nature, gives a feeling of happiness which has given rise to this fad,” says Rai.Ardent plant lover and educationist Shalini Singh has planted several air-purifying at home. “My me time is being with my little green world that we have created at our balcony as we don’t have gardening space. Areca palm, peace lily, marble queen, aloe vera, snake plant, syngonium, dracaena and aglaonema which are said have air-purifying qualities besides many other flowering and ornamental plants adorn my home,” she says.Play House school principal Shabnam Kapur, who started Arjun Nursery in her son’s memory, too vouched for the trend. “We had a dumpyard at the back of our school that we converted into a nursery for kids to remain close to nature, learn and prepare plants that eventually purchased by parents. Flowering plants are fast-selling in winters but plants which are high on air-purifying now more in demand. We know about the oxygen emitting property of plant and with that it gives happiness and keeps us close to nature,” she says.Gokul, the gardener at her nursery adds, “Bahut log oxygen wale ped mangne aate hai. Kafi saare to pehle bilkul nahi biktey they par ab sabko spider plant, peace lily aur areca palm chahiye.”Shachi Singh, who runs social enterprise Nature’s Gift and promotes rooftop farming, calls it a small step toward self reliance. “How long will we blame others for everything! We need to cut pollution, promote greenery and rooftop farming is an option where we can and it’s a step towards being self-dependence, healthy living and being close to nature. I am happy that people are slowly but becoming aware,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/luckowites-seek-relief-from-pollution-with-air-purifying-plants-101640023528844.html

This week the condition is better, however, the rates are expected to remain high as many farmers have suffered damages due to unseasonal rains. The wholesale rates have gone up by 20%,” said Vilas Bhujbal, president, Market Yard Commission Agents.“Along with the damage caused by the unseasonal rains, due to marriage season and less supply, tomato and brinjal rates are high,” added Bhujbal.For the last two years, Pune district has been getting rains in November and December and it has impacted the rates of vegetables.“Generally, during winter, it is expected that vegetable rates remain stable, but these trend has changed in the last two years in Pune district due to rains. The unseasonal rain has caused heavy damages to all vegetables and also to fruits like strawberries. We have not seen ample strawberries coming in to the city till now this year,” added Bhujbal.In the wholesale market – a bag of 10kg brinjals costs around ₹600-800, while tomato is trading for between Rs150 to Rs300 for 10kg.Shalmali Rege, resident of Sinhgad road said, “In winter season, tomato rates never go up like it is happening now. We used to make tomato ketchup at home, purchasing tomatoes at ₹10-15 per kg a couple of years back. For the last two years we have stopped making it because the price is crossing ₹40 per kg.”“Rates are fluctuating every day in Sahakar nagar. Rates are Rs20 less in the afternoon, but it increases in the evenings. Most vegetable vendors keep the rates the same, if one can bargain then it is your luck, otherwise you have to pay extra,” said Sayali Shinde, a school teacher who stays near Sahakar nagar.Chandu Bisure, vegetable vendor from Ideal colony, Kothrud said, “There was a shortage of brinjal and tomato last week in the wholesale market so rates have gone up.”Leafy vegetablesWith fewer trucks of leafy vegetables coming into market yard, rates have gone up. “A 30 per cent rise has been noticed in leafy vegetables. The rates of methi and spinach are stable. High rates are expected to remain the same for next week,” added Bhujbal. “The rates are expected to remain high till Makar Sankranti (January 14), supply increases during this time and rates start to stabilise,” added Bhujbal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/prices-of-tomato-brinjal-spike-as-farmers-claim-crops-destroyed-by-december-rain-101640023470163.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Construction ban over but dust control a priority, says Rai||New Delhi: Following directions from the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said the government has issued a notification to immediately lift the ban on construction and demolition activities and entry of trucks into the city, but added that firms need to strictly adhere to 14-point dust guidelines issued by the Delhi government. Rai also said that the government’s campaigns against dust pollution and open burning will continue, and teams will further undertake night patrolling to ensure dust norms are being followed in the Capital.The 14-point guidelines include measures such as setting up anti-smog gun for sites measuring over 20,000 square metres, sprinkling water to settle dust, covering construction material with tarpaulin, and cleaning up after the entry and exit of supply trucks, among others.“If a construction company is found violating any of the 14 rules, firm action will be taken against the company and the site in question will also be sealed if needed. Hence, it is my appeal to all agencies involved in C&D (construction and demolition) work to not take unfair advantage or be careless now that the ban has been lifted,” said Rai on Monday.He further asked people to report any violations on the Green Delhi app.“Pollution levels in Delhi had increased considerably post-Diwali and we were recording ‘severe’ air. Keeping this in mind, all construction and demolition (C&D) works were banned in Delhi, with only activities of national importance allowed to continue. All trucks entering Delhi, barring those involved in essential services, were also banned, but with Delhi’s AQI not touching severe in the last 10 days, these bans have been lifted immediately,” said Rai on Monday.Rai added the government’s anti-dust campaign and its anti-open burning campaign are still in place, with agencies such as the PWD, the corporations, and the fire brigade continuing sprinkling of water.“These campaigns and drives are continuing and it is my appeal to the people of Delhi that while some of the emergency measures we had taken to tackle pollution are now being relaxed, we still have to work towards improving the air quality in Delhi for which we need everyone’s cooperation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-construction-ban-over-but-dust-control-a-priority-says-rai-101640023468243.html
20-12-2021||Lucknow||UP govt seeks guidance over NISHAD Party’s SC quota demand||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday shot off a letter to the Registrar General of India and the Census Commissioner of India seeking guidance over the reservation to the Nishad community under Scheduled Caste (SC) category.The Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) Party chief Dr Sanjay Nishad, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2022 UP assembly election, has raised the demand for the inclusion of Nishad, Majhwar, Kewat and Mallah communities in the Scheduled Caste category and reservation for them in government jobs accordingly.Union home minister Amit Shah had assured the Nishad community to fulfil their demands and resolve all the problems in the joint rally of the NISHAD Party and the BJP held on Ramabai Ambedkar ground in Lucknow on December 17. There, the NISHAD Party chief Sanjay Nishad had handed over a memorandum to chief Minister Yogi Adityanath demanding reservation to the Nishad community under the SC category.A state government spokesperson said, special secretary, UP government Rajnish Chandra has sent the letter to the registrar general and the census commissioner in which he has drawn the attention of both the authorities towards the Majhwar caste which is mentioned at number 53 in the list of scheduled castes of the Uttar Pradesh government.The memorandum of NISHAD Party chief has also been attached with the letter in which Sanjay Nishad has stated that Majhi, Majhwar, Kewat, Mallah and Nishad surnames are used by people of Majhwar caste in different areas of the state. “Due to the use of various surnames, they are not issued SC certificates whereas other SC people using various surnames are getting benefits meant for SC members,” he said. “Dr Sanjay Nishad has demanded that all the people with surname of Majhwar caste should also be given Scheduled Caste certificates,” the spokesperson added.Reacting to the letter, Dr Sanjay Nishad said, “The party thanks the BJP leadership and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to fulfil the long pending demands of the Nishad community. The Nishad community has been fighting for justice since long. The reservation to the Nishad community under SC category was one of the main demands of the NISHAD Party.” Replying to a question, Sanjay Nishad said the Nishad community leaders who joined the SP on Monday were expelled from the party in 2019 on the charges of indiscipline and anti-party activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-seeks-guidance-over-nishad-party-s-sc-quota-demand-101640023408295.html
20-12-2021||Mumbai||HC asks MSRTC employees to consider problems of rural students||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday expressed hope that the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees still on strike would consider the inconvenience being caused to 12 lakh students in rural areas and resume duty as a court appointed three-member committee looked to resolve the significant issues raised by them. Since October 27, 96,000 employees of MSRTC across Maharashtra have been on strike, seeking a merger of the cash-strapped body with the state government — a move that the state transport minister Anil Parab has said would need consideration and time. After the state moved court asking the employees to end their strike, the HC on November 8 directed the state to form a committee that would look into the employees’ grievances. The HC on Monday was informed that while the committee had managed to get the issue of payables and dues ironed out, it was yet to consider the issue of merger. The committee said it hoped to arrive at an amicable solution within the three-month deadline given by court. The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice S M Modak was hearing the writ petition and contempt petition filed by the MSRTC and the interim applications filed by the employees. Advocate S C Naidu representing the state submitted that the wages of the employees had been hiked based on their employment with the corporation and the dues till the month of November had been paid. A few weeks ago, the government announced that it will hike the salaries by 41% and raise the basic pay of all employees. However, thousands of employees are still agitating over the issue of merger, which they hope will be a permanent solution to payment delays and permit greater job security.Advocate S U Kamdar, representing MSRTC, while responding to a query of the court on whether the employees had resumed duty submitted that only 3,000 employees had resumed duty and out of the 13,000 rounds a day (plying between start-point and destination), the corporation was able to complete only 2,500. As a result, commuters especially from the rural areas were suffering and were getting fleeced by private service providers. “We are expecting the committee to give a commitment on when they will hear our demand for merger of MSRTC employees with state government employees,” advocate Gunaratan Sadavarte, representing the employees said. He added that the issue of employee suicide on account of non-payment of salaries before the strike also needed to be addressed, and the number now stood at 54. He said that the court needed to ensure the welfare of the employees too. After hearing the submissions the court said that as per news reports, students were suffering due to lack of the cheapest mode of transport and asked Sadavarte whether he was cognizant of the suffering of the students community.

20-12-2021||Pune||Covid-19 vaccines can be tweaked for protection against new variants: AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria||PUNE The COVID-19 vaccines can be “tweaked” to provide protection against new variants of the virus, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, Director Dr Randeep Guleria has said.His remarks have come in the wake of concerns over the new Omicron variant of COVID-19. “Although there is this new variant of COVID-19, the silver lining is that it does seem to be a milder disease and we should have protection as far as the vaccine is concerned. And I think it is important to remember that vaccines can be tweaked,” Dr Guleria here said on Sunday.“We will have second generation vaccines. This is something which we need to keep in mind. The current vaccines are effective but with new variants, they will decrease on immunity, however vaccines can be tweaked,” he added.He was speaking at the Dr V S Prayag Memorial Oration 2021 organised here in Maharashtra by the Association of Physicians of India. Every year, a new vaccine (for diseases in general) is created based on surveillance data provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), therefore it is easier to do it, Dr Guleria said.While Omicron was first reported in South Africa on November 24, India’s first two cases of this heavily mutated version of the coronavirus were detected in Karnataka on December 2. Till Sunday, 153 cases of Omicron were reported in India.According to central and state officials, the Omicron cases have been detected in 11 states and Union Territories -- Maharashtra (54), Delhi (22), Rajasthan (17) and Karnataka (14), Telangana (20), Gujarat (11), Kerala (11), Andhra Pradesh (1), Chandigarh (1), Tamil Nadu (1) and West Bengal (1).Earlier this year, the Delta variant of the coronavirus was primarily responsible for the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

20-12-2021||Mumbai||Stop interfering with Coastal Road work, Worli police to fisherfolk||Mumbai The Worli Police on Monday issued a notice to protesting fisherfolk from Worli Koliwada, under Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Code, instructing them to “stop interfering” with ongoing Coastal Road construction work being carried out by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Since October 14, fisherfolk have prevented the BMC’s contractor from constructing an interchange between the Coastal Road and the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which they maintain will cut them off from their traditional fishing grounds.The police’s notice, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Times, has been signed by Anil Koli, senior police inspector, Worli. Addressed to Nitesh Patil, secretary of the Worli Koliwada Matsyavyavsay Sahakari Sangathan (a registered fish worker’s society), the letter states, “You and your colleagues are frequently disrupting the ongoing work of the Coastal Road project by carrying out fishing activities near Cleveland Bunder in violation of orders.” The BMC had, in October, told fishers that they would not be allowed to carry out their trade in the area for a period of two years. However, since the BMC has not yet agreed to their demands for a redesign of the interchange, fishermen have continued to operate in the area and have repeatedly thwarted attempts by the BMC to resume construction work.“In the future, if you and your colleagues reunite and disrupt the work of the Coastal Road project and create law and order problems, you will be held fully responsible and will be prosecuted. Appropriate legal action will be taken for any violation of this order,” the notice states. It also tells fisherfolk that all forms of protest, including meetings, fasts, marches, dharnas and so on are prohibited at any other location in South Mumbai other than Azad Maidan, as per a 1997 order of the Mumbai High Court.Fisherfolk, on the other hand, maintained that they will not give up their demands for a redesign of the interchange, and will respond to the police’s notice through appropriate channels. Fisherfolk has repeatedly emphasised that the proposed interchange between the Coastal Road and BWSL will force them to shut down Cleveland Bunder, an artisan fishing port in Worli Koliwada, despite regulatory clearances for the project prohibiting any construction that hampers traditional livelihoods of fishers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stop-interfering-with-coastal-road-work-worli-police-to-fisherfolk-101640021728180.html

20-12-2021||Mumbai||Lokmanya Tilak’s kin in bid to head Savarkar Smarak||MUMBAI: Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, one of India’s foremost freedom fighters, was an abiding influence on revolutionary-turned-Hindutva ideologue, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. This Sunday, though, the descendants of Tilak and Savarkar will battle it out for control of the Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak or Swatantryaveer Savarkar National Memorial at Dadar in central Mumbai. The memorial is the nerve-centre of Savarkarites. The memorial’s president has a one-year tenure. Its membership is limited to Savarkarites (applications are vetted by existing members, and only those that are loyal to Savarkar’s ideology are approved), and is controlled by 11 trustees, who are also part of a 21-member working committee. There are provisions to co-opt up to five members on the working committee. Deepak Tilak, the great-grandson of the Lokmanya, will fight for the president’s post; and Ranjit Savarkar, the grandson of Savarkar’s younger brother Dr Narayanrao aka Bal, and his associates, have fielded former state director general of police (DGP) Praveen Dixit. Located opposite Shivaji Park at Dadar, the memorial is spread over 6,650 sq m (1.65 acres), of land, and has a library, exhibits and conducts classes for activities such as martial arts. The land was granted by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the early 1970s, and the first phase was thrown open in 1989, with the second phase inaugurated in 2003. Close to 400 members of the trust will vote by secret ballot on December 26. Deepak’s father Jayantrao Tilak became a Congress leader following a stint with the Hindu Mahasabha, a social organisation-turned-political-party that Savarkar headed between 1937 and 1943. It was under Savarakar that Hindu Mahasabha became became a staunch critic of the Congress party. Jayantarao was the chairman of the memorial from 1987 to 1996 and its president from 1996 to 2001. As a Congressman, he became a member of the Rajya Sabha from 1968 to 1980, and was also chairman of the Maharashtra Legislative Council. Deepak is the chancellor of the Tilak Maharashtra University and controls the Kesari newspaper, while his son Rohit is a Congress leader and had contested the assembly elections from Kasba Peth in Pune. Deepak said poor management has led to the memorial’s weak financial position. “The management of the Smarak is poor... its financial health has collapsed,” he said, adding that he had written to the members of the institution in the past about these issues. He said that Congress leaders had also played a role in the development of the institution and had donated to it. A trustee from 2004 to 2007, Deepak says he has promised to restore its glory, add more members and also complete work on the museum of armed revolutionaries, which he alleged is hanging fire for 20 years. He also referred to his father’s role in the development of the complex. “Deepak Tilak has no moral right to contest as he kept mum when the Congress was defaming Savarkar,” said Ranjit, the current working president. He said the Tilak Smarak Mandir Trust controlled by him had given the Lokmanya Tilak award to Congress leaders such as Pranab Mukherjee and Sheila Dixit. He questioned whether Deepak wanted to dilute the case filed by the Smarak against former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for his comments against Savarkar. Ranjit said Deepak had announced his candidature for the President’s post in 2006, but had later backed off. Tilak and Savarkar In 1905, Savarkar, then a student at the Fergusson College in Pune, organised a massive bonfire of imported clothes, with Tilak in attendance. Tilak also recommended Savarkar to the revolutionary Shyamji Krishna Verma, enabling him to get a scholarship to study for the Bar at London. Editors of Kesari such as NC Kelkar and JS Karandikar were affiliated to the Hindu Mahasabha, and the newspaper reflected these positions. Savarkar would stay in the Kesari office guest house at Pune and his daughter Prabhat was married there in 1945. Jayantrao, whose father, Shridharpant Tilak, was a social reformer and anti-caste activist, was with the Mahasabha before joining the Congress. He also edited Kesari. Tilak’s other grandson GV Ketkar was also the editor of Mahratta and Kesari. Savarkar was arrested in connection with the murder of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, but acquitted by a special court. In 1964, presiding over a function to felicitate the accused in the case who had been released from prison, Ketkar disclosed that for around three months before Gandhi’s murder, Nathuram Godse, his assassin, used to discuss these plans with him. This led to an uproar and prompted the Union Government to set up the Justice J.L. Kapoor commission. It would say that “all these facts taken together were destructive of any theory other than the conspiracy to murder by Savarkar and his group.” However, in 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the finding of the commission did not interfere with the acquittal or overturn it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lokmanya-tilak-s-kin-in-bid-to-head-savarkar-smarak-101640021008227.html
20-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC gives green signal to ₹1.8k crore worth road works||Mumbai The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee headed by the Shiv Sena cleared road repair works in the city at ₹1,800 crore- 18% below the estimation of ₹2,200 crore by the BMC’s administration. This is despite corporators across party lines raising concerns about whether the contractors, who bid that BMC’s estimated cost just to get the contract, would end up building poor quality roads to earn profit. However, barring members of the opposition BJP, they voted in favour of the proposal citing upcoming elections and the condition of the roads requiring repairs before the next monsoon. According to BMC estimations, the proposed repair work across the city, western and eastern suburbs include both major and minor a total of 808 roads. For this, ₹2,200 crore was estimated to be spent. However, in the meeting of the civic standing committee, the proposals to give contracts for ₹1,800 crore, which was 18% below the estimated cost were cleared. BJP members walked out of the meeting demanding rollback of the proposal, while Shiv Sena with the support from Congress and NCP, showed green light to the same. The BJP had demanded that proper details should be given by BMC as to why contracts are being given at lower rates than the estimations followed by technical details regarding the road contracts.However, corporators across party including Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP backed the proposals citing upcoming elections wherein corporators have to show face to the citizens.Vishaka Raut, Shiv Sena Corporator and group leader of the Sena in the BMC, said, “We need to understand that we have been working for the citizens over the last five years. Now we need to see what works we do for citizens in the last few months. Hence, we should be passing these road repair works proposals without any further delay.”The current tenure of the corporators is ending on March 7, 2022, and the elections are expected in the last week of February or the first week of March.Prabhakar Shinder, BJP’ group leader in the BMC said, “There are no details in the proposal as to what is the length, width of the individual roads that are being taken up for repair works. The third-party auditors that will monitor the quality of road repair works are yet not appointed. So, why are we going ahead with passing the proposal at much lower rates?”Ravi Raja, the leader of Opposition in the BMC and Congress Corporator said, “I agree that the contracts are being awarded at a much lower price and we need to appoint a third-party auditor to monitor repair works, but this does not mean we delay the work. We need to pass the proposal and ensure administration gives good quality of roads to the citizens.”Responding to the corporators, Sanjeev Kumar, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have noted each and every point of corporators and we will do the necessary compliance. We will also timely appoint third-party auditors to monitor road works, and good quality of road repairs will be ensured.” Post this, Shiv Sena Corporator Yashwant Jadhav and chairman of the standing committee gave their approval to the proposals worth ₹1,800 crore. However, the BJP corporators staged a walk out of the civic standing committee.Civic activist Nikhil Desai from Matunga said, “For a citizen or layman, I do not think contracts being given at more or less cost should be a concern considering BMC is financially stable to spend. But what matters the most is that the quality and durability of the roads should be there. If there are potholes in months or roads, there is no meaning. I will be happy if citizens good roads even at a higher or lower rate considering quality is all that matters.”Further, under the repair, maintenance and strengthening work, the BMC is converting the surface of all city roads from paver block/ asphalt to cement and concrete.

The team from SCB Medical College and Hospital, comprising Datteswar Hota (urologist), Satya Narayan Routray (cardiologist) and Chitta Ranjan Panda (gastroenterologist), took the flight to Jeypore and then from there to Malkangiri town. Before the team arrived, another team of 4 doctors from SCB Medical College had travelled to Malkangiri.Health minister Naba Das said under the initiative, a list of specialists required for the treatment of critical patients admitted to various District Headquarters Hospitals (DHH) will be prepared and sent to the health department. Accordingly, the doctors will be flown to the destined DHHs through aircraft/ helicopters for prompt treatment of the patients. If required, the patients will be airlifted to various healthcare facilities in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Specialists such as neurologists, nephrologists and cardiologists will be flown to the DHHs. The follow-up treatment of the patients will be carried out through tele-medicine.The air health service comes in the aftermath of the distribution of smart health cards under the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana in which pre-loaded cards will be given to over 96 lakh families. Under the scheme, an annual health coverage of ₹5 lakh is provided per family while families with women members get an additional ₹5 lakh. The cardholders can get free treatment up to ₹5 lakh or ₹10 lakh from empanelled private hospitals.The air ambulance service however was slammed by health activists who called it an election stunt. Gouranga Mohapatra of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, a health NGO, said while the state government has filed an affidavit with Orissa High Court that nearly 44 per cent of the doctor posts are lying vacant in district headquarter hospitals, periphery hospitals, community health centres and primary health centres across the state, there is little to achieve by flying doctors from Bhubaneswar or Cuttack.“It’s an exercise in futility. The government instead of flying in doctors can strengthen the healthcare system in the district headquarter hospitals by recruiting doctors. Instead of spending huge amounts of money on burning aviation fuel, the same money can be used to hire more doctors and make their residential quarters in districts better. These stop-gap arrangements would not be of much help,” said Mohapatra.The state government in an affidavit in the Orissa High Court last week said that till December 7, at least 3,523 posts of general duty medical officers in the Odisha Medical Health Services cadre were vacant out of sanctioned posts of 5838. Similarly, 1,211 posts of specialist medical officers in the OMHS cadre were vacant out of 2708 sanctioned posts....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-starts-air-health-services-to-fly-doctors-to-hinterland-hospitals-101640020708969.html
20-12-2021||Patna||People raising questions over PT result are ‘Manuwadi’: Soren over JPSC row||Rejecting all allegations of corruption in the ongoing civil services examination being conducted by the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC), chief minister Hemant Soren on Monday said that those making an issue of the Prelims result are people with ‘manuwadi’ mindset as the number of aspirants from the reserved category has gone up this time around.Soren made this statement in the Jharkhand assembly in view of the repeated disruption of proceedings in the House by the BJP legislators demanding CBI inquiry in the alleged irregularities in the examination and sacking of the JPSC chairman.“People who hold Manuwadi mindset are having trouble now because members from the ST, Dalit, and OBC category are coming forward. They are getting people paid to hold protests. They are backing the protesters from the backdoor and providing them with ration and logistics. They are making VHP people sit in the protest,” Soren said.Claiming that the JPSC was an autonomous body and there was no interference of the government in conducting the examination, the chief minister challenged all 81 members in the House to come out with any proof against it. Besides BJP, members from the JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML) have raised questions about the Preliminary Test (PT) results and have even sought a probe.“We know what has been the history of JPSC in the past due to government interference. A former JPSC chairman is in jail and CBI is also probing the case. But in this examination, there has been no interference from the government. I challenge all 81 members here to come with any proof,” said Soren.The CM’s statement, however, failed to impress those demanding a probe. Speaking to reporters outside the House, BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi said the CM’s remark was a diversionary tactic to defend corruption and the JPSC chairman.“No one is raising questions about people from which category have cleared the exam. The question is about irregularities. Initially, the commission said there was no irregularity, despite the fact that students from the same room cleared the exam at the same location. When the aspirants protested and started mounting pressure, the commission itself revised the result saying OMR sheets are missing. Why has the Commission not put the OMR sheets in the public domain yet as was promised in the examination notification? The CM is running away from the real questions,” said Marandi.Taking exception to the CM’s statement, BJP legislator and former minister Amar Kumar Bauri described his remark as unbecoming of someone holding a constitutional post. “You are making divisive statements to defend corruption and the JPSC chairman. The government was also defending itself in the Rupa Tirkey murder case. Court then ordered a CBI inquiry. You say there is no political interference, but you have made the wife of party spokesperson member of the JPSC,” said Bauri.CPI (ML) legislator Binod Singh, who too has been demanding a probe, said he was not convinced with the CM’s statement. “It would be better if the government comes out with data to back their statement. JPSC is an independent body, but it is the government that makes all appointments. They have access to all information. They should instead come out with facts over questions being raised so that they gain the confidence of the aspirants,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/people-raising-questions-over-pt-result-are-manuwadi-soren-over-jpsc-row-101640020348224.html

Lakhs of people, both in formal and informal sectors were said to have lost their jobs. Jharkhand witnesses huge migration due to lack of jobs in the state and many returned home during the pandemic, the government said.When asked by the BJP legislator about its plans to fill vacant government posts, the government’s reply did not give a clear road map on the issue.The government said the process of recruitment is going on and employment policy across several departments is being amended and it would soon come up with employment notifications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/56-lakh-registered-with-unemployment-exchange-in-18-months-in-jharkhand-101640020107864.html
20-12-2021||Patna||Bihar: MU registrar, 4 others arrested by SVU||Sleuths of the special vigilance unit (SVU) on Monday arrested four people including two professors and a registrar of Magadh University (MU) for alleged corruption, misuse of government funds, and abuse of powers, SVU officials said.Last month, the SVU had carried out raids at the residence and office of the MU vice-chancellor.The registrar, identified as Pushpendra Kumar Verma, has earlier held additional charges of Nalanda Open University and Arya Bhatt Knowledge University. Others who were arrested have been identified as Prof Binod Kumar, library in charge of MU, proctor Jainandan Prasad Singh and assistant Subodh Kumar.Confirming their arrests, the additional director general (SVU) N H Khan told HT that all the accused were produced before the special vigilance judge and they have been sent to judicial custody.He said that the SVU had on November 17 carried out simultaneous raids at the office of MU’s VC Rajendra Prasad, residential premises in Bodh-Gaya and native place at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.The SVU has registered a case against present V-C, his PA-cum-assistant of MU, Subodh Kumar, the financial officer of Veer Kunwar Singh University (VKSU), Om Prakash, registrar of Patliputra University, Jitendra Kumar besides M/s Poorva Graphics & Offset Printers, M/s XLICT software private limited, Lucknow and others under IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), besides relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.According to preliminary reports, the V-C has been charged with financial irregularities to the tune of ₹30-crore during his stint as MU VC and additional charge of Veer Kuer Singh University (Ara) for a brief period.According to sources, there was a long list of complaint against the V-C, including petitions sent to the Prime Minister by a Right to Information (RTI) activist regarding corruption in Bihar varsities through UP-based companies - Infolink Consultancy Services Pvt Ltd and XLICT Pvt Limited, both of which are registered under the name of the same person and were mentioned as working under patronage of bigwigs. The owner of the companies is also said to be related to the V-C.The contract given to the two companies spelt trouble for the V-C after the resignation of MU finance officer, termination of registrar by the order of the Raj Bhawan and later the transfer of MU financial advisor to TM Bhagalpur University by Raj Bhawan’s notification few months ago.The three officers had in March 2021 written to the principal secretary, Chancellor’s office regarding pressure on them to clear payment of ₹16-crore to the two companies for OMR sheet and other exam related work without following the due tender process.Besides, answer-sheets were purchased from Vidya Enterprises (Khera), Gujarat, without following the due procedure of going through the GEM portal for any government purchase. “A new RS 26-lakh SUV was also purchased by the VC without prior sanction even though nearly half a dozen vehicles were there at the university in the VC’s name,” the officials said, adding there were various other complaints regarding money play in transfer, posting and even official work.
20-12-2021||Mumbai||Now Raut dares BJP to give up 105 assembly seats and fight polls again||MUMBAI A day after union home minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah dared chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to resign and fight elections again, the Shiv Sena on Monday delivered its comeback challenging the BJP to give up its 105 seats in the assembly and see how many it wins without the support of the Shiv Sena and central agencies.Sena leader Raut said in the national capital, “We dare them (BJP) that all 105 legislators (who won in the 2019 elections) must resign. Had it not been for the Shiv Sena’s support, they would not have got this number. We dare them to resign and get re-elected in the 105 seats.”“You are roaming around with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Maharashtra. We dare you to keep them away and then fight us. We will take attacks head on; do not backstab,” Raut said in a thinly-veiled reference to cases registered by the three agencies against leaders of the ruling coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA).Responding to Shah’s accusation that the Shiv Sena compromised on Hindutva for power, Raut said, “The Shiv Sena has never let go of Hindutva and it will never do so. In 2014, a ‘staunch Hindutvawadi party’ like ours was cast aside for the sake of complete power. Amit Shah must tell everyone who was it that wanted to keep the Shiv Sena out... He (Shah) also said that we should contest solo. I wish to tell him that we contested solo in 2014 against an immense wave of money, power and government power. We fought well under Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership and got victory.”Shah on Sunday accused the Sena of betraying the BJP for power and called the MVA a ‘punctured rickshaw’ whose wheels were headed in three different directions. “They (Sena) sat in the lap of the ones they have been fighting against for two generations,” he said. Reacting to Shah’s criticism, Raut said that he understood the ‘frustration’ of the BJP leaders as the central agencies failed to topple the MVA government. Raut recalled that when the alliance was announced at a venue in Worli in 2019, both parties used the phrase, “50:50 power-sharing”. “What does it mean? The 50:50 power-sharing (formula) included the chief minister’s post as well; do not lie, at least not in Pune, which is Shivaji Maharaj’s land. He (Shah) must look into law and order in Karnataka where Shivaji Maharaj is being insulted,” Raut said.Countering Raut’s riposte, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said that the state of affairs in Maharashtra is so bad that people would react to it if there is an election now. “Amit Shah said that if the Shiv Sena is ready, they can announce polls and see the results for themselves. If an election is announced now, it will be clear who helped whom. Everything (in the government) is scattered. Somebody is unwell, someone is in jail, papers are leaked, there are crimes against women, farmers are not getting any assistance, Maratha reservation is gone, the other backward classes (OBC) political quota is gone so let the people vote again in this backdrop, and you will know who the citizens back.”Ahead of the municipal elections, the bitter war of words between the Sena and BJP is only expected to intensify as the Sena wants to keep control of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and gain control of civic bodies in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad with the help of the NCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/now-raut-dares-bjp-to-give-up-105-assembly-seats-and-fight-polls-again-101640019748072.html
20-12-2021||Patna||Bihar set to get new chief secy in 2022, two IAS to go on central deputation||With the present chief secretary, Tripurari Sharan, set to retire by end of December, the Bihar government is now looking at options to fill the post, officials said.A 1985 batch IAS officer, Sharan was appointed as the state chief secretary on May 1 after the demise of his predecessor Arun Kumar Singh due to Covid-19. Since then, he has been given two extensions of three months each, one in June and the other in September. His term will come to an end on December 31.At present, there are 12 officers in the rank of additional chief secretary in the state, including 1986-batch Sanjiv Kumar Sinha, presently chairman, board of revenue. However, many see development commissioner and 1987 batch officer Amir Subhani as the front runner to succeed Sharan, though another 1987 batch officer Atul Prasad, additional chief secretary, social welfare department, is also in the race.Subhani had a long stint as the state home secretary as well and people aware of the development said that he might fit Nitish Kumar’s scheme of things. Moreover, what goes in Subhani’s favour is the continuity factor, as he would retire in April 2024, while Sinha and Prasad will retire in May 2022.Other officers in the additional chief secretary rank include chief inquiry commissioner Sudhir Kumar (1988 batch) and three 1989 batch officers - revenue and land reforms department head Vivek Kumar Singh, industry department head Brajesh Mehrotra, labour resources department Vandana Kinni , and three officers in the 1990 batch, education department head Sanjay Kumar, home department head Chaitanya Prasad and prohibition and excise department chief KK Pathak. Apart from the two officers, heath department head Pratyaya Amrit and finance department head S Siddharth, from 1991 batch, are also in the additional chief secretary rank.One of the additional chief secretaries Sanjay Kumar is set to go on central deputation. He is awaiting his empanelment after no objection from the state government. Besides, chief minister Nitish Kumar’s principal secretary Chanchal Kumar, who had the longest stint with the CM, is also set to go on central deputation. He is seen as the most powerful officer due to his close proximity to the CM. His exit might lead to a rejig in the CM secretariat as well, people aware of the development said. Besides, former chief secretary Dipak Kumar is also tipped for the post of chairman of a commission, people aware of the development said. Since his retirement as chief secretary, Dipak Kumar is serving in the CM secretariat as principal secretary.
20-12-2021||Patna||Special status demand: JD(U) threatens to stage stir in Bihar, BJP calls it ‘political stunt’||Upping the ante on the central government to grant special status to Bihar, the Janata Dal (United) on Monday threatened to launch an agitation if their demand is not met. The JD(U) had even raised the matter in the Lok Sabha on December 14. JD(U) national president of the Parliamentary Board, Upendra Kushwaha in Patna said that if the Centre wants Bihar can get a special status. “Everything depends on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If he wants, Bihar will get special status immediately. If the central government does not give special status, then JD (U) will launch an agitation,” Kushwaha said.The renewed demand for the special status follows Niti Aayog’s recent report on multidimensional poverty index which placed Bihar at the bottom in the country.Lashing out at the BJP, who have been opposing the demand of granting special status to Bihar, Kushwaha said, “Please inform the people of Bihar how many special packages have been given to the state”.Hitting back at Kushwaha, BJP minister for road construction Nitin Naveen said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has provided a special package due to which Bihar is developing. The Prime Minister is keeping a close watch on the state.”Terming JD(U)’s demand as a political stunt, BJP’s spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said, “Kushwaha’s statement is nothing but a political stunt. This is not required at all. Bihar is being properly looked after by the PM. During the 14th Finance Commission, there was a provision of special status but the Raghuram Rajan Committee suggested doing away with the “Special Category” criterion of providing additional assistance to poorer states. Instead, it has proposed a general method for allocating funds from the Centre based on the state’s development needs as well as its performance”.Denying that the party’s demand for special status is a political stunt, JD (U) national principal general secretary KC Tyagi said, “Didn’t Bihar fulfill all the parameters? The Niti Aayog says Bihar is backward but is silent on the crime rate that has come down in general and on women empowerment. ”A senior NDA leader who did not wish not to be named questioned the party’s timing for raking the issue. “In its quest to get national party status, the demand has been raised so that JD (U) gets a greater share in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh polls,” said the leader.Experts also echoed the same view. “Nitish Kumar’s renewed demand for special status has no apparent reason except that JD (U) wants to fight on more seats in Uttar Pradesh, which is due for polls next year. Making his presence felt will make the BJP pay attention to Nitish’s demands, if any, in Uttar Pradesh,” said Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor of Sociology, College of Commerce.According to people aware of the development, JD (U) wants to get close to 60-80 seats in UP whereas in 2012 it had contested 20 seats.
20-12-2021||Patna||Bihar fully prepared tackle third wave of Covid: CM||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that the state is prepared to meet any eventuality in case the third phase of pandemic breaks out.Talking to media persons after the customary Janta Darbar — an event where people get a chance to talk to the CM about their problems —Kumar said there was no report of Omicron infection in Bihar, so far. “The health department has intensified testing for Covid pandemic across the state to ward off the outbreak of the pandemic. Bihar is among the states, where the rate of testing is, considerably, very high,” said the CM, adding that it’s taking nearly 22-25 days for the test to decipher the new variant of Covid against the previous cycle of 5-7 days.The CM said that the health department was on alert mode to combat the challenge. “The designated hospitals are geared up with all resources to deal with the pandemic,” he added.Taking swipe at the opposition’s allegations about the misuse of public money in the name of social reforms campaign, slated to begin this Wednesday, Kumar said he does not care about others perceptions. “Through this campaign, we want to make the society free from addiction, dowry, child-marriage and ensure that all needs of the poor get fulfilled, irrespective of the distance barrier. The families marginalised in the society must be attached with the livelihoods. The campaign for social reforms will go along with the development of the state,” added the CM.Regarding former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s allegations that the influential persons breach the liquor ban with impunity, Kumar said he didn’t expect a person, who take the pledge to ensure prohibition in the state, talk like that. “Of course, there are still some people, who do not obey the norms and they are caught by the law enforcing machinery,” said the CM.On being asked for the reasons for the delayed completion of the PM housing scheme units, the CM asked the principal secretary of the rural development department, Arvind Kumar Chaudhary, to explain the situation. Countering the allegations, Chaudhary said that 83% of the houses being built under the scheme were complete, while the pace of construction on the rest would scale up after the Panchayat elections. About 26 lakh housing units are to be completed under the PM Awas Yojana in the state this fiscal.As many as 135 persons met the CM during the event and sought solutions for their problems related to various departments..
20-12-2021||Mumbai||Will our bandh restraining order have any impact on political parties: HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC), while wondering aloud whether its orders restraining bandhs in the state would have any effect on political parties, directed the state to respond to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by former police commissioner Julio Ribeiro and three others. The PIL in question seeks to penalise the political parties which called for a statewide bandh on October 11 to protest the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and to restrain political parties from calling bandhs in future as they are unconstitutional.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik while hearing the PIL filed by Ribeiro, 92; Gerson Da Cunha, 92; Dattatraya Sukhtankar, 89; and Cyruz Guzder, 76; was informed that the October 11 bandh was unprecedented and called by the three parties in power in the state.The PIL stated that it was understandable that a bandh was called by opposition parties or their members but this bandh was called by the MVA government comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and hence, caused losses to the tune of Rs3,000 crore to the state exchequer.The PIL added that the bandh was unconstitutional as it affected citizens’ rights and therefore illegal and hence sought directions to the ruling allies to pay, jointly and/or severally, exemplary damages/compensation to the union of India and the state of Maharashtra and to the affected citizens/persons, through a bandh loss compensation fund, 2021.The bench appreciated the petitioners’ concerns and stated, “Who is to identify who is affected and the extent of him being affected and how much compensation he should be given?” The court questioned whether its order restraining bandhs would have any effect. “Even if we order that no bandh should be allowed henceforth, do you think that our orders will be imposed? It requires a change of mindset,” said chief justice Datta. The bench then directed the state government to file an affidavit in response to the petition and posted the matter for further hearing on February 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-our-bandh-restraining-order-have-any-impact-on-political-parties-hc-101640019447909.html

This new setup is part of long-stretch construction work on the fifth and sixth line between Thane-Diva railway stations for diversion of trains to help avoid any obstructions or delays in the Central line for both suburban and outstation trains.After exiting tunnel 1, the trains will run on the current down slow line. Similarly, suburban trains on the up slow line from Mumbra to Kalwa will use the same route wherein after exiting the tunnel, they will run on the up slow line. There are a few more mega blocks planned in the future for the completion of work on the fifth and sixth lines. Thane-Diva is the busiest section of the suburban network of the Central Railways. The work of the fifth- and sixth-line project between the two stations was sanctioned in 2008 and since then, its cost rose from ₹130 crore to ₹440 crore. The 9-km stretch between Thane and Diva has four lines; however, if compared to the other stretches that have six to eight lines, this stretch, in particular, has a narrow section that delays local, suburban and outstation trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/down-slow-line-trains-between-kalwa-mumbra-run-on-a-new-alignment-101640019268720.html

20-12-2021||Lucknow||Income tax raids trigger cartoon war between SP, BJP in Uttar Pradesh||Income tax raids on Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders have become the new flash point in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP) with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition party using cartoons to spar with each other. The Samajwadi Party also put up a poster outside its party headquarters in Lucknow that essentially said that SP had Akhilesh, while the BJP had central agencies, including income tax, enforcement directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). While the income tax department that had carried out a survey on Samajwadi Party leaders considered close to party chief Akhilesh Yadav, remained tight-lipped even after over 36 hours of the whole exercise, the SP chief on Monday shared a cartoon that led to the BJP’s counter. The income tax dept has reportedly wound up its assessment on SP national spokesman Rajiv Rai though assessment had still not officially concluded on some leaders in Lucknow. The cartoon that Akhilesh shared on Twitter showed “on election duty” written on a vehicle of the income tax department to drive home his point that the income tax exercise on his party leaders just ahead of the elections was politically motivated. In the run-up to the 2022 UP polls, Yadav’s party has emerged as the chief opposition player that is trying to stop the ruling BJP from a second successive stint in power in the most populous state. The cartoon that Akhilesh shared went viral in no time as the SP chief had mentioned lines from the Hindu holy book Ramcharitmanas with the cartoon. The lines went thus:“Hit anhit pashu pakshioo jaana, manus tanu ganu gyan nidhana (amid the sages, animals roam without fear but run away at the sight of hunters. How can human beings not be aware of that what animals know instinctively).” The SP leaders, whose premises were searched included Jainendra Yadav, a close aide of Akhilesh Yadav. His Vishal Khand-Gomtinagar residence in the state capital was searched. The others whose premises were searched were party spokesperson Rajiv Rai (at Mau district’s Sahadatpura) and contractor Manoj Yadav from Punjabi Bagh locality of Mainpuri, who is believed to be close to the SP chief and a Lucknow-based businessman. Akhilesh’s cartoon jibe at the BJP drew a counter from the ruling party, which responded with another one that showed Akhilesh stating “Yogi hai, anupayogi (Yogi is unsuitable)” even as income tax sleuths held a bird on which it was written “income disproportionate to known sources of income.”Income tax sleuths were also shown holding a briefcase on which it was written “on national duty.” This tweet by the BJP, too, went viral even as top leaders of both BJP and the SP spoke on the raids.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had on Sunday said that income tax raids had rattled the Samajwadi Party. In response, the SP chief charged the BJP with misusing the central agencies for poll gains. Adityanath had targeted the main opposition party’s accusations against the government reflected a ‘guilty conscience’.He had also said that the “wealth of some people went up by 200 times in five years of Samajwadi Party rule.” Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya also defended the raids. He said only the corrupt fear it even as the SP found support from several opposition parties on the issue.Asked about the outcome of the tax survey findings on SP leaders, a tax official not associated with the survey said such assessment exercises are usually a long-drawn affair.“Usually, these surveys and assessments stretch for long and there is a long procedural part, which includes cheque books and balance sheets of those surveyed,” a tax official said.

The BSP leader was addressing a public meeting at Mirzapur in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The BJP government’s work is limited to hoardings, banners, posters and advertisements, Mishra said.The welfare schemes and development projects announced by the state government were confined to paper, he alleged, adding that the BJP government has failed to fulfil the people’s aspirations. Satish Chandra Mishra called upon the Brahmin community members to support the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the Uttar Pradesh assembly election. Members of all communities, including Brahmins had been safe and had lived with dignity under BSP rule, he said.He also claimed the BJP government converted Kashi Vishawanath temple and Vindhyadham into tourist spots and the aim is to raise funds rather than serving the people or respecting their religious sentiments. The BSP leader said both the SP and BJP promote members of a particular community while others are neglected. He further alleged the farmers, traders, labourers, youths and women are harassed under the BJP government. Akhilesh Rakesh, son of former Congress MP Ram Nihor Rakesh, and Satyansh Shekhar Mishra, a social worker from Sonbhadra district, joined the BSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-govt-should-give-jobs-instead-of-smartphones-says-bsp-leader-101640015067878.html

The mangoes were sold at Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 per dozen to Crawford market, Peddar road, Linking road, Juhu and Ghatkopar,” director of the fruit market and mango trader Sanjay Pansare said. The next lot is expected in 20 days. “From January onwards, the stock coming will increase,” Pansare added.Farmer Arvind Walkhe, 65, from Kunkedhwar in Devgad who has been producing mangoes during this time since the last five years said, “Regular pesticide and fungicide spraying is what helps me get the fruit in the month of December for five years now. The trees start flowering in the month of July. In most cases when it started raining and flooding, farmers don’t step out for spraying. But I make sure to do it every two days. That helps me with the results too. Even when there is heavy flooding, I go for spraying. The sprays used are expensive and cost Rs5,000 to Rs6,000 per litre,” Arvind Walkhe said.

20-12-2021||Mumbai||Omicron cases in Maha: Over 80% breakthrough infections||Mumbai More than 80% of the Omicron cases detected in the state since December 4 are breakthrough infections- that is among people who are fully vaccinated. State health authorities said that the Omicron cohort is still too small to conclude the behaviour of the highly mutated virus, but preliminary observations highlight its immune escaping nature which should be considered as a point of caution. Of the 54 Omicron cases detected in Maharashtra till December 19, 44 are among fully vaccinated people. Among the remaining 10 cases, two people were unvaccinated but one of them had contracted Covid-19 in the past, and eight were minors and thus not eligible for the jabs. “As seen globally, the new variant does evade immunity developed through vaccination or previous infection,” said Maharashtra surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. “But we cannot ignore the fact that all the patients had a mild and asymptomatic infection and the vaccination has an important role in this,” he said. A majority of people in Maharashtra and the rest of the country have received the Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s vaccine-Covishield. In comparison, a small percentage of the population has received Covaxin developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech. Preliminary studies have shown Omicron’s ability to evade through the immunity developed by most of the widely used vaccines. Newly published observations by researchers at Cambridge University pointed that the new mutant could cheat existing immunity but it could not cause replication of cells, which is perhaps why it causes a milder disease. “Little is known about whether the mild disease caused by Omicron is due to the virus’ inherent nature or because of the vaccination,” said infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal. “Some studies have shown that a previous Covid-19 infection offered 80% protection against the Delta variant, but it offers only 20% protection against Omicron. It is therefore clear that we will see a rise in cases by January-February. Our health systems should be prepared as given our population, the magnitude of the cases could be high,” she said. Maharashtra has recorded over 6.6 million Covid cases. The state’s full vaccination coverage has touched 54% and its first dose vaccination coverage is 86%. “We have broad exposure to the virus including the Delta variant. But only time will tell if our population will behave differently with Omicron compared to the other countries,” said Dr Singhal. In the UK, for instance, 90% population has taken at least one dose, 82% has taken two doses and a large chunk of the population has taken booster shots. Yet, the country’s daily caseload has been nearing 90,000 over the past few days and it has been recording more than 100 deaths. PREPARE FOR THIRD WAVE Health experts said that data on how the virus will behave in senior citizens and the immunocompromised population is not available, but if the caseload increase, hospitalisations are likely. “The Omicron variant has not caused any Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions or a surge in oxygen requirement,” said Dr Om Srivastava, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “But we should be prepared for a third wave which is likely in February. If the numbers increase, some hospitalisations are bound to happen,” he said. Assuming that Omicron continues to cause only mild disease, doctors called for refined home isolation and institutional isolation protocol in the state so that patients don’t unnecessarily crowd hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-cases-in-maha-over-80-breakthrough-infections-101640008227543.html

He also referred to income tax raids on places associated with those close to Samajwadi Party leaders and justified them. The yatra, which chief minister Yogi Adityanath had flagged off in Mathura on Sunday, took the shape of a road show while passing through the old city areas of Aligarh in western Uttar Pradesh. The road show began at Kalawati Palace on the Khair bypass and, after crossing Aligarh city, reached Harduaganj. After Atrauli, the home to former BJP leader the late Kalyan Singh, the yatra moved towards Kasganj district in the evening. “Uttar Pradesh is changing now. It is now not known for riots, which used to take place in the previous regimes of the non-BJP parties. Now, UP is known for development undertaken during the BJP regime in state. Earlier, there was goonda raj. Now, law and order prevails. Criminals are either in jail or out of the state. The state got multi-crore investment even during the pandemic,” Dinesh Sharma said. “Expressways and international airports are coming up. New schools and colleges are opening and 12 universities are in the process of being set up. People in UP acknowledge that BJP has worked on the ground and is against any appeasement,” DInesh Sharma further said.“Income tax raids have taken place because no wrongdoing is to be spared. He may be from any party whatsoever, the law will take its course and guilty will be punished,” he said.Ministers of state Chaudhary Udaybhan Singh and Sandeep Singh, Etah MP Rajveer Singh Raju, BJP state spokesperson Alok Awasthi and the party’s media incharge for Braj region Nawal Tyagi were present during the Jan Vishwas Yatra in Aligarh. 
20-12-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC extends Varavara Rao’s bail till Jan 7||Mumbai The Bombay high court on Monday extended till January 7 the medical bail granted to Elgar Parishad case accused P Varavara Rao after perusing his medical reports and allowed his counsel to file a short affidavit till December 30. The medical summary report submitted by the Nanavati hospital on December 16 based on the tests conducted by various experts stated that Rao’s condition was stable. Rao’s counsel however wanted to file a short affidavit which the court allowed. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, which is hearing the extension of medical bail application of Rao, was informed by senior advocate Anand Grover that after perusing the medical reports it was clear that Rao deserved an extension. He referred to the February 22 order which granted bail for six months and said that in light of the observation that due to his age, the authorities should ensure that Rao is not having any ailments and as the medical reports stated that Rao had age-related problems hence the bail should be extended. Grover further submitted that a short affidavit in light of the medical reports was necessitated and hence the bench should grant a further extension for Rao to surrender. The court accepted the request. However, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the national investigation agency opposed the request and said that such extensions would go on perpetually if Rao was not asked to surrender. “He has to surrender, why keep delaying it,” said Singh. The court thereafter noted that Rao’s counsel had a right to respond after seeing the medical reports and was granted the extension only in light of the February 22 order. Directing Grover to file the reply by December 30, the bench posted a hearing of the application to January 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-extends-varavara-rao-s-bail-till-jan-7-101640007687376.html

Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “The areas falling in the jurisdiction of sectors 81-110 are getting water supply. We will start water supply for sectors 111 to 115 from March next year. Works, such as laying pipelines and other infrastructure for water supply, is being undertaken on priority as many people have started residing in these sectors and occupation certificates are also being issued. The work was affected due to a ban on construction activities for the past one and half months...we will start work from Monday.” Officials said since the usage of water is less during winters, hence residents are not facing any problem, but work is underway to increase water supply before the next summer. Works have been expedited on a 250m-long line functional near the under-construction boosting station at Sector 72. This boosting station will provide water to residents from sectors 68-80 during the summer months, when demand is high. GMDA officials said currently, Gurugram has a capacity to treat 570MLD of water; of which 513 MLD is treated everyday. During winters, there’s a demand of around 400-450MLD of water while in summers, it increases to 500MLD or more. With increasing population, GMDA is expecting the demand for water supply also to increase. “With increasing population, we will need another unit of 100 MLD to meet the increasing demand for water. A project for the same was approved by the chief minister during GMDA’s ninth board meeting. This water treatment plant, which will be constructed at an estimated cost of ₹110 crore, will be completed in two years,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-water-supply-to-new-sectors-111-115-likely-to-start-from-march-101640001147056.html

The legislation, which was passed in August in the budget session of the assembly, had been criticized by opposition parties due to the strict restrictions. The government will table an amendment bill for the law in the winter session of THE state assembly which began on Monday. “We want to change two important provisions of the Bill. Earlier, when we used to recover illegally transported cattle, while the animals are sent to cow shelters, the vehicles used to transport them used to be in our custody,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “The first amendment would allow us to auction off the seized vehicles after taking permission of the court. This will empower officials and also bring in additional revenue,” he added. The second amendment would allow inter-district transportation of cattle for agricultural and animal husbandry purposes except in 8 districts that border Bangladesh and Bhutan. The present law restricts inter-district transportation without permits issued by the competent authority. The Bill bans inter-state transport of cows through Assam to control their smuggling to neighbouring Bangladesh. It also bans the transport of cattle from other states through Assam to places outside the state. Transport of cattle from any place within Assam to places outside the state “where the slaughter of cattle is not regulated by law” is also banned. Transport of cattle from places outside Assam to any place within the state is also be banned by the legislation. Further, the movement of cattle from one place within the state to another located in Assam will also be restricted. However, the competent authority may issue a permit for the transport of cattle for bona-fide agricultural or animal husbandry purposes. The Bill bans the sale of beef in areas that have a predominant population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and other non-beef-eating communities or within a radius of 5 km of any temple, ‘satra’ (Vaishnavite monastery) “or other religious institutions belonging to Hindu religion”. Violations of the provisions of the Bill could lead to imprisonment for three to eight years and a fine between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh. Besides the amendment Bill for cattle preservation law, the state government would table 13 other amendment legislations and new legislation for setting up a commission to regulate recruitment to Class III and Class IV posts.

20-12-2021||Mumbai||‘Shiv Sena is a staunch Hindutvawadi party’: Sanjay Raut rebuts Amit Shah||MUMBAI: A day after union home minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah dared chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to resign and fight elections again, the Shiv Sena on Monday delivered its comeback, challenging the BJP to resign its 105 seats in the assembly and see how many it wins without the support of the Shiv Sena and the central agencies.“We dare them (BJP) that all 105 legislators (who won in 2019 elections) must resign. Had it not been for Shiv Sena’s support, they would not have got this number. We dare them to resign and get re-elected on 105 seats,” Sena leader Sanjay Raut said in national capital Delhi.“You are roaming around with CBI, ED, and NCB in Maharashtra. We dare you to keep them away and then fight us. We will take attacks front on, and do not backstab,” he added, a reference to cases registered by the three federal agencies, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (NCB) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), against leaders of the ruling coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA).Raut also responded to Amit Shah’s accusation that the Shiv Sena compromised with Hindutva for power. He underscored the Sena’s credentials as a “staunch Hindutvawadi party”“Shiv Sena has never let go of Hindutva, and it will never do so. In 2014, a staunch Hindutvawadi party like ours was cast aside for the sake of complete power. Amit Shah must tell everyone who was it that wanted to keep the Shiv Sena out... He (Shah) also said that we should contest solo. I wish to tell him that we contested solo in 2014 against an immense wave of money power and government power. We fought well under Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership and got the victory,” Raut said.Amit Shah’s criticism at a meeting of BJP workers in Pune was mostly directed at the Sena, which contested the 2019 state assembly elections in alliance with the BJP but parted ways over the issue of the chief minister’s post. Later, Thackeray joined hands with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Shah said the Sena betrayed the BJP for power and called the state’s ruling alliance a “punctured rickshaw” whose wheels are going in three different directions. “They (Sena) sat in the lap of the ones against whom they have been fighting for two generations,” he said.Raut said he understood the “frustration” of BJP leaders as the central agencies failed to topple the MVA government.Raut recalled that when the alliance was announced at a venue in Worli in 2019, both parties used the word “50-50 power-sharing”. “What does it mean? The 50-50 power-sharing [formula] included the chief minister post as well; do not lie, at least not in Pune, which is Shivaji Maharaj’s land. He must look into law and order in Karnataka where Shivaji Maharaj is being insulted.”Amit Shah’s sharp attacks on the Sena at Sunday’s meeting sounds the bugle for the elections to municipal corporations, including Mumbai and Pune, which are due early next year. The bitter war of words is expected to intensify between the two parties, as the Sena wants to keep control of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and gain control of the civic bodies in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad with the help of the Nationalist Congress Party.
20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Age no limit for Badal Senior, launches campaign from Lambi||Nonagenarian Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal launched his party’s poll campaign in the Lambi assembly segment of Muktsar district on Monday with eight public meetings. Also read: Punjab elections: Sidhu wants debate with Kejriwal, not Bhagwant MannAccompanied by his daughter-in-law and Lok Sabha member from Bathinda, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the five-time former chief minister has been evading a direct reply on whether he will be contesting the 2022 elections or not. When pressed for an answer on Monday, he didn’t reveal his plans but expressed gratitude to the electors of Lambi who had made him victorious from the rural constituency for the past five elections. Badal, who celebrated his 94th birthday on December 8 has been contesting elections successfully from Lambi since 1997. Earlier, he represented the Gidderbaha segment for another five terms since 1969. The Shiromani Akali Dal has announced candidates for more than 80 seats. Lambi and Jalalabad are among the key seats from where the party has yet to announce its candidates. Former deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal was elected from Jalalabad twice in 2009 and 2014. During his two terms, he tried to nurture the segment as a SAD bastion. But in the 2019 bypoll, the SAD had fielded Raj Singh Dibbipura, who lost to novice candidate of Congress Raminder Singh Awla. Parkash Singh Badal will be super CM: Harsimrat At a public meeting at Bhitti Wala village of Lambi segment on Monday, Harsimrat said people want Parkash Singh Badal to contest again. “On winning the elections, Sukhbir may be the chief minister, but Sardar Parkash Singh Badal ji will be super CM. He will remain the guiding force for the government,” she said. “It is the wish of the people of your constituency. You need not step out of your home as I will represent the family and shoulder the responsibility of campaigning,” she appealed to Badal Senior. Villagers and aides of Badal urged him to contest but he kept everyone guessing on his plans. Congress has done maximum damage to Punjab: Ex-CMAddressing the gathering, he said the coming elections are crucial for Punjab and Punjabis. He said the SAD is known to protect the social fabric and works for inclusive development. Badal said he owed his success in public life to voters in villages. “In my political career spanning seven decades, people voted for me to form governments and represent them. They even went to jails when I was imprisoned by political dispensations for raising their voice,” he said. “The Congress has done maximum damage to the state and to the spirit of Punjabiyat. Incidents of military action on Darbar Sahib, Amritsar, and the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 were the real faces of the Congress. Leaders of such a party should not be let in the village,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-age-no-limit-for-badal-senior-launches-campaign-from-lambi-101639992566674.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||As air quality improves, CAQM lifts construction ban in Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas on Monday lifted the ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities in NCR and the ban on entry of petrol and diesel trucks into Delhi with immediate effect, citing an improvement in air quality over the past few days.In its order issued on Monday morning, CAQM said construction and demolition activities can resume immediately, but each site needed to follow the norms and guidelines laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).All construction and demolition sites in Delhi and the NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh with a plot size of more than 500sqm will, however, also have to register themselves on a ‘web portal’ developed by the state governments for online monitoring by agencies. For Rajasthan and Haryana, where the web portal is yet to be commissioned, the registration process will need to be done latest by January 20, 2022, the CAQM said. HT has reviewed a copy of the order.Also Read: Political narrative on air quality management in India“Air quality in Delhi has improved from the ‘very poor’ category and has been in the ‘poor’ category consistently for the last three days. The meteorological and weather forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) indicates continuation of this favourable trend of wind speed and climatic conditions to facilitate dispersion of pollutants from the region,” said the CAQM in its order on Monday, underlining that entry of trucks into Delhi was being allowed with immediate effect. “Construction and demolition activities will also now be permitted, with immediate effect, subject to persons and agencies undertaking C&D activities strictly complying with directions and orders for dust control norms issued by the commission from time to time as well as those under the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and various CPCB guidelines in this regard,” said the order. The commission, however, clarified that all units and sites shut down by it or by state governments for violating the norms will not be allowed to reopen under this order. It said each project proponent will be required to approach the commission individually for a review.The commission first banned construction and demolition activities across NCR on November 16, 2021. This order, which exempted activities notified as “essential, was effective till November 21. The prohibition on construction activities in NCR was, however, re-imposed on November 24, and only non-polluting activities such as interior work, plumbing and electrical activities were allowed to continue. The states concerned were told to pay notified minimum wages to workers.CAQM extended the ban on December 17 but with relaxations to construction activities for hospitals, nursing homes and healthcare facilities; linear public projects such as highways, roads and flyover and sanitation and public utility projects such as sewage treatment plants and water pumping stations.The ban on entry of trucks into Delhi has been in place since the November 16 and was extended multiple times over the last one month. CAQM has already lifted the ban on physical classes at schools, colleges and educational institutes in NCR, along with restrictions on six out of 11 thermal power plants operating within a 300-km radius of Delhi. While the restrictions on thermal power plants were lifted on December 12, the restriction on schools and colleges was lifted five days later on December 17.The Air Quality Index (AQI) across NCR was hovering between the higher end of the ‘poor’ and the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on Monday. While Delhi’s AQI was recorded as 332 (very poor) at 12 noon, Faridabad, Gurugram, Greater Noida were in the ‘poor’ category with readings below 300. Ghaziabad and Noida, like Delhi, were in the ‘very poor’ category with readings of 328 and 308 respectively.An AQI between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor and over 400 is ‘severe’ as per CPCB’s index.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, says good wind speed has played a key role in improving air quality across the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. “If the air is good, we can allow developmental activities to resume and ensure our economy keeps functioning. Trends indicate air quality will not deteriorate too much in the coming days either as a western disturbance will again impact the region,” said Saha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-air-quality-improves-caqm-lifts-construction-ban-in-delhincrdelhi-101639989746473.html

20-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Two lives||She sits down on the pavement, as people pass to and fro, here in Gurugram’s Sadar Bazar. Ms Kashmiro has a large bundle of raw papads with her. She starts to roast them one by one on her small stove with her bare hands. Her face shows no expressions. Her movements are slow. With a pink shawl draped about her blue sari, she seems too advanced in years to be working on such a busy street, while being saddled with so many belongings to handle at the same time.“I work because I am alone.” Ms Kashmiro says in a mournful tone, explaining that her husband died when he was very young. So did her two sons. “One chhora died 16 years ago, the other chhora died 12 years ago.”A scooter is parked adjacent to her. Its owner prepares to start the vehicle. Ms Kashmiro asks him, in Punjabi, to not accidentally bump the scooter into her stove. Within moments, the vacant place left by the scooter is taken over by a middle-aged man. He uninhibitedly, but politely, listens to the conversation, looking eager to wade into it at the earliest opportunity.“I have been selling papad in this bazar for many years,” Ms Kashmiro says. The man remarks that he had, however, never seen her before. “I usually stay in the other side of the market,” she replies. Ms Kashmiro gives more details of her life. She lives in a rented room in Rajindra Park, and there are times when she isn’t able to earn enough money to pay the month’s rent. “But then good people, who think well of me, come to my aid.” Responding to a query, she says she must be 60. The man looks surprised, telling her that she looks older than that. Ms Kashmiro says matter-of-factly: “That is because I have lived with grief for so long.”The man nods as if he understands what Ms Kashmiro is trying to convey. He says, “Who isn’t sad… I’m also in grief.” Introducing himself as Harish Chander, he says he had been working for many years in a Sadar Bazar shop but lost his job following the coronavirus pandemic. “The buisness had gone down…. so… I’m now khaali (idle).” After a prolonged pause, he adds, “My wife died in May this year… she was tested positive for corona.” Ms Kashmiro nods her head, murmuring, “Hum sab dukhi hain (we all are sad).” She continues to roast the papads. The man walks away after sometime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-two-lives-101639958097362.html

The complainant, Rajwinder Kaur of Payal of Ludhiana, had said that she had cleared the IELTS exam, which is a prerequisite for settling abroad, and had approached the consultancy for securing a visa. The immigration consultancy had assured her that a visa would be arranged within six to eight months and she had paid ₹6,59,950 for the same. However, the company was unable to secure a visa for her despite submitting all requisite documents, and also failed to inform her about the same. Citing deficiency of service on part of the immigration consultancy, Kaur sought complete refund of the amount she had paid along with ₹2 lakh compensation and ₹22,000 as litigation expense.However, the consultancy firm’s counsel said the complainant had paid ₹5,67,500 for express-entry employment facilitation in Canada, of which ₹5 lakh had already been returned to her. “The complainant had paid an additional ₹2,10,000 to the respondent, of which ₹29,399 had been given to the state exchequer as service tax, which is non-refundable. There has been no deficiency of service or negligence,” said the counsel, adding that their client had immediately started working on the immigration case. “The respondent assessed the complainants’ documents as per the national occupation classification and uploaded the complainant’s documents on Job Bank Canada for arranging a job offer. However, the complainant had failed to receive a job offer so far as the employers were yet to go through a resume, “ the counsel added.The commission, in its order, observed that it could not be disputed that the complainant had provided all the documentation, and the arrangement with a company in Dubai for a job offer had been made through the consultancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-consumer-forum-directs-immigration-agency-to-refund-1-5-lakh-for-not-securing-visa-101639955904682.html

Increasing enrolment, without hiring more teachers is not a smart move.” Upgrade need of the hour: DEOMeanwhile, district education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra said, “The upgrade was the need of the hour as enrolment in government schools has increased during the ongoing session. Government schools have become smart schools and the schools in the district are providing quality education.”Government school principal Davinder Singh Chhina says since the education system is getting streamlined and digitised, government schools have become the first choice for parents. “A large number of students migrated from private schools to the government schools, not just because of a lack of financial resources, but also because they knew that government schools are providing quality education,” Chhina said.

20-12-2021||Chandigarh||97% of vaccinated patients in Chandigarh not requiring hospitalisation||As many as 97% of the Covid patients, who have got first or both doses of vaccine, are not requiring hospitalisation in Chandigarh, the UT health department said on Sunday.“Of the 100 people getting infected with the virus these days, over 99% are vaccinated against the virus, at least with the first dose. This is because Chandigarh has already vaccinated all of its eligible population with the first dose and 82% with both doses. Though vaccinated people can also get infected, the vaccine is certainly helping in controlling the severity of infection,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.Dr Singh added, “Of the total vaccinated patients, over 97% are getting mild or no symptoms. Therefore, they are able to recover at home. Only those who have co-morbidities, like diabetes and hypertension, are requiring hospital care despite getting vaccinated.” As per the UT health department, the vaccination drive has also significantly helped in controlling the fatality rate.“In the past two-and-a-half months, the health department recorded only two fatalities owing to the virus. Hence, while severity of infection and hospitalisation has decreased, fatality rate is also in control,” Dr Singh said.It was only on October 5 when Chandigarh had last reported a Covid-related death, until a 35-year-old woman from Bapu Dham Colony died due to the virus on December 18. The woman was admitted for bilateral pneumonitis at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, where she breathed her last.As per the health department, the woman was not vaccinated.“Even if we have administered the first dose of vaccine to 114% of our targeted population, there are some people, including migrants, who have not yet taken any dose of vaccine. We are conducting a door-to-door vaccination drive for locating such people and vaccinating them,” Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/97-of-vaccinated-patients-in-chandigarh-not-requiring-hospitalisation-101639949616404.html

For the AAP, Sangrur member of Parliament and Punjab president Bhagwant Mann will be in Chandigarh for the next two days, campaigning for the party. Even Congress has stationed its national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala in the city for the past two days to hold public meetings for its candidates. Congress’ national spokesperson Alka Lamba also campaigned for the party on Sunday. In the next couple of days, the party is also likely to put in the field its leader Kanhaiya Kumar. For the BJP, its Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari will once again be in the city. Both will be focusing on the crucial Purvanchal votes, which are estimated to be more than 1 lakh strong.“Leaders from other states have been called in the city mainly for two purposes. The primary aim is to bolster the confidence of the people on the ground, who are in direct contact with the voters. Also, with more than 2.5 lakh voters from Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, leaders and workers from other states are being pressed into action,” said a senior BJP leader.One-on-one contactIn the next two-days, the emphasis will shift heavily to door-to-door campaigning.The ruling BJP, looking to retain power in MC, has called up MLAs, mayors and senior functionaries from HP, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and even Bihar. While MLA-level functionaries are supervising the party’s districts, other functionaries have been posted till up to the booth level. “Though given a diverse set of duties, the functionaries’ focus is on one-on-one contact with the voters of their states. They are visiting people’s houses, sitting with them, sharing the party’s achievements here and in their native states,” said Arun Sood, BJP state president.The Congress has also called up its reserves from other states, including HP, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.“More than 60 senior HP leaders and workers are in the city. They are not only pushing for the Himachali natives’ votes, but are also contributing to the party’s overall campaign in different capacities,” said Rajinder Rana, Chandigarh Congress campaign coordinator and MLA, Sujanpur, HP. From Punjab, reinforcements have arrived mainly from the neighbouring assembly constituencies – Mohali, Kharar and Dera Bassi. They have been deputed with each candidate to strengthen their campaign.AAP leaders, on the other hand, insist that the party is depending only on local party workers for campaigning. “MLAs from Delhi are camping here primarily for coordination. There are eight MLAs, who are managing five wards each, and one is based at the party’s city headquarters. They are also providing any assistance required by candidates at the ground level,” said Chandermukhi Sharma, chairman, AAP election campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-political-parties-rush-leaders-from-other-states-to-bolster-campaigns-101639949612396.html

The AAP supremo was addressing a public rally at the Dussehra ground in Sector 43 on Sunday: “In 25 years of Chandigarh MC history, you have given 13 years to the BJP and 12 years to the Congress. Inhone shehar ka bedagarg kar diya (they ruined the city). Humein bhi 5 saal deke dekho (give us a chance as well),” said Kejriwal. “I don’t know politics, I only know how to work and deliver. Ask your friends and family members in Delhi how much work we have done,” he said. Kejriwal was accompanied by Sangrur MP and AAP’s Punjab president Bhagwant Mann, senior Chandigarh leadership and all 35 party candidates on the stage. The MC elections are scheduled for December 24. The AAP is contesting the Chandigarh civic polls for the first time and has fielded candidates on all 35 seats. Reiterating the party’s five promises in its manifesto for Chandigarh MC elections, Kejriwal said, “AAP will end corruption in MC. We will bring MC to the doorsteps of city residents. All the money currently going to the pockets of the Congress and BJP councillors will be spent on the city’s development.”He assured that the Dadumajra garbage dump will be cleared and the city will be made cleanest in Asia. “In Delhi people get zero water bills, which will be ensured in Chandigarh as well,” he promised. On women security, Kejriwal said the party will install CCTV cameras and street lights at all internal roads of the city. “For long, development and proper maintenance has eluded group housing societies. The MC under AAP will take over these functions,” said Kejriwal. Attacking the BJP, he said, “They have a government at Centre, they are ruling in MC and the administration is also under them. But they have still failed to get any work done. Humein inse kaam karwana aata hai, hum yaha bhi karke dikhayenge (we know how to get the work done, we will show that here as well).” BJP is ‘Bharatiya Jumla Party’: MannAddressing the gathering, Bhagwant Mann said the BJP’s real name was “Bharatiya Jumla Party”. “The broom button is the button of your luck.

After increasing the property tax and parking fees, the municipal corporation has robbed residents by increasing water bill rates.” Kejriwal gained false popularity with money: KherTaking a jibe at Kejriwal after his rally in Chandigarh, Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher on Sunday night tweeted, “Kejriwal, who has gained false accolades and popularity on the basis of money, the enlightened people of Chandigarh will not catch your free election rattles. Vote will be given only on development and not on illogical nonsense. Kahe Chandigarh Dil Se, BJP Phir Se.” In the same tweet she also shared a video with the title, “For getting false popularity, Kejriwal is bringing crowd from Punjab by giving them money…You can gather crowd by giving some money, but people will give vote to development only.” The video showed trucks and buses carrying AAP supporters. Earlier, former BJP Chandigarh president Sanjay Tandon, said, “AAP has failed in Delhi and is now seeking five years in Chandigarh to ruin it too.

GMADA had also transferred 105 parks of these new sectors to the civic body over the past year. Besides in August, the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) had handed over the maintenance and upkeep of the Industrial Area Phases 8-A and 8-B to MC.GMADA also contributes 25% of the total amount spent by the civic body on development works in the city.Apart from this, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) also cleared ₹10 crore it owed MC in form of excise duty deducted from electricity bills.“Former mayor Kulwant Singh had made MC financially weak. Now it is cash-rich after our efforts to get maximum maintenance works from GMADA and recover dues from various agencies,” said city mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu.MC set to increase its boundaryMC is also going it increase its boundary for which the Punjab local bodies department has already sought objections from people.In June this year, MC had passed a resolution to this effect, following which the local bodies department had sought objections and suggestions from people on December 13.

As per the IMD, a cold wave is declared in the plains when the minimum temperature goes below 4°C. It is also declared when the minimum temperature is 10°C or below and also 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. “While the city witnessed dense fog over the past few days, the sky was clear in the early hours of Sunday. Fog acts like a blanket, keeping the minimum temperature from dropping too low. In its absence, night got chillier between Saturday and Sunday. Similar conditions are expected on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday as well,” said an IMD official.However, the official added, as two western disturbances were likely to affect the city one after the other in the coming days, the temperature will rise.Meanwhile, the clear skies helped the maximum temperature increase from 15°C on Saturday to 18.7°C on Sunday, but it was still 2.4 degrees below normal. Over the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 17°C and 19°C, while the minimum temperature will hover between 3°C and 6°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cold-wave-at-3-2-c-chandigarh-records-season-s-coldest-night-101639949604381.html
20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Vijay Hazare trophy: 2 Chandigarh based cricketers playing for other teams have fine run||While the UT Cricket Association senior men’s team lost all five matches, two Chandigarh-based cricketers playing for other state teams had a fine run in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Left-arm spinner Rahul Singh, through his bowling form along with superlative batting performances, helped Services qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament after nine years. With figures of 3-33 against Rajasthan in the last league game, he set up a win for his team and helped them enter the quarter-finals.The 28-year-old spinner, who had played for Himachal Pradesh in the past, is in his fifth season for Services and grabbed the highest eight wickets in the five matches for his team. “The off-season training and preparatory camps helped get me into rhythm. In T20 matches, there are bowling limitations for a spinner, but in one day and day’s cricket, a spinner can try variations. I want to continue playing well and help my team win the quarter-final tie as well,” said Rahul, who has featured in 28 matches, picking up 33 wickets at an impressive economy of 4.07. The Vijay Hazare Trophy 2021 was a breakout season for him, as he was first in the chart for the lowest economy of any bowler midway through the tournament.Rahul eventually finished sixth in the season, when it came to the lowest economy. He finished 11th on the list of best averages.Services topped Group E with four wins from five matches and will take on Kerala in the quarter-final tie in Jaipur on December 22.Meanwhile, Uday Kaul who shifted to Mizoram from UTCA this season, scored 326 runs in five matches including two centuries. With 102 first-class matches and 74 List A games under his belt, he used his experience well for the Mizoram team. He played for two seasons for UTCA before shifting to Mizoram for better opportunities. Even though his team did not qualify for the knockout stage, but 34-year-old Uday made most of the chance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vijayhazare-trophy-2-chandigarh-based-cricketers-playing-for-other-teams-have-fine-run-101639949065597.html

Reconstruction of several roads, cleaning and painting of dividers and markings are still underway at several intersections between Ambala and Panipat. The road conditions worsened after torrential rainfall earlier in the year, which led to small portions of roads caving in.Authorities had put up spring posts and crash barricades, which were placed on the highway during the monsoon season in August after reports of the damage, which are still intact.The temporary blockades, however, divert vehicles coming from a lane on either end to its accompanying two on the six-lane highway, heightening the risk of accidents.Speaking of the measures undertaken, Virender Singh, project director of the NHAI, Ambala zone, said, “Maintenance work was undertaken at over 100 spots on the highway intersection to avert accidents,” “In the interest of the commuters, we began filling such carved portions after the monsoon ended. Now, for a long-lasting solution, we will start repair and reconstruction of the whole lane. Design has been finalized and I expect at least 15% of work will be done in this financial year,” he added.On being asked about the threat to speeding commuters due to diversion from on the lanes, he said the authorities had taken utmost care while placing these barricades. “These are made of fibre or plastic and will cause the least damage to a commuter. Our motive is to save human lives that is why the diversions will remain for at least the next six months or so,” the project director said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nh44-fog-incomplete-maintenance-work-contribute-to-commuters-woes-101639948713562.html

Jain was speaking at a meeting with traders, businessmen and shopkeepers of Mohali and Kharar on Saturday evening.He said during his visit to Punjab, after meeting various businessmen and traders, he realised that they were afraid to start new projects because of corrupt politicians, who forcibly demanded shares in their businesses. Jain assured the businessmen that no AAP MLA will ever ask for anything from them, and instead businessmen and traders of Punjab will be provided better environment and opportunities to start and run their businesses. “This way, they’ll also assist the government in increasing employment in Punjab,” he added. Answering a query, Jain said the AAP government will provide basic facilities to everyone, irrespective of their financial status: “We have announced guarantees for the two most important things for everyone – better health and education. We will extend the benefits to all – poor, rich, middle-class, shopkeepers and traders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-minister-satyendar-jain-assures-better-environment-for-traders-in-punjab-101639948464163.html
20-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU study: MOFs efficient nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery||A research carried out at Panjab University (PU) has revealed that the metal-organic frameworks (MOF) class of materials are efficient nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in the human body.Nanocarriers are nanoparticles that carry medicinal drugs to targeted sites in the body while minimising damage to the surrounding tissue. The study has been conducted by professor Dr Sanjeev Gautam and a master’s student, Juhi Singhal, at Dr SS Bhatnagar University Institute of Chemical Engineering and Technology (UICET). It has been recently published in an international journal, “Materials Today Chemistry” (2020 impact factor =8.301).Magnetic target drug delivery acts as an efficient method for carrying a drug directly to an organ or targeted location in the body by incorporating magnetically vulnerable material coated with a drug-laden matrix. Magnetic nanoparticles of MOF act as a drug carrier by targeting the treatment location without affecting the other healthy cells. MOFs, also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are an emerging class of microporous materials consisting of metal clusters linked by polyfunctional organic linkers yielding three-dimensional porous networks.In this study, a metal-organic framework developed by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has been used as a nanocarrier for drug delivery. The adsorption of the drug and releasing mechanism development are the major part of this research, including the electronic structure investigation of the drug delivery mechanism using synchrotron radiation research.The drug delivery application was carried out for HKUST-1 samples to check its versatility in daily use. Paracetamol was chosen as a model drug for the delivery. Further, solutions of concentrations up to 100 ppm were prepared by dissolving paracetamol in distilled water and were then calibrated at different concentration (ppm) levels. The drug delivery experiment was optimised using HKUST1 samples (synthesised for 10 and 48 hours) and calibrated 3.5 ppm of paracetamol (drug) solution by executing a comparative study.Sanjeev Gautam said, “The targeted drug delivery is a future technology for medicine delivery to specific cells without affecting the healthy cells. We found that the MOFs are efficient for this purpose and can be easily synthesised as compared to other nanostructured materials used as drug delivery vehicles presently.”He said that he has planned a future research project in this area and is collaborating with professors Rajat Sandhir (biochemistry) and Navdeep Goyal (physics) along with experts from PGIMER in his subsequent research in this area.

The strike and the administration’s intransigence have put thousands of J&K residents to extreme hardships amid bone-chilling temperatures and Covid-19 pandemic as hundreds of patients are struggling to keep on to their oxygen concentrators.Divisional commissioner, Jammu, Raghav Langer has written to the department of military affairs, ministry of defence, requesting for the assistance of the army in the restoration of the essential services.“It is to bring to your kind notice that due to strike by electricity department personnel in the union territory of J&K, essential services have been severely affected in the Jammu region. We would like to hereby requisition the Indian army to assist in the restoration of the said essential services by provisioning manpower to man critical electricity stations and water supply sources,” the communication by Langer to the army said.The divisional commissioner, Jammu, earlier during the day held a meeting with the representatives of the employees which failed to make any major headway.The government requested the employee leaders to call off the strike after the meeting.“The Government of J&K, taking a sympathetic view of the issues raised, has engaged in several rounds of talks with Coordination Committee of the Power Employees. The government has already agreed on two of their major demands -putting on hold the proposal for formation of the joint venture and ensuring delay in salary is immediately resolved,” said the official twitter handle of department of information and public relations, Government of Jammu & Kashmir.It said during each round of talks, the government representatives have appealed to the power employees to call off their strike as people in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions are suffering. “In the wake of Covid contagion and nail-biting cold in both the divisions, the Coordination Committee of the Power Employees is requested to end its strike,” it said.All J&K Power Employees and Engineers Coordination Committee (JKPECC) leader Majid Munshi’s phone was switched off. Another leader of the committee, Sachin Tickoo told the media that they were opposing the systematic transfer of assets. “They are selling the assets of the transmission sector. They want to give 50% shareholding to the power grid which is against the interests of Jammu and Kashmir,” he told a news channel.The strike has plunged large swathes of the union territory into darkness amid the chilling temperatures as the employees refuse to rectify any faults.Political parties have criticised the J&K administration for its “incompetence” and inconvenience people have been facing.Peoples Conference general secretary Imran Reza Ansari said: “The strike of power sector employees has exposed the incompetence and callousness of current administration. On one hand livelihood of thousands of power sector employees is at stake, on the hand the survival of millions of citizens of J&K.”“The army has been called to operate the power infrastructure in the Jammu division of J&K. There is no bigger admission of failure for a civilian administration than to call upon the army. It means a total breakdown of governance has been accepted by the J&K government,” said Omar Abdullah, J&K former chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-crisis-in-jammu-and-kashmir-army-s-help-sought-101639946304102.html

The FPO will be registered with an initial membership of 192 farmers and steps will be taken to enhance the membership in coming months,” said a senior officer.Asad said the FPO is an institutional mechanism to reduce the cost of production, increase per unit production and facilitate better market linkage so as to enhance the income of farmers. “We will provide an end-to-end solution to the problems confronted by the farmers. They will be free to manage their affairs from the production level to post-harvest and marketing of their branded products,” he said.Chief agriculture officer, Srinagar, Chowdhary Mohammad Younis said there was a huge export potential of vegetables from the Srinagar district which can be further enhanced through FPO promotion. “For the first time vegetables have been exported from Kashmir to Sharjah (UAE) through Lulu Group in which Srinagar district contributes more than 90% of the export produce,” he said.Officials said the FPO can become eligible to get equity grant support to the tune of ₹15 lakh per FPO and can avail of collateral-free credit guarantee support up to ₹2 crore from banks and other financial institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-emerges-as-vegetable-basket-begins-export-to-uae-101639946244299.html

20-12-2021||Chandigarh||In 5 years, Himachal incurred ₹320.18-crore cumulative losses: CAG report||Himachal Pradesh is incurring huge losses every year due to the difference between interest on government borrowings and returns from investments, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has revealed.The report was tabled in the Himachal Pradesh assembly last week on the concluding day of the winter session.As per the report, in five years from 2015-16 to 2019-20, the state has incurred cumulative losses of ₹320.18 crore.The government as of March 31, 2020, had invested ₹4,261.06 crore in statutory corporations, rural banks, joint-stock companies and cooperatives.Out of the total investment of ₹4,261.06 crore, investment of ₹3,809.76 crore (89%) was in five companies — ₹1,098.14 crore in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVNL); ₹263.50 crore in Himachal Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (HPPTCL); ₹862.64 crore in Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (HPPCL); ₹743.87 crore in Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Ltd (HPBSE) and ₹841.60 crore in Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC).“The state government keeps on making investments in loss-making government companies,” the report states.The average return on these investments was 6.05% in the last five years while the government paid an average interest rate of 7.63% on its borrowings during the given period.The year 2016-17 was the only time when the government got more returns (8.79%) than the interest paid on borrowings (7.60%).The report further states that seven government companies with an aggregate investment of ₹2,128.87 crore were incurring losses and their accumulated losses amounted to ₹1,919.41 crore.Out of seven losses-incurring government companies, losses of ₹1651.29 crore in three companies –Himachal Pradesh Financial Corporation (HPFC), HRTC and Himachal Pradesh State Forest Development Corporation Limited (HPSFDC) constituted 86% of the total losses of government companies.Out of total investment of ₹412.23 crore made during 2019-20, the state government invested ₹298.14 crore in three loss-incurring companies.“The state government may consider reviewing the working of state PSUs which are incurring huge losses, formulate a strategic plan for their revival or closure,” the report suggests.Erosion of net worthNet worth means the sum total of the paid-up capital, free reserves and surplus reduced by accumulated losses and deferred revenue expenditure. Essentially, it is a measure of what an entity is worth to the owners. A negative net worth indicates that the entire investment of the owners has been eroded due to accumulated losses.As on March 31, 2020, the overall accumulated losses of the seven loss-incurring companies were ₹1,919.41 crore as against the capital investment of ₹2,128.87 crore resulting in erosion of net worth of the investments to ₹209.46 crore, says the report.Out of this, in two loss-incurring DISCOMs, the overall accumulated losses were ₹169.06 crore as against the capital investment of ₹1,134.13 crore, thus the erosion of net worth to ₹965.07 crore, it added.

Sukhbir, who held rallies in Talwandi Sabo and Mansa in support of the party nominees on Sunday, urged the Union and Punjab governments to show a sense of urgency to identify and punish those behind the alleged conspiracy. He charged the Congress-led Punjab government with its failure in cracking previous incidents of desecration of holy scriptures. “The Union & state government must demonstrate sincerity and a sense of urgency in their actions to identify, expose and punish those behind the most painful acts of sacrilege against Sikh Panth. There is more politics on their minds than the pursuit of real culprits (sic),” said Sukhbir in a tweet. In another tweet, Sukhbir wrote: “Those committing these nefarious deeds were emboldened and went scot-free as Congress govt in Punjab wasted nearly 5 yrs in playing dirty politics. The guilty of these acts at Sri Harmandar Sahib & Kapurthala would have escaped if SGPC and the devotees were not vigilant (sic).” Meanwhile, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in a statement termed the Harmandar Sahib sacrilege as “deeply shocking and painful”. He said that it was unbelievable that such a painful and brazen crime could be committed at the holiest shrine of by an individual. Seeking a probe into the matter, Badal said those behind this should be given exemplary punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/show-urgency-in-punishing-those-behind-sacrilege-sukhbir-to-punjab-govt-101639946004130.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||In a first, DPCC to study microplastics pollution in River Yamuna||In a first-of-its-kind survey by a government body in the national capital, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) will conduct a study to ascertain the concentration, distribution and composition of microplastics in River Yamuna, besides soil, vegetables and other edible products. The pollution control body will also examine if the soil in the floodplains of River Yamuna is fit for agriculture, according to officials.Microplastics are fragments of any type of plastic less than five millimetres, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Chemicals Agency. They enter natural ecosystems from a variety of sources, including cosmetics, clothing, and industrial processes.Studies conducted earlier have shown that microplastics carry bacteria that are pathogenic to human and natural biota, and can enrich antibiotic resistant genes from municipal activated sludge. The polymeric compounds and additives such as copper ions used in the production of plastics are toxic. Also, microplastics absorb various toxins in water that subsequently desorb inside the host organism. The Yamuna floodplains, stretching 48 kilometres from Palla to Okhla, will be divided into three stretches of 16 km each for the study: Delhi Segment I (Palla to Wazirabad), Delhi Segment II (Wazirabad to Nizamuddin Bridge) and Delhi Segment III (Nizamuddin Bridge to Okhla), according to the terms of reference prepared by the DPCC.A DPCC official said the idea to study the presence of microplastics in River Yamuna and the national capital originated after an MP asked a question in Parliament about microplastics in River Ganga."It is sad that we have not conducted any such study in the national capital," the official said, citing a report by environment research and advocacy organisation, Toxics Link. The Toxics Link study on River Ganga threw up alarming results as "microplastics were found in all the samples". "Locations with higher population density and greater industrialisation (textile, tannery, etc.) had a higher microplastics concentration in the river," the report says."Compared to the concentration of microplastics in rivers such as the Rhine in Europe, the Patapsco, Magothy, Rhode in North America, the Elqui, Maipo, Biobio, and Maule in South America, the pollution is much higher in the Ganga," according to a report by Dr Mahua Saha, a senior scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, and his team. As river water is used for drinking and irrigation purposes quite extensively, an increased concentration of microplastics increases the potential harm it can cause to organisms and humans.As part of another study, the DPCC will examine the soil of the Yamuna for various contaminants and its fitness for agriculture and remediation possibilities."River Yamuna is one of the most important rivers of India and is highly polluted.The river water and the adjacent soil are contaminated with various pollutants, including heavy metals. In this study, the effects of seasonal variations and heavy metal contamination in Yamuna water on physicochemical  properties and enzyme activities of soil will be observed," the terms of reference read. Sampling will be collected from 10 points along the river course in summer, monsoon and winter.

20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Dominant clan announces social boycott of another over a marriage in Haryana’s Jind||In a dictat, the members of the dominant Chahal clan (a Jat sub-caste) in Jind’s Kamach Khera village allegedly announced social boycott of the Khokhar clan (another Jat clan) after a youth belonging to the latter clan married a girl whose grandmother hails from Chahal clan from the neighbouring Deverar village.In his complaint to the Julana police, Sunil Kumar said his younger brother Raveen alias Chotu, of Kamach Khera village, married Ritu, of Nandal village, on December 17.“Few influential people of our village, belonging to the Chahal clan, have announced a social boycott of our clan by accusing us of breaking social harmony and brotherhood. They claimed that Ritu’s grandmother belonged to their clan and hailed from the neighbouring Deverar village, another Chahal clan dominated village,” he said.“The Chahal clan said Ritu’s grandmother hailed from their clan which means she is their granddaughter and they will oppose this marriage. Later, Deverar villagers associated with the Chahal clan also joined them by supporting their diktat,” the complainant added.He alleged that their family has grown carrots on five acre rented land, which was also taken back by the owner.“The owner said he will not allow us to take care of the crop. The influential people have announced to ban our ‘hookah-paani’,” the complainant said.A group of people from the Khokhar clan went to meet Jind deputy commissioner on Saturday to hand over their complaint and in the DC’s absence, they submitted the same to SDM Ved Parkash.Pardeep Kumar, former sarpanch of Kamach Khera village, said he got to know that the Chahal clan has announced a social boycott after their son’s marriage but he was not present in the panchayat.Jind SDM Ved Parkash said he has received a complaint and they are investigating the issue.“Such orders are not permitted in a civilised society and action will be initiated against those who announced the social boycott,” the SDM added.Slamming the move, sociologist and retired Rohtak MDU professor Neerja Ahalwat said girls are doing well in Haryana and yet some people are against their choice to marry.“Traditionally, we used to avoid gotras of mother, father, grandmother and maternal grandmother. But nowadays, we are leaving only father and mother’s clans in fixing marriages. In this case, the couple had solemnised their love marriage by following gotras,” she said.“If some people have a problem with this, they should distance themselves from the family but a social ban is unacceptable. Such people still believe in patriarchy. Haryana’s influential khaps and other society leaders are also mum on this issue. If a girl can choose her career, why cannot she choose her life partner?” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dominant-clan-announces-social-boycott-of-another-over-a-marriage-in-haryana-s-jind-101639943003979.html
20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu ‘political mercenary’, divided Punjab Congress: Rana Gurjeet||A fresh rift has broken out in the Punjab Congress with cabinet minister Rana Gurjeet Singh on Sunday lashing out at the state unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu for trying to create divisions within the party and questioning the loyalty of true and traditional Congressmen. Calling the state unit chief a “political mercenary” bereft of any principles or ideology, Rana said that Sidhu had joined the party with the sole purpose of becoming the chief minister. “It is an irony that someone who is basically a political party hopper and has not even spent five years in the party, is preaching and pontificating to people like us who have spent an entire lifetime in the service of the party,” the cabinet minister said in a stinging response to Sidhu’s remarks against him. The cabinet minister’s full-blown attack on the PPCC chief came a day after the latter at a public meeting in Sultanpur Lodhi had said that it was the end of the road for Rana. Sidhu also backed Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Cheema with whom the minister has been having a continuous rift. Cheema was among the MLAs who had opposed Rana’s return to the state cabinet three months ago. Taking a dig at Sidhu’s flip-flops, Rana claimed that keeping in mind Sidhu’s unstable and eccentric behaviour, nobody was sure whether he would stay in the Congress till the Vidhan Sabha elections or run off from the battle of ballot well before. “But sooner you leave, better it will be for the party as you have divided and damaged the party from within as if you were pursuing some hidden agenda of your ‘real’ political masters who are still pulling your strings,” Rana said. The cabinet minister also questioned the intentions of Sidhu in opposing his own government and the chief minister, saying that he had now been exposed. “You have been openly criticising our chief minister as you have started feeling jealous and insecure about his popularity among the masses,” Rana said, warning Sidhu against weakening the party by trying to create divisions and fissures. “As party president, your key responsibility is to keep the party united, but you did not leave any stone unturned to create fissures in the campaign committee, manifesto committee, and screening committee constituted by the party high command,” he added. He also asked the PPCC chief to mind his language while talking about a true Congressman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-political-mercenary-divided-punjab-congress-rana-gurjeet-101639942943999.html
20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Setting an example: Two Haryana brides cancel wedding after dowry demands||In Haryana, at least two marriages were called-off in the recent weeks after the grooms allegedly demanded luxury cars ahead of the wedding.The first case was reported from Mahendergarh district, where a sub-inspector of the Border security force (BSF) demanded either a Creta or a Harrier car from the bride’s family.The bride and her brother recorded the phone call in which the sub-inspector purportedly complained about the furniture given by her family in lagan (days ahead of the wedding).The groom allegedly scolded the bride over the phone stating that he receives a monthly salary of ₹70,000 and despite that “the quality of bed, sofa set and furniture given by the family is poor”.“Your father has given ₹1 in dowry. I had asked for either a Creta or a Harrier car. I don’t need any small car,” he added.Later, the girl’s family and locals held a panchayat and decided to cancel the wedding, which was scheduled to be solemnised on November 22.On the girl’s complaint, the groom, his father and mother were arrested by the Mahendergarh police for seeking dowry and later released on bail.In the second incident, the Karnal police on December 7, booked a groom, his father and uncle for allegedly demanding ₹20 lakh cash and a Fortuner during a marriage on December 6.In her complaint, the bride, who is a legal advisor with the Haryana government’s education department in Panchkula, had alleged that the groom, of Jind, who is a scientist and employed in the Union government, allegedly demanded an SUV and ₹20 lakh cash when the wedding ceremony was going on.After high drama, the marriage was not solemnised and both parties filed complaints against each other at Karnal’s Civil lines police station.Karnal city DSP Abhilaksh Joshi said the groom and the bride had approached the police and signed a compromise deed.“We are investigating the case thoroughly and will see how both the parties react,” he added.Haryana women commission’s officiating chairperson Preeti Bhardwaj Dalal said they have taken suo moto in both the cases and she is personally monitoring the probe.“Police probe is on and we are yet to receive a report. It is encouraging that girls are fighting against dowry. The state government has already asked government employees to file in writing about their marriage and dowry-related details,” Dalal said.“In the Karnal case, I had visited the girl’s family. The groom has apologised to the bride and her family. He has also urged people not to take dowry,” she added.Meham Chaubisi president Tulsi Grewal said the khaps are organising seminars asking people not to give or accept dowry.“After witnessing the recent cases of dowry in which girls have showed exemplary courage, we have decided to educate our elders and the daughters on the issue. Police should take strict action against those demanding dowry,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/setting-an-example-two-haryana-brides-cancel-wedding-after-dowry-demands-101639942704026.html

20-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC’s 48 inspection teams to conduct surprise checks for Covid-19 appropriate behaviour||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to form a total of 48 inspection teams - two teams in each of the 24 administrative wards in the city, to conduct surprise inspections at marriage halls, malls, multiplexes and restaurants, and ensure that citizens and establishments are following covid-19 appropriate behaviour. This comes owing to the rise in the number of Omicron cases in the city, and after the civic body on Saturday urged Mumbaiites to avoid gathering or organising parties for Christmas or New Year’s Eve.These surprise inspections will take place only at public commercial places, and not for private gatherings or parties, the civic body said on Sunday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department said, “At the ward level, the civic body will contact marriage halls, commercial open spaces, and take down a list of dates from that are booked for private gatherings. Wards have been instructed to conduct these surprise inspections and check if everyone is adhering to covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Restaurants will be the last places we will check, even though they will not be ignored, as citizens visit restaurants to eat, so their masks are going to be off. However, we will check if they are operating at the allowed capacity during our inspections”Owing to increasing Omicron cases, BMC on Saturday appealed to citizens to avoid gathering or organising parties for Christmas or new year celebrations. The BMC in a statement appealed to citizens to follow the existing rule of 50% capacity in marriage halls and 25% capacity in the open lawn. However, in case of more than 1,000 guests, permission will have to be taken from local district administration, said the BMC. Currently, restaurants, bars and nightclubs are allowed to remain open till 12.30 am at 50% capacity.Action to be taken against those flouting covid-19 guidelines will be based on the magnitude of the violation, Kakani said. If quests are found to be without masks, then they will be fined ₹200 each for not wearing masks. If the organisers have not ensured social distancing, a warning will be given to the organisers. However, the organisers of events will also be booked by the BMC in case the situation is very serious, Kakani said. “If we find that the premises are operating at full capacity and not adhering to our guidelines, punitive action will be taken against the organisers.”According to BMC officials, the state government has empowered the BMC to levy a ₹10,000 fine on individuals or establishments for violating norms.Mumbai on Sunday reported four more Covid-19 cases infected with the Omicron variant, taking the total number of Omicron tally of patients in the city to 22. However, the four Omicron patients reported on Sunday were detected during screening at the Mumbai international airport. Out of the 22 cases in Mumbai detected with the Omicron variant, two are from Karnataka, and one each from Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Jalgaon, and Aurangabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmcs-48-inspection-teams-to-conduct-surprise-checks-for-covid-19-appropriate-behaviour-101639939883109.html
20-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans smart traffic signals at 70 junctions across 12 roads||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will conduct a detailed survey of 70 traffic junctions in the city to upgrade conventional traffic signals to an intelligent traffic signal system.A total 12 roads have been selected for this project across which 70 traffic junctions have been identified by the civic body. Some of the prominent roads include B A road, Senapati Bapat road, Belassis road, R A Kidwai road, Sir J J road, P D’mello road and Shahid Bhagat Singh road.A topographical study of the junctions will be carried out, including road width, traffic signal poles, footpaths, trees, pedestrian crossings, chamber ducts and utility crossings; building boundaries and entrances; traffic count, pedestrian count, impact on journey time, parking areas nearby and vending areas nearby. Based on the data collected and the outcomes, a feasibility study for the intelligent traffic system will be carried out. The BMC will appoint a consultant for the project, who will be required to monitor the air quality of the area as well.The study is expected to help the BMC identify existing problems with traffic management at each of these junctions and draw up a resolution for these problems. The data will be used to prepare an adaptive real-time system, with construction designs for footpaths, road width, street lights, manholes, traffic management and pedestrian movement management systems. The consultant will also prepare a traffic regulation design that will include recommendations for all traffic regulations which will apply within at least 150 m from the centre of a junction. A synchronised timing plan for the signals will also be prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-smart-traffic-signals-at-70-junctions-across-12-roads-101639939765490.html
20-12-2021||Mumbai||MVA parties harden stance against Karnataka CM Bommai||MUMBAI/BENGALURU: Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties on Sunday hardened their stand against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka over the alleged desecration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Bengaluru. While the Shiv Sena protested across Mumbai, with Lok Sabha MP and spokesperson Arvind Sawant asking the BJP to clarify its position, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) activists performed a ‘milk abhishek’ of the warrior-king’s statues in the state. The Congress has questioned if the BJP will ask Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to quit. Bommai, meanwhile, reiterated that vandals will be dealt with sternly as tensions remain high in Belagavi, a border town over that Maharashtra claims for itself on linguistic grounds. The city has reported several incidents of arson and defacing of statues over what appears to be the reviving of the Kannada-Marathi language and border row between two of India’s most industrialised states. “Our government will not tolerate any acts of violence,” Bommai said on Sunday. “Vandals would be dealt with sternly. We have arrested 27 persons in Belagavi and three in Bengaluru in connection with cases of vandalising the statues of Shivaji and Sangolli Rayanna.” The statements came after some protesters went on the rampage in Belagavi on Friday night, leading to clashes with the police. In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena activists forced hotels and other establishments owned by Kannadigas to shut down in neighbouring Kolhapur. MVA parties attacked the Karnataka government for what they called its “unjust handling of the protests by Marathi speakers in Belagavi” and other parts of the state’s border with Maharashtra; groups that are seeking the inclusion of the region in Maharashtra due to their linguistic majority. The BJP claimed that one of those arrested for the desecration is a Congress worker. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday had sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant, who led a protest in Mumbai’s Lalbaug area on Sunday, said, “During the 2014 elections, the BJP had coined a slogan seeking votes in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. But the statue was desecrated in a state ruled by them and their chief minister called it a trivial incident. This shows their attitude. The BJP just wants to use Shivaji Maharaj for their politics. Immediate action must be taken against those responsible for this incident.” Sawant also referred to Modi invoking Shivaji Maharaj while inaugurating the Kashi Vishweshwar corridor last week. Sawant said Kannadigas in Maharashtra were living happily and should tell their brethren in Karnataka that that they should not perpetrate any injustice against Marathi speakers. “They (Kannadigas in Maharashtra) must condemn the atrocities against Maharashtrians in Karnataka… they must remember what happened in 1969 (when the Shiv Sena rioted in Mumbai over the Belagavi issue),” he said. State minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that the “hatred of Marathi and the hatred of Maharashtrians in Karnataka had morphed into a hatred of (Shivaji) Maharaj,” and that this caused the incident. He said he condemned Bommai’s attempts to “trivialise the issue” and called for “a stop to the injustice against the Marathi-speakers in Belagavi and other border areas.” On Saturday, leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP had tweeted that Shivaji Maharaj was an icon not just for Maharashtra, but India as well, and condemned the incident. He also referred to how Bommai had also condemned the desecration, and that some of those allegedly involved in the case had been arrested by the police. Prohibitory orders are in place in Belagavi after members of what is believed to be a pro-Marathi group defaced the statue of Sangolli Rayanna, a celebrated figure and general of Rani Chennamma of Kittur, who had taken on the British East India Company in 1824 over attempts to take control of her kingdom under the doctrine of lapse. Rayanna is also a figurehead of the influential Kuruba community in Karnataka, which counts former chief minister Siddaramaiah and incumbent cabinet minister KS Eshwarappa as its members. “Shivaji Maharaj, Kitturu Rani Chennamma and Sangolli Rayanna are great patriots. They should be respected,” Bommai said. “Nobody should indulge in spreading false news and incite people. The incidents are being propagated in different shades to mislead the people. This is far from the truth. I have immense respect and pride for the patriots. People should not get swayed by rumours.” Pro-Kannada groups had blackened the face of Deepal Dalwi, the president of the separatist Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi (MES), on December 13 at the start of the winter session of the Karnataka legislature in Belagavi as a show of strength and protest against holding the legislature session in a region which the Samithi considers should rightly be a part of Maharashtra. Several areas of erstwhile Mumbai-Karnataka, now renamed as Kittur Karnataka, are part of the regions that were included into the southern state in the 1956 reorganisation of states. While Karnataka celebrates Kannada Rajyotsava on November 1, the MES observes it a black day as they claim to have been forcibly separated from their parent state 66 years ago during the reorganisation exercise. In 2012, the Karnataka government inaugurated in Belagavi the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha, a replica of the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, where it holds the winter session of the state legislature to further thwart any claims of territory by the neighbouring state. However, the region still has Marathi-speaking residents, who continue to raise the inclusion of Belagavi and surrounding regions into Maharashtra and often clash with pro-Kannada organisations in the border district. Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s home minister, said all precautions have been taken in Belagavi to prevent any untoward incidents. He said the home department was in touch with the police over the incidents in Belagavi and Bengaluru. “I have asked for all necessary action to be taken to maintain peace and order,” Jnanendra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-parties-harden-stance-against-karnataka-cm-bommai-101639939527868.html
20-12-2021||Mumbai||Cause of concern: Ragging incidents go up in 2021||Mumbai: Cases of ragging on campus have been a matter of concern in higher education institutes for years now and while the pandemic brought such cases in control last year after colleges were pushed online, 2021 witnessed double the number of cases compared to 2020. Experts have highlighted that while the total complaints registered this year is still only 50% of what was registered before the pandemic, the fact that maximum of these cases are of online harassment makes this a bigger problem. According to statistics revealed by UGC’s www.antiragging.in as well as the Aman Satya Kachroo Trust—reachable through the national anti-ragging helpline number 1800-180-5522—a total of 511 cases were registered across the country this year compared to 219 registered in 2020. The cases reported in 2019 and 2018 were 1,070 and 1,016 respectively. “There was a case in the college where a male student was passing unsolicited comments against a female classmate, either during class or on WhatsApp groups, and this happened more than once. The female student brought this to our notice and we immediately took this matter to the institute’s anti-ragging cell that resolved the matter,” said the principal of a suburban college. The male student was not allowed to appear for his end of semester exams. After the initial days of lockdown, colleges first reopened for virtual classes in July-August 2020. Several colleges in the city as well as state received complaints of online harassment and while in some cases it became difficult to find the perpetrator, strict action was taken against the perpetrators in several cases. Mumbai’s St Xavier’s College had suspended three of their students for sharing the login ID and password of their lecture with outsiders, who in turn joined the class and disrupted the lecture. Similarly, four female students of the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) reported harassment at the hands of exam proctors who were reported to have passed comments about the way these students looked during the exam and sent messages to these students’ personal mobile numbers. All four proctors were fired and a case of sexual harassment was registered against all four perpetrators. While most higher education institutes have been conducting lectures online for the past 20 months, medical institutes had started in-person classes earlier this year, which has accounted for maximum complaints of ragging once again this year. As per information shared by the UGC, 181 of the total cases of ragging reported this year came from medical colleges alone. “Before the pandemic, ragging was always prevalent in residential institutes, majorly in the medical and engineering institutes while cyber bullying would be considered online ragging. With classes going online, more cases are being reported from several colleges and sadly the line between ragging and sexual harassment is diminishing,” said Meera Kaura Patel, advocate, Supreme Court and Honorary Legal Head, Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE), a non-profit organisation focusing exclusively on protection of lives and dignity of students in education institutes. Recently, a college in Mumbai registered a case with their anti-ragging cell when a student was accused of sharing obscene drawings in the middle of a class presentation. While no First Information Report (FIR) was lodged, the perpetrator was suspended. “The anti-ragging regulations have been crafted in a way where the primary responsibility to prevent such cases falls on the head of the institute, and most education institutes end up keeping the case covered in a bid to save their own reputation. This has, more often than not, led to lenient punishment against perpetrators,” added Patel. She said in some cases, victims have also been coaxed to drop their charges. “Need of the hour is for state governments to make ragging a cognisable offense and as the same time, for colleges to ensure violence free education to students. Only then can ragging be solved.”

Vivek Trivedi, station house officer (SHO), Phase 3 police station, said that a 32-year-old woman, a resident of Eldeco Aamantran Noida Sector 119, was going to her office in her car on Saturday morning. “The woman got into a heated argument with a 62-year-old man, Devendra Kumar, who collided his motorcycle with the woman’s car near The Millennium School in Sector 119,” Trivedi said. The woman, in her complaint, said that Devendra abused and slapped her during the spar, and also called the arrested suspects (Devendra’s sons) — Amit and Vikas — to reach the spot. On calling, the woman’s husband also reached the spot along with a friend (details not provided by the police).“Devendra and his two sons to reach the spot. The Kumars hit the friend of the victim’s husband in the head with a rod, and he received a fracture in his head.

20-12-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai emerges state’s most vaccine-efficient city||MUMBAI: The city tops the state in vaccine use efficiency with -6.33% wastage, according to data released by the Maharashtra health department to Hindustan Times under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The state’s capital is followed by Ratnagiri (-4.29%), Palghar (-4.03%), Akola (-3.87%) and Wardha (-3.81%). The data is as of December 14, 2021, and pertains to Covishield, which accounts for 89% of the total doses administered. Negative wastage implies that vaccination centres managed to inoculate more than the expected number of beneficiaries per vial, a state health department official said. Vaccines doses have to be administered within a certain time limit after a vial is opened, or else it loses its potency. Manufacturers anticipate this, and they usually add more doses per vial. However, if there are not enough people to be inoculated within that time limit the vial is disposed of, and the vaccine is considered as wasted. Vaccine wastage can also occur due to heat and non-utilisation beyond the expiry date. Earlier this year, in the middle of the second wave of Covid-19, the Central government had set a target of reducing wastage to less than 1%. Districts in the state that exceeded the 1% wastage target include Gadchiroli (2.04%), Pune (1.94%) and Yavatmal (1.21%). Mumbai also tops in the number of doses administered so far, accounting for 15.03% of the state’s total. Until Sunday evening, Mumbai had administered 17,413,662 doses, including inoculating 9,839,928 people for their first doses and 7,573,734 citizens for their second doses. Maharashtra’s eligible population for the vaccine is 92,365,46. According to Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC, “We ensured that at least 10 people are at the booth while opening a new vial meant for 10 doses. Towards the end of the daily session, booths coordinate among themselves to ensure adequate number of beneficiaries is available. By using additional doses in the vial, we ensured more people are inoculated. The government expects wastage of between 1% and 2% wastage, but with the efficient use of the doses, we could achieve this feat. We have so far inoculated at least 100,000 more than expected.” Kakani said BMC’s strategy to exhaust the stock rather than staggering its use during the shortage earlier this year helped them to use the inventory effectively and maintain high rate of vaccination. Until Sunday evening, the state had administered 127,774,101 doses, of which 78,792,696 were first doses and 48,941,239 were the second dose. As on Saturday, nearly 12.69 million or about 13.88% of 91.44 million eligible people had not taken even the first dose. The state’s percentage of the first dose is 72.3%, with 21 districts averaging below this and nine districts below 55%, as per a health department presentation on December 15. Fully vaccinated people amount to 32.97% of the eligible population. As many as 23 districts have not achieved this figure. A health department official said, “We have more than five million unused doses vaccines in the state. People are not coming forward for vaccination. The fear of a potential third wave, and the rising threat of the Omicron variant has helped us plug this gap a bit in the last two months.” He said the rural response to vaccination is poor on account of significantly fewer cases in the last few months and also because of strongly held beliefs in certain communities. We are taking due step to overcome them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-emerges-state-s-most-vaccine-efficient-city-101639938987129.html
20-12-2021||Gurugram||Three held with goods stolen from factory in Manesar||Three men were arrested on Saturday for allegedly stealing goods and heavy motors from a factory in Manesar. Police said they have recovered some stolen goods worth ₹4 lakh from the suspects, one of whom worked at the factory. The suspects were identified as Praveen Kumar from Delhi, Chotu Kumar, a native of Bihar, and Vijaypal alias Pradeep, a native of Uttar Pradesh, police said, adding that Vijaypal worked at the factory which manufactures auto parts. “The burglary took place on the intervening night of December 8 and 9. The three broke into the factory and made off with iron channels, copper cables, and heavy Japanese motors of 60 horsepower, among other items,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). Police said the suspects were identified with the help of CCTV footage from the cameras installed at the entrance and the halls. “Vijaypal is an employee of the company and he can be seen in the footage. When he did not turn up for work the next day, the company management informed the IMT Manesar police. Subsequently, raids were conducted and the suspects were arrested from different parts of the city,” said Sangwan. Police have also recovered two knives from the possession of the suspects. Sangwan said the suspects who had been committing thefts for the past eight months used to sell the stolen items to scrap dealers. “One of the scrap dealers asked the suspects for three days’ time to get the value of motors evaluated. He has a criminal history and has been booked in the past too. He is at large and raids are being conducted to arrest him,” said Sangwan. The suspects were produced before a magistrate who sent them to two-day police remand, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-three-held-with-goods-stolen-from-factory-in-manesar-101639938925009.html
20-12-2021||Noida||Noida authority to operate all parking facilities digitally by December-end||The Noida authority will operate all the car parking facilities in the city, including the multi-level car parking space, through a mobile application (yet to be named) to be launched by the end of December, said officials on Sunday.The authority wants to ensure transparency, and make the parking process easy for the users. After the app is operational, people will be able to book parking spaces through digital payment, which will save their time, according to the officials.“We are likely to start operations through the app at all major parking facilities in the city by December-end. We are in the final stage of launching the app. Once the app is operational, parking services will completely become digital and it will help in maintaining transparency,” said SP Singh, deputy general manager of Noida authority, who also heads the Noida traffic cell.Vehicle parking spaces at sectors 18 and 38A, and Film City, and underground parking facilities at sectors 1, 3 and 5 come under the Noida authority, along with at least 60 parking sites — run by different private contractors — across the city.Many times, people complain that parking attendants misbehave with them, and overcharge for the space. “When the app is operational, people would not face such issues. They can easily get the service through the app,” said Singh.The Noida authority will also open an escrow account, connected with the app, so that the collected revenue goes into that account and information about it is being saved from each parking site.The parking facility at Noida Film City has a capacity of accommodating 1,400 vehicles, and sectors 38A (7,000), 1 (534), 3 (565), and 5 (262). The remaining ones in the city are surface parking facilities.“The Noida authority keeps talking about transparency and users’ ease, but nothing like that has happened so far. We hope this service starts at the earliest, without a delay... Many private contractors for the service overcharge, and at times their behavior is also not appropriate,” said Kummu Joshi Bhatnagar, a social activist from Noida Sector 77.
20-12-2021||Noida||Only 23% of foreign returnees from ‘at-risk’ nations tested for Covid in Noida||Despite the threat of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 turning into a full-scale outbreak looming large, the Gautam Budh Nagar health department has tested just 23% of the travellers arriving from ‘at-risk’ nations. A total of 4,000 international travellers have been notified to the district authorities, of whom 1,700 people have arrived from ‘at risk’ countries. Of them, just about 400 travellers have been tested for Covid-19 . Overall, around 2,500 Covid tests are being conducted in the district daily, which is less than half the target of 5,500 tests mandated by the state. Officials said around 1,200 to 1,400 rapid antigen tests (RAT) and a same number of RT-PCR tests are being conducted every day. District officials said that many a times, the travellers provide wrong information, making it difficult for the teams to track the travellers.Often the contact details are either incorrect or not reachable and addresses given are also not correct. “It is not easy to track travellers if the contact details are not right. Besides, calling international numbers is also a time taking process,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. District officials said no other international traveller has tested positive for Covid-19 apart from a couple and their five-year-old son , who returned from United Kingdom, and a woman and her five-year-old daughter, who came from Singapore. Health officials said the samples of the two adult travellers from UK were sent to the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) for genome sequencing and the reports showed that the couple tested negative for the Omicron variant. The samples of the couple’s son and the mother-daughter duo from Singapore were sent to the National Centre for Disease Control and the results of the genome sequencing are still awaited. Three new Covid cases in Noida Three fresh Covid-19 cases, all of whom are contacts of previously infected Covid patients, were reported in Noida on Sunday, taking the tally of active cases to 29. With reports of an Omicron infected elderly couple coming from Ghazia[bad, the health department has asked private hospitals to be ready if there is a surge in infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/only-23-of-foreign-returnees-from-at-risk-nations-tested-for-covid-in-noida-101639938863730.html

20-12-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy sale above fixed yield: 30K farmer accounts under lens in Punjab||Around 30,000 farmers’ accounts in Punjab are under the scanner of the food and civil supplies for purportedly booking paddy for sale to the state’s procurement agencies higher than the average per acre yield of 34 quintal fixed by the department. The kharif (paddy) procurement ended on November 30, and after that the state’s four procurement agencies — Pungrain, Punsup, Markfed and warehousing corporation — besides the food department and Mandi board, which manages the grain market operations, are busy settling the accounts. For the first time in the state, paddy stocks were procured by fixing the per acre yield, as the Centre has made it mandatory to link crop payment with land records. Initially, there were 5.2 lakh accounts of 9 lakh farmers under the scanner, and even though most have been settled, there are still 30,000 accounts that show sale of paddy more than the average. The ceiling was fixed to check bogus billing and to end the malpractice of mixing rice and paddy of the previous crop seasons to the fresh crop. The crops are mixed to earn on the difference of price at which the crop of past seasons is procured and the higher minimum support price (MSP) offered in the prevailing season. The practice is adopted by a section of arhtiyas (commission agents) by manipulating the farmers’ accounts. “We have made red entries on all farmers’ accounts that show sale of crop more than the average, and are in the process of verifying their antecedents. The farmers and arhtiyas found guilty of selling more than the average yield will face action. These accounts could even be frozen or a penalty could be imposed,” said state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. According to a senior official of the state department, it’s a tedious process to match purchase from each farmer’s account with land tilled by them. “This being the first season, we are facing many challenges to reconcile the records. We have formed committees at district level, with members of procurement agencies and the Mandi board, to verify the purchase,” said the official, who didn’t wish to be named. In the recent kharif season, 188 lakh tonne of paddy was procured by government agencies, against an all-time high of 203 lakh tonne in the previous season, for which paddy from outside the state and bogus billing were alleged to be the main contributors. Every year, the food department and procurement agencies face an uphill task to check the flow of old paddy from other states. This year, amid heightened vigil, a many trucks were seized at the state borders, or illegal stocks were found at godowns of rice shelling mills during physical verification. ‘Linking Aadhaar to land records a solution’The food department and Mandi board finds it impractical to device a method to verify the land owned by a farmer with the payment portal. “The only solution is connecting the land record to Aadhaar card, so that even if farmers have more than one farm in the state, all could get a unique ID by connecting it to the Aadhaar number of the owners,” suggested a Mandi board official, on the condition of anonymity. The Centre’s ministry of food and public distribution is pushing Punjab to implement the Aadhaar linking, but the process is facing delays. There are at least 45 lakh “khewat” (account) numbers in the name of 8.5 lakh farmers. “We have a plan to do the Aadhaar linking, but let’s see how and when it will be implemented,” said an officer of the food procurement agency. 
20-12-2021||Other||Gurugram: MCG panel to probe hiring of agency for C&D waste||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has constituted a four-member committee to probe into the alleged irregularities in the hiring of a private contractor in February 2019 to collect and transport construction and demolition (C&D) waste as well as payments made to the agency for the work during the contract period, among others. The committee was formed by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on December 14 following directions from the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB), Haryana.The committee has an MCG joint commissioner, chief engineer, chief account officer, and district attorney as its members.As per Ahuja’s order, a copy of which is with HT, the committee has to investigate three key points: If the MCG had obtained approval from the Haryana government, as the competent authority, before awarding the contract to the private agency; if the agency performed its duties as per the three-year agreement signed with the MCG; and alleged irregularities in making payments to the contractor.Besides, the committee has to ascertain the reasons behind C&D waste lying scattered across the city other than the designated sites, according to the order. “References have been made by ULB, and MoEF, and some other issues are pending pertaining to payments to the bills submitted by (private contractor)... to the MCG and the C&D waste lying scattered at various locations in the MCG limits. It is hereby ordered detailed investigation... The committee shall examine all aspects of the matter and submit a detailed report within 10 days,” Ahuja’s office order read.According to the order, the MCG executive engineer for Swachh Bharat Mission has been directed to provide necessary documents and records to the committee.The ULB, in its October 6 order to Ahuja, had stated that Raman Sharma, an RTI activist and resident of Malibu Towne, has alleged that the then MCG commissioner and other civic body officials had committed a “large scale systematic and organised corruption of ₹50 crore” on the collection, transportation, and dumping of C&D waste during the “lockdown and Covid health emergency period,” and directed Ahuja to look into the matter and take the necessary action as per rule.Ahuja’s 52-page order regarding the constitution of the committee includes the ULB’s order sent to him on October 6, the Malibu Towne resident’s complaints, as well as copies of bills submitted by the contractor and the payments made by the MCG to it.Some of the important points raised by complainant Sharma indicate that as per the minutes of the meeting, chaired by the then MCG commissioner on February 6, 2020, he directed MCG officials to not enter any details or bills related to C&D work in the measurement book and that only bills/ invoices submitted by the private firm will be sufficient for payment purpose after due verification. Another point raised by the complainant was that bills were approved and payments were made to the contractor accordingly, within two days after submission.
20-12-2021||Delhi||Palwal: Muslim man beaten to death, family alleges hate crime||A 22-year-old Muslim man was allegedly beaten to death by his three friends over stealing a mobile phone of one of them in Palwal on December 15, even as the victim’s family have alleged that it was a communal hate crime, police said on Sunday.The Palwal police had registered a case of death in an accident soon after the matter was reported to them, but later added charges under section of murder after the post-mortem examination showed severe injury marks, and after a video was posted on the social media that showed the three suspects beating the man.All three suspects who the police identified as as Aakash alias Diljale, Vishal (who goes by single name), and Kalua -- all residents of Rasoolpur village in Palwal -- have been arrested, police said. They added that all suspects have been remanded into judicial custody.Ram Chandar Jakhar, station house officer (SHO) of Chand Hut police station in Palwal, said on December 15, they received information that a man, Rahul Khan, has died in accident. “We registered a case under sections 279 (rash driving), and 304A (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code. But, the post-mortem report revealed assault injuries, and the victim’s family approached us with a purported video of the incident. Following this, we converted it into a murder case, and started conducting raids to arrest suspects,” he said.Jakhar said they have also recovered the mobile phone on which the purported video was shot. “Aakash had shot video and shared it on social media to prove that he was not involved in the case . He is apparently heard in the video, saying ‘Mat maro isko, jane do’(Don’t hit him, let him go). He thought it will help him escape the blame,” the SHO said.Khan, a resident of Rasoolpur, nearly 16 kilometres from the Palwal city, worked as a daily wage labourer, his family members said. His wife, Saina, said Khan went to attend a wedding function with three of his friends on December 14. “Kalua called us around 6pm that Rahul has met with an accident near Nangal Road canal. An unidentified vehicle hit him, and fled. He said they were taking him to a hospital and asked us to reach there,” she said.Saina said, before breathing his last in the hospital on December 15, Khan told her that five people, including Kalua, beat him with rods. She said they believed Kalua registered a case of accident to hide the crime. “On December 15, we received a video , in which Rahul can be seen pleading and being beaten mercilessly. The suspects were threatening him, and saying ‘Hum Hindu Hain Hindu, Tu Mulla Hai Mulla’ (We are Hindus, and you are a Muslim), she alleged.SHO Jakhar said they were yet to confirm it was a communal angle to the crime. “We are investigating the case and the mobile phone has also been seized. We will sent it to the (forensic) lab. If it was a hate crime, we will add charges under the relevant sections of the law,” he said.Police said Aakash, one of the suspects, has told them that he had shot the video, but did not assault Khan. “Kalua was agitated as Rahul had stolen his mobile phone, after drinking together at the wedding function. Kalua was enraged over this, and encouraged his friends to assault Rahul. They did not realise that he was severely injured and could die,” Jakhar said, quoting what Aakash said during the interrogation.Razia, the sister of victim, alleged that her father retired from Indian Railways in April this year. She alleged that the suspects were pressuring Khan to give money to them from the retirement funds of his father. “They (the suspects) are drug addicts, and were demanding money from my brother. Last month, my brother gave them ₹2,000, but they were demanding ₹5,000 more,” she said.The family claimed that Khan could never steal anything, and the suspects were cooking up the story to misleaded the police.Chhedi Khan, the father of the deceased, said all the suspects were his son’s friends. “I moved to this village after my retirement. was posted in Ballabhgarh. My son hardly worked. Despite my repeated attempts, he did not give up their company,” he said.
20-12-2021||Delhi||In digital era, coding a key skill for country’s students||With children getting acquainted with computers and electronic devices at an early age, educators are increasingly laying emphasis on inculcating computational thinking among children still in school. Often compared with learning a foreign language, students are being introduced to coding at a relatively younger age, driven by the idea that it’s easier to acquire logical thinking skills while they are still young and learning proactively. Coding can foster creativity and curiosity as it encourages students to understand the “how” and “why” behind the functioning of technology and its products, educators said. It drives computational thinking and encourages students to give shape to their ideas. Introducing students to coding while they are in school can pique their curiosity and aid the development of their analytical skills early on. Group coding projects such as HT Code-A-Thon also encourage teamwork and allow students to learn from each other. They can be great tools to encourage students to think of creative solutions to problems.To that end, Hindustan Times has kicked off the second edition of India’s biggest coding Olympiad, Hindustan Times Code-A-Thon. Launched on August 31, Code-A-Thon provides an opportunity to students in classes 4 to 9 to learn to code and boost algorithmic thinking, mathematical and computing skills, and analytical thinking to prepare them for careers of tomorrow in science and technology. The olympiad intends to highlight the importance of coding for the younger generation by helping them to improve their analytical reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. HT Code-A-Thon will offer a platform to students to pick up the basics of coding, and showcase their code writing skills at a national level. The programme is divided into three rounds. The learning round is supposed to continue till the first week of January This will be followed by the qualifier round, which will take place in the second week of January and open the competition. The final, which holds the promise of a battle between whiz kids, is scheduled for the third week of January. The virtual felicitation ceremony will take place on January 20. Those interested to sign up for Code-A-Thon can visit https://htschool.hindustantimes.com/code-a-thon or scan the QR code below. After registering, participants can access their age-appropriate modules and course material. Students will be divided into three cohorts — classes 4 and 5 (app development), classes 6 to 8 (web development with HTML / CSS/ JavaScript), and classes 8 and 9 (dame development with Python). The top 100 students from each cohort will compete in the finale. Three winners from each cohort will be the winners of the HT Codeathon. All participants will receive mentorship from technical experts and certificates. Vinayak Garg, commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (an autonomous body under the union ministry of education), said the programme will help students to develop algorithmic thinking, which will enable them to approach various challenges and problems using logic and computational thinking. “Vigyan Jyoti Programme, a flagship initiative of the department of science and technology, is running successfully in 100 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas. The program aims to increase the representation of women in STEM and encourages and empowers meritorious girls of Class 9 to Class 12 to pursue STEM courses. Code-A-Thon, conducted by IBM in collaboration with Hindustan Times for Vigyan Jyoti Students will help in developing algorithmic thinking among students which will enable them to understand how to approach various challenges and problems using logic and computational thinking. Learning Programming language at school level will prepare our girl students for future career prospects in today’s world of hyper technology,” said Garg. For the coding Olympiad, HT has partnered with IBM and SpeedLabs, an AI-based practice and learning platform that boosts foundational concept-based learning. The competition was recently recognized as the “Best in South Asia” in the Global Media Awards hosted by the International News Media Association (INMA), which also had entrants such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal vying for the top spot. In December last year, more than two months after its launch, four winners and eight runners-up from two zones were chosen as winners of HT Code-A-Thon 2020. The event saw 10,000 schools and over 61,000 registrations. Around 400 finalists competed with each other by participating in tests..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ht-launches-2nd-edition-of-code-a-thon-to-help-students-learn-coding-101639938504012.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||Trees and robots in NCRPB plan to combat pollution||The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) in its draft Regional Plan-2041 for NCR envisages an environment plan that includes a mixture of greenery and technology to combat pollution in the region.The plan that has been put in the public domain seeking suggestions and objections suggests creating green corridors, green barriers along highways and a dense biodiversity park network, along with implementing technologies such as smog towers and floating water drones/robots to collect garbage and waste from the river to check rising pollution in the region.“Pollution mitigation technologies like smog towers, smog guns should be set up. Delhi has already initiated installing smog towers in 2020 and other urban areas in NCR should follow the same,” says the draft plan.The plan states each NCR district will have to mandatorily establish a continuous automatic weather monitoring station by 2024, with air quality monitoring equipments to be set up in each urban ward and village in a time-bound manner.“Green corridors/tree barriers should be developed wherever possible along roads to act as buffer and to reduce air pollution and noise pollution impacts. All highways shall have noise barriers/ tree corridors, especially when they are passing through or close to residential areas, hospitals, old age homes, educational institutions, courts, religious places and appropriate dense plantation should be done in such areas along roads,” the plan states.Delhi has seven existing biodiversity parks, and the plan envisage development of similar parks across NCR. It states that each NCR state should have at least one botanical garden and a zoo in each city and regional centres by 2030.To clean rivers in the region, it also asks for a revival and rejuvenation action plan to be prepared by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) by 2022, which will ensure zero discharge of untreated sewage into rivers such as Yamuna, Hindon and Kali. It also calls for exploration of possibilities to revive the old Sahibi river, which would feed the Najafgarh lake.Use of technology has been suggested to trap waste from flowing into the rivers. “Autonomous drone technologies like waste-sharks/aqua drones which work similar to vacuum cleaners should be adopted by NCR states for cleaning of rivers, channels and water bodies to help in reducing water pollution,” says the plan.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said the plan’s focus should be more on creating sufficient buffer zones for the region, an exercise which can commence from identifying and re-designing the correct land-use pattern. “We have to preserve our existing buffers and add more, wherever possible. Reliance on technology need not be as much as we look at creating more green pockets to provide fresh air. Technologies can only be adopted if there is some scientific backing,” he said, asking for more research before implementing air purifiers and smog towers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ncrplanning-board-suggests-trees-and-robots-to-combat-air-pollution-101639938205480.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||Amit Shah likely to lift curtains on city’s 2nd ‘waste-to-art’ park this Friday||Work on the Bharat Darshan Park in Punjabi Bagh has been completed and is likely to be inaugurated by Union home minister Amit Shah later this week, said officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).This will be the second waste-to-art park in Delhi where replicas of monuments have been set up using scrap material. Officials said that the facility uses 350 tonnes of scrap to recreate 17 Indian monuments over 8.5 acres.Shah is likely to inaugurate the park on December 24.The park has been built for around Rs12 crore over the past two years, said a senior municipal official said.The first such installation in Sarai Kale Khan, called the Waste-To-Wonder Park, was thrown open to the public in 2019.The Bharat Darshan Park will feature replicas of monuments like the Konark temple (in Odisha), Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal (Agra, Uttar Pradesh), Sanchi Stupa (Madhya Pradesh) and Nalanda University (Bihar).Meanwhile on Sunday the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Delhi MP Parvesh Singh Sahib and south Delhi mayor Mukesh Suryan inspected preparations at the park.“The construction of the park has seen some delays due to the pandemic, but all the work has been completed. The park is based on the concept of ‘waste-to-wealth’ where replicas of historical monuments are made. ‘Unity in Diversity’ is the theme of the park, where diversified culture and rich heritages of India is reflected through monuments. Like Waste to Wonder Park, Bharat Darshan Park will also become a popular tourist spot of Delhi,” Suryan remarked.Work on the park began in January 2020, but, like most infrastructure projects in the city, has been interrupted several times owing to the pandemic.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said “These monuments have been constructed with waste material like old vehicles, fans, iron rods, nuts and bolts that were left at SDMC’s yards and stores.”The park will be powered by solar panels, said officials aware of the matter.The park also hosts a 1.5-km walking track, a specified children’s zone, and an amphitheatre.A separate zone has been earmarked to establish stalls to organise cultural programmes and, food courts. A senior official overseeing the project implementation said that the provision of audio tour and selfie points have been made in the park.The park has also seen controversies even before being opened up for the public. The Golden Temple replica was dismantled in June after objections from the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (DSGPC). The civic body replaced it with replicas of Char Dham — Badrinath, Jagannath Puri, Dwarkadhish and Rameshwaram — that have been placed at the four corners of the park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/union-home-minister-amit-shah-to-inaugurate-bharat-darshan-park-101639937904764.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||Govt sets in motion plan to revamp Jama Masjid area||After the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk main road, the Delhi government has decided to give a facelift to the area around the Jama Masjid, and has appointed a consultant for preparing a detailed plan, a senior official aware of the development said.The consultant will also prepare the plan for the second phase of Chandni chowk redevelopment and creation of a heritage corridor between Delhi Gate and Kashmere Gate, the senior government official said.A government spokesperson said, “This will be developed as a heritage area. The scope of work of the consultant involves the development of Jama Masjid area, Netaji Subhash Marg as a heritage corridor, facade improvement and development of some internal roads of Chandni Chowk.”Revamp of Jama masjid surrounding areasThe redevelopment of areas around the Mughal-era mosque was conceived in 2004, but the project has remained on the drawing board. The government now intends to make the densely populated and congested area pedestrian-friendly, free of encroachment and upgrade the existing infrastructure.A senior PWD official, aware of the development, said the previous consultant (Pradeep Sachdeva Design Associates) prepared a detailed project last year report after an extensive survey of the area.PDSA, which carried out the Chandni Chowk redevelopment work, was also working on the Jama Masjid redevelopment project. But after the demise Pradeep Sachdeva, a renowned architect, last year, his firm pulled out of the projects, said a PWD official.“The consultant was appointed in November. We have asked the consultant to prepare the plan in continuation of the unapproved DPR. We have shared the report with them,” said the PWD official.The work to improve the road infrastructure on the Jama Masjid road will be taken up to clear it of any encroachment, make it pedestrian-friendly and take overhead cables underground etc.The PWD official said, “As per the report prepared by the previous consultant, we know the key problem areas such as encroachment, lack of parking, haphazard traffic movement etc. The plan is to streamline traffic movement while creating space for safe pedestrian movement. Currently, we are just focusing on the area outside the precinct. So far, no decision has been taken regarding the redevelopment of the precinct.”Historian Swapna Liddle said while planning the redevelopment of the area, the original design and the current use of the area should be kept in mind. “There are two important aspects: design and the usage. It is very important to see what was the original alignment between the Jama Masjid and the southern Gate of the Red Fort. The spirit of that alignment and the fact that this was an important public space, a cultural hub, should be kept in mind while planning for the area. The other aspect is about its current usage.”Mohammad Imran Khan, 45, who lives in the vicinity of Jama Masjid said drainage facilities in the area along with traffic management were messed up. Khan said roads and sanitation in the area were abysmal, and called for a inclusive, holistic development. Khan, who is also the head of the Meena Bazaar Street Hawkers Association, he said dedicated spaces are reserved for hawkers in any development proposal.“We are not against development but the government should also think about the hawkers here who are working hard to earn a living. We support beautification, but such efforts should not happen at the cost of the people who have their shops and establishments here. The area needs public toilets, sitting arrangements, and drinking water facilities. It is an international mosque but hawkers should also be given dedicated places for work and operations,” said Khan.Abu Sufiyan, a culture revivalist and old Delhi resident, said the development of the area surrounding the Jama Masjid should be done in a manner that allows the local residents to reclaim public spaces for community engagement. “In areas surrounding the Jama Masjid, there is a lot of encroachment by hawkers and shopkeepers in the market. Most of these people are not locals. Due to the lack of hygiene and cleanliness, local residents avoid going into these areas. If the government decides to redevelop these areas, the locals should be given a chance to reclaim the streets as is being done on the Chandni Chowk stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid,” said Sufiyan.He said if the area was developed with necessary public facilities, women and the elderly would be able to step out without challenges. Relocation of the motor market in the vicinity and other establishments that are encroaching on public streets should be regulated for local residents to claim public spaces, said Sufiyan. “Due to encroachments and increasing incidents of pick-pocketing, locals avoid stepping out in the market areas a lot. Chandni Chowk model can be implemented here with the purpose of community engagement,” he said.Chandni Chowk Phase-IIThe government has decided to take up the façade improvement of buildings along the 1.5km-long Chandni Chowk main market stretch and the improvement of six adjoining roads. The six roads are: Nai Sarak, Ballimaran Road, Gali Qasim Jaan, Road Grand, Farash Khana, Lal Kuan Main Road. The consultant for façade restoration was finalized in SeptemberOfficials from Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, had earlier told HT that façade restoration will be done keeping in mind the diverse architectural and heritage value of buildings in Shahjahanabad. “A uniform façade may not go with the heritage character of Shahjahanabad. We will come up with ideas and adopt the best possible practices for the preservation of the area’s heritage,” Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, told HT earlier.A senior PWD official said the government plans to develop a 3km-long heritage corridor on Netaji Subhas Marg between Delhi Gate and Kashmere gate. The project will involve streetscaping and dedicated lanes for non-motorised vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-appoints-consultant-for-revamp-of-jama-masjid-area-101639937665249.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police hike reward for info on illegal guns trade||Last month, a team of Delhi police officers arrested two alleged criminals Shailesh Kumar and Mohammad Hanif, with seven country made pistols, one motorcycle, a machine and equipment used in making firearms. During interrogation, both the accused disclosed that they, along with their associates used to make illegal firearms and sold them in the national capital. In another case, police arrested a man, Sahil alias Vicky, who was involved in a robbery at Geeta Colony with a country made pistol and three live cartridges. In both the cases, the police teams were alerted by informers, mostly locals, who were helping the police in a special operation against the illegal arms. Police handed both a cash reward of ₹10,000. Under a new scheme to encourage people to come forward with information that may help the police bust illegal firearms, the Delhi Police have increased the reward money from Rs1,000-Rs5,000 to ₹10,000-Rs25,000. “In the last five months, over 25 people have been rewarded for information about illegal weapons. Till now, we have been giving ₹1,000 to 5,000 to the informers who shared information about such criminals. But now under the new scheme, they will get at least ₹10,000,” said a senior police officer involved with the operation while speaking on condition of anonymity. The police informer, who helped police arrest Shailesh and Hanif, said, “Many youngsters from our villages started going to Hanif’s house in the late evening and used to return home in the afternoon. A boy, who was my distant cousin, left his college for this vocation. If both of them had not been nabbed, dozens of youngsters from our village might have been trapped in the illegal business of gun making. This is why I thought of informing the police.” The police informer in the second case said the Sahil alias Vicky used to trap gullible youngsters of the village to make easy money. HT is not disclosing the identity of the informers for their safety. Senior police officers said the identity of such informers is kept secret, and their safety is ensured. The Delhi Police has also asking informers to use smartphones and spy cameras, in a bid to receive concrete information. Under the eyes and ears scheme of the police, citizens are encouraged to keep an eye on suspicious and illegal activities around them, and inform the police. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said the new initiative aims to bolster the information flow. “Policing boundaries are defined by law, but it should not mean that there is no scope for innovation and experimentation. The idea is to involve the public in information gathering. It is yielding positive results. Our beat policemen are sensitizing all the stakeholders such as watchmen, security guards, vegetable and fruit vendors, parking attendants, drivers, residents and traders’ welfare associations, so that they can keep their eyes on criminals in their areas and share information with us,” he said. “The identity of the informer will be kept secret. If someone wants to share the information directly with me, it can be sent as text or WhatsApp message, directly on my official number. These informers are paid secretly as secrecy is an important aspect in cracking crime,” Asthana said. Former Delhi Police chief Ajay Raj Sharma there are several citizens who want to help the “system” if their identity is protected. “It can really yield very good results in crackdown against the illegal arms, if the police offer cash rewards as an incentive. They are officially known as confidential human source (CHS), or criminal informants (CI) within the law enforcement world. In our efforts to combat crime, oftentimes we heavily rely upon statements of our secret informers as their communications have proven vital to the detection of criminal activities,” he said. It may be noted that at least 2,000 illegal country made pistols are seized every year in Delhi. The city’s criminals use illegals guns of different types such as country made, automatic and imported ones. In cases of weapons seized from city criminals, Delhi police have in these years pinned the source of country made pistols to illegal factories in places such as Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh, Agra, Mathura, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. Police have also found that pistols were smuggled into Delhi from factories of Dhar, Khargone, Burhanpur, Indore, Gwalior and Sendwa in Madhya Pradesh, and also Khagaria and Munger in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-hike-reward-for-info-on-illegal-guns-trade-101639937423722.html
20-12-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP tussle as MCDs ask central govt for funds||As the national Capital approaches the crucial municipal elections that are due in April next year, a war of words has ensued over the BJP-ruled MCDs approaching the Centre for financial assistance to tide over the severe financial crisis that the three civic bodies are going through.Having failed to pay salaries to their staff, who have gone on repeated strikes in protest, the civic body leaders approached the Union finance ministry two weeks ago, seeking financial assistance that the Centre extends to municipalities in all states. However, the request has been denied with the finance ministry clarifying that the stipulated fund of Rs488 per person per annum is given to the municipal bodies in states, and not the union territories.The Aam Aadmi Party, which is the main opposition in all three corporations, has targeted the BJP, saying if the civic bodies in Ghaziabad and Gurugram can get the funds, the Centre should not ignore Delhi and Chandigarh.A senior finance ministry officer who asked not to be named said there was no provision to allocate financial assistance to the municipal bodies in the union territories. “Every year, we release these funds to all the state governments for the development of municipal bodies there. But since the municipal bodies in the union territories are not eligible, we can’t allocate unless the eligibility conditions are amended,” he said.Senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, said the MCD office-bearers must ask the Centre that how the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – the civic body of Mumbai – is different from those in the national capital. “The BJP leaders in Delhi lack conviction and determination. Whenever they get an opportunity to interact with union ministers belonging to their party, they just want to please them instead of telling them about the financial distress the municipal bodies are facing. The fact is that Centre has never given a single penny of financial assistance to the MCDs. Besides, the central bodies owe thousand of crores in due to the civic bodies such as the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has to pay ₹1,300 crore to South MCD, and ₹2,800 crore to North MCD,” he said.Pathak alleged that the BJP has turned the civic bodies “a white elephant”. “There are a number of areas in which the BJP-ruled MCDs have failed to deliver. The heaps of garbage and mountain-like landfills are common sights in the national capital. In the past few years, the Kejriwal government has proved that it can provide better facilities to Delhiites as it has given free electricity and water to one and all. Even the unauthorised colonies have been given the basic amenities. On the other hand, the employees and pensioners in the three MCDs have to protest for their salaries and dues. The BJP has no roadmap to bring MCDs out of bankruptcy,” he said.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta countered that the AAP should ask its Delhi government about the dues that it owes the MCDs, instead of targeting the Centre. “If the AAP says that the Centre is not giving financial assistance to the MCDs, they should better ask this question to the Kejriwal government as such funds are given through the state government,” he said, adding that no requisition for this fund has been made by the Delhi government.BK Oberoi, chairman of the standing committee in South MCD, said municipalities do not believe in “hoodwinking the people by offering freebies”. “We are exploring avenues to meet our expenses. As far as getting dues from DDA or paying rent to North MCD are concerned, everything is being done in accordance with the law,” he said.The Congress, which has only 31 members of the total 215 councillors in the three corporations, accused both the ruling BJP and AAP, for the sorry state of affairs in the municipal bodies.Delhi Congress vice-president and SDMC councilor, Abhishek Dutt, said both the parties are the two sides of same coin. “Both these parties have never taken such issues on priority for discussion in the House. As a result of this blame game between the two parties, the employees as well as the common people have stayed at the receiving end,” he said.The three civic bodies have been in a financial mess ever since the MCD was trifurcated, and have struggled to implement new projects and pay salaries to their staff leading to strikes. In the build-up to the 2022 municipal elections, the BJP, which has been ruling the three civic bodies for the past 15 years, has come under severe attack from the opposition which has blamed the crisis on the mismanagement and rampant corruption in the civic bodies.The municipal corporation elections in Delhi are crucial for all the three main contenders -- for the BJP, it will be a big test if it could manage to hold on to power despite a huge anti-incumbency; for the AAP, it will be the last frontier in its bid for complete administrative control over Delhi after having humbled its political opponents in two consecutive assembly polls; and for the Congress it will be yet another elections where it has to fight to regain whatever space it could that it has ceded to rivals in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-political-war-of-words-over-mcds-seeking-central-funds-101639937064649.html
20-12-2021||Other||In Goa, more than half of legislators switched sides since 2017||On Friday, when independent legislator Rohan Khaunte resigned and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he became the 21st legislator to switch sides since 2017, a sort of record in itself. More than 50% of Goa’s 40-legislators find themselves in a different political party from which they were elected in the last assembly polls 2017.The biggest beneficiary of these defections has been the BJP which saw its numbers grow from 13 -- its lowest tally in an assembly poll since 1999 when it won ten seats -- to 27 at the time it persuaded ten legislators from the Congress and two from the MGP to switch sides to the BJP.In recent months, three legislators -- one each from the Congress, the Goa Forward and an independent - have resigned and switched to the BJP with the expectation that they will be offered the party’s tickets for the upcoming polls.The BJP has lost only one -- its Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha to the Aam Aadmi Party.The biggest loser has been the congress whose strength in the Goa Legislative Assembly currently stands at three with the only upside being the party’s expected alliance with the Goa Forward Party that has also been able to bring independent legislator Prasad Gaonkar on board. Added to the mix is the Trinamool Congress (TMC) which has within its ranks two legislators who were elected in 2017.“This is a normal scenario in Goa. There are very few people like me who have not changed political parties and we are stuck where we are. This is happening because the public wants their MLA to be in power and every MLA runs where he presumes power will be there. This essentially happens because everybody expects their MLA to be in power that’s why everybody is shifting sides,” former MLA and member of the now nearly defunct United Goans Democratic Party Radharao Gracias, said.Gracias, known for his cynical view on politics, referred to Goa’s tumultuous past in the 1990s when the state saw 13 chief ministers assume the chair between 1990 and 2002 - the shortest being Churchill Alemao who was the chief minister for a mere 18 days - and legislators frequently changed sides the pulled the run under each other’s feet and various political formations were formed and dissipated.One would think the situation changed especially since it is more than 15 years since Goa was last brought under president’s rule (back in 2005) but Digambar Kamat of the Congress, who was chief minister between 2007 and 2012, remains the only chief minister in the history of Goa as a state to complete a full five-year term as Chief Minister.Gracias admits the current system has left the voter bewildered. “People are moving from anywhere to anywhere. People are joining and moving away from all parties. So probably sometime will have to pass before we can know at least what will happen because we do not know who will be with whom, when,” Gracias said.Political commentator Adv Cleofato Almeida Coutinho struck a more sombre tone cautioning that, if allowed to continue, the very system of partisan politics will cease to have any meaning.“When the Congress lost 10 MLAs to the BJP, people were saying that the Congress should put an end to this menace (of defections bereft of ideology) and opt for loyal faces. Today, those same people are saying that the Congress is not playing it smart,” Coutinho said.“If this is allowed to continue, then the very system of partisan politics should be under threat. The Election Commission should step in to ensure that a candidate is allowed to represent a party only if he has spent a certain amount of time in the party -- three years or more,” he added.The Congress for its part has assured that it has once and for all shut its door on those who have deserted the party in favour of the BJP assuring that they will not take them back even if they wished to come back.Former Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar of the BJP, who has indicated that he is keen to protect not just his political turf but his ‘ideology’ from his local political rival Dayanand Sopte who joined the BJP from the Congress said that the “voter is wise enough to see through what’s going on.”Asked if we have now entered an era where ideology no longer matters in politics, Parsekar said that this question would be better answered by those who are “swearing at the BJP one day and joining the party the next.”Political analysts fear that the practice of frequent party jumping will lead to disenchantment among voters and possibly a lower voter turnout for a state that has been regularly crossing the 80% voting percentage mark.“I fail to understand how these MLAs jump from one party to another even after bad-mouthing the party they jump to. How and why do they even think of becoming ministers if they want to mess around with the people of Goa,” Gabel Mascarenhas, a working professional said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-goa-more-than-half-of-legislators-switched-sides-since-2017-101639911142880.html
20-12-2021||World||Pentagon issues rules aimed at stopping rise of extremism||Warning that extremism in the ranks is increasing, Pentagon officials are issuing detailed new rules prohibiting service members from actively engaging in extremist activities. The new guidelines come nearly a year after some current and former service members participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, triggering a broad department review.Senior defense officials tell The Associated Press that fewer than 100 military members are known to have been involved in substantiated cases of extremist activity in the past year, but they warn that the number may grow given recent spikes in domestic violent extremism, particularly among veterans.Officials said the new policy doesn't largely change what is prohibited, but is more of an effort to make sure troops are clear on what they can and can't do, while still protecting their First Amendment free speech rights. And for the first time, it is far more specific about social media.The new policy lays out in detail the banned activities, which range from advocating terrorism or supporting the overthrow of the government to fundraising or rallying on behalf of an extremist group or “liking” or reposting extremist views on social media. The rules also specify that commanders must determine two things in order for someone to be held accountable: that the action was an extremist activity, as defined in the rules, and that the service member “actively participated” in that prohibited activity.Previous policies banned extremist activities but didn't go into such great detail, and also did not specify the two step process to determine someone accountable.What was wrong yesterday is still wrong today, said one senior defense official. But several officials said that as a study group spoke with service members this year they found that many wanted clearer definitions of what was not allowed. The officials spoke about the new rules on condition of anonymity because they have not yet been made public.The military has long been aware of small numbers of white supremacists and other extremists among the troops. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other leaders launched a broader campaign to root out extremism in the force after it became clear that military veterans and some current service members were present at the Jan. 6 insurrection.The risk of extremism in the military can be more dangerous because many service members have access to classified information about sensitive military operations or other national security information that could help adversaries. And extremist groups routinely recruit former and current service members because of their familiarity with weapons and combat tactics.Officials said that while the substantiated cases may be small, compared to the size of the military, which includes more than 2 million active duty and reserve troops. The number appears to be an increase over previous years where the totals were in the low two-digits. But they also noted that data has not been consistent so it is difficult to identify trends.The new rules do not provide a list of extremist organizations. Instead, it is up to commanders to determine if a service member is actively conducting extremist activities based on the definitions, rather than on a list of groups that may be constantly changing, officials said.The regulations lay out six broad groups of extremist activities, and then provide 14 different definitions that constitute active participation.Soon after taking office, Austin ordered military leaders to schedule a so-called “stand-down” day and spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks.The new rules apply to all of the military services, including the Coast Guard, which in peacetime is part of the Department of Homeland Security. They were developed through recommendations from the Countering Extremist Activities Working Group. And they make the distinction, for example, that troops may possess extremist materials, but they can’t attempt to distribute them, and while they can observe an extremist rally, they can’t participate, fund or support one.The rules, said the officials, focus on behavior not ideology. So service members have whatever political, religious or other beliefs that they want, but their actions and behavior are governed.In addition to the new rules, the Pentagon is expanding its screening for recruits to include a deeper look at potential extremist activities. Some activities may not totally prevent someone from joining the military, but require a closer look at the applicant.The department also is expanding education and training for current military members, and more specifically for those leaving the service who may be suddenly subject to recruitment by extremist organizations.More than 650 people have been charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, including dozens of veterans and about a half dozen active duty service members. Among them — an Army reservist who wore a Hitler mustache to his job at a Navy base.Some of the rioters facing the most serious charges, including members of far-right extremist groups, have military backgrounds. In several of the prosecution cases already, the Justice Department has cited a rioter’s military service as a factor weighing in favor of a jail sentence or house arrest. Prosecutors have repeatedly maintained that veterans’ service, while commendable, made their actions on Jan. 6 more egregious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-issues-rules-aimed-at-stopping-rise-of-extremism-101640024377459.html
20-12-2021||World||Wall Street falls on Omicron worries, Biden investment bill blow||US stock indexes fell more than 1% on Monday, dragged down by concerns about the impact of tighter Covid-19 curbs on the global economy, and a potentially devastating setback to President Joe Biden's investment bill.Surging global infections of the Omicron coronavirus variant have sparked worries in financial markets as many European nations and Britain weigh the possibility of restrictions during Christmas."Typically what happens in Europe is a bit of a preview for what we see in the United States. So, if we see a lot more infections in the US, it could stress hospitals, make people less reluctant to get out, spend, and partake in the economy. That's definitely a cause of concern," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.All of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with energy tumbling 2.4% as oil prices slumped by about $3.Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary, the sectors which house majority of mega-cap growth stocks, extended their slide from the previous session.Denting the market's sentiment further, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Sunday he would not support Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill.Goldman Sachs trimmed its quarterly U.S. GDP forecasts for 2022 after Manchin's comments.The developments come at a time when the Federal Reserve decided last week to end its pandemic-era stimulus faster, with the central bank signaling at least three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022."So we could be seeing a little bit of downward pressure on growth forecasts for next year and as a result, we may be seeing some of that reverberate through the market as well," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management."To some extent, they'll (lawmakers) probably go back to the table and try and figure out some parts of this plan that they may like to pass going forward, but in this current form, it doesn't seem like something that's going to happen at this point."Investors have taken a more defensive stance this month, with S&P 500 sectors such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities leading sectoral gains so far in December.The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge for investor anxiety, gained over 4 points and rose to its highest level in two weeks on Monday.At 12:00 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 618.07 points, or 1.75%, at 34,747.37, the S&P 500 was down 74.89 points, or 1.62%, at 4,545.75 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 245.91 points, or 1.62%, at 14,923.77.Oracle Corp fell 4.1% after the enterprise software maker said it would buy electronic medical records company Cerner Corp for $28.3 billion. Shares of Cerner added 1.0%.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 280 new lows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wall-street-falls-on-omicron-worries-biden-investment-bill-blow-101640022424389.html
20-12-2021||World||India, China ‘effectively managed’ border frictions: Chinese FM Wang Yi||China and India have maintained communication through diplomatic and military channels to control friction at the border, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said on Monday amid a dragging conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh that has seen bilateral ties plunge to its worst in decades.“China and India have maintained dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, and effectively managed and controlled frictions in certain border areas, under a shared commitment to improving and developing the bilateral relations,” Wang said.Wang was speaking on China’s Diplomacy in 2021: Embracing a Global Vision and Serving the Nation and its People at a symposium on the international situation and China’s foreign relations.Wang referred to India only once in his lengthy speech in which he talked about China’s global diplomacy, focusing on Beijing’s ties with different countries and continents.The senior Chinese diplomat has spoken earlier about the need for India and China to partner each other and respect each other’s core interests.Beijing, however, has continued to blame India for the current military tension and not explained why the last round of military talks in October, or for that matter, a round of diplomatic negotiations the following month, failed to make any headway.In November, India and China emerged from the last round of diplomatic talks on the border standoff with little to show but an agreement on holding the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date.In fact, the virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against the backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the LAC and a lack of forward movement on disengagement at friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang.Earlier this month, Wang spoke about Sino-India ties during an online talk with India’s outgoing ambassador Vikram Misri.Wang told Misri about building “mutual trust”.“When we build mutual trust, even the Himalayas cannot stop us from friendly exchanges. Without mutual trust, it is difficult to bring the two sides together, even if there are no mountains in the way. China and India should become partners and friends,” Wang said during the interaction.The narrative from New Delhi says it’s that very “mutual trust” that Beijing doesn’t seem keen to build.While China blames India for the border troubles, India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-effectively-managed-border-frictions-chinese-fm-wang-yi-101640023228616.html

20-12-2021||World||Several countries shorten Covid-19 booster timelines in bid to tackle Omicron spread||A growing number of countries are reducing the wait time for Covid-19 vaccine boosters from six months to as few as three in a bid to ward off a new surge in infections from the Omicron variant.They are reacting to early evidence suggesting that Omicron is spreading faster than its predecessor, Delta, and is more likely to infect people who were vaccinated or had Covid in the past. Some scientists, however, say that giving boosters too soon could compromise the level of longer-term vaccine protection.While data remains limited, half a dozen laboratory studies have shown that an initial course of Covid-19 vaccines - typically given in two doses - is not enough to halt infection from the Omicron variant, but a booster shot may help.Research from southern Africa and the UK shows that the variant is spreading very quickly, prompting forecasts that it will soon outpace Delta in several countries. Scientists are also trying to determine how severe cases of Omicron are.Many countries, including the United States, earlier this year authorized booster doses at six months after a person completes vaccination. This month, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Thailand cut that interval to three months. Belgium has lowered it to four months.France, Singapore, Taiwan, Italy and Australia have decreased their booster wait time to five months.Some countries, including the United States, South Africa and Germany, have stuck to the six-month booster schedule.Finland has recommended a three-month booster timeline for at-risk groups, saying it does not believe shortening the time for the general population will slow rising hospitalizations.Spain and Lithuania are also so far offering boosters only to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable, while India has not decided on a booster campaign. The World Health Organization, which had told rich countries to prioritize sending first Covid vaccine doses to the developing world, has become more open to boosters in light of rising cases.More data is needed, but there is a risk that shorter timeframes could compromise the effectiveness of vaccines given in multiple doses, experts said."In general for multiple-dose vaccines ... the immune system works better if it has time to mature," said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.Immune system defensesWhile studies show that boosters temporarily increase antibody levels, scientists say the goal of a vaccine regimen is to elicit not only antibodies but second-line immune system defenses such as T-cells."All that is going to be helpful for keeping you out of the hospital," said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine.Multi-dose vaccines prime the immune system, giving it time to marshal those back-up defenses.Dr. Luciano Borio, a former Food and Drug Administration acting chief scientist, said, "I do worry that we don't know what impact it may have on the immune system maturation of the doses. Three months seems like a very short interval."The United States has no plans to change its current booster timing recommendations, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email."From an immunologic point of view, it does not make sense to shorten the intervals to less than six months," said a spokesperson for Arkansas' public health department.Still, some experts argue that the six-month interval was arbitrary, and data gathered prior to the rise of the Omicron variant in November has shown that immunity as measured by antibody levels begins to drop off as early as four months after initial Covid-19 vaccinations."Four months is when the waning really started to get substantial," said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. "Omicron just forces the issue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-countries-shorten-covid-19-booster-timelines-in-bid-to-tackle-omicron-spread-101640020487329.html
20-12-2021||World||China drafts new sexual harassment legislation for women||China's top lawmaking body on Monday debated legislation to give women more protection against gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, state media reported, outlining rules including a clearer definition of inappropriate behaviour.The standing committee of the country's parliament, the National People's Congress, deliberated a draft amendment to the "Women's Rights and Interests Protection Law," state television network CCTV reported.The move came as China explores ways to maintain the labour force while its population is set to shrink, and after activist calls for gender equality that have accompanied a fledging #MeToo movement.China ranks 107th among 153 countries in the World Economic Forum's annual ranking on global gender equality. Men dominate top echelons of politics and business. Women made up roughly one-quarter of the parliament and there is just one woman in the 25-member Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.Under the new rules, employers would not be allowed to ask female job applicants if they intend to get married or pregnant, or to make them take pregnancy tests, CCTV said.CCTV is part of the Chinese government's publicity department and is an official channel in which the party and government releases information. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the proposed legislation.It was not clear how quickly the legislation could be passed. The discussion is expected to continue until at least Friday and the draft would not likely be voted on before that.Under the new rules, employers would be breaking the law if they restrict female staff from getting married or having children, or if they explicitly prioritise male candidates over females.In the clearest definition yet of sexual harassment in China, the draft amendment stipulates that it is unlawful to subject women against their will to verbal expressions with sexual connotations, inappropriate or unnecessary bodily behaviour, sexually explicit images, or hint at benefits in exchange for intimate relationships or sex.China's #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment. It spread to NGOs, media and other industries but faced a recent setback when a court in September ruled against the plaintiff in a high-profile sexual harassment case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drafts-new-sexual-harassment-legislation-for-women-101640017578844.html
20-12-2021||World||Covid-19: WHO says Omicron spreading faster than Delta, infecting those vaccinated||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading faster than the Delta variant and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday."There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing for Geneva-based journalists, held at its new headquarters building."And it is more likely people vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 could be infected or re-infected," Tedros said.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that the variant was successfully evading some immune responses, meaning that the booster programmes being rolled out in many countries ought to be targeted towards people with weaker immune systems.Omicron appears to be better at evading antibodies generated by some COVID-19 vaccines but there are other forms of immunity that may prevent infection and disease, WHO officials said."We do not believe that all vaccines will become completely ineffective," Swaminathan said.WHO expert Abdi Mahamud added: "Although we are seeing a reduction in the neutralisation antibodies, almost all data shows T-cells remain intact, that is what we really require."While the antibody defences from some courses have been undermined, there been hope that T-cells, the second pillar of an immune response, can prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.Swaminathan, referring to a treatment for people with the disease, said: "Of course there is a challenge, many of the monoclonals will not work with Omicron." She gave no details.But the WHO team also offered some hope to a world facing the new wave that 2022 would be the year that the pandemic, which already killed more than 5.6 million people worldwide, would end - with the development of second and third generation vaccines, further development of antimicrobial treatments and other innovations."(We) hope to consign this disease of a relatively mild disease that is easily prevented, that is easily treated ...and that able to cope easily with this disease into the future," Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergency expert, told the briefing."If we can keep virus transmission to minimum, then can bring pandemic to end."However Tedros also said China, where the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first detected at the end of 2019, must be forthcoming with data and information related to its origin to help the response going forward."We need to continue until we know the origins, we need to push harder because we should learn from what happened this time in order to (do) better in the future," Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-who-says-omicron-spreading-faster-than-delta-infecting-those-vaccinated-101640017895516.html

It includes a focus on whether the Trump Organization overstated the value of some real estate assets to obtain loans and tax benefits.In July, the company and longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in what a prosecutor in Vance's office called a "sweeping and audacious" 15-year tax fraud.In Monday's lawsuit, Trump and the company claim that James, a Democrat, is motivated by partisan bias against Trump, a Republican, pointing to public statements she made against the former president before she was elected to her position.They are seeking a court order barring the investigation from going forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-sues-nyc-attorney-general-letitia-james-to-stop-probe-of-his-businesses-101640016490180.html

It stated that the extension of Covaxin’s shelf life up to 12 months from the date of manufacturing was recently approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).The issue of vaccine wastage is a major concern for companies as well as the health authorities since the demand has been not able to keep up pace with the supply. The latest announcement could help resolve the vaccine wastage issue to some extent, especially the vaccines nearing expiry. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker said that Covaxin has been approved for use under the 28-day multi-dose vial policy from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the WHO Emergency Use Listing.“This approval of shelf life is based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CSCO,” Bharat Biotech said, adding that the hospitals can now utilise the stock which was nearing the expiry and avoid vaccine wastage.The company said the multidose vial policy would save money for procurement agencies by reducing the cold chain logistics and management and subsequently reducing the carbon footprint and costs related to open vial wastage.“Most importantly, we believe in being environmentally friendly by reducing the quantum of packing materials and single-use plastics that are utilized in vaccines manufacturing, storage, distribution, and disposal,” it added.Earlier today, Bharat Biotech said it has submitted an application to the DCGI to conduct a phase 3 clinical trial for a booster dose of its intranasal Covid-19 vaccine."We have submitted phase 3 clinical trial application to DCGI," Reuters quoted a Bharat Biotech spokesperson as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opened-vials-of-covaxin-can-be-stored-for-up-to-28-days-bharat-biotech-101640011900541.html
20-12-2021||World||Novavax Covid jab gets EU medicine regulator's approval||Europe's medicines watchdog on Monday approved a Covid jab by US-based Novavax, which uses a more conventional technology that the biotech firm hopes will reduce vaccine hesitancy.The protein-based vaccine of the kind used around the world to protect against many childhood illnesses is the fifth coronavirus shot authorised for use in the European Union."EMA has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Novavax's Covid-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid to prevent Covid-19 in people from 18 years of age," the European Medicines Agency said in a statement."After a thorough evaluation, EMA's human medicines committee concluded by consensus that the data on the vaccine were robust and met the EU criteria for efficacy, safety and quality," the Amsterdam-based agency said.Two main clinical trials -- one in Britain and the other in the US and Mexico and involving more than 45,000 people in total, showed between 89-90 percent efficacy in reducing the number of symptomatic Covid cases, the EMA said.But the watchdog said the clinical studies involved the original Covid-19 strain and some variants of concern such as Alpha and Beta, which were "the most common viral strains circulating when the studies were ongoing.""There is currently limited data on the efficacy of Nuvaxovid against other variants of concern, including Omicron," it said.'Well-understood platform'Monday's approval is also a boost for the Maryland company, whose jab has been plagued by delays.The EU has already signed a deal to buy up to 200 million doses of the two-shot vaccine pending the EMA's approval.Chief executive Stanley Erck said the firm "looks forward to providing an additional vaccine option in Europe, built on a proven, well-understood technology platform".The vaccine "may help address major obstacles to global vaccination, including global distribution challenges and vaccine hesitancy," Erck added.All vaccines work by teaching the body's immune system to attack the coronavirus, but they do it in different ways.Novavax's so-called protein subunit technology is already tried and tested, having been used for decades to vaccinate people against diseases including hepatitis B and whooping cough.It also means it does not have to be stored in ultra-low temperatures, potentially giving it a logistical edge over some other jabs.'Production problems'Novavax uses tiny, lab-made fragments of a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus spike.When injected, these trigger a reaction by the immune system, so that if it later comes into contact with the Covid virus, it knows to attack it.By contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have dominated the global Covid response using pioneering, but hitherto largely untested Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.They use a molecule of genetic material known as RNA to deliver a message to cells to produce the spike protein themselves. The body's immune system then learns to recognise the protein and attack it.The viral vector approach used by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson works on a similar principle, but delivers the genetic message via a version of the common cold adenovirus as a "vector".Rare but serious side effects of heart inflammation have been reported with the mRNA vaccines, and blood clots with the viral vector vaccines.But Novavax has struggled with months of delays amid what a group of MEPs recently called "production problems".Indonesia and the Philippines have already approved the Novavax jab, while Japan has agreed to buy 150 million doses.Novavax says it has also filed for approval in Britain, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and with the World Health Organization.The company has also said it is "evaluating its vaccine against the Omicron variant" and working on an Omicron-specific version.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-covid-jab-gets-eu-medicine-regulator-s-approval-101640010174751.html
20-12-2021||World||Egypt suspends classes, ports due to stormy weather||Stormy weather has prompted Egyptian authorities to suspend classes Monday in the capital of Cairo and a handful of other provinces as a precautionary measure.Authorities also closed the ports in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and the Suez Canal cities of Port Said and Suez.The country’s meteorological agency said moderate to heavy rainfall is expected over the northern coast and the Nile Delta region. The agency also said dusty storms are expected to hit northern and southern parts of country, and limit visibility.The Environment Ministry also urged old people and those suffering from chest and respiratory diseases to stay at home Monday to avoid weather-related complications.The Health Ministry said it deployed more ambulance crews in remote areas and on highways as a precautionary measure in case of road accidents.Moderate rains overnight have partly flooded streets in some neighborhoods in Cairo and other parts of the country. Local media reported snowfall over Alexandria, partly covering roads and rooftops across the coastal city.People took to social media platforms posting images and videos mostly celebrating the rare snowfall over the city. An Arabic hashtag, #Alexandria, was trending Monday.“Alexandria has become like Moscow. Good Winter!” wrote Menna Bader in a tweet, referring to Russian capital known with its icy weather.The seasonal rainfall has raised questions about the country’s ability to deal with flooding which usually leaves parts of Cairo and other major cities impassable. Flooding and heavy rain were also deadly in previous years, especially in rural areas.Infrastructure, sewage and drainage systems have all suffered from a lack of investment and years of poor maintenance. Scenes of trucks fanning out to drain water from flooded areas have been common in recent years.Last month heavy rain and flooding forced scorpions from their hiding places into many houses across the southern province of Aswan. State-run media reported at the time that three people were dead and over 500 others hospitalized from scorpion stings in Aswan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-suspends-classes-ports-due-to-stormy-weather-101640008964720.html
20-12-2021||World||Giant rave in Saudi desert pushes kingdom’s changing boundaries||The party in the Saudi desert looked like any other rave until the music stopped for the Islamic call to prayer, leaving attendees in ripped skinny jeans and combat boots to stand in silence.Fifteen minutes later -- religious duties completed -- thousands of party-goers got back to business. Men and women danced with abandon in a country where that would have been unthinkable five years ago.The electronic music festival in Saudi Arabia this weekend highlighted the changes catapulting through the conservative kingdom under its controversial crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In just a few years, the prince has lifted a ban on women driving, loosened gender segregation and defanged the religious police, who used to roam the streets punishing restaurants that played music.In contrast, the four-day festival called MDL Beast Soundstorm was endorsed by the government and included performances by global DJs like Tiësto and Armin van Buuren. Organizers say more than 180,000 people attended the opening night, pushing boundaries as the kingdom transforms.“Allow us progress, allow us to represent ourselves in the way that we feel fit,” said Prince Fahad Al Saud, a royal family member and entrepreneur who attended in a psychedelic-patterned jacket and sparkling eyeliner. “We are very eager to be part of the international community, but we can’t be stifled every time we try to make progress because it doesn’t look like what you want to see.”Busy monthIndeed, the festival was part of a dizzying month in which Saudi Arabia hosted a Formula One race, two separate art biennials and a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. All of it underlined the fact that any ostracism on the world stage has largely passed for Prince Mohammed, who faced global outcry after the 2018 murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.The prince’s plans to diversify the oil-dependent economy call for developing new sectors such as entertainment and tourism. And after closing the kingdom’s borders during much of the coronavirus pandemic, officials seem eager to make up for lost time -- even as the omicron variant of the virus drives case surges in other countries.At a recent international film festival in Jeddah, women strutted the red carpet in sleeveless gowns and an openly queer man, Adam Ali, won best actor. British supermodel Naomi Campbell was photographed sitting on the floor in front of a traditional Saudi meal, eating with her hands.“Now everything is here and the world has come to us,” marveled Abdullah Alghamdi, 29, who attended the weekend rave. “There are honestly so many events that you don’t know where to go.”Queer cultureThe scenes at the music festival were the most extreme of any yet. Women flaunted their style, wearing everything from skintight pants to full-length robes and face veils. Inebriated men stumbled through crowds perfumed with the distinct scent of marijuana, alongside a limited but notable display of local queer culture. Alcohol and homosexuality are still illegal in Saudi Arabia, but the event created a carnival-like atmosphere, opening the space to test limits.Any critical voices were largely silent. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s social opening has come with a crackdown on domestic dissent. Driving that fact home, officials closed every other large-scale event in Riyadh “for maintenance” for the duration of the festival, sparking sardonic jokes about the government forcing people to attend.But to Ibrahim Fahad, a 21-year-old tourism and hospitality student, the festival was a long-awaited dream.“I can’t even describe my feelings,” he said, posing for pictures as bass pounded in the background. “Before music opened up in Saudi Arabia, I used to travel to see artists like The Chainsmokers. Now I can stay at home, because they’re here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-rave-in-saudi-desert-pushes-kingdom-s-changing-boundaries-101640008353132.html
20-12-2021||World||Philippines typhoon death toll hits 375||The death toll from the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year surged to 375 on Monday, as desperate survivors pleaded for urgent supplies of drinking water and food.The Philippine Red Cross reported "complete carnage" in coastal areas after Super Typhoon Rai left homes, hospitals and schools "ripped to shreds".The storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees, toppled concrete power poles, smashed wooden houses to pieces, wiped out crops and flooded villages -- sparking comparisons to the damage caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013."Our situation is so desperate," said Ferry Asuncion, a street vendor in the hard-hit seaside city of Surigao, which was devastated by the storm.Residents urgently needed "drinking water and food", he said.At least 375 people were killed and 56 are missing in the latest disaster to hit the archipelago, with 500 more injured, the national police said.More than 380,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Rai slammed into the country on Thursday.One of the hardest-hit islands was Bohol -- known for its beaches, "Chocolate Hills" and tiny tarsier primates -- where at least 94 people have died, provincial Governor Arthur Yap said on Facebook.In Bohol's coastal town of Ubay, a state of calamity has been declared, with many wooden houses flattened and fishing boats destroyed.A senior official at the national disaster agency said he had not expected as many deaths."I was proven wrong as it appears now coming from the reports," said Casiano Monilla, deputy administrator for operations.- 'SOS' -Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season: most cyclones develop between July and October.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest storm ever to have made landfall, leaving over 7,300 people dead or missing.The death toll from Rai is not expected to get anywhere close to that number.The Philippines has an established disaster management system that provides early warnings of approaching storms and moves vulnerable communities into evacuation centres.But the storm has dealt a savage blow to the tourism sector, which was already struggling after Covid-19 restrictions decimated visitor numbers."SOS" has been painted on a road in the tourist town of General Luna on Siargao Island, where surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, as people struggled to find water and food."There's no water anymore, there's a water shortage, on day one there was already looting in our neighbourhood," Siargao resort owner Marja O'Donnell told CNN Philippines.There has also been widespread destruction on Dinagat and Mindanao islands, which along with Siargao bore the brunt of the storm when it hit, packing wind speeds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) per hour.Police reported 167 deaths in the Caraga region, which includes Dinagat, Siargao and the northeastern part of Mindanao.At least 14 people died on the Dinagat Islands, provincial information officer Jeffrey Crisostomo told broadcaster ABS-CBN, saying the area had been "levelled to the ground".But letters written by Dinagat residents, and posted to Facebook, expressed hope."We are happy to be alive," Aimee Antonio-Jimeno wrote to her sister."Our houses are roofless but we are not hopeless!"With electricity knocked out in many areas, there is no signal or internet, hampering efforts to assess the storm's damage.Thousands of military, police, coast guard and fire personnel were deployed along with food, water and medical supplies, while heavy machinery -- including backhoes and front-end loaders -- were sent to clear roads.President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to "look for another" two billion pesos ($40 million) in aid, which would double his previous pledge.But some expressed frustration at the government's response."No one showed up -- I don't know where the politicians and (election) candidates are," said a visibly angry Levi Lisondra, a resident in Surigao, on the northern tip of Mindanao."We paid big taxes when we were working and now they can't help us."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-typhoon-death-toll-hits-375-101640004007457.html
20-12-2021||World||Christmas lockdown after 12 Omicron deaths? Here's what UK deputy PM has to say||Britain’s deputy prime minister Dominic Raab on Monday said 12 people infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus have died in the United Kingdom, refusing to rule out further restrictions before Christmas. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant ahead of the festival has put the British government in a spot amid reports of a possible two-week circuit-breaker lockdown.Health experts have also started to play down the initial argument of “mild” disease from Omicron as compared to the Delta variant given the worrying rate of transmission which could overwhelm the health system. The United Kingdom has been recorded over 37,000 confirmed cases of Omicron, with a majority of cases detected in the last two days.With record levels of Covid cases in Britain, officials have warned that the full effect of the latest wave is yet to be seen. While the severity of the disease caused by the new variant of concern remains unclear, 12 deaths related to Omicron may push the government to opt for stricter measures in the coming days. As many as 104 Covid patients are currently in hospital with Omicron, said Raab.When asked about whether the government would impose further restrictions before Christmas, the deputy PM told Times Radio, "I just can't make hard and fast guarantees.""In assessing the situation we rely very heavily on the real data coming through and it will take a little bit more time to assess this critical issue of the severity of Omicron."Last week, British media reported on a meeting held by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which recommended measures ranging from "mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown.""If the aim is to reduce the levels of infection in the population and prevent hospitalisations reaching these levels, more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon," the Sage minutes said, as quoted by BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-lockdown-after-12-omicron-deaths-here-s-what-uk-deputy-pm-have-to-say-101640002344427.html

The decision was announced by Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett office following a Cabinet vote on Monday.The rare move of banning travel to the United States comes amid a rapid spread of the new variant of concern across the globe and a rise in infections in Israel, a country with high vaccination coverage. The travel ban is expected to take effect from Wednesday midnight once the parliamentary committee gives the decision a final approval.The US and Canada will join several European countries and other destinations on the so-called travel red-list to which Israelis would be barred from travelling and incoming travellers must remain in quarantine for a stipulated time period.Here’s the list of countries Israel will extend its travel ban:The travel restrictions come amid growing concern over the transmission rate of the Omicron variant which has now spread to at least 89 countries within a month of its identification by South African and Botswanan scientists in November. Top health experts, including White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci, has sounded alarm bells about the variant of concern raging through the world.“I don’t foresee the kind of lockdowns that we’ve seen before but I certainly see the potential for stress on our hospital system,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-extend-travel-ban-to-us-canada-8-other-countries-as-omicron-rages-101639991567127.html
20-12-2021||World||Chinese banks cut borrowing costs to counter economic slowdown||Chinese banks lowered borrowing costs for the first time in 20 months, foreshadowing more monetary support to an economy showing strain from a property slump, weak private consumption and sporadic virus outbreaks.The one-year loan prime rate was set at 3.8% versus 3.85% in November, the first reduction since April 2020, according to a statement from the People’s Bank of China on Monday. The five-year loan prime rate, a reference for mortgages, was unchanged at 4.65%.The cut comes as the central bank and government increase support for the economy and follows the PBOC’s decision earlier this month to cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, which freed up 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) of cheap long-term funding for banks. Monday’s decision means the strongest companies will be able to borrow at a slightly cheaper rate and also reinforces the shift to looser policy as the leadership aims for stability in 2022. “The cut reinforces our view that China’s authorities are increasingly open to the possibility of an interest-rate cut amid looming headwinds to the economy,” said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. While technically not a policy interest rate, the LPR is based on 18 banks’ loan rates for their best customers and has been considered China’s de facto benchmark funding cost since 2019. The cut will lower overall interest payment burden of Chinese companies by 80 billion yuan per year starting next year, according to Xing, who said there are around 160 trillion yuan of loans pegged to the one-year LPR. The CSI 300 Real Estate Index climbed as much as 2.6%. Gemdale Corp. and Poly Developments and Holdings Group Co. led the gains, each rising at least 3.5%. China’s 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.85%, while the offshore yuan steadied at 6.3865 to the dollar.The move strengthens the easing bias of the PBOC, and more measures could be rolled out if the economic slowdown deepens, including further cuts to the reserve requirement ratio as well as reduction of policy rates, according to analysts. The PBOC vowed last week to continue to unleash the potential of interest rate reforms and guide overall corporate financing costs lower.“The signal is obvious that we are in an easing cycle,” said He Wei, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, who expects the PBOC’s policy rates, or the rates for the medium-term lending facility and seven-day reverse repurchase notes, will be lowered in the first half of next year.In another sign of support, China will focus on supporting “quality” property developers buying the real estate projects of large companies which are experiencing difficulties, Financial News, a newspaper co-founded by the PBOC, reported Monday, citing a notice from the central bank and the banking regulator.Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd., said the next window for monetary easing could be late January, when the PBOC may act to cut the RRR, policy rates or roll out more structural tools depending on the economy’s state as well previous policies’ impact.“In the near term we may not see PBOC adding more measure,” said Qi Gao, a strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia. The PBOC could cut the MLF rate next year and lower the RRR again in the first half of 2022, he said.Xing of ANZ echoed the view that the LPR reduction signals there may not be policy rate cut in the short term, but forecast another RRR cut early next year to cushion mounting credit risks in the property sector.The LPR is reported by banks in the form of a spread over the interest rate on PBOC’s medium-term loans. With the PBOC having kept the MLF rate unchanged last week, most economists polled by Bloomberg had expected the LPR to remain steady as well.Still, the chorus for a rate cut has grown louder recently, and interest rate swaps also showed traders had been betting the LPR would soon be cut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-banks-cut-borrowing-costs-to-counter-economic-slowdown-101639988946856.html

He is currently planning a trip to the moon.Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa returned to Earth on Monday after spending 12 days on board the International Space Station, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.Maezawa is a fashion tycoon who sold his online fashion business Zozo to SoftBank in 2019. Forbes estimates his worth as $1.9 (€1.69) billion.What was the trip like?Maezawa parachuted onto Kazakhstan's steppe at around the planned time of 0313 GMT, along with his assistant and film producer Yozo Hirano, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.The landing site was located 150 kilometers southeast of Zhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan, where there was precipitation and sub-zero temperatures.Maezawa made the trip in a Russian 'Soyuz' spacecraft and became the first space tourist to travel to the International Space Station in more than a decade.The entrepreneur made a variety of posts on social media from his trip, including photos from space of his home prefecture of Chiba, and videos showing how to make tea in zero gravity and discussing his shortage of fresh underwear.What did Maezawa say about the trip?In a live interview from the orbiting space station, Maezawa said that "once you are in space, you realize how much it is worth it by having this amazing experience."When asked about claims that he had paid more than $80 million (€71 million) for the trip, Maezawa said he couldn't disclose the exact sum but admitted that he paid "pretty much" that much.Maezawa is currently searching for eight people to join him on a trip to the moon in 2023.

20-12-2021||World||China tennis star Peng Shuai denies sexual assault claim||Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai on Sunday said she has never been sexually assaulted by anyone, retracting a social media claim made in November where she said a former top Communist Party of China (CPC) had forced her into sex.Peng, speaking to the Chinese language Singaporean newspaper, Lianhe Zaobao, in Shanghai, said she was living at her home in Beijing and was not under any kind of official supervision.Sunday’s short interview to Zaobao on the sidelines of a sports event in Shanghai was the first time Peng directly spoke to the media after dropping out of sight following her allegation that former CPC politburo standing committee member and vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.Peng had posted the allegation on her verified Twitter-like Weibo account.On Sunday, however, Peng denied her own allegation. “First of all, I want to emphasise something that is very important. I have never said that I wrote that anyone sexually assaulted me. I need to emphasise this point very clearly,” Peng said, according to a translation of what she told the newspaper reporter in Chinese.Asked about the allegations made on Weibo, Peng Shuai said: “First, I would like to stress a very important point: I have never said nor written anything accusing anyone of sexually assaulting me. I would like to emphasise this point very clearly.”She added: “Regarding Weibo, first of all, it’s a matter related to my personal privacy. Everyone has had many misunderstandings. Their misreadings do not stand.”According to a report by another Singapore newspaper, the Straits Times, when asked if she was under surveillance following the matter, she replied after a brief hesitation: “Why would that be the case? I have always been very free.”Peng Shuai added that an e-mail she had sent to the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) head Steve Simon in November assuring him that she was safe was legitimate.Peng said she wrote the Chinese version of the e-mail “entirely of my own free will” but that state media’s English channel CGTN had published a translated version of it in English as her own standard of the English language was not up to par. “What was conveyed (by CGTN) was no different from what I meant to convey to Mr Simon,” she added.Her #MeToo allegation against Zhang had sparked an online firestorm and swift censorship in China in the first week of November.Peng, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, had accused former Zhang, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Zhang, the vice premier, was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.The WTA, which early this month said it would suspend tournaments in China immediately due to concerns over the treatment of Peng Shuai and the safety of other players, continued to call for an investigation. “It was again good to see Peng Shuai in a public setting and we certainly hope she is doing well,” it said in a statement.“As we have consistently stated, these appearances do not alleviate or address the WTA’s significant concerns about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,” the WTA said.“We remain steadfast in our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.”China has not directly commented on Peng’s initial post, but said after the WTA’s move to suspend tournaments in China that it “opposes the politicisation of sports”.Zhang has not commented on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tennis-star-peng-shuai-denies-sexual-assault-claim-101639980146049.html
20-12-2021||World||Elon Musk says he will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year||Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., said on Twitter that he’ll pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year, an amount that could constitute a record payment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.The billionaire may face a tax bill of more than $10 billion for 2021 if he exercises all his options due to expire next year, calculations last week by Bloomberg News showed.The unusually high levy comes after Musk exercised almost 15 million options and sold millions of shares to cover the taxes related to those transactions. That was following a Twitter poll last month when he asked followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric carmaker, whose shares have rocketed more than 2,300% over the past five years.A report by ProPublica in June said Musk paid little income tax relative to his outsize wealth. But he’s pushed back against that characterization, saying he doesn’t draw a salary from either SpaceX or Tesla, and pays an effective tax rate of 53% on stock options he exercises. He added that he expects that tax rate to increase next year.Musk earlier this month said he’ll pay more taxes than any American in history this year. That was in response to another tweet from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who used Musk’s Time Magazine “Person of the Year” accolade to call him out on his taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-he-will-pay-over-11-billion-in-taxes-this-year-101639979660710.html
20-12-2021||World||Covid-19: These 10 countries remain untouched. Know the reason and see list||It’s been two years since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) struck the world. It changed the definition of “normal” and affected almost every sector – be it travel, education or healthcare.The disease spread across the globe at an alarming pace, and kept mutating regularly to emerge in more dangerous and, in some cases, vaccine resistant form.The United States and Europe are among the worst affected regions, where the new Omicron variant has been wreaking havoc. More than 800,000 people have already been killed in the US, and the infections are still surging.But surprisingly, there are some countries have managed to stave off the coronavirus pandemic since it began in late 2019, reporting zero cases, according to the World Health Organization.Most of these countries and territories are islands in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and are likely to be experiencing the benefit of bordering only the sea.Some of the countries have also adopted strict travel policies, which helped them successfully keep the infections at bay. Two of them are being run under dictatorships, so getting an accurate data is very difficult.Though these countries have reported zero Covid-19 cases, that does not rule out the fact that some cases may have flown under the radar.Here’s a look at 10 countries which have not reported any Covid-19 cases till now:Tuvalu: This independent island in the South Pacific has stopped the coronavirus infections from reaching its shores. Though a member of the Commonwealth, Tuvalu successfully closed its borders to travel, with a mandatory quarantine in some cases. The group of three reef islands and six atolls has a combined area of 25 square kilometres. According to WHO, nearly 50 people are fully vaccinated per 100 population.Turkmenistan: The country has not acknowledged any case of the coronavirus disease, a stand that has irked the international community. The Central Asian country shares its borders with Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, and is largely covered by the Karakum desert; from one side, it also touches the Caspian Sea. A senior WHO official earlier told the BBC that it is highly unlikely that the virus is not circulating in Turkmenistan as the world has been grappling with it for two years.North Korea: Like Turkmenistan, the hermit kingdom has also not declared any Covid-19 cases. In fact, reports in a section of media claimed that the Kim Jong-un regime eliminated the known cases of the disease to keep the country virus free.Tokelau: The WHO has listed the tiny group of atolls in the South Pacific as free of Covid-19. Tokelau is a group if three atolls with a combined area of 10 square kilometres and population of 1,500. With no airport, the island near New Zealand is accessible primarily by ship.Saint Helena: It is a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. Saint Helena is considered one of the most remote regions of the world. According to WHO, total vaccine doses administered per 100 population in Saint Helena is 138.Pitcairn Islands: These are the group of four volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. According to country profile on the CIA website, the population of full-time residents at 50 and most of them reside near the village of Adamstown.Niue: This island nation is one of the world’s largest coral islands, located about 2,500 kilometres from New Zealand. Niue was supported by New Zealand in its fight against Covid-19.Nauru: It is the third-smallest country in the world by size. Nauru is a neighbouring country of Kiribati. The reason why Covid-19 has not been reported in the country is the travel restriction put in place by the local administration.Kiribati: It is located more than 3,200 kilometres southwest of Hawaii. The administration here imposed travel restrictions early on, and the arrival of a handful of flights made implementation of these norms easier, which stopped the spread of Covid-19.Micronesia: The Federation of Micronesia is made up of more than 600 islands. The country has received support from then WHO, as well as countries like the United States, China and Japan in keeping Covid-19 at bay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-these-10-countries-remain-untouched-know-the-reason-and-see-list-101639966462979.html
20-12-2021||World||Typhoon Rai: Death toll in the Philippines crosses 200||The death toll from the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year has surged to 208, the national police said Monday, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit the country in recent years.At least 239 people were injured and 52 were missing after Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago, the police tally showed.More than 300,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Rai slammed into the country on Thursday as a super typhoon.The Philippine Red Cross has reported "complete carnage" in coastal areas."Homes, hospitals, school and community buildings have been ripped to shreds," Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said earlier.The storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees, toppled concrete power poles, smashed wooden houses to pieces, and flooded villages -- sparking comparisons with Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.Haiyan, called Yolanda in the Philippines, was the deadliest cyclone on record in the country, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.One of the hardest-hit islands this time was Bohol – known for its beaches, rolling "Chocolate Hills", and tiny tarsier primates – where at least 74 people have died, provincial Governor Arthur Yap said on his official Facebook page.There has also been widespread destruction on the Siargao, Dinagat, and Mindanao islands, which bore the brunt of the storm when it slammed into the country packing wind speeds of 195 kilometers (120 miles) per hour.At least 10 people died on the Dinagat Islands, provincial information officer Jeffrey Crisostomo told AFP on Sunday.S.O.S was painted on a road in the popular tourist town of General Luna on Siargao Island, where surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, as people struggle to find water and food.Swathes of the affected areas have no communications, hampering efforts of disaster agencies to assess the full extent of the storm's damage.Electricity also has been knocked out, affecting water-refilling stations and ATMs.Thousands of military, police, coast guard, and fire personnel have been deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts.Coast guard and naval vessels carrying food, water, and medical supplies have been dispatched, while heavy machinery -- like backhoes and front-end loaders -- have been sent to help clear roads blocked by fallen power poles and trees.Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season -- most cyclones typically develop between July and October.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked among the globe's most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes, and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-death-toll-in-the-philippines-crosses-200-101639964533761.html
20-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: 'We are sitting ducks for next wave of Covid-19', says expert||The Omicron variant has been spreading fast, especially in the United States, which was already ravaged by the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is confronting another dark winter, with hospitalisations increasing 45 per cent over the last month and cases rising 40 per cent, according to a tally by news agency Reuters.Also Read | What more we know of Omicron todayAnd now, a healthcare expert has warned that people in the United States are “sitting ducks for the next wave of Covid-19”.Watch: Covid Omicron spreading 'significantly faster', says WHOAdvocating booster shots to fight Omicron, Dr Eric Topol, a cardiologist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told CNBC that Americans might not be ready for the fast-spreading variant of coronavirus.“We’re lagging behind what we need to get out to the American public,” he told CNBC last week, adding that fully vaccinated should mean three shots instead of two.“We are in Omicron land now,” he said.His comments were made days before US President Joe Biden’s top medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said that a redefinition for what it means to be fully vaccinated is certainly on the table.“There’s no doubt that optimum vaccination is with a booster,” Dr Fauci told CNBC.On Sunday, he urged unvaccinated Americans to get a shot and the vaccinated to get boosters, which have been shown to get the protection back.He also cautioned against too much optimism over Omicron's severity, noting that in South Africa, while the hospitalisation-to-case ratio is lower than with Delta, this could be due to underlying immunity from widespread previous infections."No matter how you look at it," he underscored, "when you have so many, many infections, even if it is less severe, that overcomes this slight to moderate diminution in severity."Currently, in the United States, people are considered fully vaccinated if they have received two shots of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, or a single dose of Jonson & Johnson vaccine.The Delta variant is still the dominant strain in the United States but Omicron is on its way to dethrone it and claim the position for itself. The heavily mutated variant has been shown in early data to have a worrying resistance to vaccines and higher transmissibility.Also Read | Threat of Omicron looms over Xmas holidays in Europe, USWhile a little more than 70 per cent of the US population has had at least one shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another 50 million eligible people remain unprotected.Omicron now accounts for around three per cent of cases in the United States, a figure that is expected to rise rapidly as has been seen in other countries.On Saturday, New York state announced a record number of daily cases for the second day in a row, with almost 22,000 positive results.The United States crossed the 800,000 known Covid-19 deaths last Tuesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-we-are-sitting-ducks-for-next-wave-of-covid-19-says-expert-101639958281051.html
20-12-2021||World||Pentagon documents reveal 'deeply flawed' US air war: Report||Newly obtained Pentagon documents show that the US air wars in the Middle East have been marked by "deeply flawed intelligence" and resulted in thousands of civilian deaths, including many children, the New York Times reported Saturday.It said a trove of confidential documents covering more than 1,300 reports of civilian casualties undercuts the government's portrayal of a war fought with precision bombs.Pledges of transparency and accountability, it said, had regularly fallen short."Not a single record provided includes a finding of wrongdoing or disciplinary action," the paper reported in what it said was the first of a two-part series.While several of the cases mentioned by the Times have been previously reported, it said its investigation showed that the number of civilian deaths had been "drastically undercounted," by at least several hundred.- Surveillance flaws -Among three cases cited was a July 19, 2016 bombing by US special forces of what were believed to be three Islamic State group staging areas in northern Syria. Initial reports were of 85 fighters killed. Instead, the dead were 120 farmers and other villagers.Another example was a November 2015 attack in Ramadi, Iraq after a man was seen dragging "an unknown heavy object" into an Islamic State position. The "object," a review found, was a child, who died in the strike.Poor or inadequate surveillance footage often contributed to deadly targeting failures, the report said.More recently, the United States had to retract its claim that a vehicle destroyed by a drone on a Kabul street in August had contained bombs. Victims of the strike, it turned out, were 10 members of a family, including children.Many civilian survivors of US attacks, the report says, were left with disabilities requiring expensive treatment, but condolence payments numbered fewer than a dozen.Asked for comment, Captain Bill Urban, spokesman for the US Central Command, told the Times that "even with the best technology in the world, mistakes do happen, whether based on incomplete information or misinterpretation of the information available. And we try to learn from those mistakes."We work diligently to avoid such harm. We investigate each credible instance. And we regret each loss of innocent life."- Unseen from the air -The US air campaign in the Middle East grew rapidly in the final years of former president Barack Obama's administration, as public support waned for the seemingly endless ground wars.Obama said the new approach, often using unmanned aircraft controlled from far away, represented "the most precise air campaign in history," able to keep civilian deaths to a minimum.The new technology made it possible to destroy a part of a house filled with enemy fighters while leaving the rest of the structure standing, the Pentagon said.But over a five-year period, US forces executed more than 50,000 airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the report said, with much less than the advertised precision.In compiling its report, the Times said its reporters had "visited more than 100 casualty sites and interviewed scores of surviving residents and current and former American officials."The paper obtained the Pentagon documents through Freedom of Information requests beginning in March 2017 and lawsuits filed against the Defense Department and the Central Command. A new suit seeks records from Afghanistan.Before launching air strikes, the military must navigate elaborate protocols to estimate and minimize civilian deaths.But there are several ways available intelligence can mislead, fall short, or at times lead to disastrous errors.For example, the Times said, video shot from the air does not show people in buildings, under foliage or under tarpaulins or aluminum covers.And available data can be misinterpreted, as when people running to a fresh bombing site are assumed to be militants, not would-be rescuers.Sometimes, the Times said, "Men on motorcycles moving 'in formation,' displaying the 'signature' of an imminent attack, were just men on motorcycles."Captain Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said air-war planners do their best under exceedingly difficult conditions.But he added that "in many combat situations, where targeteers face credible threat streams and do not have the luxury of time, the fog of war can lead to decisions that tragically result in civilian harm."bbk/bfm/st||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-documents-reveal-deeply-flawed-us-air-war-report-101639957431962.html
20-12-2021||World||Early results favor ex-protest leader for Chile's presidency||A millennial former student protest leader took an early lead Sunday in Chile's presidential runoff following a bruising campaign pitting him against a free-market firebrand likened to Donald Trump.With barely 13% of 46,887 polling stations reporting, Gabriel Boric had 53% of the votes, compared to 47% for his opponent, lawmaker José Antonio Kast.Kast, who has a history of defending Chile’s past military dictatorship, finished ahead in the first round of voting last month but failed to secure a majority of votes. That set up a head-to-head runoff against Boric, who finished two points behind.Whoever wins will be breaking precedent. Since the return of democracy three decades ago, no candidate leading after the first round has ever been defeated in the runoff. But no president has ever been elected without winning in the capital, Santiago, which Boric carried comfortably in the first round.Opinion polls in recent days consistently showed an advantage for Boric, although sometimes within the margin or error, meaning the contest is likely to be decided by whichever candidate is able to energize his base while at the same time winning over the majority of voters who don't side with political extremes.“Turnout will mean everything,” said Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile.The two candidates couldn't be more polar opposites.Kast, 55, a devout Roman Catholic and father of nine, emerged from the far right fringe after having won less than 8% of the vote in 2017. He rose steadily in the polls this time with a divisive discourse emphasizing conservative family values and playing on Chileans' fears that a surge in migration — from Haiti and Venezuela — is driving crime.A longtime lawmaker, he has a record of attacking Chile's LGBTQ community and advocating more restrictive abortion laws. He also accused outgoing President Sebastian Pinera, a fellow conservative, of betraying the economic legacy of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the country’s former military leader. Kast's brother, Miguel, was one of Pinochet's top advisers.Boric, 35, would become Chile’s youngest modern president. He was among several activists elected to Congress in 2014 after leading protests for higher quality education. If elected, he said, he will “bury” the neoliberal economic model left by Pinochet and raise taxes on the “super rich” to expand social services, fight inequality and boost protections of the environment.In recent days, both candidates tried to veer toward the center.“I'm not an extremist. ... I don't feel far right,” Kast proclaimed in the final stretch even as he was dogged by revelations that his German-born father had been a card-carrying member of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party.Meanwhile Boric, who is backed by a coalition of leftist parties that includes Chile's Communist Party, brought more centrist advisers onto his team and promised that any changes would be gradual and fiscally responsible.“On both sides, people are voting out of fear,” said Funk. “Neither side is particularly enthused with their candidate but they are voting out of fear that, if Kast wins, there will an authoritarian regression or because they fear Boric is too young, inexperienced and aligned with the communists.”Whoever wins is likely to have a slim mandate and will be hemmed in by a divided congress.In addition, the political rules could soon change because a newly elected convention is rewriting the country's Pinochet-era constitution. The convention — the nation's most powerful elected institution — could in theory call for new presidential elections when it concludes its work next year and if the new charter is ratified in a plebiscite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-results-favor-ex-protest-leader-for-chile-s-presidency-101639951848419.html
20-12-2021||World||Threat of Omicron looms over Xmas holidays in Europe, US||The Netherlands went into lockdown on Sunday and the possibility of more Covid-19 restrictions over the Christmas and New Year period loomed over several European countries as the Omicron coronavirus variant spreads quickly.In the United States, White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci urged people travelling over the holidays to get booster shots and always wear masks in crowded public spaces.He described Omicron as “raging through the world”, and said travelling will increase the risk of infection even among vaccinated people.US President Biden plans to speak on Tuesday on the status of the fight against Covid-19 and discuss government help for communities in need of assistance, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted.Snap lockdown begins in the NetherlandsDutch urban centres were largely deserted as the country began a snap lockdown that left people’s Christmas plans in disarray.Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the shutdown on Saturday evening, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from Sunday until at least January 14.While the Netherlands took the plunge and shut down much of public life to prevent its healthcare system from being overwhelmed by an expected surge in cases, several other European governments are considering more curbs - at a time when people are normally spending money on shopping, entertainment and travel.UK doesn’t rule out more Covid-19 restrictionsBritain reported a surge in cases of Omicron on Saturday, with 25,000 recorded so far. Government advisors said this could be the tip of the iceberg and health minister Sajid Javid declined on Sunday to rule out the chance of further Covid-19 restrictions before Christmas.Javid said the government was taking the “sobering” advice of its scientists seriously, was watching the data on an “almost hourly basis” and would balance that against the broader impact of restrictions on areas such as businesses and education.In Italy, the government is considering new measures to avoid a surge in infections during the holiday period, local newspapers reported on Sunday. After holding a meeting with ministers on December 23, Prime Minister Mario Draghi could mandate that people who have been vaccinated also show a negative test to access crowded places, including discos and stadiums, daily Corriere della Sera reported.Meanwhile, Israel’s cabinet weighed banning travel with the US, Canada and eight other countries to try to mitigate the local spread of the Omicron variant. If approved, the new restrictions will go into effect at midnight on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The highly infectious new strain is in the community transmission phase and has spurred a fifth wave of the pandemic in Israel, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told the cabinet on Sunday. There are dozens of confirmed and suspected Omicron cases in Israel, including most of 17 confirmed Covid cases aboard a recent flight from the US.Two Omicron cases in the central Chinese cityTwo new cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the central Chinese city of Changsha from arrivals into the country, the Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.The provincial capital of Hunan is the latest place to discover the highly contagious variant in incoming travellers, after the southern province of Guangdong and the northern metropolis of Tianjin reported cases earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threat-of-omicron-looms-over-xmas-holidays-in-europe-us-101639951151579.html
20-12-2021||World||Johnson appoints foreign secretary to be Brexit negotiator||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday announced the appointment of Britain's foreign secretary to become the country's lead negotiator with the European Union, after long-time ally David Frost resigned after a week political upheaval in the Conservative Party.Liz Truss will have ministerial responsibility with the EU and will lead negotiations to resolve problems arising from provisions of the Brexit agreement covering trade with Northern Ireland, the prime minister’s office said in a statement.In his resignation letter, Frost expressed concern about the government’s “current direction of travel.’’“I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change,’’ he wrote.Frost also expressed growing disillusionment with the Conservative government’s policies on taxation and Covid-19.The Mail on Sunday, which broke the story of his resignation, said Frost’s decision was triggered by last week’s introduction of new pandemic restrictions, including a requirement that people show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter nightclubs and other crowded venues.In his resignation letter to Johnson, Frost said the U.K. needed to “learn to live with Covid-19. ... You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-appoints-foreign-secretary-to-be-brexit-negotiator-101639941397045.html
20-12-2021||World||HT This Day: Dec 20, 1998 - Bill Clinton nailed on two counts of impeachment||N. C. MenonWashington- UNITED STATES House of Representatives voted this afternoon to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. Mr Clinton thus became the first elected US President to be impeached. President Andrew Jackson had also been impeached 130 years ago but he was not an elected president, having taken over after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Four articles of impeachment had been brought against Mr Clinton, two for perjury, and one each for obstruction of justice and abuse of office. The first article pertaining to giving false information to the grand jury in the Monica Lewinsky case was passed 228 to 205, with five Democrats and five Republicans crossing sides. The third article about obstruction of justice was passed, whereas the one about abuse of office failed, with a large number of Republicans voting against. The second article about perjury in the Paula Jones case was lost 205 to 229 with the same five Democrats voting for impeachment, but 27 Republicans voting against. The fact that the Paula Jones case had been thrown out of court clearly led to the feeling that perjury was harder to prove. In the event, it did not matter how the last three votes turned out since passage of the first article of impeachment was sufficient to ensure that the case will now go to the Senate for a trial. That process could take several weeks or months depending on how the Upper House decides to handle the process. Removing the President from office requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate. It is considered highly unlikely that the Republicans, with a strength of only 55 can engineer enough defections from the Democratic ranks. The Democrats made a last minute effort to introduce an amendment to consider an alternative of a censure of the President. But that was ruled out. The Democrats then walked out en bloc. On the steps of the august capital building, minority leader Dick Gephardt and minority whip Bonior expressed deep disappointment and sense of outrage at what they termed as a partisan and unfair procedure. Democratic members are scheduled to go to the White House later in the day to express their solidarity with President Clinton, who is expected to urge an end to the insidious politics of personal destruction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-dec-20-1998-bill-clinton-nailed-on-two-counts-of-impeachment-101639939029886.html

The Lakshadweep Education Department has brought out a new calendar declaring Fridays working days and all Sundays holidays for schools in the islands, ending the decades-old privilege of the students for having Fridays as holidays in the islands on religious grounds. Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal said ever since the schools were opened in islands for providing education for students some six decades ago, Friday was a holiday and Saturday up to half-day was a working day. He said this decision was taken without discussing it with any of the bodies of schools, the district panchayat or with the local MP. "Such a decision is not within the people's mandate. It is a unilateral decision of the administration", Faizal told PTI. He said whenever a change is brought into the local system, it must be discussed with the people. Official sources said the administration modified the school timings and regular school activities to ensure "optimum utilization of resources, proper engagement of learners and necessary planning of teaching learning process". P P Abbas, Vice President cum Counsellor of the Lakshadweep District Panchayat, wrote a letter to the Advisor to Administrator Praful Khoda Patel, requesting him to reconsider the order of the Education Department to address the sentiments of the students and parents. In his letter, he said that the ethnic population of Lakshadweep are Muslims and to their faith, Friday is a holiday and offering Juma Namaz on Friday is considered to be an unavoidable religious practice. He requested the administration to convene a meeting of elected representatives and other stakeholders to discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-admin-ends-decades-old-system-of-school-holiday-on-fridays-101640020158521.html

When the petitioner's counsel said that the client is illiterate and could not have approached the court, the judge said that this is no justification.The petitioner, Sultana Begum, stated that she is the rightful and legal heir of Mughal Badshah Bahadurshah Zafar II, the king of Delhi."In 1857, the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was dethroned by the British East India Company and all of his assets were taken under custody by the British East India Company illegally. In 1960, the Government of India confirms the claim of late Bedar Bakht as descendent and heir of Bahadurshah Zafar II. In 1960, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Union of India started giving pension to Bedar Bakht, husband of the petitioner. On August 15, 1980, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India started giving pensions to Sultana Begum, the current petitioner. The Government of India is giving so less as pension," the plea stated.The petitioner alleged that the Government of India is having illegal possession of the Red Fort which is the ancestral property of the petitioner and the government is not willing to give any compensation or possession of such property, which is a direct violation of the petitioner's fundamental right and constitutional right in Article 300 A as well as human rights, therefore, she begs to move the court under of the Constitution of India.Sultana Begum is the widow of Late Mirza Mohammed Bedar Bakht, great-grandson and legal and rightful heir of the last Mughal Emperor late Bahadur Shah Zafar II king of Delhi. On May 22, 1980, Mirza Muhammad Bedar Bakht died and on August 1, 1980, pension to Sultana Begum was granted by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi.The plea also sought direction to respondents to grant compensation to the petitioner from 1857 to till date for illegal possession by the Government of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-handover-of-red-fort-adequate-compensation-101640017765332.html
20-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Dec 21, 1949 - Atomic Big Six Meet Behind Closed Doors||Gen. Romulo, President of the U.N. Gen Assembly, today called the atomic ‘big six” to give first priority to studying ways of reaching an interim agreement on banning atomic bomb production.Gen. Romulo presented several suggestions to Gen. McNaughton (chairman) when representatives of Britain, China, France, Russia, the U.S.A. and Canada met for the first time today to “explore all avenues and examine concrete suggestions” in an effort to reach agreement on atomic control as decided by the General Assembly at its last session. Gen. Romulo, in a letter to Gen. McNaughton, said: “I do not feel it I advisable for me to present any precise plan at this time.” He recalled that he had previously outlined the following three possible paths for exploration: (1) A short-term “armistice” accompanied by an inspection system.(2) An interim prohibition on use of atomic weapons, with adequate safeguards. (3) Further compromise between the majority and the minority plans for atomic energy control.Gen. Romulo said he still believed “all these approaches should be seriously pursued.”But his further suggestion concerning priority for a world ban on atomic bomb production was prompted by the “frightening rate” of the atomic armaments race.In a communique after their meeting the six Powers said it had been agreed in accordance with the General Assembly’s resolution that member States would be kept informed of the progress of their discussions. Periodic reports would, therefore, be issued, including summary records of the meetings, “whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so.”The ‘communique’ said that the practice of meeting behind closed door had been found beneficial and would be continued. The six Powers after their brief sitting adjourned until January 19.In addition to Gen. Romulo’s new appeal they also had before them a letter from Mr B. N. Rau, who proposed during the Assembly’s session that the problem of control be tackled by the International Law Commission. The Indian delegate’s letter was not made public immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-21-1949-atomic-big-six-meet-behind-closed-doors-101640017948015.html

20-12-2021||India||No ‘clear evidence’ on Omicron transmissibility, Delta still variant of concern: INSACOG||The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said on Monday it does not have “clear evidence” on the transmissibility, immune evasion or severity of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in India.INSACOG, which consists of 10 central laboratories and 28 regional ones, said in its release Delta, which was the main reason for the global resurgence of Covid-19 this year, continues to be the main variant of concern. It also reiterated data is still insufficient to conclude whether the Omicron variant causes mild infection.The national multi-agency consortium of genome sequencing laboratories said it has been unable to determine, despite the presence of certain indicators, if the mild infections seen in the cases so far is due to prior infections or vaccination.“Cases have continued to increase in South Africa, with a smaller but clear rise in hospitalizations. Pending complete genomic sequencing, in the UK, S-gene target failure has shown a very rapid increase in likely Omicron cases and this would represent a significant growth advantage against Delta,” it added.Vaccine production, genomic sequencing to be ramped upUnion health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said earlier in the day India is ready to fight the Omicron spread 170 cases of the variant, which was first discovered in South Africa and is primarily responsible for the shutdowns Europe and the UK is currently facing, were reported from across the country.“The Centre is in constant and regular touch with states and experts on the matter to understand the effect of the variant on the population,” Mandaviya said.The Union health minister said India’s current capacity is 31 crore doses per month and the capacity will be increased to 45 crore doses per month in the next two months, according to news agency PTI.Laboratories conducting tests for Covid-19 have said they have the capacity to handle a higher number of samples for detection of the Omicron variant.Delhi’s main genome sequencing laboratories—Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and Lok Nayak Jaiprakash (LNJP) Hospital—will now handle all positive Covid-19 samples after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government is taking measures to further identify if the Omicron or older variants are causing the new infections.“We can handle 1,000 samples per week. Though the daily cases have increased in the last couple of days, only about the capacity of 500 samples per week is being used. So, at present, we have sufficient capacity. As the need arises, we will double it,” a person familiar with the developments at the LNJP Hospital told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-clear-evidence-on-omicron-transmissibility-delta-still-variant-of-concern-insacog-101640016843189.html

The two leaders had a telephone conversation to follow up on their discussions during Putin’s visit to India earlier this month for the annual bilateral summit. At the summit on December 6, India and Russia agreed to enhance cooperation and coordination on bilateral and multilateral issues, including trade and investment and the situation in Afghanistan. The two sides also signed nearly 30 agreements, including one for the programme for defence cooperation during 2021-31, and concluded a deal for India’s procurement of more than 600,000 AK-203 assault rifles. “Spoke with my friend, President Putin, to follow up on our discussions during his recent visit to India. We agreed on the way forward for enhancing India-Russia cooperation, including in supply of fertilizers. We also discussed recent international developments,” Modi said in a tweet. An Indian government statement said the two leaders followed up on some of the issues discussed during Putin’s visit. “The exchange today helped firm up the future course of action on these issues, including opportunities for furthering defence cooperation, cooperation in supply of fertilizers [and] enhancement of India’s engagement with the Russian Far East,” it said. “The conversation also allowed an exchange of views on international issues,” the statement said, adding that the leaders agreed to deepen bilateral cooperation and consultation and coordination at multilateral forums. A readout from the Russian side said the two leaders discussed “practical aspects of implementing the agreements reached at the talks” on December 6 and “expressed mutual intent for the further multifaceted development of relations of the special and privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India”. They also exchanged “views on issues of international stability and security, including the situation in the Asia-Pacific region”, the readout said. Putin thanked Modi for the hospitality extended to the Russian delegation during the visit to New Delhi. The two leaders congratulated each other on the upcoming New Year holidays and “agreed to intensify bilateral contacts in various spheres”, the readout added. India and Russia had also held their first 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers on the same day as the bilateral summit.

In its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which was signed with IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and IISER Delhi – the government specified the need to identify real-time sources of pollution so corrective action could be taken across the most polluting sectors on each day. Experts say once daily reports begin, this could not only indicate how successful corrective measures have been, but also which sectors require the most action in the long-term.
20-12-2021||India||Bengal govt to celebrate Christmas in all districts; BJP sees a link to Goa poll||KOLKATA: The West Bengal government will celebrate Christmas in all districts, especially in places with old churches, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Monday.“Till now our government has been celebrating Christmas only in Kolkata. We have decided to increase its ambit. I am asking all police commissariats in the districts, right from Cooch Behar to Jhargram, to organise celebrations this year. This should be done especially in places where old churches are located,” Banerjee said while inaugurating a Christmas carnival at Allen Park in South Kolkata’s Park Street on Monday evening.Banerjee made the announcement in the presence of Kolkata’s archbishop Thomas D’Souza who, while addressing the audience, congratulated the chief minister on the TMC’s victory in the recent assembly polls and credited Banerjee with maintaining religious harmony in the state.“On behalf of the Christian community I want to congratulate our beloved chief minister on your victory in May, a victory in September (the assembly by-polls) and this is the first time, I myself was privileged to vote a third time, that was yesterday (the Kolkata civic body polls) and I am sure again the victory will be there. We want to thank you for the leadership you have given to the whole state and we feel secure and safe under your leadership. This is the message of Christmas. Peace is the result of love. Truth, patience and service, not any type of communalism or division, both in words and in action,” archbishop D’Souza said in his speech.Opposition parties promptly drew a connection between the announcement and the elaborate plans of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to contest the Goa assembly elections early next year. The chief minister and her nephew, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, have already visited Goa twice. Abhishek Banerjee is scheduled to pay another visit during the year-end.Christians account for a very small proportion of Bengal’s population. According to the 2011 census, they made up for only 0.72 % of the state’s population against 70.54 % Hindus and 27.01 % Muslims.In Goa, where Bengal’s ruling TMC hopes to make inroads in next year’s state elections, Christians (25.1%) are the second-largest religious community after Hindus who account for 66.08% of the state’s population, according to the 2011 decadal headcount. Muslims follow next, at 8.33%.In her speech at the event in Kolkata on Monday, Mamata Banerjee did make references to Goa.“We will celebrate Christmas everywhere, from the Vatican to Goa and from Goa to Kolkata. I was recently talking to the Archbishop in Goa and I mentioned our St Xavier’s college,” said Banerjee.“We have to be united. We have to love all the communities, castes and creeds. Our country will be strong if unity is strong. If unity is not strong we will fall,” said Banerjee, mentioning portions from the Vedas and the national anthem.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the chief minister of double standards for electoral gains in Goa.“On one hand she is trying to appease the minority Christians but on the other, she is opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act that guarantees permanent Indian citizenship for Christians who are forced to leave Bangladesh and Pakistan because of religious persecution,” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.The TMC’s campaign in Goa is led by Luizinho Faleiro, a former chief minister, who exited the Congress in September this year to join Mamata Banerjee’s party. On Monday, another Congress lawmaker in Goa, Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, resigned from his party and reached Kolkata. TMC leaders said he will join their party this week.The TMC government has been sponsoring the celebrations at Allen Park since 2011 when Banerjee ousted the Left Front government. The carnival, an integral part of the event that continues till New Year’s Day, was, however, not held last year because of the Covid pandemic.Before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee also announced a project under which old temples, churches and mosques are protected and restored with government funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-to-celebrate-christmas-in-all-districts-bjp-sees-a-link-to-goa-polls-101640012367560.html
20-12-2021||India||Banks recovered ₹13,100 crore from assets sale of defaulters like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi: Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that banks have recovered ₹13,109.17 crore from asset sale of fugitives like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.She said this while replying to a discussion on the second batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants which was approved by the Lok Sabha amid uproar by the Opposition over various issues.The Supplementary Demands for Grants authorised the government to spend an additional ₹3.73 lakh crore during the current fiscal.The extra spending includes an infusion of over ₹62,000 crore into the company that holds residual assets and liabilities of Air India, ₹58,430 crore by way of additional fertiliser subsidy, ₹53,123 crore towards payment of pending export incentives and ₹22,039 crore to rural development ministry for transfer to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Fund.Speaking on the banks' recovery from wilful defaulters, she said that a total of ₹13,109.17 crore has been recovered from the asset sales of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi as of July 2021 as per the information provided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The latest recovery was ₹792 crore from the sale of assets belonging to Mallya and others on July 16, 2021, she added.Responding to various issues, including price rise, raised by the Opposition during the debate, she said the government is taking measures to cool down prices of edible oil and other essential commodities."We are taking measures through the EGOM (Empowered Group of Ministers) for taking care of essential goods. We will attend to the problem of edible oil price and also some of the essential edible items," she said."Public sector banks together have effected a recovery of about ₹5.49 lakh crore over the last seven financial years. So, these people who are defaulters, who have fled the country, we have got their money back and put it to the public sector banks and therefore the banks are safer today," she said.She further said that the depositors' money are safer in public sector banks.On the states' financial position, the Finance Minister said that the Centre in the first eight months of the fiscal has already transferred 86.4 per cent of what was provided in the full year 2019-20.From the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), "funds are being provided and providing an extra ₹15,000 crore for emergency COVID-19 response. The financial position of the states is also reflected in the fact that the overall cash balance of states as on November 30, 2021 was ₹3.08 lakh crore approximately, fairly comfortable positions", she said.She further said that the states are having substantial cash balance with them and there are only a few exceptions.Out of 28 states, she said, only two states are having negative cash balance.Talking about Supplementary Demands for Grants, Sitharaman said that additional expenditure is of ₹ ₹3.73 lakh crore.Of which, she said, ₹2.99 lakh crore is the additional cash outgo because of big ticket expenditure going for Air India and rise in fertilizer subsidy due to firming up of global prices."We have to ensure that the farmers don't suffer because of it (rise in global prices). And therefore, increase in the subsidy for fertiliser has been provided, which itself is accounting for ₹58,431 crore," she said.Sitharaman also said that the government has so far paid around ₹93,685 crore since 2014 for oil bonds.The government will have to pay till 2026 when oil bonds matures, she said.Quoting former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, she said, "I would like the nation to remember that issuing bonds and loading deficits on oil companies is not a permanent solution to this problem. We are only passing our burden to our children who will have to repay this debt."As per the Supplementary Demands for Grants, there would be net cash outgo of over ₹2.99 lakh crore, and ₹74,517 crore extra expenditure would be matched by savings by different ministries.As per the document, ₹62,057 crore would be given to the Civil Aviation Ministry for equity infusion in Air India Assets Holding Company (AIAHL) for repayment of past government guaranteed borrowing and past dues/liabilities of Air India.As per the supplementary demands for grants, an additional ₹2,628 crore would be given towards loans and advances to Air India for recoupment of advance from Contingency Fund of India.Besides, the Department of Food and Public Distribution would be given an additional ₹49,805 crore for meeting expenditure towards various schemes of food storage and warehousing.About ₹2,400 crore would be given to Department of Commerce for meeting expenditure towards subsidies under the 'Interest Equalisation Scheme’, and Investment under the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) scheme, among others.Another over ₹5,000 crore and over ₹4,000 crore has been earmarked for additional spending by the ministries of Defence and Home, respectively.The 2021-22 Budget had projected the government's total expenditure at ₹34.83 lakh crore. But this is expected to overshoot considering the two batches of supplementary demands for grants presented by the government so far.The government had in August received Parliament nod for net additional spending of ₹23,675 crore in the first batch of supplementary demands for grants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-recovered-rs-13-100-crore-from-assets-sale-of-defaulters-like-vijay-mallya-nirav-modi-nirmala-sitharaman-101640012002873.html

Very misleading statement. We have clearly expressed our resentment over the draft of the Delimitation Commission, the biased process of seat sharing. The party will NOT be a signatory to this report,” the NC said on Twitter.The panel, which is headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai, held its second meeting on Monday in New Delhi. After Monday’s meeting, the assembly seats rose to 43 in the Jammu region and 47 in the Kashmir region, people familiar with the developments told news agency PTI.It has also proposed reserving 16 constituencies for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.The People’s Democratic Party, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party and the People's Conference have also protested against the draft recommendations which will shape the electoral map of Jammu and Kashmir.Three Lok Sabha members of the NC with party chief Farooq Abdullah attended the commission’s second meeting for the first time along with Union minister Singh and Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jugal Kishore Sharma. The commission earlier met in February.“The associated members regardless of their party and political affiliations not only appreciated the work done by the Delimitation Commission but also committed that they would in the future also extend their cooperation for the rest of the exercise,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The panel has been formed by the Centre in order to ensure the delimitation of assembly and parliamentary constituencies in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nc-rejects-delimitation-commission-draft-report-lashes-out-at-union-minister-101640007848467.html
20-12-2021||India||Come up with concrete instructions on fate of Rohingyas in jails: Gauhati HC tells Assam govt||The Gauhati High Court has directed the Assam government to issue ‘concrete instructions’ on the fate of 12 Rohingyas lodged in two jails for the past 12 years. The division bench of justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi issued the order last week on two separate petitions filed by the Rohingyas who hail from Myanmar seeking either refugee status in India or deportation to the neighbouring nation. “Since the petitioners have been languishing in jail for a long time, this court would not expect any further delay in the actions to be taken by the state authorities and would expect that the state government would come up with concrete instructions by the next date,” the order issued on December 16 read. The court issued the directions following a request by Anita Verma, special counsel for foreigners’ tribunals in Assam, seeking two weeks by the Assam government on either to grant refugee status or deport the petitioners back to Myanmar. The matter will come up for hearing again on January 10 next year. One of the petitions was filed in 2017 by 10 Rohingyas, who belong to two related families, and are lodged in Tezpur jail in central Assam, which also houses other foreigners, for several years. The petitioners - Saidur Rahman, his wife Tahara Begum and their three children, his brother Mahmad Ulla, his wife Rumana Begum and their three children - belong to Coundang village in Buthidaung of Rakhine state of Myanmar. They were arrested for entering India in 2009 without valid documents and though they have served the sentences of 6 months imposed for illegal entry to the country, they have been languishing in jail without release. The other petition was filed in 2017 by Azizul Haque (a Rohingya from Myanmar) and Md Habib Ullah (whose nationality is yet to be ascertained)—both lodged in the Goalpara district jail, seeking deportation to Myanmar. Like the previous case, they too were arrested in 2009 for entering India illegally without valid documents and were sentenced to 6 months imprisonment but despite serving their sentences, they are still lodged in jail.

20-12-2021||India||‘Appeasement politics’: MoS Home Nityanand Rai raps Kerala govt on twin murders||Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai on Monday asked the Kerala government to ensure a fair investigation into the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party’s OBC Morcha leader Renjith Sreenivasan and said its “appeasement politics” was helping fundamentalist forces.The minister rushed to the state to pay homage to Sreenivasan who was hacked to death in his home in Alappuzha on Sunday allegedly by Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) workers. SDPI state secretary KS Shan was allegedly killed by RSS-BJP workers on Saturday night and Sreenivasan was killed in an alleged retaliatory attack, police said.“The ongoing investigation is not on the right track. We want a fair investigation and all culprits should be booked. The state government is indulging in appeasement politics which really helped fundamentalist and criminal forces,” he said after paying tributes to the slain leader. He said over 200 BJP workers were killed in the state in the past few years.He said the left front government was trying to dent the popularity of the BJP and resorted to all tricks including protecting people who were involved in the recent killings of two party leaders. Another RSS-BJP leader S Sanjith was stabbed to death two weeks back by an alleged group of SDPI activists in Palakkad. He said the union government was ready for a central agency probe into recent killings if the state was willing. When asked about the SDPI leader’s murder, he refused to comment.The back-to-back political killings within 12 hours shook the state bringing police on their toes. After the twin murder, prohibitory order (Section 144) was clamped in the district and police stepped up vigil to avert further clashes. “We have arrested two persons in connection with the murder of the SDPI leader. And we identified all who participated in the killing of the BJP leader. Both cases will be cracked in a couple of days,” said Additional Director General of Police Vijay Sakhre who is supervising the special investigation team.More than 50 persons were detained in connection with both incidents, he said. The SDPI leader’s body was buried on Sunday and Renjth Sreenivasan’s body was cremated on Monday.Shan was a businessman while Sreenivasan was a lawyer. “Please don’t orphan families in the name of politics. Brutal murder is no answer to political differences. Shan has two minor children and I heard the BJP leader’s daughters were also young. Both families have been orphaned. And this is happening in a state like Kerala. It is a shame,” said H Salim, father of the slain SDPI leader.“He was murdered before my eyes. I pleaded with them not to harm my son but I was threatened and they continued to stab him,” said the mother of Sreenivasan. He was attacked by assailants in his home in the early hours of Sunday.Reports of what is dubbed as revenge political killings often arise from North Kerala’s Kannur which witnessed over 250 murders in last three decades between (CPIM) and RSS. Known as ‘Kannur-model killings’, such eye for eye and tooth for tooth politics, which was previously confined to Kannur, started spilling over to other parts of the state. “In north Kerala parties protect killer squads and usually after every murder the accused list will be provided by respective parties helping real killers to go scot free. Unless parties disown these criminal gangs blood bath will continue. It is sad it is spreading to other areas also,” said political observer and writer Umesh Babu.

In August, BBV154 had received regulatory approval for mid- to late-stage trials. Local media had reported that the mid-stage trial has been completed.Covaxin, the company's Covid-19 vaccine already approved for emergency-use approval in the county, is administered through an injection.Coronavirus cases in India have fallen sharply since a devastating second wave earlier this year.

20-12-2021||India||Keeping up With UP | The family reconciliation that may change UP’s politics||It was the uncanniest of coincidences, perhaps the kind only Indian, and the politics of Uttar Pradesh in particular, can throw up. On December 16, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was speaking in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, and took a swipe at his foremost competitor for the top chair, Akhilesh Yadav. He attacked him with an old and practised jibe, but one that would have hurt. “We respect our elders and do not throw out our father and uncle from the party,” Aditayanath said, referring to the seemingly never-ending family feuds within the top echelons of the Samajwadi Party. What Adityanath may not have known was that on the same day, Mulayam Singh Yadav, the founder member of the Samajwadi Party was putting final touches of a script that had begun with handing over the legacy of the party to his son in 2012, but was now culminating in a long-awaited reconciliation between Akhilesh Yadav, and his uncle, the influential Shivpal Singh Yadav.

The concerns related to transgender children are addressed in different textual and training materials/manuals/modules,” she said in response to a question by Congress member of parliament Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.Social Justice Matters | On gender, the conservative backlash hits classroomsThe National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on November 6 removed the teachers’ training manual on the integration of transgender or gender non-conforming students in schools from its website following a request by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).NCPCR chairperson, Priyank Kanoongo contended the text of the manual will expose children to “unnecessary psychological trauma” and the idea of removing binaries will supposedly contradict the idea of creating an inclusive environment.NCERT’s decision to remove the manual exposed the government body to sharp criticism from a Madras high court’s justice N Anand Venkatesh on December 6. The judge described the removal of the training manual a “very shocking development” and underlined that if someone really had a grievance, “the same should have been addressed in a proper manner through proper consultation and meetings, and no one can be allowed to arm twist a state-run council into forcibly withdrawing a material that came out after a long study by a committee”.“The report of an expert body after a detailed study cannot be dumped just because a handful of persons are opposed to this very idea of recognising persons belonging to the community,” justice Venkatesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncert-trans-training-manual-removed-from-website-wasn-t-final-centre-to-ls-101640004507232.html

Therefore, I have decided to support the government,” Das said. “A decision on...joining the BJP has not been taken at this point. For now, I have decided to support the government for the sake of the development of my constituency.”Sarma said to further develop Das’s constituency, the legislator expressed his desire to work with the government. “There was no discussion on the political aspect of it. At some time later definitely he (Das) will join the party (BJP)...” He added since Das has expressed willingness to support the government, they will help him in developing Raha. “Both state BJP president Bhabesh Kalita and I will welcome him (Das)... You can surmise what that means.”Sarma said many Opposition legislators were willing to join the ruling party due to the government’s work including waiving off of loans of nearly 1.1 million people.Also Read: Assam: 320 SI posts to be filled in Police Commando BattalionsCongress leader Rakibul Hussain said he was shocked and hurt by what Das has done. “It is still unclear whether he (Das) will quit Congress and join BJP... but remaining in an Opposition party and supporting the government does not make sense.”Congress lawmakers Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain resigned earlier this year to join the BJP. All India United Democratic Front lawmaker Phanidhar Talukdar also quit his party and joined the ruling party.

After taking whatever he could and misleading us till the last minute, if he could lie and cheat us, I'm sure the voters of #Curtorim will teach him a befitting lesson,” he tweeted. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Digambar Kamat tweeted that the Congress has "successfully faced many storms, floods & tsunamis". "Our functionaries have strength & mettle to defeat opportunists. Congress Party is here to form Government in 2022. I am committed to lead the @INCGoa to a thumping victory,” the former Goa CM said. Earlier this month, former Goa chief minister Ravi Naik resigned as Congress MLA. A few months back, ex-CM Luizinho Faleiro had also quit the Congress and joined the TMC, which has decided to contest the Goa Assembly polls. In the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, the Congress had won 17 seats in the House and emerged as the single largest party. But, the BJP, which had bagged 13 seats, quickly tied-up with some regional parties and independents to form government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-congress-chief-resigns-as-mla-party-s-strength-in-40-member-assembly-down-to-2-101639996128911.html

The petitioner is, accordingly, directed to be enlarged on bail on terms and conditions to be imposed by the trial court. The special leave petitions stand disposed of accordingly," the order has stated.Drabhamon Phawa was pregnant at the time of her arrest and had been in jail since February 2020.

But the Opposition parties decided to boycott the meeting as a section was sceptical about the outreach and demanded an all-party meeting instead.“This is a conspiracy to divide the Opposition. All Opposition parties are united on this issue. We have written to the government to call an all-party meeting,” Kharge said after the meeting of Opposition leaders on Monday morning.Joshi hit back saying the Opposition parties should understand that the “public is also boycotting them.”“It's a cheap statement,” Kharge said. “No party weakens with such statements. He should first accept that they made a mistake.”Kharge claimed the government’s invitation was meant to divide the Opposition as about 15-16 parties are fighting against the suspension of the Rajya Sabha members.“This divide and rule policy was perhaps given to them by the British. They have nothing to say, so they'll keep saying such things,” he added.Unfortunate and unfair, says Kharge after Centre calls 4 parties for meetingOn Sunday, Kharge wrote to Joshi terming the decision to not invite all Opposition parties as “unfair and unfortunate”.“All Opposition parties are united in the protest against the suspension of the 12 MPs. We have been requesting from the evening of November 29 itself that either the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Leader of the House Shri Piyush Goyal should call leaders of all Opposition parties for a discussion to break the stalemate,” the Congress leader said in a letter to Joshi.“This reasonable request of ours has not been agreed to, further inviting only leaders of four Opposition parties instead of inviting leaders of all Opposition parties is unfair and unfortunate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cheap-statement-kharge-on-minister-s-remarks-on-opposition-boycott-of-meeting-101639994417301.html

Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.A police official said plant workers and their relatives were among those who blocked the highway linking Chennai to India's technology hub of Bengaluru.While the nearly 70 women detained over Saturday's protest were released the following day, some of the 22 men held were arrested, added the official, who sought anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to media on the issue.Most of Foxconn's workers in India are women.In December last year, thousands of contract workers at a factory owned by Apple supplier Wistron Corp destroyed equipment and vehicles over the alleged non-payment of wages, causing damages estimated at $60 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dozens-released-after-protest-at-chennai-foxconn-plant-101639992154960.html

20-12-2021||India||Maha minister says ‘roads in my constituency like Hema Malini’s cheeks’, apologises||Maharashtra minister Gulabrao Patil recently compared the smoothness of roads in his Assembly constituency Jalgaon district to actor-turned-politician Hema Malini's cheeks. The minister later apologised for the remark.The senior Shiv Sena leader reportedly made the remark during an election meeting, a clip of which has since been under circulation on social media platforms.Addressing a meeting for the Bodwad Nagar Panchayat polls in the north Maharashtra district, Patil was heard asking his opponents to visit his constituency to check for themselves the quality of roads there and soon after, dragged the veteran Bollywood actor and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP to apparently come up with a more concrete conclusion of his statement."Those who have been MLAs for 30 years should come to my constituency and see the roads. If they are not like Hema Malini's cheeks, then I will resign," the water supply and sanitation minister said. Patil’s remarks were reportedly at former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who was an MLA from Jalgaon for several years.The chairperson of the Maharashtra State Commission for Women, Rupali Chakankar, then warned Patil of legal action if he did not tender an apology, following which the minister tendered an apology."I did not mean to hurt anybody. I apologise for the comments. I belong to the Shiv Sena that idolises Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Party founder Balasaheb Thackeray has taught us to respect women," the minister told reporters in Dhule.Last week, a Karnataka Congress MLA made a similar remark while describing a particular situation in the legislative assembly. After facing widespread condemnation for his comment “when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it”, senior Congress legislator KR Ramesh Kumar, also a former speaker, apologised in the House. He said, “People have given their verdict and accordingly I am begging for their pardon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-minister-says-roads-to-my-constituency-like-hema-malini-s-cheeks-apologises-101639979254479.html
20-12-2021||India||Omicron impact: Events across India face the brunt||New DelhiJust when the offline events’ scene in the country had started getting back on its feet, the rising number of cases of the Omicron variant has become a cause of worry, again. Leaving music aficionados high and dry at the last minute, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently issued orders to cancel Punjabi singer AP Dhillon’s concert, which was scheduled for December 18 in Delhi’s Aerocity. The cancellation order pointed out that the music show was “expecting 400-500 guests for the evening” and went on to cite an order that “prohibits all social/political/sports/entertainment cultural/religious/festival related rings and congregations throughout NCT of Delhi” from December 16 to January 1. In response, Dhillon — who recently faced an FIR over violation of Covid-19 norms after a Mumbai concert — shared on Instagram: “Delhi, I love you! Tonight’s cancellation was totally out of our control. We want nothing more than to come back and perform for you soon.” When contacted, the organiser of the concert, Naresh Madan, told us: “We will be doing it (the concert) once the things get better and Covid protocols are removed. We are not doing it as of now... As for yesterday, we were only using 25% of our capacity, which is less than 50% also, and we had kept limited numbers to come and attend that opening. So the issue was not that. We cancelled it because we wanted to follow the DDMA guidelines, and thought we should not go ahead with the event at this point. I hope the government will ensure no other people are calling artists and everyone is taking precautions for Covid.”But this isn’t the only event that has faced the brunt of rising cases of Omicron in the country. A steady surge in concerts and other events getting cancelled or postponed, is being reported from across the country. Earlier this month, the North East Festival, which was scheduled to be held from December 10-12 in Delhi’s Talkotara Stadium, was postponed to January, in accordance with the new SOPs issued on December 1. Shyamkanu Mahanta, organiser of the fest, says, “It’s a big celebration for people from the Northeast. But as responsible citizens, we decided to postpone the festival that was planned to take place in December. All flight tickets were booked and vendors were paid and we lost a lot of money. We are monitoring the situation and talking to officials while planning to do it in an open ground in JLN Stadium in January. If Omicron remains a threat, we’d reduce the concert components, and focus on exhibitions and business meets. If the situations goes extremely bad, going virtual is also an option.” Even the Auto Expo in Greater Noida will miss its edition this year. Rajesh Menon, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), says, “There is uncertainty around how Covid -19 would develop in the coming months and at the same time organising Auto Expo would need a lead time of preferably a year. The magnitude of the risk of spread of infection is extremely high in a B2C show like Auto Expo which is visited by large crowds and maintaining social distancing would be difficult. It has therefore been decided to postpone the Auto Expo – The Motor Show for now. The exact date for the next edition of Auto Expo – The Motor Show would be finalised later this year keeping in view the Covid situation and in alignment with the OICA Calendar of global Auto shows.”Similar restrictions in Mumbai, placed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on December 18 has spurred cancellation of events in the city. The curbs are on public gatherings and functions during the Christmas and New Year period. Mumbai Half Marathon is one such event that has been denied permission. The organisers issued a statement that read: “Despite our best efforts with all necessary permission from the police authorities and assurance of a safe and well managed event, we had to cancel the event per BMC last minute order.” And Farida Heera, a Mumbai-based commented on social media: “I feel little disappointed as I was all excited to run for the live event, but nothing is in our hands in the current situation.”According to Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association, the Women’s Tennis World Tour events in Navi Mumbai and Pune will be held without audience and within bio bubbles, for both players and officials. And In Goa, December concerts and festivals remain muted as well. The Sunburn Festival was earlier denied permission by the Goa government, and will now see the organisers hold it at a small scale. But the annual Serendipity Arts Festival in Panaji, will not have its physical edition this year as well. Smriti Rajgarhia, director, Serendipity Arts Foundation & Festival, says, “We are taking all possible caution and are still assessing the situation. The foundation has much in store for 2022, which hopefully will be a better year for everyone.” (Inputs by Anjuri Nayar Singh)Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-impact-events-across-india-face-the-brunt-101639980269871.html

At a meeting attended by all opposition parties barring the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to decide on the government’s invitation to five political parties for talks, the participants concluded that the invitation to just five of them was an attempt to divide them.“We refused to attend the meeting (called by the government). We saw it as a ploy to divide the Opposition,” said Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Binoy Viswam, who was among the leaders invited for the meeting convened by the government.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi invited leaders of the Congress, Shiv Sena, TMC, Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M), and CPI for the meeting.Twelve Rajya Sabha Members of Parliament (MPs) of these parties were suspended for the ongoing Winter Session of the House and triggered the logjamMallikarjun Kharge, the Opposition leader in Rajya Sabha, on Sunday wrote a letter to Joshi calling the decision to invite just five parties “unfair and unfortunate”.“All opposition parties are united in the protest against the suspension of the 12 MPs. We have been requesting from the evening of November 29 itself that either the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Leader of the House Piyush Goyal should call leaders of all Opposition parties for discussion to break the stalemate,” he wrote.“This reasonable request of ours has not been agreed to, further inviting only leaders of four Opposition parties instead of inviting leaders of all Opposition parties in unfair and unfortunate.” HT has seen a copy of the letter.On November 29, when the Winter Session started, six Congress lawmakers, two each from the TMC and Shiv Sena, and one each from the CPI (M) and CPI were suspended for their “unprecedented” acts of “misconduct” and “violent behaviour” during the Parliament’s Monsoon Session in August.The opposition parties met at 9.45 am on Monday at Kharge’s office and took the decision to boycott the government’s meeting.
20-12-2021||India||4-day work-week, change in salary: India's new labour codes likely in FY 2022-23||India is likely to implement four new labour codes on wages, social security, industrial relations, and occupational safety by the next fiscal year beginning 2022, according to a senior government official cited by the PTI news agency. Under these new codes, a number of aspects related to employment and work culture, in general, might change – including the take-home salary of employees, working hours, and the number of weekdays.If the new labour codes are implemented, there's a likelihood that employees in India may be able to enjoy a four-day workweek from next year, as opposed to the current five-day workweek. In that case, however, employees will have to work for 12 hours on those four days since the labour ministry has made it clear that even if the proposal comes through, the 48-hour weekly work requirement has to be met.The labour codes also attain added significance in light of the fact that once these are implemented, there would be a reduction in the take-home pay of employees and firms will have to bear a higher provident fund liability.Less take-home salary, more PFAccording to experts who are assessing the proposed labour codes, the new laws will bring about a major change in the way employees calculate their basic pay and the provident fund (PF). Under these new codes, the contribution of employees to their PF account every month will increase but the monthly in-hand salary would get reduced, in turn.The regulations restrict allowances to 50 per cent, which implies that half of the salary would be basic wages and contribution to provident fund is calculated as a percentage of basic wage that involves the basic pay and dearness allowance (DA).Under the current labour regulations, the employer's percentage-based contribution towards the PF balance depends on the employee's basic pay and dearness allowance. Say, if an employee's salary is ₹50,000 per month, their basic pay could be ₹25,000 and the remaining ₹25,000 might go into allowances. However, if this basic pay is increased, more PF will be deducted, thus decreasing the in-hand salary and hiking the contribution of the employer/company.Labour codes finalised, likely to be implemented next fiscalThe central government has already finalised the rules under the four labour codes and now states are required to frame regulations on their part as labour is a concurrent subject. “The four labour codes are likely to be implemented in the next financial year of 2022-23 as a large number of states have finalised draft rules on these,” the senior government official was quoted by PTI as saying. “The Centre has completed the process of finalising the draft rules on these codes in February 2021. But since labour is a concurrent subject, the Centre wants the states to implement these as well in one go.”At least 13 states have pre-published draft rulesAt least 13 states have pre-published draft rules on these laws, the official said.Union labour minister Bhupender Yadav, too, had said in a reply to the Rajya Sabha earlier this week that the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code is the only code on which the least number of 13 states have pre-published the draft rules.The highest number of draft notifications are pre-published on The Code on Wages by 24 states/UTs followed by The Industrial Relations Code (by 20 states) and The Code on Social Security (18) states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4day-work-week-change-in-salary-india-s-new-labour-codes-likely-in-fy-202223-101639970476730.html

20-12-2021||India||Elgar Parishad case: Poet-activist Varavara Rao likely to return to jail today||Poet Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case, is likely to return to jail on Monday after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said his health condition is stable and hence he must surrender before the prison. The 83-year-old activist is out on interim bail since February this year. He was medically examined earlier this month.On December 17, NIA counsel Sandesh Patil told a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and S V Kotwal in Bombay High Court that Rao had been medically examined by a panel of doctors at the private Nanavati Hospital in the city and the doctors were of the opinion that he does not need continuous medical attention or hospitalisation at present. "His health condition is stable now and the time granted via medical bail to him by this court is already over. So he (Rao) should surrender now. All other issues (raised by Rao's lawyers) can be examined after that," Patil told the high court.Rao was lodged in Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai before being granted bail on medical grounds for six months in February. He was due to surrender on September 5 this year but the bail period was extended multiple times due to medical care."Currently he has minor symptoms, such as lack of sleep and slight exhaustion. His vital parameters are in normal range. The remaining clinical examination reveals no significant abnormalities," according to the document submitted by the NIA to court.The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at an event in Pune on December 31 in 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial. The prosecution claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.The NIA has laid down 17 charges against 15 accused, including human rights and civil rights activists, and wants them to be charged under various sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It has alleged that the accused persons were active members of the banned terror outfit CPI (Maoist).The arrested accused in the case include activists and academicians Sudha Bharadwaj (who later got bail), Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao, Hany Babu, Anand Teltumbde, Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha and others. Elderly tribal rights activist and an accused in the case, Stan Swamy, passed away in custody on July 5 this year after suffering a cardiac arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-poet-activist-varavara-rao-likely-to-return-to-jail-today-101639967764841.html
20-12-2021||India||‘After Ayodhya-Kashi…’: Hema Malini calls for grand Krishna temple in Mathura||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Hema Malini on Sunday expressed hope that after Ayodhya and Kashi, her Parliamentary constituency of Mathura will also get a grand temple along the lines of those in other temple towns. The Lok Sabha MP referred to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, which was recently inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and said that the temple in Mathura could be beautified similarly in a grand manner.Also Read | Amid Mathura-Kashi temple row, BJP MP pitches for Places of Worship Act’s repealTalking to media persons in Indore, the actor-turned-politician said, “After the restoration of Ram Janmabhoomi and Kashi, naturally Mathura is also very important.”Hema, who had come to Indore to attend an event, said she will be visiting Kashi on Monday to keep an invitation. “Being the MP of Mathura, which is the birthplace of Lord Krishan who is the symbol of love and affection, I will say that there should be a grand temple,” she said, speaking on the development of a major temple in the sacred town. “A temple is already there and can be beautified like Modi-ji [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] developed Kashi Vishwanath corridor and the river Ganga can be seen directly from the temple.”Reflecting on the renovation and redevelopment work of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor, Hema Malini said, "This change was very difficult. This shows his [Prime Minister Modi's] farsightedness. This will also happen in Mathura.”Also Read | After deputy CM, Uttar Pradesh minister calls for new temple in MathuraIn ancient Hindu texts, the city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. He is believed to have been born at the Krisha Janmasthan temple complex - a set of temples built at a location in the city. The Kesava Deo temple, in particular, was built in ancient times upon an underground prison where the Hindu deity was supposedly born; it's also here that Janmashtami, the festival on the occasion of Lord Krishna's birthday, is celebrated in a majestic manner each year.The central government has included Mathura as one of the heritage cities for the National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) – along with others like Ajmer, Puri, Varanasi, Vellore, Dwarka, and Gaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ayodhya-kashi-hema-malini-calls-for-grand-krishna-temple-in-mathura-101639965111384.html
20-12-2021||India||Bill seeking to link electoral rolls with Aadhaar listed for introduction in LS||A bill on electoral reforms which seeks to link electoral rolls with the Aadhaar ecosystem to weed out duplicacy is listed for introduction in Lok Sabha on Monday.The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 seeks to allow electoral registration officers to seek Aadhaar number of people who want to register as voters "for the purpose of establishing the identity".It also seeks to allow the electoral registration officers to ask for Aadhaar numbers from “persons already included in the electoral roll for the purposes of authentication of entries in the electoral roll, and to identify registration of the name of the same person in the electoral roll of more than one constituency or more than once in the same constituency”.At the same time, the amendment bill makes it clear that “no application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll shall be denied and no entries in the electoral roll shall be deleted for the inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed”.Such people will be allowed to furnish other alternative documents as may be prescribed.According to the bill circulated to Lok Sabha members ahead of its introduction, various sections of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and 1951 will be amended.The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the bill states that Section 23 of the RP Act, 1950 will be amended to allow linking of electoral roll data with the Aadhaar ecosystem "to curb the menace of multiple enrolments of the same person in different places".Amendment to section 14 of the RP Act, 1950 will allow having four “qualifying” dates for eligible people to register as voters.As of now, January 1 of every year is the sole qualifying date.People who turn 18 on or before January 1 can register as voters. Those turning 18 after that have to wait for one whole year to register as voters.Now, “the 1st day of January, 1st day of April, 1st day of July, and 1st day of October in a calendar year” will be the qualifying dates in relation to the preparation or revision of electoral rolls.Amendment to section 20 of the RP Act, 1950 and section 60 of the RP Act, 1951 will allow the elections to become gender-neutral for service voters.The amendment will also help replace the word "wife" with the word "spouse" making the statutes “gender-neutral”.An Armyman's wife is entitled to be enrolled as a service voter, but a woman Army officer's husband is not, according to provisions in the electoral law. With "wife" being replaced by the term “spouse”, this will change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-seeking-to-link-electoral-rolls-with-aadhaar-listed-for-introduction-in-ls-101639962289308.html

The commission had also said that physical classes for students up to class 5 can begin from December 27.Every year in Delhi, air quality plummets to hazardous levels with the onset of winters due to stubble burnings, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city and other industries, as well as open garbage burning and dust.This year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in and around the city has worsened to 470-499 on a scale of 500, according to federal pollution control board data. That level of pollution means the air will seriously impact people with existing diseases and even those who have healthier lungs.A study conducted by the Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago, over a period of two years has revealed that Delhi's indoor pollution levels are also worryingly high and way above WHO limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-pollution-restrictions-on-construction-activities-likely-to-be-eased-101639961233824.html

The ministry clarified that this is merely the first stage of implementation of the protocol, and after stabilising the system and ensuring that passengers do not face any major hassle in pre-booking, the rule might be extended to other airports, too.The real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is usually considered one of the most accurate laboratory methods yet for detecting, tracking, and studying the presence of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-causing SARS-Cov-2 virus in an individual. Airports in India have been conducting both rapid and regular RT-PCR tests, sometimes handling up to 15,000 samples a day, and the results of each might take anywhere from one hour to eight hours.How to pre-book RT-PCR tests at airports in India?Here's how visitors can pre-book slots online for their respective RT-PCR tests at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Kolkata's Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, or otherwise:1. Visit the official website for the international airport of the city you are travelling to. For convenience, here are the ones for Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.2.

The testing facility is available for everyone travelling to or via the IGI airport.Additionally, passengers have the option to reschedule their appointment or cancel the booking altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-threat-pre-booking-rt-pcr-mandatory-at-these-6-airports-from-today-here-s-how-to-do-it-101639957923028.html
20-12-2021||India||India, Central Asian nations vow to fight Afghanistan terror||India and the five Central Asian states on Sunday pushed for concerted action against all terror groups, saying Afghanistan’s soil must not be used for planning terror attacks, even as they pledged to provide immediate humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.The fallout of the Taliban takeover of Kabul on regional security, post-pandemic recovery and measures to boost regional connectivity and trade were in focus as foreign ministers of India and the Central Asian states held their third dialogue in the Capital.India welcomed the interest shown by the Central Asian states in using Shahid Beheshti terminal at Iran’s Chabahar port, which is operated by an Indian company, for trade with India and beyond, according to a joint statement. All the sides agreed to develop the transit and transport potential of their countries, improve the regional logistics network and promote joint initiatives to create new transport corridors.Also read | 'Afghanistan heading for chaos': Pak PM Imran Khan wants US to 'delink' TalibanExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar set the stage for the discussions, saying in his televised opening remarks that India and the Central Asian states have similar concerns and objectives in Afghanistan, including the formation of a truly inclusive government, the fight against terror and drug trafficking, ensuring unhindered humanitarian aid, and preserving the rights of women, children and minorities.“We must find ways of helping the people of Afghanistan,” Jaishankar said.Uzbekistan foreign minister Abdulaziz Kamilov, in his opening remarks, pointed to the “challenging situation” in Afghanistan” and spoke of the “need to develop a unified and coordinated approach towards this country”.With leaders of the Central Asian states expected to be chief guests at next year’s Republic Day celebrations, Turkmenistan’s foreign minister Rashid Meredov said Sunday’s meeting will be a “key event in the preparation process for the upcoming Central Asia-India Summit in January”.The positions taken on Afghanistan, terrorism and connectivity in the joint statement hewed closely to India’s stance on these matters, including the need to ensure transparency, financial sustainability and sovereignty in connectivity projects against the backdrop of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, people familiar with developments said.While discussing the situation in Afghanistan and its impact on the region, the ministers supported a peaceful and stable Afghanistan and emphasised respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs, the joint statement said.The ministers pointed to the importance of UN Security Council Resolution 2593, which “unequivocally demands that Afghan territory not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts and called for concerted action against all terrorist groups”.They discussed the current humanitarian situation and “decided to continue to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people”.The ministers condemned all forms of terrorism and opposed “providing safe haven, using terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism, terror financing, arms and drugs trafficking, dissemination of a radical ideology and abuse of cyber space to spread disinformation and incite violence,” the joint statement said.The ministers said perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts must be brought to justice in accordance with principle of “extradite or prosecute”. They called on the world community to implement relevant UN resolutions, global counter-terrorism strategy and Financial Action Task Force standards.These aspects of the joint statement were seen as a tacit acknowledgement of India’s concerns about terrorism emanating from Pakistan, the people said, requesting anonymity.In the field of connectivity, the ministers sought optimum use of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and stressed that “connectivity initiatives should be based on the principles of transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”.While welcoming the proposal to include Chabahar port within the framework of INSTC, they expressed interest in cooperating on the development and strengthening of connectivity in Central and South Asia. All the countries agreed to explore the possibility of establishing joint working groups to address the free movements of goods and services between India and the Central Asian states.All the countries are currently discussing the use of a $1 billion line of credit announced by India last year for infrastructure projects in Central Asia, and the ministers asked senior officials to make efforts for early progress on this issue.In the field of post-pandemic recovery, all the countries stressed the importance of extensive vaccination and called for cooperation through sharing of vaccine doses, transfer of technology, development of local production capacities, promotion of supply chains for medical products, and ensuring price transparency.The ministers also backed the gradual restoration of tourism and business ties between India and the Central Asian countries. The foreign ministers of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan welcomed the mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates between India and their countries, while the ministers of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan sought early mutual recognition of certificates.India hosted the third edition of the dialogue, which began in 2019. This year’s event was joined by the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, who skipped a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Afghanistan hosted by Pakistan on Sunday. All the Central Asian states are members of the OIC and were represented at the meet in Islamabad by deputy foreign ministers or other ministers.Most of the Central Asian foreign ministers spoke of the need to build on the historical and cultural ties of their region with India and highlighted the potential for cooperation in areas such as connectivity, transport, transit and energy. They referred to the importance of security cooperation between Central Asia and India.Jaishankar sought a collective response to challenges facing the region, including the impact of Covid-19 on global health and economy, and said the pandemic had changed supply chains and governance. It also highlighted the inadequacy of existing multilateral structures to meet new and emerging threats, he saidWith India and Central Asia facing the test of rebuilding their economies, he said, “But together we can do this better and India, I assure you, will be your steadfast partner.”“We already have a good history of cooperation,” he said. “But my message to you today is a readiness to take it to the next level. Our ties must now focus around 4Cs – commerce, capacity enhancement, connectivity and contacts.”

20-12-2021||India||In run-up to polls, Akhilesh accuses Yogi Adityanath govt of tapping phones of SP leaders||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh of tapping the phones of SP leaders.In particular, Yadav charged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath with “listening to phone conversations of SP leaders, every evening, from the phones tapped by some UP police officers”.Akhilesh made the allegations at a press conference at the party’s state headquarters in Lucknow. “The ‘un-upyogi (useless)’ BJP government listens to all our phone calls. All the SP office phones and the mobile phones of all those associated with us are being listened to. The chief minister, every evening, himself listens to the recording of the phone conversations taken to him by the officers. If this chief minister works 24 hours a day, what else does he do? Work generally finishes by the evening,” he said.When asked on whose instructions he thought the officers were getting phones tapped, Akhilesh said: “Un-upyogi Sarkar (BJP government) and un-upyogi mukhya mantri (chief minister).”The former chief minister also said that on returning to power, his government will “turn the bulldozers (act against) such police officers. Some people are engaged in keeping him (the CM) happy during his last days in power.”Akhilesh said that the fear of imminent defeat in the 2022 UP assembly polls was nagging the BJP.“The fear of defeat first spurred the BJP to bring in big leaders, Union ministers in UP (for campaigning), then it started using central agencies against the SP leaders. They have brought in the income-tax department and will bring in ED, CBI and other agencies in the days to come. The BJP government at the Centre had been using these tactics in the non-BJP ruled states to win power. In UP, they are using it to try to prevent the SP from returning to power,” he alleged.When asked if he would complain about it at an appropriate forum, Akhilesh said: “No, we will not go anywhere. We will simply oust this government. People are restive to oust this government and bring the SP back to power. They are eagerly waiting for the poll notification and the voting dates.”On Saturday’s income-tax raids on some SP leaders, Akhilesh said: “If this government thinks that the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will halt because of I-T raids, then it’s mistaken. The raids have proved that the SP is coming to power. Vijay Rath will stop only when people install the SP government.”Akhilesh Yadav’s Vijay Yatra has completed seven phases so far. During the yatra, the SP chief has been campaigning from a motorised rath (bus). The eighth phase of the yatra will begin on Tuesday and cover the distance from Mainpur to Etah.He referred to the chief minister and BJP government as “un-upyogi mukhyamatri” and “un-upyogi sarkar” at least a hundred times in the 55-minute press conference.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after laying the foundation stone of the Ganga Expressway in Shahjahanpur, had used the new coinage UPYogi or “UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi” to praise Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for “eliminating” mafias and undertaking a lot of developmental work in the state.Rajiv Rai, one of the SP leaders whose houses/establishments were raided by the income-tax department on Saturday, shared the dais with Akhilesh at the press conference. Rai, who is also a spokesperson for the SP, said: “I, for last 20 years, had been filing all the relevant papers with the income tax department. Why did the department not do any procedural thing then? It’s obvious they are trying to intimidate us, scare us. But we are Samajwadis (socialists) and can’t be scared.”Hours after the raids began, Akhilesh Yadav, at a press conference in Rae Bareli on Saturday had attacked the BJP government and said, “Now, the Income-Tax department has jumped into the election fray.”
20-12-2021||India||Delhi logs 107 infections, 1 death as positivity rate stands at 0.17%||Delhi recorded over 100 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the first time in nearly six months on Sunday, as state authorities added 107 infections to the state’s tally, with experts urging residents to exercise caution and up their guard amid concerns over the Omicron variant.The Capital recorded one Covid-19 death in Sunday’s bulletin, the first fatality in 11 days and the third so far this month. The test positivity rate also climbed to 0.17%, the highest in 180 days.Meanwhile, a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday where the city’s infection situation will be reviewed, especially in light of the 22 Omicron variant cases that have been recorded in the Capital so far.The city last reported at least 100 cases on June 29, showed state health documents, when Delhi logged 101 Covid-19 infections. However, the city last added more cases on June 25, when the health department added 115 infections. The test positivity rate last exceeded Sunday’s figure on June 22, when the number touched 0.20%.Between mid-May and June, the city’s fourth wave of infections was subsiding after a record spiral of cases and deaths.In the nearly six months since then, the city’s Covid-19 daily caseload has been in the double-digits and at record lows – largely due to widespread antibody prevalence after the fourth wave of infections as well as a strong rate of vaccinations.To be sure, Delhi’s seven-day average of cases is still on the lower end of the spectrum, with the city adding an average of 68 fresh cases every day over the past week, according to numbers from the state government’s records.The vaccine coverage in the city too has been widespread, with most of the city’s adults covered with the first dose, of whom over 10 million have been completely inoculated, showed data from the central CoWin dashboard.Experts, however, said residents should be vigilant to prevent a resurgence of the infection.Dr SP Byotra, senior consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and chairman of its department of medicine, said: “People should be vigilant about distancing and masking in public places, otherwise the city may once again see a rise in the number of cases around February.”However, Dr Byotra said that since a large number of the city’s residents are now vaccinated, unlike during the second wave, the symptoms of infections may be milder.“Irrespective of whether the cases belong to Delta or Omicron variants, we should ensure that discipline in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour is observed and no laxity is allowed,” he added.The Delhi government’s spokesperson did not comment on the rise in Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, the DDMA meeting on Monday will be held through video conferencing and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal will preside over the meeting.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is the DDMA vice-chair, and will also be present at the meetingThe authority will discuss the increasing number of Omicron cases in Delhi and the current Covid-19 situation will be reviewed in the meeting, as per the notification.State health minister Satyendar Jain, NITI Aayog member VK Paul and Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev and other senior officers of the state’s health department will be present in the meeting.(With inputs from Paras Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-logs-107-infections-1-death-as-positivity-rate-stands-at-017-101639942141580.html
20-12-2021||India||Sporadic violence, low turnout mark Kolkata civic body polls; BJP, Left announce agitation||A crude bomb explosion that left three men injured, rampage inside at least two polling booths and more than a dozen sporadic clashes marked elections to the 144 seats in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Sunday even as chief minister Mamata Banerjee said “voters celebrated the festival of democracy” while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left declared state-wide agitations from Monday. A low turnout of 64% and absence of central paramilitary police force (CAPF) were salient features of the polling during which Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidates and workers were seen engaging in quarrels and fisticuffs with their counterparts from the BJP, Congress and the Left. At least five candidates were hospitalized in the evening. Calling Mamata Banerjee a dictator and the state election commissioner S K Das “spineless,” leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, demanded a re-poll late in the evening. He alleged that police tried to confine him and a host of legislators and an MP to his residence in the Salt Lake Township which is not part of Kolkata. “We were allowed to leave after the polls. A bureaucrat shoved me as well. I will not accept this,” he said. Two crude bombs went off near Khanna cinema hall in central Kolkata in the morning but nobody was injured. However, three men were hurt when another bomb went off near the polling station at Taki Boy’s School. While the political parties accused each other of ferrying in outsiders to create trouble police arrested a man for the second bomb attack. “We have also identified his associates but the names cannot be disclosed. As many as 72 people were arrested in the city till 2 pm. The polling was overall peaceful. Police took prompt action. None of the 4,559 polling booths in the city were left unguarded. The state election commission (SEC) also received complaints and forwarded these to us. We have filed action-taken reports,” said Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint commissioner of police (headquarters) Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were clamped within 100 metres of all polling stations. More than 23,500 policemen were deployed on Sunday. Of the 144 civic wards, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) currently controls 126. “The presiding officers in all polling booths became silent spectators when our agents were driven out. The TMC showed how low its confidence is even after winning 213 of the state’s 294 assembly seats six months ago,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. “The Kolkata Police has proved that it is an organ of the ruling party and not a law enforcement agency. We will stage agitations across Bengal,” Bhattacharya added. The CPI(M), too, announced a two-day agitation. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee dismissed the allegations and said strong action will be taken if any TMC worker is found to be involved in violence and electoral malpractice. “The TMC cannot do anything if the BJP does not have the organisational strength to deploy polling agents. The polls were held peacefully barring some stray incidents. If the media has any photo or video footage, showing our workers involved in any incident, please make it public. Our party will give them exemplary punishment and so will the administration,” Banerjee said. Complaints poured in even when polling was coming to a close. The BJP alleged that Kolkata Police did not allow eight of its legislators to leave the government’s MLA Hostel near Park Street by locking the main gate. The BJP also alleged that policemen were deployed outside Adhikari’s Salt Lake residence. “The policemen could not show any official order that said BJP MLAs and MPs should be restrained till 5 pm. They only said they had instructions,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. Minister Firhad Hakim dismissed the allegation. “This is a drama staged by the BJP. Can the police dare to stop the movement of legislators?” said Hakim. The MLAs were allowed to leave the hostel after the polls were over at 5 pm. Adhikari was also allowed to leave his home but he got into an altercation with the police. In the afternoon, BJP leader Meena Devi Purohit, who has won from ward No 22 thrice since 2005, alleged that she and her followers were attacked by TMC supporters. She alleged that her son-in-law and the latter’s brother were assaulted as well. Opposition parties alleged that TMC workers ransacked a polling booth in ward no 23. Polling was stalled at a booth in ward no 22 where the polling agent of the Congress was found with bleeding injuries. Congress and TMC workers clashed near Marwari Vidyalaya in the business district of Burrabazar. The counting monitor of an electronic voting machine (EVM) was thrown on the ground, SEC officials said. The SEC installed security cameras inside all polling booths, counting centres and facilities to be used for storing around 6500 EVMs following an order passed by the Calcutta high court. Adhikari alleged that most of the cameras were deactivated. “Let a central agency conduct a probe,” he said. The BJP had moved the high court seeking deployment of CAPF. It cited the alleged killings after the March-April assembly polls. The petition was however rejected by a single bench and the division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj. The party challenged the order in the Supreme Court but no hearing was held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sporadic-violence-low-turnout-mark-kolkata-civic-body-polls-bjp-left-announce-agitation-101639941564019.html
20-12-2021||India||55 TN fishermen held, 8 boats seized by SL Navy; CM urges Centre to act||As many as 55 Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested and 8 boats seized by Sri Lankan Naval personnel on Sunday following which Chief Minister M K Stalin took up the matter with the Centre to secure their release and all the 73 boats captured so far by the neighbouring country.Stalin spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar over phone and requested him to take immediate steps to get the over 50 fishermen and their 8 boats released from Sri Lanka.“The Union Minister assured immediate action,” an official release said. Stalin, writing to Jaishankar, took up the issue of continuing harassment of fishermen at the hands of Lankan Naval personnel. A total of 73 boats, including the 8 seized now, is being held by Lankan authorities, the CM said, urging action. The official here said that soon after the apprehension of 43 fishermen and seizure of 6 boats from Rameswaram, 12 other fishers of Mandapam area were also subsequently taken into custody. Two boats of Mandapam fishermen were also seized, he said.Demanding their immediate release, the fishermen association here said it would stage a protest on Monday and announced launch of an ‘indefinite strike’ as well.Stalin, in a letter to Jaishankar said he was saddened over the continuing arrest and harassment of Tamil Nadu fishermen by Lankan Navy at an ‘alarming frequency’ despite the state government taking up the issue with the central government. “I would also like to point out that, in the year 2021 itself there were 19 incidents of apprehension and attack of Tamil Nadu fishermen,” the CM said.Though the fishermen were released, fishing boats, the source of livelihood for them, are still detained by authorities of the island nation. “Further, during the same period, there were two instances of attacks and five fishermen were killed,” Stalin noted.The repeated attempts by the Lankan Navy to prevent Indian fishermen from exercising their traditional fishing rights through ‘intimidatory tactics’ must not be allowed to continue further, he added.Urging concerted action by the Centre to address this ‘festering’ issue, he sought the External Affairs Minister’s intervention to secure the immediate release of 55 fishermen and 73 fishing boats (including boats seized in previous incidents) from Sri Lanka. Fishermen departed on December 18 from here in over 500 boats and were fishing off Katchatheevu island when 43 of them were arrested and six boats seized early on Sunday, the Fisheries department official said.Following their arrest, they were taken to Kangesanthurai camp, a fishermen association leader and authorities said.Ramanathapuram MP, K Navas Kani spoke to union ministers and urged them to take immediate steps for the release of the fishermen and their boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-tn-fishermen-held-8-boats-seized-by-sl-navy-cm-urges-centre-to-act-101639940363925.html

Kerala’s coastal Alappuzha district was rocked by back-to-back killings of two party leaders, the first belonging to the SDPI and the second to the BJP, leading to clamping of prohibitory orders by police on Sunday. Following the killing of an SDPI state secretary, a BJP leader was hacked to death and prohibitory orders were imposed in the entire Alappuzha district on Sunday, district officials said. Nadda said, “The brutal murder of OBC Morcha State Secretary Adv. Renjith Sreenivasan by ‘fundamentalist elements’ is condemnable. Such cowardly acts cannot be tolerated. Kerala is turning into an unlawful state under CM @vijayanpinarayi. They can’t scare us with their cruelty.” Chief minister Vijayan on Sunday condemned the killings and said steps will be taken by police to nab the culprits and those behind them. He said such heinous and inhumane acts of violence were dangerous to the country and that people should keep away from such groups and their hateful activities. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy said Union home minister Amit Shah should assess the situation and dismiss the Kerala government. He also called for a ban of PFI and said its members should go to Pakistan as they were seeking secession from India. The Congress and the UDF opposition led by it, on the other hand, alleged that both BJP and SDPI were out to create communal disharmony in the state in order to make a political space for themselves here and therefore the state government and the people of Kerala should stay away from such groups. Leader of Opposition in the state assembly VD Satheesan said the agenda of these groups was to divide the state along communal lines and that the Left government should take stringent action against them. KPCC president and Congress MP K Sudhakaran, in a statement, blamed the Left government’s alleged support of SDPI and RSS for such “political killings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-turning-into-unlawful-state-under-chief-minster-pinarayi-vijayan-jp-nadda-on-twin-political-murders-101639940243999.html

In such a situation these posts and positions are also not permanent; this is something we should always be aware of all the time,” Bommai said in Shiggaon, his home constituency in Haveri district, about 366 kms from Bengaluru.The statements come at a time when speculation is rife of a possible change in leadership in Karnataka barely five months since Bommai replaced BS Yediyurappa who was forced to step down from the top chair in July.According to multiple people aware of the developments, there are chances that Bommai is likely to be replaced early next year, though there is no official confirmation on the same as it would further dent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its chances in the upcoming polls, including zilla and taluka panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) and the 2023 assembly polls.Bommai has been under extreme pressure after a poor show in the October 30 bypolls in which the BJP lost Hanagal, the chief minister’s neighbouring constituency in his home district of Haveri.Further, the Bommai government was unable to bag a majority in the December 10 polls for 25 seats in the upper house of the state legislature in which it shared an equal number of seats with the Congress, which also managed to win 11 seats with the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) getting two.The Bommai government is also under pressure after multiple charges of corruption levelled against some members, including the Bitcoin scandal, in which senior BJP leaders and officials are believed to have laundered large sums of ill-gotten money using cryptocurrencies. A section of the public work contractors has also alleged that they are forced to cough up almost 35-40% commission for getting any projects, highlighting the growing corruption under the Bommai government.If rumour mills are to be believed, then Bommai is expected to go abroad to get a knee-related surgery and a change is expected to happen around this time.However, there is no official confirmation on the same.“I don’t have great things to say. If I could live up to your expectations, that’s enough for me. I believe that no power is bigger than your love and trust. I try my best not to talk to you in an emotional way but sentiments overwhelm me after seeing you all,” Bommai said, almost choking on his own words.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-says-no-post-position-is-permanent-fuels-speculation-of-early-exit-101639940124146.html
20-12-2021||India||Belagavi remains tense, K’taka CM says will not put up with insult of patriots||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday reiterated that vandals would be dealt with sternly even as tensions remain high in Belagavi, about 505 kms from Bengaluru, after bouts of arson and defacing of statues over what appears to be reviving of the Kannada-Marathi language and border row between two of India’s most industrialised states.“Our government will not tolerate any acts of violence. It will be taken seriously and the vandals would be dealt with sternly. Already 27 persons in Belagavi and 3 in Bengaluru have been arrested in connection with cases of vandalising the statues of Shivaji and Sangolli Rayanna,” Bommai said.The statements come after some protesters went on the rampage in Belagavi on Friday night, leading to clashes with the police.Prohibitory orders are in place in Belagavi after members of what is believed to be a pro-Marathi group defaced the statue of Sangolli Rayanna, a celebrated figure and general of Rani Chennamma of Kittur, who had taken on the British East India Company in 1824 over attempts to take control of her kingdom under the doctrine of lapse.Rayanna is also a figurehead of the influential Kuruba community in Karnataka, which counts former chief minister Siddaramaiah and incumbent cabinet minister KS Eshwarappa as its members.“Shivaji Maharaj, Kitturu Rani Chennamma and Sangolli Rayanna are great patriots. They should be respected,” Bommai said.Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) considers Chatrapati Shivaji as a symbol of its nationalistic politics, the king is considered a Marathi and an invader in Karnataka, which may have led to the defacing of his statue in Bengaluru.“Nobody should indulge in spreading false news and incite people. The incidents are being propagated in different shades to mislead the people. This is far from the truth. I have immense respect and pride for the patriots. People should not get swayed by rumours,” Bommai said.The winter session of the Karnataka legislature is also underway in Belagavi and will continue at least till December 24, adding to tensions.Pro-Kannada groups had blackened the face of Deepal Dalwi, the president of the separatist Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi (MES), on December 13 at the start of the winter session as a show of strength and protest against holding the legislature session in a region which the Samithi considers should rightly be a part of Maharashtra.Several areas of erstwhile Mumbai-Karnataka, now renamed as Kittur Karnataka, are part of the regions that were included into the southern state in the 1956 reorganisation of states.While Karnataka celebrates Kannada Rajyotsava on November 1, the MES observes it a black day as they claim to have been forcibly separated from their parent state 66 years ago during the reorganisation exercise.In 2012, the state government inaugurated in Belagavi the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha, a replica of the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, where it holds the winter session of the state legislature to further thwart any claims of territory by the neighbouring state. However, the region still has Marathi-speaking residents, who continue to raise the inclusion of Belagavi and surrounding regions into Maharashtra and often clash with pro-Kannada organisations in the border district.Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s minister for home, said all precautions have been taken in Belagavi to prevent any untoward incidents in the district. He said the home department was in constant touch with the police over the incidents in Belagavi and Bengaluru.“Have asked for all necessary actions to be taken to maintain peace and order,” Jnanendra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-in-belagavi-acts-of-violence-won-t-be-tolerated-saysbommai-101639940005464.html
20-12-2021||India||Activists flag concerns over Tamil Nadu policy on children||A 2019 sexual assault case of a 7-year-old in Tamil Nadu has brought to light several gaps in ‘Tamil Nadu State Policy for Children 2021’ as child rights activists say children continue to suffer due to the flaws in the policy.The girl was assaulted during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown in 2019 by her neighbour. After a case was filed in 2020, the girl was medically examined in a gynaecology ward of a government/private hospital where she was referred to as a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act case. The charge sheet said that the accused repeatedly assaulted the child and threatened her that he would kill her mother if she complained. The assault came to light when neighbours heard the child screaming one day. Since she belonged to an economically weaker section, she continues to live in the same building as the accused man. These experiences have continued to further traumatise the child and the state’s new children policy doesn’t address such ground realities, according to activists. Recently, Child Rights and You (CRY) lauded the policy, released on Children’s Day– November 20, which covers aspects of a child’s health, education, protection and participation, yet experts working for children in the state said that it has gaps such as not addressing boys as victims of sexual abuse, not including cyber crimes against children, protection from intimidation by perpetrators.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crimes against children in Tamil Nadu increased by 4.8% in 2020 during the Covid pandemic compared to a marginal decline of 0.4% between 2018 and 2019.The 7-year-old child’s case is in the trial stage at the Chengalpattu district court, where the case came up for hearing on December 16, but it was adjourned as a witness didn’t appear.A person privy to the child and the case, who did not wish to be identified, said that the father left the family after this case was filed.“The mother is a domestic worker who is now alone with the daughter fighting for justice,” he said. Referring to the 7-year-old girl’s case, Vanessa Peter, founder of the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC) said that the policy doesn’t have a victim protection programme in a situation like this. “The child need not be put in an institution when she can live with her mother,” said Peter.“But because they are poor they don’t have the means to shift homes, so the victim and the perpetrator are in the building even though they are on different floors. This is where the state can introduce provisions for victims of violence against children, for housing, employment, other entitlements for the family members of the victims, especially from socially disadvantaged groups and economically weaker sections. Without such support, they are more likely to turn hostile as such cases take a long time.”From December 15 onwards, various civil society organisations, including the IRCDU and the Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch and child rights activists, got together for a two-day consultation to suggest ways to strengthen the policy. “The suggestions elaborate on how private tuition centres should be mandated to adopt a child protection policy as several children enrol there. Child Protection Policy should be mandatory not only for schools but other areas where children access education and extracurricular activities like private tuition centres, sports academies, religious places, computer centres,” said Andrew Sesuraj, convener of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch. They also argued for the policy to help establish a data repository on convicted sex offenders and paedophiles to ensure that organisations recruiting persons interacting with children can approach the government for background verification. This system is followed in the UK and US. Tamil Nadu released the child protection policy at a time when the state is reeling under an exodus of complaints of sexual abuse and assault against children. Two schoolgirls have also died by suicide alleging sexual abuse by their teachers during classes online and in physical classrooms. In Chennai alone, police have booked at least half a dozen teachers and sports coaches. In 2019, a European based study titled ‘Out of the Shadows: Shining Light on the Response to Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation’ found that India’s POCSO Act was one of the strongest legal frameworks and scored 86 out of 100 as compared to 73 for the UK.India scored low on government commitment and capacity (48) and engagement of civil society, industry and media (50). This shows that while the provisions of the laws to punish perpetrators of sexual crimes against children is present, but its implementation has been tardy given insensitive stakeholders such as police, medical staff, such as in the 7-year-old’s case, which prevents them from seeking due process of the criminal justice system besides the delays in filing charge sheet and long trial process that is common across the country.
20-12-2021||India||Cabinet may discuss bill on conversions today: Minister||The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is likely to discuss the controversial anti-conversion bill in the cabinet meeting on Monday, JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for law, parliamentary affairs and minor irrigation said. The bill, likely to be titled ‘The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill 2021’, will be then tabled in the lower house, people aware of the developments said. “The bill is ready and the cabinet may discuss it tomorrow. After discussions it has to be printed and then tabling will happen. Within a day or two, it will happen. We want to get it passed in this session,” Madhuswamy told HT on Sunday. The tabling of the bill comes at a time when the Bommai government is facing strong opposition to the proposal, especially in the backdrop of increased attacks against members of the Christian community in the state. The bill, according to senior members of the cabinet, is aimed at restricting and penalising conversion by allurement or by force. Several members of the Christian community and the Opposition have said that they will fight against the proposal in the house and outside. Siddaramaiah, the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, had said that his party will not allow the anti-conversion bill to be passed in the house. He alleged that the government was making attempts such as bringing in anti-conversion law to divert the attention of the people from real issues.“Is there a need for it? There is no need. If there is forced conversion, file a complaint against those involved and punish them. There is a law already.” he had said.“We have gone through seven bills from different states who enacted the bill. The Congress, too, had drafted it in 2016, which was scrutinised by the then law minister but was not brought before the cabinet. We have copied the same and they cannot take any objection because they have drafted this bill,” Madhuswamy said. A copy of the bill is doing the rounds on social media, which the government has not authenticated. According to this bill, the government has defined “allurement” as “any gift, gratification, easy money or material benefit either in cash or kind.” It further added that the promise of employment, free education in reputed schools run by any religious body, promise to marry, better lifestyle, divine pleasure or otherwise will also be considered as allurement. The clause said that “disturbing the freedom of practice, rituals, and ceremonies or any integral part of a religion or offending religious sentiments” will invite action.The bill also defined coercion, conversion, force and fraudulent as means for religious conversion, among others. “Mass conversions means where two or more persons are converted,” the bill stated. “Prohibition of conversion from one religion to another religion by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or marriage. No person shall convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet or conspire such conversion,” the bill added. Penal provisions for violations of the proposed law like jail terms extending from 3-10 years and fines capped at ₹1 lakh have been added to the bill. “Marriage done for the sole purpose of unlawful conversion or vice-versa to be declared void,” it added. Further, the offence will be non-bailable and cognizable, the bill read. Any person willing to convert will have to apply to the Deputy Commissioner who will scrutinise the request. Other details include the submission of personal details like date of birth, original religion, residential address and a copy of the Adhar card. After the person appears before the DC within 21 days to confirm the contents, the official will record the statements or any objections to the same. Further, the details will be sent to other departments like revenue, social welfare, backward classes and minority welfare among others, including rural bodies, principals or headmasters of educational institutions. “In recent years the state has noticed many instances of conversion by means of ‘allurement, coercion, force, fraudulent means and also “mass” conversion. These instances caused disturbance to public order and to punish such persons indulged in such acts at present no legislation is in existence in the state,” according to the statements or objects and reasons in the bill. The bill added that the Law Commission of Karnataka, after studying the various laws on the subject and considering the situation in the state in its 30th report, has made a recommendation to the government to enact a suitable law on the subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-may-discuss-bill-on-conversions-today-minister-101639939944116.html
20-12-2021||India||J&K seeks army’s help over power blackout||Jammu and Kashmir administration has sought the help of the Indian army after major parts of the union territory continue to reel under power blackout following an indefinite strike by the employees of the J&K power development department (J&KPDD) from Friday night.The PDD employees and J&K administration are at loggerheads over the latter’s decision to privatise the department’s assets and proposal to merge J&K PDD into the Power Grid Corporation of India, a statutory corporation under the ministry of power. The strike and the administration’s intransigence have put thousands of J&K residents to extreme hardships amid bone-chilling temperatures and the Covid-19 pandemic, as hundreds of patients are struggling to keep on to their oxygen concentrators. Divisional Commissioner Jammu Raghav Langer has written to the department of military affairs and the ministry of defence requesting the army’s assistance in restoring the essential services.“It is to bring to your kind notice that due to strike by electricity department personnel in the union territory of J&K, essential services have been severely affected in the Jammu region. We would like to hereby requisition the Indian army to assist in the restoration of the said essential services by provisioning manpower to man critical electricity stations and water supply sources,” the communication by Langer said.Earlier, the divisional commissioner, Jammu during day held a meeting with the representatives of the employees, which failed to make any major headway. The government requested the employee leaders to call off the strike after the meeting.“The Government of J & K, taking a sympathetic view of the issues raised, has engaged in several rounds of talks with Coordination Committee of the Power Employees. The Government has already agreed on two of their major demands -putting on hold the proposal for formation of JV(joint venture) and ensuring delay in salary is immediately resolved,” said the official Twitter handle of Department of Information and Public Relations, Govt of Jammu & Kashmir.It said that during each round of talks, government representatives have appealed to the power employees to call off their strike as people in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions are suffering. “In the wake of Covid contagion and nail-biting cold in both the divisions, the Coordination Committee of the Power Employees is requested to end its strike,” it said.All J&K Power Employees and Engineers Coordination Committee (JKPECC) leader Majid Munshi’s phone was switched off. Another leader of the committee, Sachin Tickoo, told the media that they were opposing the systematic transfer of assets. “They are selling the assets of the transmission sector. They want to give 50% shareholding to the power grid which is against the interests of Jammu and Kashmir,” he told a news channel.The strike has plunged large swathes of the Union territory into darkness amid the chilling temperatures as the employees refuse to rectify any faults.Political parties have heavily criticised the J&K administration for its “incompetence” and inconvenience people have been facing.Former J&K chief minister and National Conference vice president took exception to the privatization decision of the J&K administration and said it should be left to the elected government.“The J&K administration may be able to claim the constitutional authority to privatise the assets of J&K but it completely lacks the political authority. Decisions of this nature with far-reaching consequences should be left to an elected Govt,” Abdullah said in a tweet.Peoples Conference general secretary Imran Reza Ansari said: “The strike of Power Sector employees has exposed the incompetence and callousness of current administration. On one hand livelihood of thousands of power sector employees is at stake, on the hand the survival of millions of citizens of J&K.”“One can only pray for a divine intervention since the administration has failed to protect the interests of people as well as the employees of the power sector. This is yet another instance of the utter failure of basic governance. Imported bureaucracy is busy in PR gimmicks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-seeks-army-s-help-over-power-blackout-101639939764038.html
20-12-2021||India||Third generation Kerala craftsmen keep tradition of ‘Nettur petti’ alive||They are often called keepers of the treasure, but these treasure-trove makers are not rich. Makers of ‘Nettur petti’ (box), a handmade wooden jewel box often used by aristocratic families, rich and temple bodies in south India to keep their ornaments and valuables intact, are just trying to keep the glorious tradition and craftsmanship alive.A nostalgic piece, many still keep these wooden boxes intact, and for others, it is a showpiece now. V V Suresh Kumar and V V Ramesh Kumar, two brothers in the state capital, third-generation craftsmen, are keeping their tradition alive. Their handmade products blend beauty, elegance and tradition and they are much sought after even these days, where better storage facilities are available. Many swear they still keep their valuables in ‘Nettur petti’ as part of the tradition, and some believe it is a symbol of luck and prosperity.“Generally rosewood is used to make these boxes. But now we use mahogany, teak and jackfruits timber also. Brass is used for embellishment. Everything, including the lock, handle, nails, hinges and cover are made by hand. Later, we paint it with vegetables’ colours,” he said, adding it takes days together to make a reasonably-sized box. He said many customers often seek specifications and different embellishments, and they make it accordingly. “Once we get the wood, we treat it properly and starts chiselling and modelling it according to our needs. Modelling and moulding are cumbersome. Everything is handmade, so the cost escalates. The situation was really bad, forcing my brother once to go to the middle-east to pursue some other jobs,” Suresh Kumar said, explaining the rigours of traditional craftsmen. Ramesh is back and runs a small stall at the arts and crafts village in Vellar on the outskirts of the capital city.Besides jewel boxes, they make different boxes. Kathakali Petti (to keep dance costumes), ari petti (rice box), spice petti, chella petti (betel nut box) and kaipettti (briefcase like wooden box to keep records) are some of them. They are also specialized in making ‘Manichitrathazu’ (ornate lock), which became famous after the 1993 semi-horror Malayalam movie of the same name.Craftsmen have no idea how Nettur petti got its name. “It is also known as Malabar petti, and we feel it might have imbibed the name from a village along the Malabar coast,” Suresh said.“My father Viswanathan Achari was an award-winning craftsman, and he was with Natesan’s, a popular antiqarts chain of south India. After his long stint, he came back to the state capital and founded an art school in Thiruvananthapuram to train youngsters,” said Ramesh Kumar, adding after his father’s death they tried to run it but was forced to close it later. Now, they employ less than 10 workers, most of them their relatives, and run a making unit in their home. Sadly, youngsters are missing from the workforce.“We want to run an art school and train youngsters, but we don’t have the wherewithal. For artists also, returns are meagre. If machine-made stuff is available for one-fifth of the price of handmade people usually go for them. But many still realize rigours of handmade boxes,” said Suresh Kumar.
20-12-2021||India||PM Modi to meet India Inc before budget amid Omicron scare||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet captains of industry ahead of the national budget to discuss measures required to maintain India’s economic recovery amidst global concerns over the rapidly spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 that could restrict mobility and disrupt economic activity.Modi is expected to soon meet industry representatives, two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity. “It may happen early this week, maybe as early as on Monday evening,” one of them said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the budget for 2022-23 on February 1. Both the government and the industry are cautious about Omicron as it could slow down economic growth, the second person said. “The Modi government has always been proactive. It is keen to take policy measures to shield the Indian economy from any impending global crisis. This will happen through dialogue with all stakeholders, including the industry,” the person said.The meeting would take place in the backdrop of two official reports. The recovery in domestic economic activity is turning increasingly broad-based, with the expanding vaccination coverage, slump in fresh Covid-19 cases and rapid normalisation of mobility, the monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India said in its economic outlook on December 8.It, however, cautioned that “volatile commodity prices, persisting global supply disruptions, new mutations of the virus and financial market volatility” may pose downside risks to its outlook. India’s GDP growth will be 9.5% in the year to March 2022, the committee predicted. Another government report has warned of potential disruption of India’s economic growth momentum due to Omicron. “Omicron, a new variant of Covid-19, may pose a fresh risk to the ongoing global recovery,” the finance ministry said in its monthly economic report on December 11.“India’s economic recovery is driven by the timely relief and stimulus packages of the Modi government, and the massive vaccination drive,” the second person said. “There is a need to have a similar caliberated approach in the future to keep up the pace of economic development.”Modi on Friday hosted a roundtable interaction with representatives of venture capital and private equity funds. “It has been the constant endeavour of the Prime Minister to boost the investment climate of the country,” the government said in a statement after the meeting. “The discussion in the meeting happened on similar lines, while also illustrating how the Prime Minister is interacting personally with industry leaders to gather inputs ahead of the next budget.”Earlier last week on Wednesday, Modi met Gita Gopinath, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, which she said in a tweet was a “productive and wide-ranging conversation.” India is projected to grow at 9.5% in 2021 and 8.5% in 2022, highest among major economies, and ahead of China’s 8% and 5.6% growth in the respective periods, the IMF said in its October update of the World Economic Outlook. The Covid-19 outbreak last year and the 68-day nationwide hard lockdown had a devastating impact on the economy. India’s GDP shrank 24.4% in the first fiscal quarter ended June 2020. It plunged into a technical recession – negative growth for two consecutive quarters – as it contracted 7.4% in the next three months. Thereafter, the economy saw a V-shaped recovery on the back of a ₹20.97 trillion stimulus package and policy reforms announced since March 2020. A positive 0.5% growth was reported in the third quarter, followed by 1.6% expansion in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021.The India economy started the current fiscal year with a record 20.1% expansion in the first quarter, signalling a strong revival in business activities. It saw 8.4% growth in the second quarter ended September 2021 on the back of increased government spending and exports, official data show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-meet-india-inc-before-budget-amid-omicron-scare-101639939525490.html

As per the i-Drone project team, the drone delivered over 3000 units of medical supplies in a record 28 minutes from Mokokchung to Tuensang covering an aerial distance of 40 kilometers.“@ICMRDELHI along with Nagaland Govt. scripts a new chapter in the history of public health practices. 3525 units of medical supplies were transported from Mokokchung to Tuensang covering an aerial dist. of 40kms in 28mnts - longest flight ever by drone carrying medicines in India,” Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio tweeted on Saturday.According to an official bulletin, the drone delivery was undertaken to test the feasibility of sending Covid-19 samples from Mokokchung to Tuensang as the latter does not have sample testing facility. More than 7000 units of medical supplies were transported to Nagaland through this project.The ICMR project aims at supplying Covid-19 vaccines and essential medical supplies to far-flung places.The i-DRONE activity was launched in Mokokchung on December 14 and made the first flight from the district Chief Medical Officer’s Office to Primary Health Centre Longsa village.In a tweet, chief minister Neiphiu Rio said that ICMR Delhi and the state government scripted a new chapter in the history of public health practices.“ICMR Delhi long with Nagaland Government scripts a new chapter in the history of public health practices. 3525 units of medical supplies were transported from Mokokchung to Tuensang covering an aerial dist. of 40kms in 28mnts - longest flight ever by a drone carrying medicines in India,” Rio said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longest-drone-flight-medical-supplies-delivery-in-india-done-in-nagaland-101639939403800.html
20-12-2021||India||Bill allows detention for 2 months, legal experts flag concern||The Madhya Pradesh government will introduce a draft legislation to tackle organised crime in the upcoming winter session of the legislative assembly, the state’s home minister Narottam Mishra said. The state cabinet will soon approve the Madhya Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities Prevention Bill 2021 so that is can tabled in the assembly, which will be in session from December 20 to 24, Mishtra told HT. Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will be the second state after Uttar Pradesh to enact a law to weed out local mafias. The state cabinet on Thursday also approved a draft legislation to prevent damage to public and private property. The proposed gangster law will enable authorities to detain suspected criminals for up to two months, a home department official said. The law will be used against organized criminals, including mining mafia, land mafia, illicit liquor sellers, fake medicine sellers, human trafficking gangs, drugs peddlers, food adulterators, and illegal arms manufacturers, among others. “Police will invoke the law in all the organized crimes that have more than two accused,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “The law will empower district collectors to inquire the matter of assets of the accused and, if it is found to be disproportionate, they will have a right to seize it.” The cases under the proposed law will be heard in a special court so that hearings could be completed in a timely manner. There will also be provisions for the safety and security of eyewitnesses. “The draft is being discussed and will be formalized soon,” home department additional chief secretary Rajesh Rajora said. “This was not the first time when the provision of police remand for up to two months is going to be introduced,” retired police officer Shailendra Shrivastava said. “Earlier, it was introduced under the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA).” “It is a necessary provision because it is tough for police to interrogate hardcore criminals,” the former Indian Police Service officer said. “As of now, there is a provision of maximum remand of 15 days, but that is not enough to complete interrogation.”However, legal experts and human rights activists fear that the proposed law can be misused by the state government.  “What is the definition of a gangster and who will decide who is a gangster or not?” asked former advocate general Ravi Nandan Singh. “There is a possibility that the act can be misused and stringent provisions like in POTA and TADA will definitely upset the people of Madhya Pradesh.” “The Madhya Pradesh government is copying Uttar Pradesh in every law, but they should understand that crime in MP is different from UP,” human rights activist M Seema said. “I don’t know why the government needs an extra law to control crime. They should reinforce existing laws to stop mafias because these laws only violate human rights, as we have seen in TADA and POTA. To keep a person in police custody just on the basis of suspicion that he is part of a mafia will surely violate human rights.” The proposed legislation is nothing but a copy of the law effective in Uttar Pradesh, the opposition said. “This act will prove the failure of the BJP-led state government in maintaining law and order in MP. BJP is leading the state and they allowed mafias to grow to such extent that now the government needs a separate law to deal with them,” said PC Sharma, state lawmaker from the Congress party. The law will ensure peace and terrorise antisocial elements, BJP maintains.“This law is against antisocial elements and the mafias to maintain peace and harmony in the state and to save the lives of people,” BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said. “Opposition leaders have made a habit to oppose everything without understanding the consequences, and that’s why the Congress party is losing trust among the people.”

The committee is working with National Informatics Centre, which provides computer programming support to the government.HT reached out to Meity secretary Ajay Sawhney, who did not respond immediately.Two sub-committees have been constituted under the ICTM, the officials said. One of them will look at existing systems, identify gaps and prepare recommendations. The other will flesh out the concept of a futuristic Parliament by studying global best practices.The committees will prepare the groundwork to develop an application similar to National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA), which is used by some state legislatures. It will also use a version of Sandes, the government’s end-to-end encrypted messaging application.E-Sansad will include features for multiple stakeholders from the speaker of the Lok Sabha, chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, members, secretariat, ministers, ministries, the digital library and the general public. This would ease tracking and tracing of documents while ensuring data confidentiality, according to the document cited earlier.For the speaker and chairperson, the features may include access to list of business of the Houses, list of the questions, papers to be laid, bills to be introduced, zero-hour discussions, and so on. Similar provisions will be made for the ministries as well.For parliamentarians, it will elaborate on their engagements in Parliament for the day, committee meetings, notices, participation, communications received and sent, complete activities of the committees and even payment details. The secretariat will be able to access activities of the Table office, the question branch, the committees, the legislative branch and others, including members’ salaries and allowances, welfare and services.The core business systems will cover submitting requests, notices, precessing documents, session business support, connection with stakeholders and information dissemination.E-Sansad will “revolutionise” Parliament by “integration of stakeholders functionalities, seamless navigation of information, ease of dissemination, artificial intelligence backed search, cloud development with a single point access and Sansad process automation”, the document stated.The public platform will enable citizens to access members’ profiles, constituency reports, questions raised, responses submitted, legislative bills, committees, debate synopsis and government assurances. The debates portal will also contain video archives, verbatim records of the debates and use keyword mapping to search for bills, sector, legislation and members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-communications-may-soon-be-accessed-digitally-through-esansad-101639938805117.html
20-12-2021||India||2 arrested on spying charges in J&K’s Rajouri||Two persons were arrested on charges of spying for Pakistan in a village in the border district of Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Sunday.A man working as a porter with the Army and his relative, both residents of Nowshera, were picked up by a joint team of the Army and police on specific information late on Saturday, they said.The arrested Nazir Hussain and Mohammed Mukhtar are accused of taking videos of vital and sensitive security installations and sharing them with their handlers outside the country in lieu of money.According to the officials, the two had shot a video clip in the Army premises (erstwhile tactical headquarters of Rashtriya Rifles) on a mobile phone. “A piece of information was received at the Rajouri police station on December 16 regarding an espionage racket operating in the area… On this complaint, both the accused have been arrested and further investigation is underway,” a police spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-arrested-on-spying-charges-in-j-k-s-rajouri-101639938803706.html
20-12-2021||India||India’s latest destroyer kicks off maiden trials in Arabian Sea||An indigenously built stealth destroyer --- one of the four warships being built under an important navy project called P-15B, on Sunday kicked off maiden trials in Arabian Sea, the event coinciding with the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule. Mormugao is the second stealth destroyer under P-15B --- the first, INS Visakhapatnam, was commissioned in the navy on November 21 in Mumbai. Mormugao is expected to join the naval fleet by mid-2022, with the remaining two to be commissioned by 2025.The ships are being built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd in Mumbai. The commissioning of Visakhapatnam, armed with a variety of locally built weapons and sensors, reaffirmed India’s presence among an elite group of nations with capability to design and build advanced warships, the officials said. “December 19 is perhaps the most befitting date for the ship to put to sea for trials. The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in the liberation of Goa and dedicating the ship’s name to the maritime state will not just enhance the bonding between the Indian Navy and the people of Goa, but also link the ship’s identity permanently to the crucial role the navy played in nation-building,” the navy said in a statement. Mormugao will add significantly to the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities, it added. The navy is focused on strengthening its capabilities amid changing power dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region. Last month, it also inducted a French-designed Kalvari class diesel-electric attack submarine, Vela. INS Vela is the fourth of the six Kalvari class submarines being constructed in the country with technology transfer from French firm Naval Group under a ₹23,562-crore programme called P-75. The remaining two submarines will be commissioned in two years. India is also pursuing a project (P-75I) worth ₹40,000 crore for building six more advanced submarines in the country under the government’s strategic partnership (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet. The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign players are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.
20-12-2021||India||Murders of SDPI, BJP leaders spark tension in Kerala’s Alappuzha, curfew imposed||The murders of two political activists in less than 12 hours in Kerala’s Alappuzha sparked unrest in the district, prompting authorities to impose curfew on Sunday for two days to prevent escalation. KS Shan (38), state secretary of Social Democratic Party of India, the political arm of the Popular Front of India, was knifed to death by assailants in the night of December 18. Ranjith Sreenivasan (40), state secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party’s OBC Morcha, died of stab wounds when a gang attacked him in his home on Sunday. Both the slain received more than 40 knife wounds, police said. The authorities have detained at least 50 people in connection with the killings, inspector general of police Harshita Attaluri said. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were clamped in the district for two days, and police have been deployed in the area to avert any further clashes, Attaluri said. Shan was attacked when he was returning home in Mannacherry on his scooter. The assailants, riding in a car, hit his scooter and, when he fell down, they stabbed him repeatedly, police said. He received multiple fractures and head injuries, and succumbed to wounds at a private hospital in Ernakulam. Shan is survived by his wife and two children. Sreenivasan was attacked on Sunday morning when he was coming out of his house for a stroll, police said. He was stabbed by a group of people in front of his mother and died on the way to hospital. Sreenivasan had unsuccessfully contested the Kerala assembly election in April this year.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned the twin murders. “The government will not allow anyone to take law in their hands,” he said in state capital Thiruvananthapuram. “We will not tolerate any attempt to vitiate peaceful atmosphere of the state.” The state government has set up a special investigation team to probe the killings under supervision of additional director general of police Vijay Sakhre. It has also called an all-party meet in Alapuzha on Monday to discuss the situation.The SDPI alleged the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), ideological parent of the BJP, was behind Shan’s murder. “The RSS is trying to create mayhem by eliminating political opponents and silencing minority community members. It is a well planned and executed murder,” PFI state president CP Muhammed Basheer said. RSS state leader Valsan Thillankeri was in the district on Saturday and was “aware of the cold-blooded murder,” Basheer alleged. Thillankeri rejected the allegation, saying he attended a function in the district that was announced much earlier. The RSS had no role in the killing, he said. While there was no immediate provocation for the SDPI leader’s murder, police suspect it might be in retaliation to the murder of V Nandu, a worker of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of RSS, in Vayalar in February this year, officers said, requesting anonymity. Clashes between RSS and SDPI workers are frequent in Kerala. Last month, RSS leader S Sanjith was stabbed to death in Palakkad by a gang of assailants.  As news of Sreenivasan’s death spread, BJP’s state president K Surendran alleged that the Kerala government’s support to the SDPI led to the gruesome murder. He sought an investigation by a central agency, saying the party will not get justice from state police. “The CPI(M) is running many local bodies with the help of SDPI,” Surendran said. “It supports the communal outfit to checkmate the RSS.”“Pinarayi Vijayan’s goonda raj took another precious life,” V Muraleedharan of the BJP, who is junior foreign minister at the Centre, tweeted on Sunday. “No law and order and killers go scot-free.” VD Satheesan of the Congress party, who is leader of the opposition in the state assembly, and state Congress president K Sudhakaran condemned the murders. “If police were alert, the second murder could have been avoided,” Satheesan said. “Police should be given a free hand to investigate both.” 
20-12-2021||India||Shiv Sena betrayed Hindutva for power in 2019 Maha polls: Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said it was decided between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its then alliance partner Shiv Sena that the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis, but the Uddav Thackeray-led party compromised with Hindutva for power.He dared Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to resign from the office and fight elections again.“I was here during the Maharashtra elections. I myself had had a conversation with Shiv Sena. And I want to reiterate that it was decided that the election would be fought under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and the chief minister would be from the BJP. But they denied it. They compromised with Hindutva for power,” Shah said while addressing the BJP workers here.BJP and Shiv Sena contested the 2019 Assembly elections in Maharashtra in an alliance. However after the alliance emerged victorious, Sena parted ways from the BJP-led coalition over the issue of the chief minister’s post. Later, Thackeray joined hands with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.“They sat on the lap of the ones against whom they have been fighting for two generations. They claimed that we never agreed on making the chief minister from the BJP. In your presence, I and PM Modi had said that the election is being fought under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and he would be the chief minister. But since you had to be the chief minister, you betrayed us.”Shah was on a two-day visit to Maharashtra.In a scathing attack, Shah described the tripartite MVA dispensation as a “punctured rickshaw” whose wheels are going in three different directions and it causing only pollution. Playing on the DBT acronym of the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme of the Narendra Modi government, Shah said in the MVA government Congress takes the ‘D’ for a dealer, Shiv Sena the ‘B’ for a broker, and NCP the ‘T’ for transfers.Shah also sounded a bugle for the elections to municipal corporations, including Mumbai, which are due next year. He appealed to BJP workers to reach out to voters and explain to them about corruption and other irregularities committed by MVA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-betrayed-hindutva-for-power-in-2019-maharashtra-polls-amit-shah-101639938265185.html
20-12-2021||India||Opposition raises concerns over parts of two bills, wants detailed review||Opposition parties want detailed review of two legislations, pertaining to increasing the minimum age of marriage from 18 to 21 years for women and amendments to the Biological diversity bill, as they have reservations about some parts of the proposed bills.A senior Congress leader told HT on condition of anonymity that the bill that intends to increase the minimum legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years “needs to be read very carefully”. The proposed bill was cleared by the Union cabinet last week, but is yet to be introduced in Parliament in the ongoing winter session, which only has four days remaining.The Congress leader also termed the bill as “potentially divisive” and aimed at “electoral benefits” after reports emerged that many Muslim organisations in Kerala have criticised the Union government’s move, which the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council (KCBC) has welcomed.“We will definitely ask the bill to be sent to a parliamentary committee for in-depth scrutiny,” said the leader, an Opposition strategist.The bill that aims to bring uniformity in the marriageable age of men and women may contain amendments to faith-based personal laws dealing with marriage and inheritance.Muslim League leader ET Mohammad Basheer on Friday introduced an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha, saying the decision was against the Muslim personal law and that it was another step towards introducing a uniform civil code in the country.“We will oppose this. The government is trying to implement the Sangh Parivar’s favourite agenda of uniform civil code. The Muslim personal law board clearly defines marriage, divorce and right to property. These issues relate to our faith,” Basheer had said.Speaking about the Biodiversity bill that would be sent to a select panel, at least two other Opposition leaders maintained that the bill was brought without any consultation with stakeholders— a usual practice before bringing bills related to environment— and pointed out that “there is no provision in the bill to protect or increase the stake of local communities in sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity”.The Opposition finds the bill to cater benefits to the Ayush industry, but without any provision to enhance the protection of biodiversity.

He said the PM didn’t want a disagreement in any part of the country as celebrations are going on to commemorate the 75th year of independence.“We are celebrating ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to commemorate the 75th years of independence…The PM didn’t think it was appropriate that there was disagreement in any corner of the country. He has shown large-heartedness (aaitihasic badappan ka parichaye) through his decision to repeal the farm laws,” said Tomar while speaking to reporters after the national executive meeting organised by the BJP farmers’ wing in Gurugram on Sunday.Tomar said that the farm laws were introduced for the betterment of farmers, but a small section of people was against it.Speaking at the national executive, BJP president JP Nadda said that the central government is committed to the welfare of farmers and has taken several measures and implemented schemes in this regard. A senior BJP leader, aware of the development, said that Nadda asked party workers to tell farmers about the central government schemes.A political resolution to thank the PM for the work done by the government for farmers’ welfare and agricultural development was passed at the day-long meeting. The meeting comes ahead of the crucial assembly polls in five states.Of the five poll-bound states, farm agitation was a burning issue in two states, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.“The party workers have been asked to hold meetings at the booth level and tell farmers about the schemes and initiatives taken by the central government,” said a senior party functionary who attended the event.BJP MP and national president of the party’s Kisan Morcha Rajkumar Chahar slammed the opposition parties for doing vote bank politics whereas the BJP is working for farmers’ welfare. He said that the farmers’ wing of the party would act as a “bridge between the government and the farmers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-farmers-wing-holds-meet-hails-pm-for-agri-laws-repeal-101639937963817.html
20-12-2021||India||Variant watch: What more we know of Omicron today||The mutations in the Omicron variant of Covid-19 make it better at cheating prior immunity, but possibly also compromise its ability to replicate and cause disease, found a study uploaded on Saturday by researchers at Cambridge University.The researchers studied the mechanism of infection of the latest variant of concern by looking at how it infected lab-grown lung cells. Omicron’s entry into the cells was significantly impaired, they found, and it did not lead to fusion of cells that leads to the formation of giant infected cells called syncitia.Entry into cell determines infectivity, while the formation of the giant cells most notably gave the Delta variant an ability to lead to substantially more severe disease, the authors explained.“What does this all mean? Efficient infection of lung cells could correlate with severity of lung disease. Syncitia or fused cells are often seen in respiratory tissues taken following severe disease. Delta was very good at both, in contrast to Omicron. Further work is needed,” Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge’s department of medicine, said in a tweet on Saturday.The study is the second in two days to suggest the Omicron variant does not replicate as efficiently in the lung tissues as its ancestors. The first was by researchers at University of Hong Kong, who found a 10-fold drop in how the variant multiplied in the lungs, although its replication in the bronchus, the passage that leads air into the lungs, was significantly higher.Also read | 8 fresh cases of Covid’s Omicron variant, national tally rises to 153The Hong Kong study offered observations that seem to explain why the variant may be more fast-spreading. If there is more of the virus in a part of the airway such as the bronchus, it will be more readily spewed out by an infected person.On the other hand, if its ability to infect the lungs is impaired, it may not lead to as severe a disease as the other variants. Both studies appear to reach this inference, although the researchers involved in both have warned against drawing concrete conclusions since more studies are needed.The Cambridge study notes some new observations that might explain why the replication is impeded. The first is a change in the all-important spike protein, the protruding part of the virus that latches on to human cells before cleaving and initiating entry into the target cell.Also read | Threat of Omicron looms over Xmas holidays in Europe, USIn Omicron, it appears, the “cleavage efficiency is lower than for wild type Wuhan-1 D614G and Delta”, the Cambridge study said. Wuhan-1 D614G refers to the variant that swept across the world during the first wave that began in January 2020.The second reason appears to be an inherent loss in what is known as fusogenecity, or the characteristic of a cell (infected, in this case), to fuse with another.“In summary this work suggests that Omicron does appear to have become more immune evasive, but that properties associated with disease progression *may* be attenuated to some extent,” Gupta added in another tweet, in which he also stressed: “The significant growth of Omicron nevertheless represents a major public health challenge.”The virulence of Omicron is at present the most significant unknown that scientists are scrambling to understand. The variant has already demonstrated that it posses the two other traits that could make the pandemic flare again. It is significantly more transmissible and resistant than any prior configuration of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.
20-12-2021||India||Kolkata municipal elections: Crude bombs hurled, 72 arrested in city||Various incidents of violence, including hurling of crude bombs, marred polling to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) even as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “happy (that) people voted peacefully”.While even the state election commission (SEC) and the police described the elections as “peaceful”, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded cancellation of the “violence-marred polls”. At least 63 per cent of the nearly 40.5 lakh voters exercised their franchise till 5 pm on Sunday, when voting ended, the SEC said.After casting her vote in Bhowanipore, chief minister Banerjee said: “I am happy people voted peacefully. Kolkata Police is carrying out its duties efficiently.”According to police, three people were injured after a crude bomb exploded near a polling station at Taki Boy’s School. One person was arrested in this regard. “We have also identified his associates but the names cannot be disclosed,” joint commissioner of police (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said.Two other crude bombs near Khanna cinema hall in central Kolkata also went off but nobody was injured in the incident, police said.At least five candidates belonging to the Trinamool Congress (TMC), BJP, Congress and the Left were hospitalised following clashes at various places.Police said political workers went on a rampage inside at least two polling booths, adding that as many as 72 people were arrested across the city till 2 pm. “The state election commission has also received complaints and forwarded them to us. We have filed action-taken reports,” Sarkar said. Alleging that the ruling party looted the votes, leader of opposition in state assembly Suvendu Adhikari said: “There was no voting but TMC looted votes today. The BJP has demanded that this KMC election be declared null and void and repolling be done. The state election commissioner is spineless. We will fight on the streets and also legally for this.” “The presiding officers in all polling booths became silent spectators when our agents were driven out. The TMC showed how low its confidence is even after winning 213 of the state’s 294 assembly seats six months ago,” state unit’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said. The BJP alleged that Kolkata Police did not allow eight of its legislators to leave the government’s MLA Hostel near Park Street by locking the main gate. They also alleged that policemen were deployed outside Adhikari’s residence in Salt Lake. “The policemen could not produce any official order that said that BJP MLAs and MPs should be restrained till 5 pm. They only said they had instructions,” BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said. Dismissing the allegation, former mayor Firhad Hakim said: “This is a drama staged by the BJP. Can the police dare to stop the movement of legislators?”TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee dismissed BJP’s allegation but said strong action will be taken if any TMC worker was found to be involved in violence and electoral malpractice. “The TMC cannot do anything if the BJP does not have the organisational strength to deploy polling agents. The polls were held peacefully barring some stray incidents. If the media has any photo or video footage, showing our workers involved in any incident, please make it public. Our party will give them exemplary punishment and so will the administration,” he said. The Left, meanwhile, has announced to hold statewide agitations from Monday. The ruling TMC currently controls 126 of the total 144 civic wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-municipal-elections-crude-bombs-hurled-72-arrested-in-city-101639937787176.html
20-12-2021||India||‘Guilty conscience’: CM Yogi Adityanath rebuts SP chief Akhilesh Yadav||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the income tax department’s raids on Samajwadi Party leaders were causing heartburn to the Akhilesh Yadav-led opposition party in the state. “I was watching yesterday (Saturday) that income tax raids were causing much heartburn to the Samajwadi Party leadership. I asked someone what was the reason and he said that it was a classic case of guilty conscience,” he said during the launch of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ from Mathura on Sunday. “Could you ever believe that someone’s income would increase 200 times in five years? But then everything was possible in SP’s rule.” Attacking the opposition parties ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, he claimed, “Earlier, opposition parties were afraid of even taking names of Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura and were in a race to wear skullcaps only.” Skullcap is worn by Muslims. Samajawadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “On failing on all fronts from law and order to development, all that the ruling BJP had been doing is decisive politics and politics of hatred. But now all this won’t work. This government is on it’s way out, BJP will get historic defeat”.The chief minister further claimed that the Opposition parties did not like the ongoing development works in Uttar Pradesh, and were rather happy when the mafia was powerful in the state and terrorists were being released. “Would there have been action against the mafia and criminals, if the SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) or the Congress had been in power?” he asked. “The Opposition parties dislike action against mafia, all-round development, free connection of electricity in village, free ration to poor, better law and order situation,” Adityanath said in his 28-minute address, claiming actions taken by his government are a symbol of ‘Ram Rajya’. The ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ is scheduled to pass through Mathura, Aligarh, Hathras, Agra, Firozabad, Mainpuri, Etah, Kasganj, Badaun, Bareilly and Shahjahanpur before reaching Pilibhit on the night of December 31. The BJP’s six yatras — which were flagged off simultaneously on Sunday from Mathura, Bijnor, Jhansi, Ambedkar Nagar, Ballia and Ghazipur — will cover all 403 assembly constituencies of state ahead of the polls due in early next year. The party aims to communicate the achievements of the five-year BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh to the people in different parts of the state, said Nagendra Prasad Dubey, the convener of the yatra for Braj prant. On the occasion, Adityanath said he was in Mathura for the 19th time in his tenure as the chief minister and considered it as a blessing for him. Blaming the previous regime for tarnishing Mathura’s image, he claimed that there used to be riots in Kosi Kalan town of Mathura district. He even referred to violence at Jawahar Bagh in the heart of Mathura city on June 2, 2016 when 29 people, including two police officers, were killed in clashes between encroachers and police under the SP regime. In comparison, he claimed, there has not been a single riot in UP during the BJP rule. The chief minister first visited Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi temple after reaching Mathura on Sunday and said the state government was fully committed to preserving the “aastha” (faith) of people in Mathura, the land of Krishna. On Saturday, the income tax department conducted raids at the Vishal Khand, Gomtinagar (Lucknow) residence of Jainendra Yadav, who was the OSD when Akhilesh was the chief minister, Mau’s Sahadatpura residence of party spokesperson Rajiv Rai, the Mainpuri residence of prominent contractor Manoj Yadav, owner of RCL. A Lucknow-based businessman, too, was among those raided. Rajiv Rai, whose personal website described him as the most important person in Team Akhilesh, called the raids “politically motivated”. “Do they have the courage to carry out raids on other BJP leaders?” said Rai who was the SP’s Lok Sabha candidate for Ghosi in 2014 and is also the founder and chairman of AVK Group of Institutions, a chain in Bengaluru. The Congress has also criticised the raids. “This scared government is trying to scare rivals. But no one is going to be intimidated. Such raids will backfire on them just as they did in Karnataka and West Bengal polls. There too there were similar raids,” Anshu Awasthi, UP Congress spokesperson. However, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said that unlike past regimes, under BJP, the investigating agencies were free. “Those who have nothing to hide shouldn’t fear. The investigating agencies would check anyone including me, if they have reasonable grounds to do so. Why this brouhaha over these raids?” he asked. 
20-12-2021||India||J&K: LeT commander linked to civilian killings shot dead||A Pakistani group commander of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was killed in an encounter with security forces in Srinagar on Sunday, Jammu and Kashmir Police said. According to the police, the slain terrorist was identified as Saifulla alias Abu Khalid or Shawaz, a resident of Karachi in Pakistan, and he was affiliated with the proscribed terror outfit LeT. Inspector General of Police, Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar said, “He infiltrated in 2016 and was active in general area of Harwan (in Srinagar district) and involved in several terror crimes.” “With the elimination of Saifulla, three Pakistani terrorists have been killed so far in Srinagar city within almost a month. They were involved in several terror crime cases, which clearly shows that Pakistan is hell-bent to disturb the peace in Kashmir Valley especially in Srinagar city,” Kumar added. On Sunday morning, the police, Army and Central Reserve Police Force launched a joint operation based on specific information by the Srinagar police regarding the presence of a terrorist in Theed Harwan area of the district, a police spokesperson said. During the search operation, as the presence of the trapped terrorist was ascertained, he was given ample opportunities to surrender, the spokesperson added. “However, he denied the surrender opportunities and fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party, which was retaliated leading to an encounter. In the ensuing encounter, the trapped terrorist was killed and his body was retrieved,” the spokesperson said. The police said an AK-47 rifle, three magazines and a grenade were recovered from his possession. As per police records, Saifulla had infiltrated in 2016 via Bandipora Sector. “Later on, he sneaked into Srinagar district on the directions of Pakistan-based commanders of LeT outfit for intensifying terror activities in the districts of Pulwama, Srinagar, Ganderbal and Budgam,” the spokesperson said. The slain terrorist was working as a group commander of LeT in Srinagar district. “He was operating in Srinagar district earlier too and was familiar with the topography of Srinagar and Pulwama and their outskirts. He has also been involved in receiving new groups of foreign terrorists after infiltration,” the spokesperson added. The police said the slain terrorist had a history of terror crime cases and was wanted by law for his complicity in terror crime cases, which include attacks on police, security forces and killing of civilians. Saifulla, along with his associates, was involved in attack on an Army convoy at Bemina bypass on the national highway near JVC Hospital in Srinagar on April 1, 2017, in which three army jawans were injured, police said. “He was also the mastermind behind the attack carried out by his associates at Lawaypora Srinagar, in which two security personnel were martyred and one AK-47 rifle was snatched,” the spokesman said. The police said the terrorist was also involved in an attack on police party of PS Bandipora at Gulshan Chowk Bandipora in which two police personnel were killed. “He was also involved in killing of civilians, including BJP leader Waseem Bari, his brother and father on July 8 last year,” the spokesperson said. The police also claimed that he was also mastermind behind the revival of terror folds by luring the gullible youth and a number of fresh recruitments of local youth into terrorist ranks. “He was also instrumental in reactivation of hardcore terrorist associates of LeT outfit in the areas of Srinagar and Pulwama districts,” the police said. Meanwhile, security forces on Sunday arrested a terrorist associate in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir and seized ammunition from him, police said. “Anantnag Police and (Army’s) 1 RR (Rashtriya Rifles) arrested a terrorist associate, identified as Feroz Ahmad Zargar alias Kamraan, a resident of Gratbal Quimoh Kulgam,” a police spokesperson said. A Chinese Pistol along with a magazine and other ammunition were recovered from his possession, the spokesperson said, adding police have registered a case and an investigation has been initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-let-commander-linked-to-civilian-killings-shot-dead-101639937603713.html
20-12-2021||India||Day after incident, another man lynched over alleged sacrilege||A day after a man was killed over an alleged sacrilege bid at the Golden Temple, another unidentified person was beaten to death for allegedly disrespecting a Sikh religious flag at a gurdwara in Punjab’s Kapurthala district on Sunday, officials familiar with the matter said. Police, however, said there was “no visible sign” of sacrilege and it appeared as though the man had the intention of committing theft at the gurdwara.Providing details, Kapurthala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh said the incident took place in Nizampur village when villagers and members of Sikh organisations kept the man hostage and refused to hand him over to police despite repeated requests. Khakh said the villagers were infuriated after the man, who was believed to be in his 20s and a migrant worker, allegedly disrespected the Nishan Sahib (a Sikh flag) in the wee hours of the day. The gurdwara’s manager, Amarjit Singh, said he saw the man committing the sacrilege. Singh claimed the man attempted to flee but was caught by the gurdwara sewadars (volunteers) after a chase, the SSP said.“After a video of Singh narrating the early morning incident went viral on social media, a mob comprising villagers and members of Sikh groups gathered outside the gurdwara to punish the man,” Khakh said. On receiving information, police rushed to the spot and urged the Sikh groups to hand over the accused. As police tried to control the mob, a clash erupted and it was during this time that the protesters brutally thrashed the man, the SSP said.The man was rushed in a critically injured condition to the local civil hospital where doctors declared him “brought dead”. Meanwhile, three police personnel, including the station house officer of Shubanpur police station, were injured in the clash, police said. “They killed the youth even as police tried their level best to handle the situation,” the SSP said.The protesters, police said, claimed that various state governments had always failed to deliver justice in sacrilege incidents having taken place in the past. However, Jalandhar inspector general of police (IGP) Gurinder Singh Dhillon told reporters that a preliminary probe indicated that no sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, the religious book of the Sikhs, or other religious textbooks like Gutka Sahib had taken place. There was no visible sign of any disrespect to the Nishan Sahib, he said. “Still we have registered a case under section 295-A (hurting religious sentiments) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Kotwali police station, Kapurthala, on the basis of a complaint by the gurdwara’s manager. A probe is underway,” Dhillon said. Police said two school ID cards were found with the accused and a woman claimed that the cards belonged to her children.While the SSP had earlier said that a murder case would be registered against the accused, he and Dhillon later clarified that no separate case will be filed and the murder angle will be probed under the same FIR. 
20-12-2021||India||No surge in Covid-19 cases, but vulnerable lag in full vaccination||Over 150 cases of the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 have been detected in India so far. However, unlike the surge seen in South Africa after detection of the more infectious variant, there is no rapid rise in Omicron cases in India yet. But we have to keep in mind that India’s population is about 20 times that of South Africa. Are there local outbreaks in the country already? More importantly, how protected is India should an outbreak occur? Apart from transmissibility, Omicron is proving to be more resistant to vaccines than its predecessors. It means at least two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, if not a booster dose, might turn out to be a necessary tool in keeping the share of severe cases low and reducing hospitalizations. Here are four charts that explain how India is doing on these fronts.Currently no surge in cases and positivity rate, even at the district levelThe weekly average of daily Covid-19 cases was 7,117 on December 18, down from 8,673 on December 6 and 8,048 on December 12, and the lowest since the week ended May 31, 2020. There is, therefore, no surge in cases. However, as India is a large country, a rise in cases in one place can be offset by a larger decline in another. District data compiled by How India Lives shows that even such local outbreaks are not taking place currently. HT analysed the growth rate of cases at the district level between three dates, each two weeks apart, between November 16 and November 30, and between November 30 and December 14. The weekly average of cases grew in both fortnights for only 13 of the 707 districts for which data is available. Despite growth in cases over the past month, the seven-day average was less than 50 in all these 11 of the 13 districts. In Hyderabad and Bangalore, cases have grown and are more than 50. Last week’s average was 78 cases in Hyderabad and 187 cases in Karnataka.Is the low number of cases because of low testing? Cumulative tests have indeed fallen since the peak of the second wave but have not caused a high positivity rate. Positivity rate averaged 0.59% nationwide in the week ended December 15. The health ministry releases a list of districts with high weekly positivity rates. 25 districts had positivity rate above 5% in the week to December 15. 15 of these were from Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim, where cases are declining in all districts. Nine districts are from Kerala. In three of them – Pathanamthita, Kannuar and Kottayam – cases have increased in the past fortnight by 2%-10% after declining around 40%-50% the fortnight before. In Kolkata, where positivity rate was 5.9%, cases have declined 22% in the past fortnight.Second dose coverage is still low in about a third of districtsIndia is, however, ill-prepared in case there is a surge. Early studies suggest the Omicron variant might be more resistant to vaccines, HT reported on December 12 (https://bit.ly/3GIeNYS). Late last week, the first real-world evidence arrived of how vaccine efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 all but erodes in case of an infection with the Omicron variant, suggesting that boosters might be needed for those who have received Covishield jabs. This makes for speeding up full vaccination all the more necessary. 36% districts (229 of 628) are still lagging on this metric, with less than 50% adults fully vaccinated. Since official population projections are not available at the district level, HT has used the number of electors in the district at the time of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as a proxy for the adult population.A third of 45+ age group, half of rural India not fully vaccinatedCovid-19 vaccinations for those at 45 years and above, who are more vulnerable to severe disease and death, started on April 1, a month before those in the 18-45 years old age group began receiving jabs. Those with co-morbidities in the older age group were being jabbed even before April. Yet, 34% of the 45+ age group is not yet fully vaccinated, according to age-wise vaccination update of the health ministry on December 18. On the other hand, while there is only an eight percentage point difference in first dose coverage between the older and younger age groups, the gap in second dose coverage is wider at 17.2 percentage points. It means the young will also be vulnerable if Omicron proves to be more severe than its predecessors.The 45+ age group needs full vaccination and possibly boosters because they are vulnerable to severe disease. Rural India, on the other hand, is vulnerable because it lacks health facilities. While scaling up health infrastructure is a time-consuming and expensive exercise, vaccinations, which have to be inevitably given to every person, can be a pre-emptive tool against catastrophes. However, this group is also not sufficiently covered with full vaccination. Only 55% of the population in rural districts is fully vaccinated, compared to 60% in mixed districts, and 73% in urban areas. Districts with the share of rural population below 40% in the 2011 census are considered urban, those with more than 60% rural population are considered rural, and the rest are considered mixed. While rural areas are indeed getting more doses per million population now than urban areas, this reversal has happened only in late October.Past vaccination rates suggest we can speed up to cover the vulnerableThere is no reason why these vulnerable groups cannot be vaccinated at a faster rate. India administered over 236 million doses in September. In October and November, only 173 and 178 million doses were administered. While the speed in December so far looks to surpass the rate of the past two months – 135 million doses have been administered so far – it will be important to keep this rate up, possibly by reaching out to the elderly, and those in remote and rural areas.Also read | Omicron could be behind Delhi's Covid cases spike; Feb, March ‘convenient’ for virus: AIIMS professor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-surge-in-covid-cases-but-vulnerable-lag-in-full-vaccination-101639937062985.html
20-12-2021||India||Upset at low price, MP farmer sets dozens of kilos of garlic on fire||A farmer set fire to dozens of kilograms of garlic at a farm produce market in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur after his harvest failed to fetch what he thought was a fair price.Shankar Singh, a farmer from Mahidpur in Ujjain, was offered around ₹1,400 per 100kg for his garlic crop at an auction in Mandsaur Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti on Saturday because the quality was poor, market inspector Jagdish Babar said on Sunday.Over 8,000 sacks of garlic arrived at the market on Saturday, which were sold between ₹1,000 and ₹12,000 per 100kg, depending on the quality, he said.“Angry that his crop fetched such a low rate, the farmer set some 50-60kg of garlic on fire,” Babar said. Average quality garlic was sold between ₹2,500 and ₹5,500 per 100kg, the market official said.Singh, a resident of Deoli village in Ujjain, however, said he burnt nearly 150kg of garlic of the 200kg that he took to the market. “I invested nearly ₹30,000 in garlic cultivation, but I was only getting ₹2,000 after the auction,” he said, adding that he did not have the money to take back the produce and store it.“I do not want any bonus from the government, just the right price for my crop,” Singh said.A video of the incident circulating on social media showed people standing around the burning heap of garlic and shouting patriotic slogans.“The rate of garlic, which had been increased to ₹20,000 per quintal (100kg) a few months ago, has now decreased to ₹1,400 to ₹12,000 as per the quality of the garlic,” market secretary Parvat Singh Sisodiya said.“But nothing happened on Saturday to upset the farmers so much,” Sisodiya said. He filed a complaint with Yashodharman police, alleging that the incident was planned.“Police are investigating as mandi secretary filed a complaint with the Yashodharman police station,” Mandsaur superintendent of police Sunil Kumar Pandey said.The state government should pay heed to the incident as “Mandsaur was a centre of farmers protest in 2017,” a local farmer leader said.“Mandsaur is stated to be one of the biggest mandis in the state and farmers from neighbouring districts sell their produce here. Farmers usually get a good price for their garlic, but now they are facing difficulties in even getting the cost price,” said Paramjeet Singh. “The state government should pay attention to it because Mandsaur was a centre of farmers protest in 2017, which later turned violent and claimed lives of six farmers.”He was referring to the farmers’ agitation that began from Mandsaur produce market in 2017, where farmers sought better prices for their produce. Within days, the protests turned violent and six farmers died.“We came to know about the incident and will take action accordingly,” said Bharat Singh Kushwaha, the state’s horticulture minister. “We will ensure that farmers do not face any loss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upset-at-low-price-mp-farmer-sets-dozens-of-kilos-of-garlic-on-fire-101639937002943.html
20-12-2021||India||Punjab forms SIT to probe sacrilege bid at Golden Temple||The Punjab government has formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged sacrilege attempt at the Golden Temple on Saturday, deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said on Sunday, even as the police continued their efforts to ascertain the identity of the man who was beaten to death soon after the incident.Randhawa, who also holds the home portfolio, held a meeting with the deputy commissioner, the police commissioner, the inspector general of police (border range), the Amritsar rural SSP and other officials.Calling the incident “most unfortunate”, he said the SIT has been constituted under the deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal, which would submit its report in two days.Also read | Day after Golden Temple sacrilege attempt, Punjab CM blames ‘bad elements’The accused, Randhawa said, entered the shrine “with a target” and spent a few hours at the holiest shrine of the Sikhs.“It has also come to the fore during our preliminary investigation that the accused entered the Sri Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) complex at 11.30am and he stayed near the Parikarma of the shrine, which suggested that the accused was here with a target. He also slept in front of the Akal Takht for some time,” he said.A case under Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the unidentified accused, Amritsar police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill said on Sunday. Section 307 for attempt to murder has also been added in the FIR as the accused, before being pulled away, picked up a diamond-encrusted sword placed in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, Gill said.In videos of the incident, which were widely circulated on social media on Saturday, the man can be seen jumping across the railings inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple, picking up the sword and approaching the priest who was reciting evening prayers. He was caught by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) task force members.When he was being taken to the SGPC office, angry pilgrims grabbed him and beat him to death before police arrived.Randhawa said he spoke to the SGPC president and the Akal Takht jathedar (head priest) after the incident.The man was yet to be identified, he said.“No mobile phone, no wallet, no identity card or Aadhaar card was found on him,” the deputy chief minister said.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who visited the shrine on Sunday, alleged that some “inimical” forces may be involved in the incident in view of the upcoming Assembly polls. “I appeal to the sangat that they should pay special attention to take care of religious places—temples and gurdwaras—and institutions of all religions. People should maintain peace and mutual brotherhood,” said Channi.The state is scheduled to go to the polls early next year.If anyone has come with wrong intention, our intelligence agencies will try to nab and expose them, he said. “We will go to the bottom of the incident,” Channi said.Randhawa told the media that video footage from CCTV cameras inside the Golden Temple and markets adjoining the shrine was being examined for more details about the accused.The deputy chief minister said the state government would write to the Centre seeking approval to amendments in Section 298 and 295-A of the Indian Penal Code, as resolved by Punjab Assembly in 2018.Under Section 295 and 295-A, the offence is punishable with a a sentence of two and three years, respectively.The amendment resolved by the assembly added provisions for imprisonment of 10 years for anyone committing sacrilege against the sacred symbols of any religion, he said.(With agency inputs)
20-12-2021||India||Yellow alert in Capital as mercury dips below 4°C||Cold wave conditions were recorded in parts of the National Capital Region, with the temperature falling below 4 degrees Celsius in some areas of the city on Sunday for the first time this winter, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Although Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded the season’s minimum of 4.6 degrees, which was three notches below normal, the temperature fell to 3.3 degrees at Jafarpur and 3.6 degrees at Lodhi Road, IMD said. A yellow alert is issued to ask the people in an area to remain vigilant about the weather conditions.Several parts of northwest India recorded subzero temperatures. Both the day’s high and low were several notches below normal in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir. The cold wave is likely to remain till Wednesday, the weather office said, and conditions may improve slightly after that.Day temperatures in Delhi on Monday will likely be around 19 degrees Celsius since wind speeds are falling. Night temperatures in the Capital are expected to hover around 4 degrees, according to the forecast.The Safdarjung observatory recorded a high of 19.2 degrees, three degrees below normal. The maximum temperature fell to just 16.2 degrees at Mayur Vihar and 16.5 degrees at Jafarpur on Sunday.“We saw cold wave conditions at Lodhi Road and Jafarpur,” Met department scientist RK Jenamani said. “Similarly, we saw cold day conditions in some parts of Delhi, even though Safdarjung’s maximum was just three degrees below normal.”The weather department declares a cold day if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees below normal. It announces a cold wave if the day’s low is either 4.5 degrees below normal, or is below 4 degrees.Since the north wind is slowing, temperatures may rise slightly in the coming days. “Wind speed, which was around 30-40kmph on Saturday, dropped to 10-15kmph on Sunday, and will decline further on Monday,” Jenamani said. “This will make the day slightly more bearable.”Sikar in east Rajasthan recorded minus 2.5 degrees, 8.5 degrees below normal. Churu in the western part of the desert state recorded minus 2.6 degrees, 8.4 degrees below normal. Amritsar in Punjab saw minus 0.5 degrees, 4.3 degrees below normal, and a maximum of 15.5 degrees, 5 degrees below normal. Bathinda recorded 0.1 degree, 3.5 degrees below normal and a maximum of 17.6, 4 degrees below normal.“Very cold and dry northerly winds are blowing over the entire northwestern region, which is bringing down both night and day temperatures,” said DS Pai, head of climate research at the Met department’s Pune office. “This may abate after December 22.”“Ground frost is expected in all areas recording subzero temperatures,” Jenamani said. “We have issued a warning for its impact on agriculture.”Saturday was Delhi’s first cold day of the season, when the maximum fell to just 17.8 degrees at Safdarjung, five below notches normal. The minimum was 6 degrees.Harsh conditions are expected on Monday but Delhi could get a respite between December 22 and 25, with a fresh western disturbance set to influence the region, according to Mahesh Palawat, vice president at private forecaster Skymet.“From December 21, we will see a slight rise in temperature, and from December 22, there will be a change in wind direction to the southeast,” Palawat said. “Once the cold northwesterly winds stop blowing, we will automatically see both maximum and minimum rise by 2-3 degrees.”The high winds in the past few days helped disperse some of Delhi’s pollutants, and air quality improved marginally. The Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday was 271, categorised as “poor”, the Central Pollution Control Board said in its daily bulletin at 4pm. It stood at 291 (“poor”) on Saturday as well.Experts said the respite could be temporary. “Wind speed is dropping, and under the influence of a cold wave, the air is becoming heavier, and pollutants will find it harder to disperse,” said Gufran Beig, project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research.High AQI values mean people could experience breathing discomfort and the pollution watchdog suggests limiting prolonged exposure by staying indoors.No significant change in minimum temperatures is likely over most parts of northwest India, Gujarat and Maharashtra in the next two days, the weather office said. It may rise by 2-3 degrees from Wednesday. A gradual fall in minimum temperatures by 2-3 degree is likely over most parts of east and adjoining central India in the next three days.Cold wave conditions are likely in some parts of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on Monday. Cold day conditions are likely in a few pockets in Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.Dense morning fog is likely over Uttarakhand in the next two days and over Punjab and Haryana on December 23 and 24. Ground frost in the morning is likely in some areas of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the foothills of Himalayas in the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yellow-alert-in-capital-as-mercury-dips-below-4c-101639936943000.html
20-12-2021||India||UP govt tapping SP leaders’ phones, alleges Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath of getting telephones and mobile phones of his party leaders tapped and listening to the conversations every evening.Addressing a press conference at the party’s state headquarters in Lucknow, the SP chief said, “All the SP office phones and the mobile phones of all those associated with us are being listened to. The chief minister, every evening, himself listens to the recording of the phone conversations taken to him by the officers.”“If this chief minister works 24 hours a day, what else does he do? Work generally finishes by the evening,” Yadav said.When asked who was giving instructions to officers for allegedly tapping phones of SP leaders, Yadav said it was being done at the orders of the “un-upyogi” (useless) government and “un-upyogi mukhya mantri (chief minister)”.The SP leader also said that if returned to power, his government will “turn the bulldozers on such police officers. Some people are engaged in keeping him (the CM) happy during his last days in power.”Uttar Pradesh will go to assembly polls in February-March next year.Yadav said the “fear of imminent defeat” in the 2022 assembly elections was nagging the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The fear of the defeat first spurred the BJP to bring in big leaders, Union ministers in UP (for campaigning), then using central agencies against the SP leaders. They have brought in the income-tax department and will bring in ED, CBI and other agencies in the days to come. The BJP government at the Centre had been using these tactics in the non-BJP ruled states to win power. In UP, they are using it to try to prevent the SP from returning to power,” claimed Yadav.When asked if he would complain about it at an appropriate forum, Yadav said: “No, we will not go anywhere. We will simply oust this government. People are restive to throw away this government and bring the SP back to power. They are eagerly waiting for the poll notification and the voting dates.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after laying the foundation stone of the Ganga Expressway in Shahjahanpur on Saturday, had praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath for “eliminating” mafias and undertaking a lot of developmental work in the state, saying “UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi.”.Yadav’s reference to the chief minister as “un-upyogi” was seen as a counter to Modi’s “UP+Yogi=Upyogi”.On Saturday’s income-tax raids on some SP leaders, the former chief minister said: “If this government thinks that the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will halt because of I-T raids, then it is mistaken. The raids have proved that the SP is coming to power. Vijay Rath will stop only when people elect the SP government.”Yadav’s Vijay Yatra has completed seven phases so far. During the yatra, the SP chief has been campaigning from a motorised rath (bus). The eighth phase of the yatra, covering Mainpuri to Etah, will begin on Tuesday.Rajiv Rai, one of the SP leaders whose houses/establishments were raided by the I-T department, shared the dais with the party chief at the press conference. Rai, who is also a SP spokesperson, said: “For the last 20 years, I had been filing all the relevant papers with the income tax department. Why did the department not do any procedural thing then? It’s obvious they are trying to intimidate us, scare us. But we are Samajwadis (socialists) and can’t be scared.”According to information, the I-T department on Saturday searched the premises of SP leaders Jainendra Yadav “Nitu”, a close aide of Akhilesh Yadav (in Vishal Khand, Gomti Nagar), the party’s spokesperson Rajiv Rai (Sahadatpura premises in Mau and also in Bengaluru, Karnataka) and another SP leader and contractor Manoj Yadav (Vanshi Ghora, Mainpuri).Needs BJP reax
20-12-2021||India||Service of humanity is India’s identity: Modi during Goa visit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Goa would have been liberated from Portuguese rule much earlier had the country’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel lived for some more time.Modi, who arrived on a day-long visit to the poll-bound state, was speaking at an event on the occasion of Goa Liberation Day, at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium here, when he said: “Had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel been alive for a little more time, Goa would have been liberated earlier.” Patel, who served as deputy prime minister in the Jawaharlal Nehru cabinet, died on December 15, 1950. He is credited with the liberation of Marathwada region in Maharashtra from erstwhile Nizam’s rule. Modi said the state came under Portugal rule when a majority of the country was ruled by Mughals, but centuries later, neither has Goa forgotten its Indianness, nor has India forgotten Goa. “People from all corners of India came and joined hands together. Goa was conquered by the Portuguese at a time when, in another part of the country, the Mughals had an empire. Since then, the country has seen so many political storms… despite the passage of time and changes in power, Goa did not forget its Indianness nor did India forget its Goa,” he told the gathering. “From the Cuncolim rebellion to the Maratha conflict led by Chatrapati Shivai Maharaj and Sambhaji, there were efforts to free Goa. The Pinto revolt was led by the native Christians. This is the identity of India. Service of humanity. The efforts were made from so many corners. The country became independent before Goa. Most people of India had got their rights. Now they had the time to live their own dream, yet so many freedom fighters gave up on all this and continued to struggle and sacrifice themselves for Goa’s freedom,” he said. In the past, several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders had blamed Nehru for the delay in liberation of Goa.On December 19, 1961, Indian armed forces freed the coastal state from Portuguese rule in an operation codenamed ‘Operation Vijay’ after all diplomatic efforts between India and Portugal to get the former imperial power to relinquish control of Goa failed. To mark the day, the Prime Minister paid tributes to freedom fighters, both from and outside Goa who sacrificed their lives for the Liberation Movement, at the martyr’s memorial here. He also felicitated others freedom fighters and veterans of ‘Operation Vijay’ at the function. He witnessed a fly past and sail parade at Miramar.Modi also inaugurated multiple development projects, worth ₹650 crore, including a superspeciality block of Goa Medical College and Hospital and the renovated Fort Aguada jail museum.“Goa needs to make a new resolution. You should ask yourselves where you want Goa to be by the time it celebrates 75 years of Liberation. Make new resolutions. It needs continuity. It should stay the same in the future. We should not stop. We need to not decrease our speed (of development),” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/service-of-humanity-is-india-s-identity-modi-during-goa-visit-101639936165569.html

20-12-2021||India||Transforming the criminal justice system||Project Unlearn started by Tycia Foundation is about developing context based educational and life skills material which aims to bridge the gap between the existing literacy programs initiated inside the prison to improve education level among inmates.Eleena George, Prison Reformation Lead, co- founded ‘Project Unlearn’ with the vision to reduce Gender Based Violence. With great motivation she became a Second Chance fellow where she got the opportunity to work with Tihar prison inmates. She leads operations at Tihar Jail, manages teaching and training of Peer fellows inside the prison school. She is focussed on creating a contextual correctional educational kit with the support of the inmates to prevent crime against women by closely working with ‘at risk youth’. While on the other hand, Saanchi M, is Co-founder and CEO at TYCIA Foundation. She previously worked for institutions like Ambedkar University’s Centre for Early Childhood Education Department (New Delhi) and Room to Read India. She has also played a role of facilitator in social entrepreneurship & leadership programs like Jagriti Yatra, WeCan and Pravah’s Changelooms.Q.1 What is the vision behind Tycia Foundation?Saanchi M: TYCIA Foundation has been working in this domain since the year 2017. The initial years went by trying to understand the geography and identifying the existing gaps. Gradually as we started creating a team to work in this field we realized that it is important to identify more change-makers and leaders from various walks of life who are passionate about prison reformation and can bring a new lens of innovation to the system. The biggest issue we are working on is to overhaul the ill equipped prison and criminal justice ecosystem, why it needs structural change within and who will lead it. This led to the initiation of the Second Chance Fellowship, which aims to create a platform and opportunity for individuals who are passionate about working towards transforming the state of the criminal justice system from macro to micro-level. Many micro-enterprises have been formed as an outcome of the fellowship which envisions resolving at least one long pending prison system issues. Better life Prison School is a full day long operational school which includes functional literacy, wage/self-skill training, life skill training, drug de-addiction and healthcare support inside prison. Project Unlearn, a context-based education and life skills intervention for young incarcerated men which aims to end gender based violence and crime by intensive workshops and sessions inside prisons and communities. Kunji - a Prison Helpline-Facilitating ex-inmates over phone with help of a location-wise data of various NGOs and government institutions that are working on issues that ex-inmates face, like Drug De-addiction, Mental health, Housing/Food/Clothing, Employment, Conflict Resolution, Life-Skills, Legal-Aid, Education. Project Rihai - A crowdfunding platform to get people out on bail who have completed their sentence and do not have money to provide bail. It is only done for inmates who are recommended by prison staff on the account of reformed behaviour in their prison time and do not have any financial support from families.Q.2 What encourages you to work for this cause?Eleena George: I started my journey with the TYCIA foundation as an intern and later went on to pursue a year-long fellowship (Second chance fellowship) and realized that prison is often neglected geography which needs even more attention. I started to build interaction with incarcerated males especially booked under crime against women to understand their world view and create a better fitted solution. Upon a realization and completion of my fellowship I persevered to create a safe space on the topics such as sexual consent, toxic masculinity and other topics related to violence and crime against women that are usually not discussed in the prison premises became my motivation to pursue something which was challenging but crucial. It is given that the rampant increase in acts of crime and violence against women coupled with high recidivism rates in India highlights the need to sensitize boys and young men on gender-related issues, crimes, and violence. The peer leaders were identified inside the prison that not only helped in creating a contextual curriculum called Pehal kit but were also trained to become facilitators. They conducted workshops and sessions on such topics in order to sensitize and prevent fellow inmates from inducing violence and strengthen the voices of youth about inequalities, nurturing them into change agents to prevent gender-based violence and crimes. Being able to create a safe space among men with the support of peer leaders to openly discuss and address these social issues became my motivation to continue to work in this field.Q.3 Tell us about your experience working with these delinquent individuals?Eleena George: My experience of working with my students in the prison has definitely changed the way I view the reformation and correctional institutions. Interaction with prison officials and different stakeholders in a prison setting helped me view the criminal justice system from their perspective. Every day in the prison is new learning as the challenges of teaching inside are different from that of any mainstream school or any community outside. Since it’s been four years now I often end up meeting ex-inmates in public places. It is interesting to see ex-inmates who were part of our program during their stay in the prison now volunteering and interning with us. Being in touch with them and seeing them wanting to live a life away from crime is truly a motivation and reinforces the idea of reformation and behavioral change. Q.4 How have these prisoners helped with Tycia’s programmes?Saanchi M: The peer leaders are identified inside the prison who work closely with us in facilitating all the activities in the prison. It helps to bring forth their leadership skills and mark their journey as change makers in prison as well as their community. They had a huge role in designing contextual educational content to sensitize men on gender-based violence and crime and taking classes with teachers. Post their release they continued to partake in workshops and sessions which were organized by us. During the lockdown, they supported the team in COVID relief work like Distribution of ration kit, masks, oxygen cylinder, and concentrators. They supported and led the project on creating awareness about vaccination in several communities. Helping people to book their slots and helping them with commuting from their home to the vaccination centers. Ex-inmates also supported fellow inmates who were released during the lockdown to depopulate the prison with transportation and ration. Q.5 What activities do you engage in?Eleena George: I support designing, implementing and co-leading the prison reformation interventions with my colleagues Gauri and Tabish. Moreover, I am leading ‘Project Unlearn’ which is an offshoot from Second Chance Fellowship and have created educational content to sensitize boys and young men on gender-based violence and crime by training men on conducting workshops and sessions in the prison and communities. Its primary initiative aims to address negative gender-based socializations, harmful gender norms and rape culture in correctional institutions and at-risk communities by creating safe spaces for boys and young men to discuss and understand gender-based violence at a deeper level. Q.6 What are the future plans of the organisation?The future plans for the organization is-· To identify more change makers who are passionate and driven to work in the field of criminal justice system · To work in more prisons and create a second layer of change makers in the prison. · To work in more communities where crime rates are high and prevent men from inducing violence on women.· To support/incubate new ideas and interventions of social entrepreneurs wanting to work towards transforming the criminal justice system.

20-12-2021||Today's||Is the Indian family letting women down?||The second phase of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) findings was released a few weeks ago. Media coverage focused on the finding that seven out of 10 women in 11 states and one Union Territory surveyed did not report violence, and furthermore, many did not think it was a big deal.
20-12-2021||Today's||Kashi Vishwanath Dham: A tribute to our heritage||On December 13, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham. This unique project befits the civilisational city that Kashi is, and the historic Kashi Vishwanath temple. Highlighting the significance and antiquity of Kashi, Mark Twain wrote, “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together.” With the project’s inauguration, PM Modi rededicated one of the most ancient living cities on our planet and the epicentre of Hinduism and our age-old civilisation, Kashi or Varanasi, to the global world. An amalgamation of antiquity and continuity, Kashi belongs to all of humanity.It is regarded as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. While other ancient cities around the world could not survive the imperial and colonial onslaughts, Kashi carries on with its characteristic fervour. This makes the city truly significant and unique. Through its continuity, this city signals its firm resilience to retain its cultural, artistic, and educational identity even in the face of barbaric invasions and onslaughts. Kashi Vishwanath Dham reflects a solemn vow to rise above the tyrannical past of this city. In other words, it is a humble effort to rejuvenate the age-old spiritual, educational and creative heritage of this land. History has taken a new turn on the pretext of this Dham. It is perhaps the first time in history that a thousand years of injustice has been undone without any extirpation, depredation or any sense of retribution. It has been achieved solely through construction and creation. Kashi has been known through the ages as the city of mukti (liberation). People from all over are drawn to Kashi, seeking liberation. This project though is an attempt to celebrate the liberation of Kashi itself. This vision, and efforts of PM Modi, has brought back the millennia-old glory to the Kashi Vishwanath temple.The Kashi Vishwanath Dham is a project for all of humanity. For it is a celebration of the continuance of civilisation itself. Thus, it is a project for the entire world. The Hindu pantheon recognises the Holy Trinity of Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe, Lord Vishnu, the protector of the universe, and Lord Shiva, the liberator of the universe. Kashi evokes utmost reverence because it is one of the abodes of Lord Shiva. This is the religious and spiritual importance of Kashi. On Constitution Day this year, PM Modi said, “It was a compulsion for India and for many countries of the world to live in the shackles of colonialism for many generations. Since India’s independence, a post-colonial period started all over the world and many countries became independent. Today there is no country in the world that apparently exists as a colony of another country. But this does not mean that the colonial mindset has ceased to exist.”So, it is imperative for humanity, which survived colonialism for many generations, to decolonise itself, to become independent. Historically, besides many other things, plunder and demolition have been the main tools and objectives, means, and ends of colonisation. Naturally, civilisations with treasures of wealth, knowledge, and archaeology were the prime attractions for such barbaric hordes. Coming back to Kashi. That this legendary ancient city has been a constant victim of plundering and looting, demolition and destruction suggests the kind of fabulous destination it must have been. This is also attested by the specimens of glorious antiquities from Kashi scattered in museums and private collections across the world. The city of Kashi in general, and Kashi Vishwanath temple in particular, were demolished and constructed several times in the past. Initially, the Kashi Vishwanath temple was destroyed by Ghurid Turk Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak and was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant. The story of destruction and reconstruction continued till 1780, when, according to a legend, Lord Shiva appeared in the dream of the great Maratha Queen Ahilyabai Holkar and she became a devotee of him and rebuild this temple. According to another legend, it was the attack on this city which prompted the great Shivaji Maharaj to take up the sword. It is said that the demolition of Kashi Vishwanath Temple by Aurangzeb made Shivaji Maharaj’s mother Jijabai so furious that she dared him to capture Sinhagad, a fort under Mughal control. The rest is history. The rejuvenation of the temple complex is not just another step to break out of the colonial hangover, but also symbolises the primacy of civilisation over barbarity, the reassertion of a seat of knowledge, and the victory of reverence over savagery. The project is an effort to achieve these laudable goals through a constructive approach, while ensuring complete harmony. This presents an example for all humankind to see, even, follow. May our Kashi continue to flourish and prosper and may Lord Shiva bless us all with his divinity and glory.Anurag Thakur is Union minister for youth affairs and sports; and information broadcastingThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/kashi-vishwanath-dham-a-tribute-to-our-heritage-101640011167761.html

It’s worse when an official document uses a slur to describe those men who aren’t. The Communist Party of China (CPC) clearly knows what it wants its men to be – “wolf warriors” and not “little fresh meat”, a popular online adjective in China used to describe young and androgynous male celebrities.
20-12-2021||Editorials||Punjab: The volatile mix of politics and religion||In Punjab, politics and religion make for a volatile mix, often with serious consequences, evident in the state’s tumultuous past. The two alleged desecrations at Sikh shrines this past week, followed by the lynching of two accused, have revived a sense of foreboding weeks away from the assembly polls. There is disquiet because Punjab is a border state, which successfully fought off an insurgency in the 1980s (although there have been sporadic efforts, from Pakistan and extremist Sikh groups based in other countries, to revive the demand for a Sikh state). There is disquiet because Punjab, in many ways, is India’s first line of defence, and one of its most important agrarian states. There is disquiet because Punjab, the heart of the 14-month-long farm protest that saw the repeal of three farm laws, is headed into elections where, right now, the field seems wide open.
20-12-2021||Editorials||The Aadhaar-voter ID link||Amendments to the election law to allow the interlinking of Aadhaar and the voter identity database were cleared by the Lok Sabha amid resistance from the Opposition. The idea to use the biometrics-based identity to clean up electoral rolls goes back more than five years, when the Election Commission (EC) carried out pilot projects to remove unverifiable entries in some states. That process was halted by the Supreme Court (SC) months later and upheld in a final order in the Puttaswamy judgment of 2017 that made the right to privacy a fundamental right for Indians. Since then, the government has enacted new rules to create a legal basis for collection of Aadhaar beyond the purposes enumerated in the top court’s ruling.
