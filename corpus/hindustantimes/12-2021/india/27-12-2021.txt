27-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 28, 2004 — Tsunami toll 25,000; 7,000 in India||New Delhi/Colombo – RESCUERS PILED up bodies along southern Asian coastlines devastated by tidal waves that obliterated seaside towns and killed about 25,000 people in nine countries, and officials indicated on Monday that the death toll could climb far higher. Hundreds of children were buried in mass graves in India, and morgues and hospitals struggled to cope with the catastrophe. Somalia, some 4,800 km away, reported hundreds of deaths. The death toll rose sharply a day after the magnitude 9 quake struck deep beneath the Indian Ocean off the coast of Indonesia. Walls of water sped away from the quake’s epicenter at more than 800 kmph before crashing into the region’s shorelines, sweeping people and fishing villages out to sea. The governments of Indonesia and Thailand conceded that public warnings came too late or not at all. But officials insisted they could not know the seriousness of the threat because no tsunami warning system exists for the Indian Ocean. The international Red Cross said it was concerned about water-borne diseases like malaria and cholera. Rescuers converged on beaches and islands throughout the region to search for survivors, and offers of aid poured in from around the globe, as troops in the region struggled to deliver urgently needed aid to afflicted areas. The toll in Sri Lanka was over 12,000, India reported about 6,800 deaths and Indonesia 5,000. Thailand said hundreds of people were dead and thousands more were missing. Deaths also were reported in Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Somalia. In Delhi, the UPA government announced an allocation of ₹500 crore for the National Calamity Contingency Fund towards relief and rehabilitation in the affected states. The Centre had earlier announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹1 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-december-28-2004-tsunami-toll-25-000-7-000-in-india-101640629371727.html

The charge d’affaires of the Indian high commission was summoned to the foreign ministry in Islamabad and asked to convey the Pakistan government’s serious concerns “over the widely reported open calls by Hindutva proponents for carrying out genocide of Indian Muslims”, an official statement said. Police in Haridwar registered a case on Thursday after videos of the three-day Dharma Sansad held during December 17-19 caused a furore since several seers participating in the event had called for violence against minorities. There was no response from the Indian side to the summoning of the diplomat by Pakistan’s Foreign Office. The Pakistani side impressed upon the Indian government that it was “highly reprehensible” that the seers who made the calls for violence had “neither expressed any regret nor the Indian government has condemned or taken any action against them so far”, the statement said. The reported hate speeches were viewed with grave concern by civil society and a cross-section of people in Pakistan, the statement said. A “toxic narrative against minorities, particularly Muslims and their persecution” has become a norm, and such incitement to violence had preceded riots in New Delhi in February 2020, the statement added. “India is expected to investigate these hate speeches and incidents of widespread violence against minorities, particularly Muslims and their houses of worship and take measures to stop such incidents from recurring in future,” the statement said. Pakistan asked India to ensure the safety, security and wellbeing of its minorities, including protection of their religious places and way of life.Relations between India and Pakistan are currently at an all-time low and the Indian side has summoned Pakistani diplomats in New Delhi several times in recent months to protest against instances of oppression of Pakistan’s Hindu minority and attacks on Hindu temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-foreign-ministry-summons-indian-diplomat-over-dharma-sansad-speeches-101640628951440.html

Judge says charge her with perjury||BHUBANESWAR: A 21-year-old woman who accused four men of raping her faces prosecution for perjury after she retracted her allegations against the four during the trial in a fast-track Odisha court, Kandhamal district public prosecutor Bijay Patnaik said on Monday.Judge Bhaskar Chandra Sahu acquitted the four men accused of gang rape after she turned hostile and ordered that the woman be tried under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which relates to giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding. It is punishable by a maximum jail term of three years and fine.“Prima facie, the judge concluded that the victim suppressed the truth of her own allegation though she is legally bound to state the truth. She deposed falsehood intentionally. She needs to be prosecuted under section 193 of IPC,” Patnaik said, citing the judge’s operative portion of the order pronounced in court on Friday.The public prosecutor said in May 2020, the woman alleged that four young men raped her when she was on her way to her cousin’s house. She filed a complaint four days after the alleged crime, and the police arrested the four accused within three days.The woman’s statement was recorded by the police as well as by a judicial magistrate under section 164 of the criminal procedure code.Statements of several witnesses were also recorded by the police which backed her allegations.“However, during the trial, she backtracked and denied everything that she alleged. She even categorically denied giving any statements to the police and judicial magistrate,” said Patnaik.The judge not only ordered her prosecution for giving false evidence but also directed that any compensation due to the woman under any government scheme should be put on hold till proceedings under section 193 for giving false evidence are completed. The district legal services authority, Phulbani can later decide the entitlement of the victim as per the law. The court, which cleared the four men, said the woman’s initial complaint wasn’t wrong but there was no evidence against the four, Patnaik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-woman-raped-by-4-backtracked-in-court-judge-says-charge-her-with-perjury-101640626193558.html

27-12-2021||India||Sidhu says MLA can make cops 'wet their pants', officer sends defamation notice||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has courted controversy while praising two party members, allegedly saying that they are capable of making policemen wet their pants.Former chief minister Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Daljit Singh Cheema slammed him over the purported remark and a Chandigarh police officer sent him a defamation notice."I have sent a defamation notice to him for humiliating the police," Chandigarh Deputy Superintendent of Police Dilsher Singh Chandel said.A sub-inspector also issued a video message condemning the remark.Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu has backed the policemen and praised them for their role during militancy and COVID-19 times.The controversy erupted after Sidhu, at a recent rally in Sultanpur Lodhi while pointing towards sitting MLA Navtej Singh Cheema, said he can "make a 'thanedar' (policeman) wet his pants".He repeated the remark at a rally in Batala on Sunday while praising local leader Ashwani Sekhri who was standing by his side.When reporters asked him about his remark, Sidhu indicated that it should not be taken literally.He said it's a way of saying that these Congress leaders "wield authority".A video clip of Sidhu making the remark went viral on social media inviting sharp reaction from some police officials and political leaders.Punjab Lok Congress president and former chief minister Amarinder Singh said it was sad that the men in uniform were being disrespected."Sad to see our men in uniform being disrespected. 1700 @PunjabPoliceInd personnel sacrificed their lives to bring the state out of the dark days and now they are being mocked by @INCPunjab leaders & above all their President. Shameful! A leader must give respect to earn respect," Amarinder Singh said in a tweet.SAD's Daljit Singh Cheema questioned the "silence" of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa over Sidhu's remark.He asked both of them to tell Sidhu that he should refrain from making such a remark and ask him to withdraw his statement and seek apology from the police.Chandigarh DSP Chandel dubbed Sidhu's remark as "shameful"."It is very shameful that such a senior leader uses these words for his own force and humiliates them," Chandel said."This is the same force which protects him (Sidhu) and his family," he said in a video message.He even dared Sidhu to return his force deployed for his protection."Without (security) force, even a rickshaw puller will not listen to him," he said."I strongly condemn this remark and he (Sidhu) should not use such words for his force. The force has its own dignity and respect and it is our responsibility to maintain this dignity," he said.In a video message, Sub-Inspector Balbir Singh, posted in Jalandhar (Rural), said, "Such language was used by a senior leader against us, I strongly condemn it."He also requested the Punjab DGP not to allow the image of police to be affected."We live with our families in the society and our children question us why such language is being used against us," Balbir Singh said.He said this remark was not against any 'thanedar' but against the entire police force."I want to tell Sidhu Sahib that we are not cowards. We are brave and the whole country knows about the tales of our bravery," he said as he recalled the role of police against militancy.Without caring for their own lives, the personnel of the Punjab police provided food to the needy at their homes during the COVID-19 outbreak, he added.Commenting on the videos of the Chandigarh DSP and the sub-inspector, Ludhiana MP Bittu lauded the Punjab police for its role in eliminating terrorism from the state.Bittu, whose grandfather and the then chief minister Beant Singh died in a bomb blast in 1995, said, "Some videos of a DSP and sub-inspector have gone viral. First of all whatever has been said about the police, I seek apology," he said."I know it is Punjab police personnel, from senior IPS officer to the constable level, which did not care for their own lives and curbed terrorism with iron hand," Bittu wrote on his Facebook page.Bittu said during the COVID-19 outbreak, the police force personnel took food to the homes of people.Referring to the Ludhiana court bomb blast, he said it was the Punjab police which reached the spot first."How will they protect people if we use wrong words against them. It was very important that we stand by them," he said."We are proud of you and we salute you," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-says-mla-can-make-cops-wet-their-pants-officer-sends-defamation-notice-101640622495443.html

The meeting was held hours after Rajesh Bhushan and senior health officials held a meeting with the Election Commission of India discuss the prevailing Covid situation for upcoming assembly elections.While Uttarakhand and Goa have reported vaccination coverage for the first and second doses higher than the national average, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Manipur have Covid-19 vaccination coverage numbers below the national average.A total of 142.38 crore vaccination doses have been administered so far, of which more than 83.80 crore vaccine doses are for the first dose and more than 58.58 crore are second doses of the vaccine, the statement said.The states were advised to speedily ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination of the eligible population for the first dose and ensure that those who were due for the second dose are administered the second dose.The states have also been told to draw up district-wise weekly vaccination implementation plans and review their implementation on a daily basis.The five states were also advised to exponentially increase the testing to ensure that the infected cases are identified promptly for timely initiation of public health response measures, and to ensure that there is no sudden upsurge in numbers due to low testing. “The state authorities were strongly advised to ensure that recommended Covid appropriate behavior is strictly followed and adequate measures are undertaken for their effective enforcement, the health ministry statement said.

Those yet to receive their first dose should be given the same at the earliest, while those awaiting their second dose of the vaccine would have to complete the course, the states were told.Testing would also have to be exponentially accelerated to curb the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases.The Centre also asked the states to ensure strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour.According to an ANI input, Bhushan will soon conduct a meeting with chief secretaries and medical officers of states and Union territories regarding the vaccination of 15-18-year-old and precaution doses for healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities.Earlier in the day, the Union ministry issued a fresh set of guidelines on the expanded inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-reviews-public-health-measures-vaccination-status-in-5-poll-bound-states-101640621079512.html
27-12-2021||India||Govt fixes a 9-month gap for 3rd vaccine dose, says will send SMS alert||NEW DELHI: CoWIN system will send an SMS to beneficiaries eligible for availing the ‘precaution dose’ when the third dose becomes due for health care and frontline workers, and people aged 60 and above with comorbidities, said Union health ministry’s guidelines issued on Monday on the additional dose and children’s vaccination.“As a matter of abundant precaution, for those Health Care Workers (HCWs) & Frontline Workers (FLWs) who have received two doses, another dose of COVID-19 vaccine would be provided from 10th January 2022. The prioritization and sequencing of this precaution dose would be based on the completion of 9 months i.e. 39 weeks from the date of administration of 2nd dose,” the guidelines, which will come into effect from January 3, said.For children between 15 and 18 years eligible to take the shot, the only vaccine option at the moment is ‘Covaxin’ as this is the only vaccine approved in India that has WHO emergency use listing for the 15-18 years age group.A second vaccine, too, is approved by the national drugs regulator for use in ages 12 and above – ZyCoV-D, a dose made by Gujarat-based Zydus Healthcare. ZyCoV-D is yet to be included in the immunisation programme. “All persons aged 60 years and above with comorbidities who have received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine, will on doctor’s advice be provided with a precaution dose from 10th January 2022, the health ministry document said. The nine-month gap between the second and third dose will, however, apply. This means that senior citizens will be eligible for the third dose only if they were given the second dose on or before 10 April 2021.According to RS Sharma, chief executive of National Health Authority that is leading CoWIN system implementation for the national Covid immunisation programme, the system will only register people from the three eligible categories if nine months from the second dose have elapsed.“Registration and appointment services can be accessed through both, the online and the onsite modes. The details of administration of the precaution dose will be suitably reflected in the vaccination certificates,” said the guidelines, issued two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to permit the third dose to people falling in the eligible categories.Also, children eligible to take the Covid-19 vaccine shot from next year will be able to register on the CoWIN platform from January 1, said Sharma.“The system is being modified accordingly. Students can make use of their identity cards for the purpose of registration,” he said.All those whose birth year is 2007 or before will be eligible to register on CoWIN; they can self-register online through an existing account on CoWIN or can also register by creating a new account through a unique mobile number. For now, the facility is available for all eligible citizens of India. Eligible children can also be registered onsite by the verifier or vaccinator in facilitated registration mode, and appointments can be booked either online or onsite (walk-in), as per the government guidelines Prime minister Narendra Modi on December 25 announced key decisions in India’s fight against the coronavirus disease including the start of vaccination for children in the 15-18 age group from January 3, next year, and allowing ‘precaution dose’ for health care workers, frontline workers, and persons 60 and above who suffer from comorbidities, on advice of their doctor. The move came amid calls from experts to expand the vaccine drive, especially booster doses, to fight new variants such as Omicron, which has shown a substantial drop in vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease. “Keeping in view the recent global surge of Covid-19 cases, detection of Omicron variant which has been categorized as a Variant of Concern (VOC), scientific evidence, global practices and the inputs/suggestions of ‘Covid-19 Working Group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI)’ as well as of ‘Standing Technical Scientific Committee (STSC)’ of NTAGI, it has now been decided to further refine the scientific prioritization and coverage of Covid-19 vaccination,” the health ministry said in a note.

This is beyond the comprehension of the common man,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. “Given Uttar Pradesh’s limited healthcare facilities, we have to honestly decide whether our priority is to stop the spread of the dreaded Omicron (variant) or show electoral power.”Gandhi said the maximum transmission typically happens during the day and the government should cut down on gatherings, which could emerge as Covid-19 clusters. He called for a holistic strategy. “Measures such as night curfews, weekend lockdowns have very limited impact in containing or suppressing the transmission. Hence, the administration should focus on strict and effective containment strategy.” He said the policymakers should lead from the front.Gandhi’s remarks came two days after Uttar Pradesh’s BJP government imposed a night curfew citing rising Covid-19 cases in the poll-bound state. It also limited the number of guests at weddings and other public functions to 200.The Centre on Monday asked states and Union territories to ensure local authorities take appropriate Covid-19 containment measures and consider imposing curbs during the ongoing festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-takes-dig-at-up-govt-for-rallies-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101640604049958.html

The government has faced criticism for pursuing the project ignoring protests.The CPI (M) has asked its cadres to carry out the campaign to highlight the advantages of the project, which the party believes will change the state’s face. Leaflets have been prepared to address the doubts raised about the project. The party has asked top leaders to coordinate explanation sessions in their districts.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated on Monday the government will go ahead with the project and asked people to discourage the forces derailing the state’s development. He said earlier same forces opposed a pipeline project and expansion of the national highway but the government ignored their protests and implemented both.“The Congress, BJP, and Jamaat-e-Islami are on the same platform to oppose the project. We will not bend before such opposition. (The promise for) K-Rail (project) was in the manifesto and people gave us a resounding mandate rewriting the poll history of the state,” he said. He asked the cadres to explain to people the project and remove their reservations.The ₹63,490-crore project seeks to develop a high-speed rail corridor connecting Kasaragod in the state’s north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. The state needs 1,383 hectares of land for the project, of which 1,383 hectares are private.The rail line will bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45 km, to four from 12 hours. It will be completed by 2025, said Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd, the nodal agency for the project. The Centre is yet to approve the project.Left-leaning organisations such as Sasthra Sahitya Parishad have also opposed the project citing environmental degradation. “It seems the project caters to a higher income group. Its environmental and social impact studies were not done. At many places, it will run parallel to the existing line which the railways opposed. Going by the state’s existing developmental perspective, K-Rail cannot be termed a priority,” said the Parishad.Opposition leader V D Satheesan asked Vijayan to give up his adamant posture and address the apprehensions. “Even in the assembly, the government was not ready for a discussion. Its detailed project report is yet to be made public and experts were never consulted. The chief minister cannot even ally fears of the ruling party’s partners and Left-leaning outfits,” he said. He added the Congress-led Opposition will stage state-wide protests if the government goes ahead with the project. “Last budget says outstanding debt of the state will be ₹3.27 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal. The government is again trying for a huge loan for the K-Rail. The state is heading towards a debt trap.”Union minister V Muraleedharan, who is from Kerala, said the railway ministry has made it clear that it is not a viable project and called the state government’s approach to it dubious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-opposition-cpi-m-announces-campaign-to-drum-up-support-for-rail-project-in-kerala-101640601828199.html

Rural SP K Karthik had said that two cases have been lodged in connection with the incident on December 25 night and the investigation was going on to identify all those involved in it and to collect evidence. Visuals of the violence which went viral on social media showed a large group of people surrounding the police vehicles, climbing on top of them, pelting them with stones and then thrashing them with sticks, leaving the vehicles in shambles. Subsequently, after the policemen retreated to safety, the workers set fire to one of the vehicles. Kitex Managing Director Sabu Jacob, had later told the media over the phone, that "the workers had brutally assaulted the police officers, including a Circle Inspector, who had reached the spot to resolve the arguments between two groups of labourers on Saturday night." He had said that initially the camp security and the supervisors tried to intervene and resolve the issue, but they too were assaulted and thereafter, the police were called. However, when the police arrived, the "uncontrollable" workers brutally attacked the officers. Jacob had further said that there was no criminal intent behind what happened and claimed that drugs were brought into the camp and some of the workers were probably under its influence, leading to them becoming "uncontrollable". He had also said that his company would cooperate with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-christmas-violence-50-migrant-workers-held-101640600445765.html

27-12-2021||India||With Omicron fuelling Covid-19 cases, will 2022 be different?||When the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic struck in 2019, it changed the way people “normally” live their lives. In 2020, it led to lockdowns and other severe curbs, and a desperate search for a vaccine.In 2021, as the Sars-CoV-2 virus mutated further, it caused the devastating second wave of infection which affected millions and killed hundreds of thousands. The United States, and now Europe, are the worst affected, with the former recording the highest number of fatalities in the world. In Europe, daily infection tally has been breaking records daily.Also Read | Indian govt rings Omicron alarm, asks states to impose district-level curbs as neededThis fresh surge in infection is led by the Omicron variant, which was detected in South Africa on November 24 but has spread in more than 100 countries now. It has once again brought the fears of lockdown and other stricter curbs to the fore.So, how is it going to be in 2022? Will there be more variants? What steps the governments will take? Here’s a look based on the facts that have emerged in the last few weeks.Is Omicron the last variant of coronavirus?No. Many health experts have said that the world will see more such mutations of the coronavirus, and urged the governments to speed up the vaccination coverage.Since its emergence in 2019, coronavirus has undergone several mutations - each one deadlier than the previous one. The World Health Organization (WHO) has already categorised Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron as ‘variants of concern’.But Dr Julian Tang, professor of Respiratory Sciences at Leicester University, has said that the Sars-CoV-2 virus will evolve itself out of the pandemic strain very soon. “It will become milder, more transmissible to the point where you may only need to think about vaccinating the more vulnerable members of the population,” said Dr Tang.‘70% vaccination by mid-2022’The WHO has said that achievement of 70 per cent coverage with Covid-19 vaccines in all countries is imperative. The statement is based on the recommendation of Independent Allocation of Vaccines Group (IAVG).India has already given both doses to more than 60 per cent of the country’s eligible 944 million adults, while 90 per cent have received one dose, as announced by the Union health ministry last week. But health experts have warned that there is no room for complacency."Vaccination, some improvements in health infrastructure, partial but continued use of masking and omicron as a possibly more infectious but less virulent strain will contribute to a less devastating situation than what we saw in 2021," Vineeta Bal, an immunologist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research told Deutsche Welle.What about booster shots?According to WHO, booster doses are administered to those who have completed a primary vaccination series when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population. The emergence of Omicron variant has once again fuelled the talks of giving a booster shot to the people.Many countries, especially those in Europe, are contemplating making a booster shot necessary for travellers coming from other places. The leaders of Greece and the Netherlands have said in public that a rule making booster shot mandatory will most likely be implemented from February 2022.In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address to the nation on Saturday night, announced that vaccination against Covid-19 for children between 15-18 years will start from January 3, while "precaution dose" (booster shot) for healthcare and frontline workers would be administered from January 10.In Photos: Who are eligible for covid-19 precaution dose? When will it be rolled out?The decisions came amid rising Covid cases linked to the Omicron variant of the virus.Vaccination certificates to be mandatoryAs more and more countries inoculate their population against the deadly Covid-19, the vaccination certificate too has been made mandatory. The European Council gave green light to EU’s decision to make vaccination certificates mandatory to enter in Europe.These rules will come into force from February 1, 2022. Similarly, Singapore and other Asian countries are implementing the measure from early next year.India has also made vaccination certificates mandatory from countries where Covid-19 has been spreading fast. In many states, the document is necessary to enter public places, like malls etc.Omicron rewriting the Covid plan for 2022Living with Covid-19 in 2022 will mean assessing local risks and protecting oneself through vaccination, masking and social distancing."When I go to the store this afternoon, what helps me is to know how much Covid is in my community," said Dr Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco."There will not be one state of the pandemic. There will be different states for different people and for different regions," he said. "And that's going to be the way it is for the foreseeable future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-omicron-fuelling-covid-19-cases-will-2022-be-different-101640592724662.html

States may consider imposing need-based, local curbs/restrictions, to control the crowd during the festive season.”The holiday season in India is one to watch, especially amid rising concerns over the highly transmissible Omicron strain and experts fearing that public places may turn into Covid-19 hotspots.Several states have already strengthened curbs in districts reporting high case positivity rates along with measures such as bringing back the night curfew, strictly regulating large gatherings, and imposing restrictions on the number of guests who can attend marriage ceremonies and functions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rings-omicron-alarm-asks-states-to-impose-district-level-curbs-as-needed-101640590373574.html

We don't want to tarnish his reputation abroad. If any decision would be taken, it would not be done without the consent of farmers. We honestly cultivate the fields but Delhi did not pay attention to our demands," the BKU leader said in a tweet (roughly translated from Hindi).Reacting to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar's recent statement over three repealed farm laws, Tikait had said that the remark was intended to deceive farmers and would also humiliate the Prime Minister.Tomar at an event in Nagpur had said: "We brought the farm laws. Some people did not like it. But the government is not disappointed. We moved a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India's backbone and if the backbone is strengthened, the country will become stronger."However, the minister later clarified that the Centre has no plan to reintroduce farm laws adding that his statement during a programme was misquoted.Tikait has threatened to restart agitation if the farm laws are re-introduced by the Centre.The three farm laws were repealed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19. These bills were passed during the winter session of Parliament which began on November 23.The farmers, who had been protesting on the borders of Delhi against the three laws for almost a year, have suspended their agitation and returned to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-pm-to-apologise-and-tarnish-his-image-abroad-rakesh-tikait-101640585250234.html

They may also explore a broad understanding of other issues.Elections to the 117-member Punjab assembly are scheduled to be held early next year, either in February or March, according to those familiar with the matter. The term of the current assembly elected in 2017 will expire on March 27, 2022, unless dissolved earlier.In the 2017 Punjab assembly election, Congress won an absolute majority in the state by winning 77 seats and ousted the SAD-BJP government after ten long years.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged as the second-largest party winning 20 seats in the 117-member Punjab legislative assembly.The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) could only manage to win 15 seats while the BJP secured 3 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-meets-amit-shah-ahead-of-punjab-polls-seat-sharing-talk-likely-101640584802724.html

27-12-2021||India||6 Maoists killed in encounter on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border||At least six Maoists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Chhattisgarh-Telangana border area on Monday morning, police said. The skirmish took place between 6 am and 7 am in a forest in Kistaram area of Chhattisgarh's Sukma district, located over 400 km from the state capital Raipur, they said. Six ultras, including four women, were killed in the gun-battle with the special anti-Naxal Greyhounds unit of the Telangana Police, a senior police official posted in Bastar said. A joint team of the District Reserve Guard and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) from Sukma was also out on the operation in the area as an auxiliary support to the Greyhounds team, he said. “As per preliminary reports, bodies of six ultras, including four women, belonging to the Kistaram area committee of Maoists, were recovered from the spot,” the official said, adding that the operation is still underway. Terming the operation as a huge success, Sukma Superintendent of Police Sunil Sharma claimed security forces inflicted a heavy blow to the Kistaram area committee of Maoists, which had been instrumental in carrying out various deadly attacks in the past. “There are total five area committees of Maoists operating in Sukma. In the last six months, security forces have been successful in effectively controlling the activities of the Kerlapal and Konta area committees,” Sharma told PTI. Top cadres from the Kerlapal area committee surrendered in the last one year while in August this year, a local organisation squad (LOS) commander and his deputy from the Konta area committee were killed in an encounter with the Sukma police, he said. "Now that the Kistaram area committee has been significantly decimated, the next target will be to neutralise two other committees - Katekalyan and Jagargunda," he added. Earlier in the day, Telangana's Bhadradri Kothagudem district Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt said the ultras were killed in a joint operation of the Telangana and Chhattisgarh Police and the CRPF. He said they received a tip-off that Maoists were trying to attack the security forces and combing was stepped up in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-naxals-killed-in-encounter-on-chhattisgarh-telangana-border-101640583645158.html

27-12-2021||India||PM Modi to launch hydropower projects worth ₹11,000 crore in Himachal today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday visit Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, where he will inaugurate and lay the foundation for hydropower projects worth more than ₹11,000 crore. Included among these is the Renukaji Dam project, lying pending for around three decades.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the completion of the 40-megawatt hydropower project was only made possible by the collective effort of six states—Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Delhi—at the behest of the central government.Built at a cost of ₹7,000 crore, the Renukaji Dam will optimally utilise the hydropower potential of the Himalayan region to bring benefits to as far away as national capital Delhi, which will be able to receive a water supply of around 500 million cubic meters per year.Prime Minister Modi will also lay the foundation stone of the Luhri Stage 1 Hydro Power Project, a 210-megawatt dam that's built at a cost of more than ₹1,800 crore and is expected to generate over 750 million units of electricity per year. According to the PMO, the modern and dependable grid support will prove beneficial to the surrounding states of the region as well.Additionally, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation of the Dhaulasidh Hydro Power project on Monday, the first of its type in the Hamirpur district of the state. “The 66 MW project will be built at a cost of over ₹680 crore,” reads an official press release. “It will lead to the generation of over 300 million units of electricity per year.”PM Modi will also inaugurate the Sawra-Kuddu Hydro Power Project. “The 111 MW Project has been built at a cost of around ₹2080 crore,” the release added. “It will lead to the generation of over 380 million units of electricity per year, and help the state earn revenue worth over ₹120 crore annually.”Finally, Prime Minister Modi will preside over the second ground-breaking ceremony of the Himachal Pradesh Global Investors' Meet on Monday. The meet, according to the PMO, is expected to give a boost to investment in the region through the start of projects worth around ₹28,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-hydropower-projects-worth-rs-11-000-crore-in-himachal-today-101640562258031.html

Our research within the country also says that almost two-thirds of the deaths which occurred due to Covid in India are within this age group. So, this decision was mainly taken to protect the adolescents,” Arora told ANI in an interview.He also listed two other advantages of immunising adolescents against Covid-19.“One is that they are quite mobile, they have to go to the school colleges and their risk of getting an infection, particularly in the light of Omicron, is present,” he explained.Also read | Policy on booster, additional Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2 weeks: Dr NK Arora"Secondly, many times these adolescents get infection into their households where elderly and those with comorbidities can get infected. So, in view of all this, the country has decided to introduce vaccination for children between 15 to 18 years," he said.He also said immunisation of these children can be started in a short period without any specific preparation and that the dosage requirement will be the same as adults.Dr Arora said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin has shown a “very good” immune response during trials.Also read | 9-12 months' gap likely between 2nd dose and 'booster' precaution dose: Reports"In fact, it is slightly better than adults. Secondly, this vaccine is a safe vaccine, and even local effects like pain, swelling in the arms is much less as compared to adults. We would like to offer this protection to our adolescents," he said."Although the disease's effects are much milder, but as we know many schools have opened. A lot of parents are still not very confident in sending their children to schools,” he added.“So this vaccination drive will also be giving confidence to them. I would say it's a great New Year gift for our adolescents."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/great-new-year-s-gift-covid-task-force-chief-on-decision-to-vaccinate-kids-101640564579727.html
27-12-2021||India||Greenpiece: Need mask standards to protect the people||These days, we wear masks to prevent both Covid and air pollution.But when the air is better, we don’t necessarily wear other masks, intended only to ward off the virus. We typically wear one mask type. Since the pandemic, many mask types have sprung up across the country. Some wear only blue single use masks, others flaunt cloth masks, calling them eco-friendly.What does this mask diversity mean for our health?The virus cannot be kept out by wearing a cloth mask unless the cotton has other layers inside. As far as air pollution goes, this depends on the specific particle. It is hard for most users to go looking for the correct mask for each usage type.Nor should a user have to do this.India needs masks standards to guide and protect its people.A mask in India must meet various needs.It must fight Covid and pollution, sometimes just dust. Workers on a construction site need masks as do young school children.And because this is India, the mask must not suffocate the user in the heat either. Instructions about its disposal should be clear.Standardizing masks is key to public and environmental health, to saving lives. It is also key to using the appropriate resources in the most impactful manner.The Bureau of Indian Standards must use available data and issue standards to protect lives and prevent the wrong use of materials. We can fight Covid and climate change both, if robust regulation kicks in.(The writer is founder and director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)
27-12-2021||India||BJP plans to appoint coordinators as part of its village outreach drive||In a major community outreach in rural areas, the farmers’ wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party plans to appoint co-ordinators in every village to inform farmers about the various welfare schemes of the central government, a BJP leader said told HT.The development comes ahead of crucial assembly elections in the five states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.During a national executive meeting of BJP’s Kisan Morcha on Sunday, the first meeting after the contentious farm laws were repealed, party functionaries in states were told to hold meetings and organise seminars to tell farmers about the farmer-centric policies of the Narendra Modi government.“We will soon start appointing gram syanyojak (village coordinator) in every village across the country,” Manoj Yadav, national media in-charge of BJP farmers’ wing, said.“The central government has come out with several schemes such as soil health card, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance scheme), etc., for the welfare of farmers, and we want to reach out to farmers and tell them about them.”There will be a seminar by party workers every three months where they will take up one policy or scheme of the central government and explain them in detail, Yadav said.While BJP leaders say the farmers agitation will have little impact on the upcoming assembly elections as the laws have been repealed, they agree there is a need for an outreach campaign in rural belts, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.In poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the state unit’s farmers’ wing has planned a Kisan Sammelam (farmers’ conclave) in 75 districts till January 3. Kameshwar Singh, president of the state’s BJP farmers’ wing, said the party has been organising meetings and rallies since June.“There are around 56,000 villages in UP, and in the past few months, we have organised several programmes to reach out to the farmers. In the Kisan Sammelan, our focus is on telling farmers about the Centre and state government schemes for farmers,” Singh said. “It is also to listen to their concerns and how they have benefit from the various schemes.”Of the 403 assembly constituencies in India’s most populous state, 104 have a large percentage of sugarcane farmers, he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s decision to increase the minimum support price for sugarcane by ₹25 per quintal will benefit lakhs of farmers, Singh said. “This is one of the many farmer-centric measures taken by the UP government,” singh said. “Though our outreach initiatives, we are going to tell farmers about it,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-plans-to-appoint-coordinators-as-part-of-its-village-outreach-drive-101640557027582.html

Those who are contesting are doing it in their individual capacity... Those who are contesting have nothing to do with us. Ours is not a political manch (platform).”On the farmers’ group forming a political front in Punjab, Tikait said, “We are holding a meeting on January 15 and we will talk about this then.”He, however, said that the farmers will play the role of kingmakers in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.

The soldiers of the 21 Para Special Forces appeared to have mistaken the civilians for militants.A jawan was killed in retaliation by civilians on the same day.There were massive protests across the state with Naga organizations seeking a fair probe into the incident.On Sunday, a joint statement from deputy chief minister Y Patton and leader of Naga Peoples’ Front Legislature Party TR Zeliang said that the panel has been directed to submit its recommendations within 45 days.“The committee will submit its report within 45 days and withdrawal of Disturbed Area and AFSPA from Nagaland will be based on recommendations of the committee,” the statement said.A court of inquiry will take action against the army personnel “directly involved” in the Oting incident and action will be taken immediately “on the basis of fair inquiry”, the statement said.“A court of inquiry will initiate disciplinary proceedings against the army unit and personnel who were involved in the Oting incident, and action will be taken against on the basis of a fair probe. The identified persons facing the investigation will be placed under suspension with immediate effect,” the statement said.The Nagaland government will provide jobs to the next of the kin of the deceased, it said.The decisions were taken at a meeting of Union home minister Amit Shah and Rio, along with Patton and Zeliang on December 23.The meeting was also attended by North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.On December 20, the Nagaland assembly adopted a five-point resolution denouncing the killings in Mon and demanded the repeal of Afspa from the region.The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, is in force in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, parts of Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. It allows security forces to open fire on any person on suspicion, and arrest individuals and search premises without warrants, in designated disturbed areas.Thanking Shah “for taking up the matter with utmost seriousness”, Rio on Sunday urged “all sections to continue to maintain a peaceful atmosphere.”During the recently concluded winter session of Parliament, Shah expressed regret over the killings and said that a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the “unfortunate incident” will complete its investigation within a month. He also said the firing was a consequence of “mistaken identity”.
27-12-2021||India||With 77 new cases, India’s Omicron tally crosses 500||The number of infections of the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 detected across India on Sunday soared past the 500-mark, even as more than 150 of these cases have already recovered, data compiled across states showed.A total of 77 new cases of the heavily mutated variant were reported on Sunday, as the number of state and Union territories that have reported Omicron infections has now touched 19, with two new regions – Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh – joining the list on Sunday.The national tally of Omicron cases now stands at 508 — Maharashtra has reported 141 cases (the most in the country), followed by 79 cases in Delhi, Kerala has seen 57 infections, Gujarat has 49, Telangana 44, Tamil Nadu 34, Karnataka 31, Rajasthan 23, Haryana 10, Madhya Pradesh nine, Odisha eight, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal have reported six each, while Chandigarh and J&K have three each, followed by UP at two, and one each in Ladakh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh.The number of people who have recovered from recovered from Omicron infections, meanwhile, touched 153, data showed.On Friday, Union health ministry had said that a government analysis of 183 Omicron cases in India found that 70% of the infected are asymptomatic and the rest have mild symptoms.Expert across the world have pointed out that people infected with the Omicron variant are less likely to require hospital admission, with a small proportion among them showing symptoms and those too likely to be mild. They have said the new Sars-CoV-2 variant may be less severe in people with past infection and those vaccinated, when compared to the Delta variant.“Regarding infection with Omicron, it does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic clinical disease. In India, about a third of all detected cases were mildly symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic; therefore, the treatment for Omicron-infected symptomatic individuals remains the same,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-77-new-cases-india-s-omicron-tally-crosses-500-101640555654621.html
27-12-2021||India||60+ likely to need co-morbidity certificate for third shot: Officials||Senior citizens seeking a third vaccine jab will have to produce a medical certificate that shows they have specified co-morbidities to be eligible for a precaution dose, according to people familiar with the matter.People aged 60 years and above will be given a third dose from January 10 if they suffer from certain co-morbid conditions, along with health and front line workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday.“We are going to follow the same process that was followed when Covid vaccination was opened for 45-plus category of people who suffered from specified co-morbidities,” said RS Sharma, chief executive officer of the National Health Authority, which also operates the government’s CoWIN platform.Citizens eligible for the additional shot will have to get a certificate from a registered medical practitioner that can be scanned and uploaded on the CoWIN portal or produced at a vaccination centre, Sharma said.The gap between the primary and additional doses could be between nine and 12 months, government experts said, although the details are still being worked out. The inoculation drive for senior citizens started on March 1 this year, the same day as persons between 45 and 59 years of age suffering from certain medical conditions. Some 20 co-morbidities were listed at the time.“This (the interval) would be based on how long it takes for the vaccine-derived immunity to wane,” said a government expert who declined to be named.India has at least 137.5 million persons above 60 years of age, official data show, who could be potentially eligible for an additional dose.Persons with specified medical conditions included those who were immuno-compromised, on cancer treatment, undergoing or having undergone organ or tissue transplant surgery, afflicted with chronic kidney, liver, lung or cardiovascular disease, or those on immunosuppressant drugs, among others.The third jab is being called a precaution dose, Modi said, adding that the step was taken in the light of the amount of time front line and health workers are spending in the service of Covid-19 patients that will also strengthen their confidence.Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient, according to the World Health Organization.The objective of an additional dose in the primary series is to enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immuno-compromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series with some vaccines, the global health agency said.“Since senior citizens largely suffer from one or more underlying medical conditions, making their immune system weak, it was decided by experts looking into the matter to allow them also to have the precaution dose,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Health care and front line workers are anyway at high risk of getting the disease, owing to their nature of work. Hence, they needed additional protection.”It is a good idea to allow an additional dose for high-risk people, experts said.“Omicron could possess a potential risk in some elderly with long diabetes, heart and lung diseases, and those who are immunosuppressed, as witnessed with previous variants causing hospitalization and fatality,” said Dr Anup R Warrier, head of infectious diseases and infection control at Aster DM Healthcare (India units), which runs a chain of hospitals.“With global evidence and support for booster doses to combat the new variant, we hope that this initiative will prevent infections among the most exposed (healthcare workers),” Dr Warrier said.The CoWIN platform, which provides the technological backbone of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive, will be tweaked for the revised policy.“The process will not take much time as the same module will be followed as earlier,” said Sharma.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, made it clear that the rail project was in the Left Front’s manifesto and there was no going back on the project but the Congress and other opposition parties said “K Rail will turn into another Nandigram” for the party and government. The Congress meanwhile has toughened its position on Tharoor. “If you are a party MP you have to follow the party line. Otherwise, you can leave the party, we have told him in clear terms. There is no personal opinion before the collective decision of the party. Hope he will clear the air soon,” said party state president K Sudhakaran. Two weeks back when 17 MPs from the state wrote to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav urging him not to give clearance to the high-speed project ‘K Rail,’ Tharoor abstained from it saying he needed more time to study the project. But he made it clear that not signing the letter does not mean that he supported the project. While attending the inaugural ceremony of Lulu Mall in the state capital on December 16 Tharoor lauded the developmental initiatives of the CM hurting the party leaders again. But the senior leader made it clear that he never shied away from congratulating a person who had done a good job and there was no need to read between lines. The Congress was forced to go after Tharoor after some allies resented his open defiance and the ruling CPI(M) started praising his “bold position,” said party insiders adding he was asked to clear the air at the earliest. “All must have a personal opinion. But once the United Democratic Front took a decision all leaders are bound to go by it. Tharoor’s indifferent position will weaken the UDF stand,” said Revolutionary Socialist Party leader N K Premachandran MP. Congress MP Rajmohan Unnithan also criticized Tharoor saying, “The party always protected him in critical times, not the CPI(M).” Despite mounting criticism from the party Tharoor is yet to react. Fissures have also started appearing in the ruling dispensation over the K Rail project. “There is a lot of apprehension among people. The government will have to clear them and release the detailed project report (DPR),” said CPI joint secretary Prakash Babu. Many left-leaning organisations like Sasthra Sahitya Parishad have also opposed the project saying it will be a sure recipe for environmental degradation. When Left MPs met the railway minister last week in Delhi CPI MP Binoy Viswom kept away from it. Though he cited personal reasons, people close to him said he was not happy with the project. Many environmental activists have also opposed the ₹63,490-crore proposed project, saying the state is yet to learn lessons from recent natural calamities and early warnings of climate change. They said the government was going ahead with the project without a proper environment impact study. Unfazed by criticism, the chief minister said his government will go ahead with the project, with his party asking its workers to “expose forces” that are bent on “derailing developmental activities” of the state. “For some it has become a habit to oppose everything. The government will not bend before such forces. People gave us a huge mandate to implement such projects,” said the CM in Pathanamthitta. The K-Rail project aims at developing a high-speed rail network, connecting north Kerala’s Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram in south. The state will need 1,383 hectares of land for the project, of which 1,383 hectares are private land. The state is planning to fund the project using equity funds from the government, foreign lending and railway ministry’s partial funding. The new rail network will bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45 km, to only four hours (from 12 hours at present) and it will be completed by 2025, said the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd, the nodal agency for the proposed project. The Centre is yet to give the green signal to the project.

The sale of tickets would be done online, though the venue of the event has been kept a secret.Firebrand BJP lawmaker from Hyderabad T Raja Singh also wrote a letter to Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy not to give permission to Faruqui to stage his show in the city, as it was meant for creating hatred against Hindu religion and gods.Singh reminded that Faruqui had earlier been arrested and imprisoned for 37 days in the past for creating hatred against Hindu gods. “He also made serious comments against Union home minister Amit Shah in a programme at Indore in January. He also made comments against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Godhra incident and Kar Sevaks etc,” he pointed out.He warned that if the programme was allowed, the Hindu supporters would come out on roads and take up protests that would disturb the peace of Hyderabad.It may be mentioned that on December 17, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s son and state information technology minister K T Rama Rao welcomed stand-up comedians like Faruqui and Kunal Kamra to stage their shows in Hyderabad.“Hyderabad is truly cosmopolitan and offers stand-up comedians an open invite. We don’t cancel shows of Munawar Faruqui and Kunal Kamra just because we are not aligned with them politically,” KTR said.In November, Faruqui”s show in Bengaluru was cancelled after protests by Hindu right-wing groups, who alleged that he had hurt their religious sentiments in one of his shows. Besides Bengaluru, his shows in Gujarat, Gurugram, Chhattisgarh, and Goa too were cancelled following threats from various right-wing groups.

The government will have to clear them and release the detailed project report (DPR),” said CPI joint secretary Prakash Babu.The ₹63,490-crore K-rail project aims at developing a high-speed rail network, connecting north Kerala’s Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in the south.

They said the government was going ahead with the project without a proper environmental impact study. “No proper environment impact study was done. It seem the government is in hurry. It will lead to displacement of thousands of people and wetland will be affected. Such big projects will cripple fragile environment of the state. It seems the state is yet to learn a lesson from recent natural calamities,” said Dr S Vijayan, a wildlife scientist, who was part of the Madhav Gadgil committee on Western Ghats. Metro Man E Sreedharan also said the high-speed rail project was not feasible in a state like Kerala. “In a densely- populated state it is not feasible. Moreover, around 140 km of the rail line passes through wetland and it is not suitable for high-speed trains,” he said. The Congress and other opposition parties said, “K-Rail will turn another Nandigram” for the party and government. The reference is a clash between police, West Bengal-ruling CPI (M) members and villagers in Nandigram in 2007, which sparked violence, leaving 14 people dead and many more injured.Unfazed by the criticism, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said his government will go ahead with the project, with his party asking the cadre to “expose forces” that are bend to “derail developmental activities” of the state. “For some, it has become a habit to oppose everything.

Officials said tigress T-99 was spotted with a cub in zone 10 of the reserve. The reserve now has 20 tigers, 30 tigresses, and 27 sub-adults and cubs, apart from 4 tigers each in the Keladevi range and Dholpur range of the reserve. District forest officer, Mahendra Sharma said, “Six-year-old tigress, T-99 is sighted with a cub in Halonda area in zone-10 of RTR. The cub is of around 3-4 months, and it is the first litter of the tigress.” In the last three months, two tigresses -- T-63 and T-105 -- were sighted with three cubs each in the reserve. A forest official said the big cat population in the reserve is constantly increasing, which is good for tiger conservation but is an issue of concern as territorial disputes and migration is happening. 
27-12-2021||India||River boards to manage all projects: Govt rejects Andhra, T’gana pleas||The Centre has turned down requests from the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments not to bring all irrigation projects being built on Krishna and Godavari rivers under the respective river management boards of the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, but to restrict them to only inter-state projects, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. In a recent communication to the Andhra Pradesh government, joint secretary of Union Jal Shakti ministry Sanjay Awasthi said as per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, all the major and medium irrigation projects built on Krishna and Godavari rivers during the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh regime would be brought under the purview of the river management boards. Since all the projects in the respective river basins are inter-linked, they cannot be seen in isolation and hence, should be monitored by the river management boards, a senior official of the Andhra Pradesh state irrigation department said, quoting the Union ministry. On July 15, 2021, the Union ministry issued a gazette notification bringing 36 projects in the Krishna basin and 71 in the Godavari basin in both Telugu states under the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB), respectively. The projects were to be handed over to the two boards from October 14 for administration, operation, maintenance and regulation of their components, including barrages, dams, reservoirs and other regulating structures, besides hydel power plants, part of the canal network and transmission lines. However, the two-state governments raised objections to the Union ministry over the gazette notifications. At the first KRMB meeting on August 4, which was boycotted by the Telangana government, the Andhra officials suggested that only projects like Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala, which are common to the two states, be brought under the purview of the board. Similarly, Telangana also wrote a letter to the KRMB in the first week of December to exempt the Jurala irrigation project and two other lift irrigation projects – Nettempadu and Bhima built on Krishna river – from the purview of the board, as it purely serves the needs of Telangana and had no dispute with Andhra Pradesh. However, the Union Jal Shakti officials made it clear that all the irrigation projects and the schemes associated with them under both the Krishna and Godavari basins would be brought under the control of the respective river management boards. “All these projects were mentioned in the AP Reorganisation Act; and hence, were brought under the purview of the boards. If any project has to be given any exemption, it requires necessary amendments to the Act by Parliament,” the irrigation department official said, quoting Awasthi’s letter. Concerning the projects being constructed post bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh, the Union minister said both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should submit the detailed project reports (DPRs) of these projects to the ministry for clearance within six months.

27-12-2021||India||No attempt to bring back farm laws, Cong spreading rumours: Tomar||The central government has no intention of bringing back the contentious farm laws that were repealed last month, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar clarified on Sunday.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had decided to withdraw the agricultural reform laws to keep the honour of the farmers,” Tomar said, reacting to statements by the opposition Congress party that protests might be renewed if such a step was being considered. “The Congress is spreading rumours to cover up its own failures. The farmers should be beware of this.”The three laws , approved in September 2020, sparked widespread protests by famers. The government repealed them in the recently concluded winter session of Parliament after a statement to that effect by Modi.Speaking at an event in Nagpur on Friday, Tomar had remarked: “We took a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India’s backbone. And if the backbone is strengthened the country will get stronger.”His comments drew sharp criticism. “The agriculture minister has insulted Modi’s apology — it is highly condemnable,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had tweeted on Saturday. “If the anti-agro-farming steps are taken again, then there will be annadata satyagraha again.”The government had earlier tried to explain the benefits of the three laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 – to protesting farmers, but failed to convince them.On November 19, the Prime Minister announced that his government will withdraw the three laws. On November 29, Parliament repealed the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-attempt-to-bring-back-farm-laws-cong-spreading-rumours-tomar-101640542901818.html
27-12-2021||India||Want to manufacture BrahMos so no country casts evil eye on us: Rajnath||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the Defence technology and test centre and BrahMos manufacturing centre -- to be established by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Lucknow.Speaking on the occasion, Singh said India wants to manufacture BrahMos missiles not to attack anyone, but to ensure that no other country has the audacity to cast an evil eye .The Uttar Pradesh government has allocated 200 acres of land for the project.The BrahMos manufacturing centre, announced by BrahMos Aerospace, is a modern, state-of-art facility in the Lucknow node of the defence industrial corridor.The next generation BrahMos missiles are to be manufactured at the facility, which is scheduled to be operational in 2-3 years. Around 80-100 missiles will be manufactured at the Lucknow unit each year. The missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.Singh expressed confidence that the foundation laying of the two units would herald a new chapter in defence manufacturing of the country, and the economies of Lucknow as well as the state.So far, an investment of ₹1,400 crore has been received for the defence corridor in UP, Singh said.Stressing the need to maintain nuclear deterrence, he said, “We want to manufacture BrahMos on Indian soil so that no country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on India.”“It has never been the character of India to attack any other country or grab even an inch of land of any country,” he said.Singh stated that India has attained a respectable position in areas of defence technologies, including the development of state-of-the-art missile systems in recent years and has made commendable progress in building its defence industrial base.He slammed Pakistan of carrying out terror attacks in the country.“There is a neighbouring country. It got separated from India sometime back. I don’t know why its intentions vis-a-vis India are always bad. It committed acts of terrorism in Uri and Pulwama,” the defence minister said.“And then our Prime Minister took a decision and we went to the soil of that country and destroyed terrorist hideouts and when there was a need for airstrikes, we did that successfully,” he said.“We gave the message that if somebody dares to cast an evil eye on us, then not just on this side of the border, but we can go to the other side and hit them. This is India’s strength,” Rajnath added.The defence minister praised UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for expediting land acquisition for the project.“When I spoke to Yogiji and expressed the desire to establish this project, he did not take a second and said land will be made available at the earliest. I thank the chief minister for making 200 acres available in just one and a half months,” he said.Rajnath Singh stated that action against the mafia and improved law and order scenario in the state has made Uttar Pradesh a favoured destination for companies in India and abroad.“Before 2017, riots were common, criminals and mafia ruled the roost in the state. But today, Uttar Pradesh’s law and order is being discussed in other states. ‘UP ki sarkar bhaut asardar’ is what others are saying,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-manufacture-brahmos-so-no-country-casts-evil-eye-on-us-rajnath-101640542784590.html
27-12-2021||India||Tweaks in green laws may dilute safeguards, warn experts||The government has recently tabled draft legislations in Parliament to modify laws on biodiversity conservation and wildlife protection to improve ease of business that activists said could dilute environmental safeguards in the country.The Biological Diversity Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, tabled in Parliament on 9 December by environment minister Bhupender Yadav, provides exemptions to projects promoting Indian medicine systems, also known as Ayush. It has been sent to a joint parliamentary committee for further scrutiny.On December 17, the government tabled the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2021, which seeks to rationalise the schedules under which wildlife is protected. It too has been referred to a parliamentary standing committee.The draft laws are the latest in a series of tweaks carried out the central government to reform processes related to environmental and forest approvals for infrastructure and developmental projects.The proposed modifications would effectively address current ecological and economic needs of the country, the government has said, but legal experts are concerned that such large-scale reforms would sidestep environmental concerns. Activists also said these modifications are sought without asking for public comments, as is the norm when laws are up for amendments.However, minister Yadav said the Centre has sought comments on the forest conservation law, which is why a consultation paper was released to the states.In October, the environment and forest ministry released a consultation paper on amending the forest conservation law to significantly change forest governance in India, which include facilitating private plantations, and exploration or extraction of oil and natural gas beneath forests by drilling holes from outside the forest areas. the consultation paper also suggested that the use of forest land for strategic and security projects of national importance should be exempted from the need to obtain prior approval.“The Wildlife Protection Act 1972 has to be amended for implementation of the Convention on International trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). India is party to CITES and we have international obligations related to it,” Yadav said. “As far as the biological diversity amendment bill is concerned, these amendments were referred by four government constituted committees.”However, several provisions in the draft laws introduced in Parliament could weaken environmental regulations, lawyers and researchers said.“The standing committee of the state board for wildlife is a derogatory step, as it will replicate the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife, which had led to a situation where the national board rarely meets and all decisions are taken by a select group of members of the standing committee, who are chosen by the environment minister,” said noted environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta. “The aim of constituting the standing committee of the state board is to exclude vocal conservationists from the decision-making process. All powers will now be vested with a small group headed by the state minister in charge of forest and wildlife.”Dutta is also concerned about the proposed modifications to the biodiversity law. One of the major changes in the proposed law is that registered Ayush practitioners can access any biological resource and its associated knowledge for commercial utilisation, without giving prior intimation to the state biodiversity board.“The amendment seems to be done with the sole intention of providing benefit to the Ayush industry,” Dutta wrote in a recent critique. “The main focus of the bill is to facilitate trade in biodiversity as opposed to conservation, protection of biodiversity and knowledge of the local communities. The amendments are completely contrary to the aim and objective of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.”The amendment bills should be seen as part of a larger scheme of redesigning environmental regulation, said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. The environment ministry has released several new policies and guidelines this year to ease provisions for mining, expansion of industries, and facilitate defence and security infrastructure.“In 2021, the environment ministry has been pushed to do two things. First, align its regulation to economic reforms introduced by the central government and, second, ensure compliance with international agreements including those related to climate change and access to biological resources,” Kohli said. “The government is redesigning environmental laws to enable the unlocking of natural resources, asking fewer ecological questions and reducing standards of public involvement in decision-making.”Several new guidelines, policies were released by the ministry this year to ease provisions for mining, expansion of industries, and facilitate defence and security infrastructure.Easing norms for defence-related worksIn March, the ministry wrote to state governments stating that states cannot impose any additional environmental or conservation directions for infrastructure projects in forest areas other than what has already been stipulated by the Centre while granting forest clearance to a project. While granting forest clearance to a project under the Forest (Conservation) Act, it is presumed that the state government has already examined the proposal properly at all levels and has exercised due diligence. “Hence, the stipulation of additional conditions after according in-principle approval is against the norms and also demonstrates that such diligence was not made,” the letter had said. Independent experts had cautioned that such a guideline will curb the powers of the state in raising objections or suggesting additional environmental safeguards.On May 10, new guidelines were issued to state that the environment ministry’s regional offices will now consider and expedite forest clearances for “critical infrastructure projects” in Left-wing extremism (LWE)-hit districts and those related to defence and security in border areas instead of the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC). Experts pointed out that leeway to defence projects could lead to giving green signal to a lot of projects that may be tangentially connected to defence but mainly of some other requirement.The environment ministry this year also allowed companies operating in several industries, including some polluting ones, to expand capacities on the basis of a self-certification that this will not “increase the pollution load.” In May, the ministry released a user manual for online submission of an undertaking on no increase in pollution load due to expansion.Facilitating miningThis year a number of amends were made to facilitate new mining projects. In July, the environment ministry made provisions for mining permits to be transferred to new mining lessees from previous leaseholders, without having to apply for fresh forest clearance. In a letter to all states and union territories on July 7, the ministry said that the transfer of approval under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, can be made provided mining companies that are new lease holders meet certain conditions like complete compliance of terms and conditions stipulated in the forest clearance granted previously.In September, the ministry wrote to all state governments stating that roads, conveyor belts, railway infrastructure etc. that connect mines to ports or other destinations can now be considered as standalone projects that can be approved by the regional offices of the union environment ministry instead of the Forest Advisory Committee. The letter stated that the ministry of coal had requested the environment ministry to consider the possibility of constructing new linear projects linking mines to dumping or loading sites.The ministry of coal launched an auction for mines last year. In the first tranche 38 were listed and in the second tranche 67 mines in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh were listed for commercial coal mine auctions.In October, the ministry relaxed the environmental norms for the expansion of certain iron, manganese, bauxite, and limestone mines. It issued an office memorandum (OM) on October 20 stating that expansion of up to 20% capacity for mines of these four minerals which have a 5-star rating can be allowed only based on a public consultation.Last month, the ministry went a step further and approved the commencement of mining in non-forest land even before forest clearance is granted to allow the activity in contiguous forest land in blocks where mining involves both types of lands.Air quality CommissionCentre brought in the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act 2021 in August to provide for the constitution of the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas to address severe air pollution in Delhi NCR. The newly constituted Commission continues to have sweeping powers in controlling air pollution in Delhi NCR.Any non-compliance or contravention of any provisions of this ordinance, rules made thereunder or any order or direction issued by the Commission is a punishable offence with imprisonment of up to five years or with fine which may extend up to ₹one crore or with both. The new ordinance has clarified that provisions of this section will not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue. The constitution of the Commission was criticised by legal experts because it is again a move to centralise powers, they said.Developing the IslandsThis year saw a concerted effort to facilitate so-called development in the Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. The environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee considered multiple infrastructure projects in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands including luxury tents and resorts on some islands; two water aerodrome projects in Shaheed and Swaraj islands (formerly Neil and Havelock islands, respectively); two major township and area development projects on the Great Nicobar Island and Little Andaman, one of which is also likely to involve denotification of a tribal reserve.The Lakshadweep administration introduced the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) 2021 that seeks to develop the islands as a major tourist destination similar to Maldives according to Lakshadweep Administrator Praful Khoda Patel. Scientists and former bureaucrats put up a stiff resistance against the draft saying that it ignores Lakshadweep’s vulnerability to climate crisis, rights and culture of indigenous people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tweaks-in-green-laws-may-dilute-safeguards-warn-experts-101640542720417.html
27-12-2021||India||Awareness key in fight against Omicron: PM||Awareness and discipline have to be the strength of Indians in the fight against the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly radio broadcast to the nation.Although scientists are constantly studying the new variant and the government is working on their suggestions, it is the effort of citizens that is crucial to defeat the global pandemic, Modi said in this year’s last Mann Ki Baat programme on Sunday.“We have to remember that a new variant of Corona has already knocked on our doors,” he said. “In such a situation, self-awareness and self-discipline are our strength in the fight against this variant of Corona. Only our collective strength will defeat corona, and it is with this very sense of responsibility we have to enter into 2022.”India will start vaccinating children aged 15 and above from 3 January, and there will an additional jab for fully inoculated frontline health workers and senior citizens from 10 January, the Prime Minister had announced on a televised address on Saturday.The government’s efforts to inoculate the country’s population is praiseworthy, he said. “Crossing the 140 million vaccine dose mark is an achievement of every Indian,” Modi said in the 84th edition of the radio programme. “This shows that every Indian has trust in the system and trust in science and in scientists. It is also a testament to the willpower of the people who are fulfilling their responsibilities towards society.”The Prime Minister also spoke about the tragic helicopter crash in which chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 12 defence personnel lost their lives. He paid tribute to Shaurya Chakra awardee Group Captain Varun Singh, the lone survivor who succumbed to his injuries a week after the crash, for his humility and effort to inspire students.Referring to Singh’s letter to his school principal after receiving the military decoration for valour, Modi said, “After reading this letter, the first thought that came to my mind was that even after reaching the pinnacle of success, he did not forget to nurture his roots. When he had time to celebrate, he showed concern for the generations to come…he did not boast of his valour, instead he referred to his failures, but talked about how he converted his shortcomings into his strength.”In the letter, which went viral on social media after Singh’s death, he wrote that “it is okay to be mediocre” and performance in school was by no means the measure of things to come in life.Modi noted that the Swachh Bharat campaign for cleaniness and hygiene was a common theme in all the suggestions and messages he received from people for the new year. He spoke about the individual initiatives of people to contribute to the Swachh Bharat initiative. He also listed out the various measures taken by the government.He made special mention of the Arunachal Pradesh Airgun Surrender Campaign, a unique initiative in the northeastern state to halt the indiscriminate hunting of birds. People have surrendered about 1600 airguns, Modi said.The Prime Minister also spoke about efforts by individuals and institutions to promote Indian culture and protect ancient art forms from extinction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/awareness-key-in-fight-against-omicron-pm-101640542666415.html
27-12-2021||India||Terror attacks rose during pandemic year in India: US report||India faced more terror attacks in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020, than the previous year, with 37% of these incidents being reported from Jammu and Kashmir, according to data compiled by the US state department.The data shows that there were 10,172 terror attacks across 98 countries in 2020, 1,300 more than the incidents reported in 2019.Overall, 679 terrorism-related incidents were reported in India last year, in which 567 people were killed (2% of global fatalities in terror attacks in 2020). In 2019, 655 terror attacks were recorded in the country, according to the US data.Even though India was in the top 10 countries for most terrorism incidents last year, it was not in the top 10 for fatalities. Afghanistan reported 1,722 terror attacks followed by Syria (1,322) and DR Congo (999).The US data reveals that the states in India that experienced the most terror incidents were Jammu and Kashmir with 257 incidents (37.8%), Chhattisgarh with 145 incidents (21.4%), and Jharkhand with 69 incidents (10.2%).The Union home ministry’s data, however, shows that 244 terror attacks took place in J&K in 2020. The government shared this data in Parliament on March 23 this year.The Centre has said that terror incidents have come down in J&K since the nullification of Article 370 on August 5 in 2019 and major terror networks in the Valley have been dismantled by security forces.The home ministry did not respond to a query on the difference in data on terror incidents in 2020.The US state department report said that “Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats, although gaps remain in interagency intelligence and information sharing”.Among the perpetrators in India, according to the US data, CPI-Maoist continued to be the fourth most destructive group in the world in 2020, with 298 incidents and 202 fatalities. They were behind 44% of the total (679) terror attacks in the country, while Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Hizbul Mujahideen were responsible for 6% of all incidents. According to the records, 29% of the terror incidents were not attributable to any outfit in India.The Taliban (including the Haqqani Network) were responsible for the most terror incidents (1,325) and fatalities (7,417) in 2020, followed by ISIS-Core (which comprises the ISIS elements in Iraq and Syria), al-Shabaab, CPI-Maoists and ISIS-DR Congo, the US analysis shows.Mumbai-based national security analyst Sameer Patil said: “The pandemic provided the opportunity for many terrorist groups worldwide to regroup and strengthen their activities as much of the attention in the last one year was focused on containing the Covid outbreak and enforcing lockdowns. The same can also be said for the Left Wing Extremist groups in India.”“With regard to the situation in the Kashmir Valley, the mainstream terrorist tanzeems regrouped under different front organisations to carry out random acts of violence targeting the security forces, minorities and other vulnerable sections of the society. For carrying out this violence, they relied on the Over Ground Workers, which also helped them to escape security forces’ dragnet. This kind of violence was sensational but also difficult to sustain, which is exactly what has happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-attacks-rose-during-pandemic-year-in-india-us-report-101640542605120.html
27-12-2021||India||Terrorist linked to murder of cop shot dead in Anantnag||A suspected terrorist involved in the murder of a police officer last week was gunned down by security forces in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district on Sunday.The deceased man, a member of the terror organisation Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK), was identified as Faheem Bhat of Kadipora in Anantnag, police said.“He had recently joined terror outfit ISJK and was involved in killing of martyr, assistant sub-inspector Mohd Ashraf, who was posted at police station Bijbehara,” said Vijay Kumar, inspector general of police, Kashmir.Unidentified men had on Wednesday evening shot at Ashraf, who succumbed to his injuries.In the past three days, security forces have killed six suspected terrorists in south Kashmir, including four on Saturday in two separate gunfights.On Sunday’s shooting, a police spokesperson said security forces received information regarding the presence of a terrorist in Kalan Sirgufwara village of Anantnag on Saturday evening, following which a joint cordon and search operation was launched by security forces.The terrorist was given ample opportunity to surrender, the spokesperson said. “However, he denied the surrender opportunities and instead, fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party.In the ensuing encounter, the trapped terrorist was killed and his body was retrieved from the site of encounter. He has been identified as Faheem Bhat,” the spokesperson said.Police have registered a case under relevant sections of law.“Pertinently, in the last 48 hours, joint teams of police and security forces neutralized six terrorists in four successful anti-terrorist operations without any collateral damage,” the spokesperson added.Meanwhile, two policemen were injured in a grenade attack in Pulwama district on Sunday evening, PTI reported. The attack took place at Pulwama’s main square, said the report, adding that terrorists hurled a grenade at a police team.WITH PTI INPUTS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-linked-to-murder-of-cop-shot-dead-in-anantnag-101640542482270.html
27-12-2021||India||In 20 years, 51% sessions adjourned early in Parliament: Rajya Sabha data||Adjourning a Parliament session ahead of its schedule—as has been the case in the last five sessions—is neither a new trend nor an exception. For, 51% or 32 of 62 sessions in the past 20 years had to be curtailed for various reasons, a Rajya Sabha secretariat analysis showed.Disruptions, an increasing trend in parliamentary strategy, were in focus in the recently concluded winter session of Parliament that saw Rajya Sabha proceedings washed out partially. It also saw the suspension of 13 members over unparliamentary behaviour, only to rake up a row over the validity of such suspension.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu asked for a report on the trend of early adjournments after the winter session was cut short on December 22, a day ahead of schedule. To be sure, the winter session fared better than the last four sessions as some of them were shortened by a week or even 13 days.The analysis of early adjournments showed that since the 193rd session held during July-August 2001, 32 of the 63 sessions till the just concluded winter session, ended before schedule. While 25 sessions (40%) of the 63 ran their full course, 6 sessions (9%) concluded beyond the scheduled duration.Since 2020, Parliament has been affected by the Covid pandemic starting with last year’s budget session that was cut short by 13 days. This time, too, the session was wrapped up a day before schedule amid fears over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.“On account of running short of the scheduled calendar of sittings, the Rajya Sabha has lost a total of 108 sittings (7.42% of the total scheduled sittings) over the last 20 years. With the House meeting beyond the schedule for a total of 23 sittings in 6 sessions, the net loss in sittings was 85, accounting for 6% of the total scheduled sittings of 1,455 over 20 years,” the analysis said.During the Narendra Modi government, 14 of 25 sessions held since June 2014 fell short of schedule, accounting for 56% of the total.“Reasons for such early adjournments include disruptions, agreement among the parties, government’s proposals, elections and the pandemic recently,” said a senior official of the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-20-years-51-sessions-adjourned-early-in-parliament-rajya-sabha-data-101640542361451.html
27-12-2021||India||Majority not a defence for arbitrary action: CJI Ramana||Chief justice of India N V Ramana on Sunday said a popular majority is not a defence for arbitrary actions of the government and underscored that all wings of the government should work within the Constitutional limits. He added that it would be “unthinkable” for democracy to function “without judicial review.”Delivering the fifth Sri Lavu Venkatewarlu endowment lecture on ‘Indian Judiciary – Challenges of future’ at Siddhartha Law College in Vijayawada, the CJI also criticized the tendency to brand judicial review as judicial overreach.“Such generalisations are misguided…If judiciary does not have power to review, then functioning of the democracy in the country would be unthinkable,” he said.He also raised concern over the growing tendency to disregard and even disrespect orders of the court. “The executive needs to assist and co-operate for rule of law to prevail in the nation,” he said.He also dismissed the criticism that judges themselves are appointing judges and said it is one of the “widely propagated myths”.Justice Ramana said the judiciary was one of the many players involved in the process of appointing judges and said some of the recommendations made by high courts on appointment of judges are still to be transmitted to the Supreme Court by the law ministry.The CJI referred to a recent comment made by Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Kerala John Brittas in Rajya Sabha that the appointment of judges by judges in India was unheard of anywhere in the world. He wondered whether the appointment of judges should be shrouded in mystery, secrecy and darkness. Brittas had made the remark on December 21 during a debate on The High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021.“It is nowadays fashionable to reiterate phrases such as ‘judges are themselves appointing judges’. I consider this to be one of the widely propagated myths,” the CJI said.Ramana pointed out that many authorities were involved in the appointment process including the law ministry, state governments, governor, high court collegiums, intelligence bureau and the topmost executive. “I am sad to note that the well-informed also propagate the aforesaid notion. After all, this narrative suits certain sections,” Ramana said.He called for improving the service conditions of judges to attract the best talent and fill vacancies.The CJI pointed out that people approach the judiciary only when other state organs fall short of constitutional expectations. Considering the monetary and psychological impact of litigation, no individual would like to approach the court without a serious grievance, he said.Stating that pendency of cases was a complex issue, he said it could only be resolved through a multi-pronged approach. Increased use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), clear legislation, executive actions within legally prescribed limits, cooperation of advocates and litigants, prompt implementation of orders, respecting the rule of law, etc., are part of the solution.He said there were 46 million cases pending before Indian courts. By itself, this number is not a very useful indicator, taking into consideration 1.4 billion population of India and the judge-to-population ratio of 21 judges per million.“Nearly 47 percent of the total litigation comprises government cases. Actions or inaction of authorities leads to a lot of litigation in the country,” he said.
27-12-2021||India||SP dreaming of winning polls to stop Ram temple work, says Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday accused the Samajwadi Party (SP) of “daydreaming” of coming back to power in Uttar Pradesh and stopping the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Uttar Pradesh is slated to go to the polls early next year.“Samajwadi Party is daydreaming that it will come to power again in Uttar Pradesh and they will stop the ongoing work at Ram Janmabhoomi. Akhilesh Ji, no one can stop the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” Shah said at a public rally as part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jan Vishwas Yatra, in Jalaun.He also accused the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of being “casteist”, adding that there were only  “three Ps: Parivarwaad, Pakshpaath, and Palayan under the SP rule”.“I want to say that we are going win more than 300 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election 2022. Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party are casteist parties. But Modi Ji and Yogi Ji stand for Sabka saath, sabka vikas,” he said.In the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party bagged 312 of the 403 seats, while the SP bagged 47, the BSP won 19 and the Congress could manage only seven seats.Without naming the SP or its leader Akhilesh Yadav, he said that those who got karsevaks fired upon and were instrumental in toppling the Kalyan Singh government haven’t liked the construction (of the temple) one bit.They are daydreaming that fortune would smile on them and they would get power in Uttar Pradesh, he said.“It (stopping the work) is not going to happen no matter what anyone thinks or tries,” Shah said, adding that SP and BSP used to taunt the BJP for using Ram temple merely as a poll plank.“Modi ji has fulfilled his promise just after getting the solid mandate from the people (for a second term). Soon, a Ram temple as high as the sky will be visible for all in Ayodhya,” he said in Orai.He accused the Opposition of feeling ashamed to restore the glory of Hindu symbols.At the other rally in Kasganj, he asked the crowd if they would vote for those against the Ram temple in Ayodhya.The home minister also referred to the recently inaugurated Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi.“The corridor of (Kashi) Vishwanath temple was deserted since the time of Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, but Modiji changed it all in Varanasi. Now, one carry gangajal directly to the temple in Varanasi. The Congress, the SP and the BSP all opposed but Modi abolished Article 370 in Kashmir on August 5, 2019. There was terrorism during Congress rule at the Centre, but Prime Minister Modi carried out surgical strikes across the border when terrorists targeted Uri and Pulwama,” the home minister said.He termed the SP and BSP as casteist parties.“The regime of ‘Bua and Babua’ (Mayawati and Akhilesh) in Uttar Pradesh did not do any development for the masses and were confined to caste-based politics and their own families. On the other hand, the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, has worked for all,” he said both in Orai and at Kasganj, where the BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra reached on Sunday.Hitting back, Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “It’s already apparent that the BJP is getting panic attacks. There’s massive buildup of support for Samajwadi Party as people want it back to put the state back on development track. The divisive and hate politics won’t work.”Shah said that all six Jan Vishwas Yatras, flagged off on December 19 and travelling through 403 assembly constituencies, were getting a warm welcome from supporters across the state.Kasganj is part of Etah parliamentary constituency from where former Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh governor and ex-UP chief minister the late Kalyan Singh, had been elected as MP.Amit Shah remembered Kalyan Singh and described him as a leader who let his chief minister’s post go (in 1992) when it came to the cause of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.“The landslide victory for BJP in 2014, 2017 and 2019 would not have been possible if there was no Kalyan Singh,” said Amit Shah.“Kalyan Singh ji spoke of good governance within Uttar Pradesh for the first time. He worked towards giving rights to the backward society. Kalyan Singh ji chose Ram Janmabhoomi over the chief minister’s chair,” he said.Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer Singh ‘Raju’, the current BJP MP from Etah, shared the stage with Amit Shah at Kasganj.“During the past regime in UP before 2017, girl students used to stay away from schools, but in these five years of Yogi Adityanath’s tenure as CM, it is now the criminals who are leaving the state. Decades had passed but work on the Ram temple in Ayodhya could not begin. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was voted to power again in 2019 and the Ram temple construction became a reality,” said Shah.“Earlier, there used to be riots in Uttar Pradesh, but now medical colleges and expressways are coming up in Uttar Pradesh. Not a single riot has taken place in Yogi Adityanath’s rule in the state. Incidents of loot, rape and kidnapping have gone down in UP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made free of cost vaccination for over 130 crore citizens of India a possibility,” Shah said.Talking about the development works in UP, he said, “Eighteen big schemes are being launched in the state. Thirty medical colleges and five expressways are coming up in Uttar Pradesh. Sugarcane farmers are being paid their due amount and 20 sugar mills are being modernized.” The Union home minister ended his speech with “Jai Sri Ram”.In Kasganj, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya highlighted that SP president Akhilesh Yadav did not pay tribute to “Babuji’ (Kalyan Singh) and asked his followers to avenge the insult to Singh who championed the cause of the backward castes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sp-dreaming-of-winning-polls-to-stop-ram-temple-work-says-amit-shah-101640541882187.html
27-12-2021||India||Seven months and counting: The longest Silger stir retains its verve||It is 10 pm on a cold December night. A group of about 30 teenaged boys and girls are gathered around bonfires under a tamarind tree in Silger village. The light from the fires cuts through the darkness, the silhouette of the forests flickering in the shadows. The gathering at this hour, in this part of Chhattisgarh, is unusual. For Silger is in the forested heart of south Bastar, the epicentre of a deadly, decades-long battle between security forces and Maoist insurgents. A battle where many innocents have been caught in the crossfire.On a usual day, Silger would have been pitch black, and eerily quiet. But voices suddenly pierce the night air. The teenagers have started singing. The song is new, and has no name. But the chorus has the words “O adivasi re...jaago re”(Awake, O Adivasi). They start singing the verse, “tere saamne tere bhai ko goli maara re...tere saamne tere ghar dwaar cheen liya re (they shot your brother in front of you, they stole your home in front of you).”It is a song of protest.Around the singers, there’s movement in the makeshift tarpaulin tents, and scores of protesters emerge and join in. Thousands of kilometres away, farmer collectives may have won their battle with the government and left for home in joyous victory marches, but in the Chhattisgarh hinterland, a protest, now the longest in Bastar’s history, has been going on for the past seven months. A protest that has all the markings of the region’s macabre and complicated history – protest against a security camp, four deaths, a typical government response centred on calling the dead and protesters Maoists or sympathisers, and a long impasse that has gone on into winter without any constructive intervention.The beginning of the Silger protestOn May 12, residents of Silger began protests against a new camp of the Central Reserve Police Force. For four days, the number of protesters swelled. The villagers argued there was no permission for the camp, and that it would only bring more harassment to residents. The security agencies argued that it was the villagers who had asked for the camp, that it was key to driving away Maoists and bringing any form of development, and that the protests were being pushed by Maoist cadre.Five days later, as the number of protesters kept rising and more villages joined in, there was sudden gunfire. Chhattisgarh Police said it was an exchange of fire with Maoists in the crowd, but villagers claimed the security forces unilaterally opened fire. Three people were brought dead to the hospital. A few days later, a fourth woman succumbed to her injuries as well.“On the night of May 16, the protesters returned to their villages, but the next afternoon some people, including some Maoists of Jagargunda Area Committee, reached the camp and started firing. When the camp was attacked, the security personnel retaliated,” Sunderaj P, inspector general of police in Bastar, had said at the time.A day later, Sunderaj told the media that the three that died immediately were from “frontal organisations” of the Maoists.“The deceased were identified as Uska Pandu, a Bhumkal commander from Timmapur village (Sukma); Kowasi Waga, DAKMS (Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan) member from Chhutwahi; and Kursam Bhima, militia member from Gundem village (Bijapur),” he said.But two weeks later, a two-member fact finding team comprised of noted economist and human rights activist Jean Dreze and lawyer activist Bela Bhatia visited the spot, and said they found no evidence that supported the police claim that an armed group of agitators took over the protest on May 17, and intended to burn down the CRPF camp, leaving the forces with no choice but to open fire.The report said the camp was set up in the dead of night at around 3 am on May 12, without informing villagers, and about 40-50 of them were dispersed by force when they protested against the camp the next day.“On May 14, about a thousand adivasis of five gram panchayats started a mass protest... People shouted slogans demanding the removal of the camp. Every day the police tried to disperse them, sometimes with lathis, sometimes with “mirchi pataka” or tear gas. Dozens of protestors sustained minor injuries... and returned to their villages for local treatment,” the activists alleged.Witnesses alleged that by May 17, the number of protestors grew exponentially, perhaps touching 10,000, and some of them started pelting stones after a baton charge, and tear gas and bullets being fired into the air to control the crowds, Dreze and Bhatia said.“By that time the forces were on both sides of the road with protesters in the middle. Soon police firing started. Three protestors were killed on the spot (one of them, Uika Pandu, also called Murali, of Timmapuram village, who was hit in the head, was only 16 or 17 years old), at least another three had bullet injuries and as many as 40 were injured in one way or another,” they said.Chhattisgarh Police maintained that the CRPF camp was established to facilitate construction of a road on the Basaguda-Jagargunda axis, as it was an important corridor for Maoists and a stronghold of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army Battalion number 1, led by Maoist commander Hidma.Sunderaj had then refuted claims made in the fact-finding report and said villagers were properly briefed about the nature of the camp on May 13 by police and an executive magistrate, and they returned convinced with the response.“Meanwhile, the Maoists were planning to destabilise this camp to protect their corridor. So the Naxals mobilised their frontal organisation members and militia cadres from the surrounding area and sent them to Silger on May 17 with a conspiracy to instigate violence and launch an attack on the security forces deployed in the Silger camp,” the Bastar police chief said.How has the protest run for seven monthsOn May 20, a group of protesters banded around the Mool-Vaasi Bachao Manch (platform to save indigenous people), the aim of which was to streamline the Silger protest. Raghu Madyami, 21, president of the Manch, has been leading the protest with 26 other office bearers since then.The Manch later formed a cultural wing, the Mool Niwasi Sankriti Kala Manch, which now composes songs , slogans and plays. For the past seven months, the platform has sought to build systems that are sustainable for a mass protest.In the middle of December, when HT reached the spot, there were about 20 small camps of protestors. “Each camp belongs to a village taking part in this protest. Every five days, a group of villagers come here and reside in their village’s camp. They bring their food and cook. Each day at around 11am, we protest outside the Mokur camp, which is 700 metres from here, and the next day, another group comes to replace them,” said Raghu, sitting outside the Timmapuram village camp in Silger.For the Manch or other protestors who come from far-flung areas, villagers donate cereals. “We have also developed two acres of land for vegetables in the last seven months,” said Raju Sori, president of Mool Niwasi Kala Manch.A day starts at 7am, and protesters cook and eat by 10. They then march towards the camp to mark their protest and return by 2pm. Groups then begin to search for wood for fires that must burn at night. By 7, dinner is done, and from 8pm to midnight, they sing the winter away. Every day for the past seven months.Silger’s impact in BastarThe Silger protest has marked a new shift in the Maoist-state conflict in Bastar, inspiring more protests against the establishment of security camps, and other sites. Over the past few weeks, there have been demonstrations at a newly made Border Security Force camp in Kanker district, and the sites of alleged police atrocities like Sarkeguda and Gompad.The firing in Silger led to a rethink in the police establishment on how to establish new camps, according to an Indian Police Service officer serving in Bastar. “As security forces penetrate core Maoist areas, some protests will be there, but it can be handled by the resolution of genuine demands of villagers and winning their confidence,” he said requesting anonymity.Soni Sori, a tribal rights activist, said that the state government was mistaken in its belief that the protest would die a natural death, and this could have political consequences. “I believe that it is the longest protest of tribals in the history of Bastar against any government. The way people reacted after the agitation against the Salwa Judum, which sidetracked the Congress for 15 years, similar things will happen in the next election. I am not sure if they will return to power,” she said.“None of the questions that the Adivasis tried to raise through the movement have been answered by the government yet,” Bhatia said. “Why was a camp established on village land without telling them, or without a gram sabha (village council meeting)? Why was a judicial enquiry not ordered into the killings of the three protestors and the woman who succumbed to her injuries later? Why has the report of the enquiry conducted by the Sukma deputy collector not been made public yet? When will the guilty policemen be punished?”Government responseDespite the hard stance police and the administration initially took on the firing, over the months the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government has made a climbdown, attempting to reach out to protesters. On July 1, a delegation of protesters and activists met with chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, where the families of the victims were offered a compensation and jobs.“When the chief minister asked about our demands, we told him that we want an inquiry into the matter led by three retired judges, which will include a Dalit judge, a tribal and one non-tribal judge. The chief minister also offered compensation and jobs, but the people were not ready to accept. They want an investigation first,” said Soni Sori, who was present in the meeting.Telam Ramdas, one of the many protesters from Gomguda village, said that they wanted to see administrative action before they accept compensation. “Our demands are simple – terminate the official responsible for killing our brothers, and take back the camp,” he said.While no judicial probe has been ordered, the state government ordered an enquiry at the level of the sub-divisional magistrate on August 12, which is yet to submit its report. “The probe is ongoing and in its last stages,” said Vineet Nandanwar, collector, Sukma.In an interview with HT on December 17, chief minister Baghel defended his government’s stance, and pointed to the attempts at dialogue. “Which government has met and talked to the people where the incident has taken place? We have sent the member of Parliament, legislators and also the members of their own community to have dialogue with them,” Baghel said.Asked why then his government had failed to quell the protests, Baghel said, “Those helpless people have been made to sit to protest at gunpoint. But it is the very first time that the population over there is with us, on our side. The camps are established on their demand only.”Back in Silger, 497km from Raipur, the group of protesters is still singing, and it is now close to midnight. When the clock strikes 12, the protesters will return to their camps to adjourn for the day.They will be back tomorrow. One young protester said, “We will sing every night until our demands are met.”

Some of them may well be regular ones. A list is being prepared.”Two other factories in vicinity were also damaged, he said.Three of the seven people who died have been identified. They were Prakash Rai of West Champaran, and Vinod Rai and Sandeep Kumar, residents of Mushari in Muzaffarpur district, said Gyan Prakash, subdivisional magistrate of Muzaffarpur East.Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed sorrow over the tragedy and announced a compensation of ₹4 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased. He ordered a probe into the blast.“We need to find out why the factory was operational on a Sunday. A government certificate was given for operation of the boiler in May,” said Ramsurat Rai, the state’s revenue and land reforms. “A high-level inquiry to be conducted, followed by action against those found guilty.”Local people rushed to the spot after the explosion and rushed some of the victims to the Shri Krishna Medical College and Hospital with help from the district administration.

27-12-2021||India||Understanding the unequal nature of India’s economic recovery||That the Indian economy is recovering from the pandemic’s disruption is an undisputable fact. However, what is under doubt is not the existence of the recovery itself, but the nature of it. Here are four charts which suggest that India’s growth might have become more unequal in its post-pandemic phase.The different trajectories of fuel consumptionBecause the pandemic forced imposition of social distancing norms, tracking mobility levels became among the most important indicators of restoration of economic activity in the post-pandemic phase. Mobility levels have been increasing consistently in India, if data from Google Mobility indices is to be believed.However, what is also true is that most technology-based mobility indicators – they use Internet-based devices to track mobility – have a formal sector bias. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (Nibri) for example, uses the Apple Driving Index, which sources data from persons with access to Apple devices. This source – the poor are less likely to be using mobile Internet devices – introduces a pro-rich bias in these indicators.Tracking fuel consumption from the petroleum ministry’s database offers some evidence into this bias and highlights a class aspect to restoration of mobility, and by extension, economic activity in the Indian economy. While consumption for all kinds of transportation fuel – petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) – fell sharply during the first lockdown, petrol and diesel led the recovery as restrictions were eased in 2020, a trend which continued in 2021. This was understandable as there were significant restrictions on air travel even after the easing of lockdown restrictions. However, this trend has reversed in the past few months and it is ATF consumption which is closing its gap with pre-pandemic consumption levels, while the consumption of petrol and diesel has actually shown a dip. Numbers speak for themselves. Consumption of petrol-diesel as a share of pre-pandemic levels (2019-20) has actually lost momentum in the last two months whereas this trend is not to be seen in the consumption of ATF. Even LPG consumption shows a similar trend as petrol-diesel.While predicting the exact reason for this trend is an exercise in speculation, the adverse impact of higher petrol-diesel and LPG prices on consumption, and hence mobility, cannot be ruled out. End consumers of ATF are richer than those who consume petrol-diesel. A March 2021 HT analysis by Vineet Sachdev cited data from a survey commissioned by the petroleum ministry to argue that the poor have a large share in consumption of petrol and diesel in India.Difference in revival of two-wheeler and passenger car salesThe demand for two-wheelers and passenger cars are a widely accepted proxy for purchasing power of the non-rich and rich in India. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that the two were moving broadly in tandem the year before the pandemic struck. This seems to have changed after the pandemic. While the sale of passenger cars saw a sharp revival in the first quarter of 2021-22, this was not the case for two-wheeler sales. A November 2021 Bloomberg Quint story quoted a Bajaj Auto Ltd (an important two-wheeler manufacturer in India) official describing the two-wheeler demand as being “stressed”. To be sure, sales data for both cars and two-wheelers has been contaminated because of the supply-side problem due to shortage of microchips. Still, the divergence in trajectory of revival in demand for cars and bikes underlines the class-difference in purchasing powers post pandemic.The class-difference in economic sentimentThe persisting stress in the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Surveys (CCS) has been among the most important indicators of general stress levels in the economy.While the RBI’s CCS is important statistical evidence, it has two important limitations. CCS is only conducted in urban areas (13 major Indian cities to be precise) and it does not give a class-wise break-up of economic sentiment.CMIE’s consumer sentiment numbers can fill an important gap here. The Index of Current Economic Conditions in the CMIE’s consumer pyramid survey is based on comparison of financial condition of households compared to a year ago, and their perception about whether or not this is a good time to buy consumer durables such as televisions and two-wheelers etc. The Index of Current Economic Conditions highlights the class-wise disparity when it comes to the pandemic’s impact. This index was broadly same across different income categories – they vary from less than ₹1 lakh per year to more than ₹10 lakh – in November 2017. While the richest started increasing their gap, it was still not very high until November 2019. This gap increased in a big way by November 2020 and has still not closed in a significant manner in November 2021, the latest period for which monthly data is available. If the Indian economy has to achieve a sustainable growth trajectory, it is crucial that the economic sentiment of the non-rich recovers as well. This is all the more important given the fact that some of the pent-up demand from the rich, both for goods as well as services (vacations for example) could begin to dissipate going forward.
