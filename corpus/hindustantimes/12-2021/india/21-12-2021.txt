21-12-2021||India||Anti-conversion bill tabled in Karnataka assembly amid din||The Basvaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka on Tuesday tabled the controversial anti-conversion bill in the ongoing winter session of the state legislature in Belagavi, triggering heated exchanges with the principal opposition party, Congress.Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri put the tabling of the bill by home minister Araga Jnanendra to a vote even as the Congress members were yet to return from the lunch break, prompting angry reactions by the opposition.The Congress objected to the tabling of the bill, Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2021, with party president DK Shivakumar tearing up the document on the floor of the House.“This bill has been brought in with mala fide intentions,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition, said, calling it a violation of basic human rights.Kageri said that the bill will be taken up for discussion on Wednesday but the Congress appeared defiant, staging a walkout eventually.The heated exchanges between the ruling and principal opposition party came even as protests against the bill gained steam across Karnataka. The proposal was first made by the Bommai-led government during the monsoon session of the state legislature in September.The BJP tried to reason over the intent of the bill, only to be shouted over by the Congress.KS Eshwarappa, Karnataka’s minister of rural development and panchayat raj and a senior BJP leader, said the Congress was trying to appease the Muslim and Christian communities as part of its vote-bank politics.Eshwarappa stood to object to the Congress when R Ashok, a senior BJP leader, asked his colleague to make a “Hindutva” statement in favour of the bill.“As soon as the revenue minister started speaking, the Congress agreed. But then three Congress legislators spoke among themselves and said that we have to satisfy Muslims and Christians and then walked out,” Eshwarappa said.“They do not want north Karnataka. They want conversion from Hindus to Muslims and Christians and want to make India like Pakistan where the percentage of population (of Hindus) has come down from 24% to 3%,” he added.The bill came at a time when there have been several attacks against the Christian community across the state.It is also part of the BJP’s attempt to introduce more laws in the state in line with its core ideology. The government has already implemented a law severely restricting the slaughter of cattle and has now proposed to introduce the Special Marriages Act against what right wing organisations, many affiliated to the RSS, the BJP’s ideological parent, term “love jihad”, that is marriage between Hindu women and Muslim men with the intention of converting the former to Islam.“No person shall convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by any of these means or by promise of marriage, nor shall any person abet or conspire such conversion: Provided that if any person reconverts to his immediate previous religion the same shall not be deemed to be a conversion under this Act,” the proposed bill said.The BJP has argued that there were mass conversions taking place by force and allurement across the state, which was a threat to “Indian culture”.The bill also proposes jail time of 3-10 years for violators, including fines of up to ₹1 lakh.Anyone willing to convert will have to submit an application to the district collector who will scrutinise the application and interview the applicant to ascertain if the conversion is not by force or allurement.If the application is found to be genuine, then other departments will be informed to ensure the converting person loses benefits from his existing caste or religion and be included into the category into which the said person is converting.Any marriage which has happened with the sole purpose of unlawful conversion or vice-versa by a man of one religion with a woman of another religion, either by converting himself before or after marriage or by converting the woman before or after marriage, shall be declared null and void by the family court or, where a family court is not established, by a court having jurisdiction to try such cases on a petition presented by either party against the other party of the marriage“Making K’taka a Uttar Pradesh is not only bad for investments & job opportunities, but will kill rational thinking prevalent dominantly in our state. The BJP Govt’s ideology is weighing down the progress of the state,” Priyank Kharge, former minister and Congress legislator, said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticonversion-bill-tabled-in-karnataka-assembly-amid-din-101640108373484.html

Doctors decode||Doctors in Delhi said patients infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have milder symptoms in terms of severity in comparison to Delta strain and some of them didn't complain of fever.Dr Suresh Kumar, the medical director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital, said of the 34 Omicron patients they have treated so far, most were asymptomatic.“One patient was having low-grade fever, one complained about body ache and the rest of them were having cold-like symptoms,” he told news agency ANI.Dr Kumar said all the patients were given symptomatic treatment only and none of them required steroids, oxygen or antiviral. “We are giving paracetamol tablets only if somebody has a fever,” he said.Also Read | Three times more transmissible than Delta: Govt warns states, UTs on OmicronDr Manoj Sharma, a senior consultant of internal medicine at Delhi's Fortis Hospital, also said Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, which was discovered in India last year and caused panic across the globe, in terms of severity. “Although it is a very early stage to generalise about the symptoms of Omicron,” he told ANI.Dr Sharma pointed out that data from across the world also suggests the severity of illness in Omicron patients is less than those who were infected with the Delta variant. “In the older age population or those with comorbidities, any disease is more severe,” he said, adding it's “too early” to certainly state anything on the severity of Omicron.Omicron, which has been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the World Health Organization (WHO) similar to the Delta strain, has been triggering worrying signals due to its high transmissibility. To explain this, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Lalit Kant referred to a study conducted in Hong Kong.The experiment was conducted outside the human body by taking tissues from the bronchus of patients during surgery and using it to grow the virus in the laboratory.Also Read | Do existing Covid-19 vaccines work on Omicron? Govt's replyDr Kant said the study showed after 24 hours, the Omicron variant replicated nearly 70 times more than Delta or the original strain that was found in Wuhan in China. "This could lead to people shedding more viruses and infecting others more easily," he was quoted as saying by ANI.Dr Kant said as per the study, the Omicron replicated “10 times slower” in the lung tissue, which could be a probable explanation for it exhibiting milder symptoms as opposed to the Delta strain.Also Read | 3 Omicron cases confirmed in Jammu, officials says no abroad travel historyDr Kant, however, cautioned against drawing conclusions with certainty as the study has been published online and is yet to be peer reviewed.India has so far reported 216 Omicron cases, with Maharashtra and Delhi accounting for the most number of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-is-more-transmissible-has-milder-symptoms-than-delta-doctors-decode-101640099210912.html

The Instagram accounts of my children have also been hacked,” Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Priyanka Gandhi’s allegation comes after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav accused Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath of tapping telephone exchanges and claimed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also listened to those recordings every evening.“All our phone calls are being heard.

21-12-2021||India||Three times more transmissible than Delta: Govt warns states, UTs on Omicron||The Centre on Tuesday asked state governments and administrations of Union territories to increase surveillance, saying the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is three times more transmissible than Delta.“Hence, even greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making and strict and prompt containment action are required at the local as well as district levels,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to the health departments of the states and the Union territories.The variant, which has led to shutdowns and has become the dominant strain responsible for the surge of infections across Europe and other countries, has now infected more than 200 people over a period of fewer than three weeks causing the government concern.The bulk of these Omicron cases is from Delhi and Maharashtra, with the western state detecting 11 cases on Tuesday, which took the tally in the state to 65. Delhi has recorded 54 Omicron cases so far.Bhushan asked state and Union territories to impose restrictions if the rate of new infections reached 10 per cent or higher in a week or if 40 per cent of oxygen or ICU beds were occupied.“Keeping in mind the higher transmissibility of Omicron, States/UTs (union territories) can take containment measures and restrictions even before these thresholds are reached,” Bhushan said.“Activate the War rooms/EOCs (Emergency Operation Centre) and keep analysing all trends and surges, no matter how small and keep taking proactive action at the district/local level,” he added.India, which has vaccinated at least 88 per cent of its eligible population against Covid-19, is now urging citizens to get their second jab as well as follow preventive measures in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus disease amid a renewed threat posed by the Omicron variant.The variant, first detected in southern African nations in November, has higher transmission rates but experts are yet to understand if the disease severity is lesser when compared to the previous variants||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-times-more-transmissible-than-delta-govt-warns-states-uts-on-omicron-101640100373556.html

Stalin sought the Central government’s intervention for the release of the fishermen.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was “concerned at the detention of Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu by Sri Lankan authorities” during December 18-20. “As per our information, 68 fishermen and 10 boats have been taken into custody,” he said.“Our high commission in Colombo has taken up the issue of early release of the Indian fishermen and boats with the government of Sri Lanka,” Bagchi added.Officials from India’s consulate in Jaffna have met the detained fishermen and are “providing all necessary support”. This includes providing clothes, toiletries, snacks, dry essentials and masks to the fishermen, and facilitating phone calls to their relatives. The Indian officials are also arranging legal representation. “In the case of one fisherman who was indisposed, the Indian consular officer has visited him in the hospital to check on his welfare,” Bagchi said.He said the external affairs minister had received representations on the issue from various political parties. Jaishankar was also called on the matter by the Tamil Nadu chief minister, and the external affairs minister “has apprised them all of the current situation and underlined government of India’s efforts to secure early release” of the fishermen, Bagchi said.The Sri Lankan Navy detained the fishermen, most of them from Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, on charges of alleged poaching in the island nation’s waters. Fishermen’s associations in Tamil Nadu have contended the Union government has not done enough to address the issue of such detentions by Sri Lankan authorities.The associations also contended that the detained fishermen had not violated the maritime boundary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expresses-concern-at-detention-of-fishermen-by-sri-lanka-seeks-early-release-101640100634084.html

21-12-2021||India||‘Retire or will be messy’: Goa BJP’s Vishwajit Rane’s harsh advice to his father||PANAJI: Upset that veteran Congress leader Pratapsingh Rane might contest next year’s Goa elections, his son and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vishwajit Rane on Tuesday went public with his advice to his father, Pratapsingh Rane, to quit politics. If Pratapsingh doesn’t take his advice, Vishwajit added, he will contest against him and warned that it will ‘be very messy’.“At 83, why does he have to continue in politics? One should gracefully retire after becoming a chief minister for more than nine terms,” said Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane on Tuesday, hours after his father declared his intention to contest the state elections early next year.Then came the warning. “A person who is my idol and someone I have so much respect for, that person should gracefully retire, not retire in the battlefield. It will be a very messy thing,” Vishwajit said.Pratapsingh Rane, the Goa Congress’s most prominent face, is the state’s longest serving MLA; he has won 10 assembly elections since 1972. Pratapsingh also holds a record for having served as chief minister of the state for a little less than 16 years across six terms between 1980 and 2007.Vishwajit, who has represented Valpoi assembly seat since 2007, has been mostly in the Congress but joined the BJP in 2017 after elections and helped Manohar Parrikar become chief minister. A BJP leader said Vishwajit hoped to get a BJP ticket for his nominee from the neighbouring Poriem seat that his father represents. Both seats are along the forested eastern border with Karnataka and are considered the Rane family’s pocketborough.Vishwajit Rane’s harsh advice to Goa’s seniormost politician came after Pratapsingh announced his decision to contest the polls on a Congress ticket. “My workers have taken this decision (to contest). They have said that I should contest the elections. Let us see what people say. Party leadership will eventually decide whether I should contest or not,” Pratapsingh.said.Pratapsingh’s name didn’t figure in the Congress first list of eight candidates leading to speculation that he might finally call it quits after a nearly 50-year association in politics. Tuesday’s announcement appeared to have upset his son’s calculation.“I had requested him. We had discussed this. But I feel that Congress central leaders and state leaders are pressuring him, which is why he made the statement,” Vishwajit told reporters.Several hours after his outburst, Vishwajit Rane attempted a damage control. “Shri Pratapsingh Raoji Rane is my father and we shall sort this issue amicably. Although I have decided to contest from Poriem constituency, we will resolve this internally within the family,” he said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retire-or-will-be-messy-goa-bjp-s-vishwajit-rane-s-harsh-advice-to-his-father-101640098233131.html

Rai said that the centre only acts as a facilitator for the amicable resolution of these disputes. While many of these conflicts are long-standing issues, not always are they dormant. In July for instance, there was a massive flare-up on the Assam Mizoram border which left 6 police personnel dead.

Govt's reply||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Tuesday there is no evidence to suggest existing Covid-19 vaccines being used in the government’s vaccination drive do not work on the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, though some of the mutations reported on spike gene may lower their efficacy."There are limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron," Mansukh Mandaviya said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.Mandaviya was responding to a question on whether the vaccines being administered in the country are effective to develop immunity against the Omicron variant, which has been spreading across the world and is fuelling Covid-19 cases.Also read | Omicron alarm: India has 200 cases of new strain, Maha & Delhi top contributors"However, vaccine protection is also by antibodies as well as by cellular immunity, which is expected to be relatively better preserved. Hence vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease and, vaccination with the available vaccines remains crucial," the health minister added. His comments came as the government said India’s tally of the Omicron variant rose to 200 as cases have been detected in 12 states and Union territories so far. Out of the 200 Omicron patients, 77 patients have recovered or migrated.

The bill is in violation of SC Puttaswamy judgement and will lead to mass disenfranchisement. How can it be passed WITHOUT any DISCUSSION or SCRUTINY? It's a mockery of our democracy!"

Under a provision of the bill, the new applicant may voluntarily provide Aadhaar number along with the application for the purpose of identity.The people cited also said no application will be rejected on the grounds that Aadhaar number has not been provided, which Union law minister Kiren Rijiju said on Monday after the passage of the bill in the Lok Sabha.Also read | 'Giving vote to non-citizens': Shashi Tharoor on Election Laws (amendment) BillThey said Aadhaar linking with the electoral roll will root out multiple enrolments of the same person at different places.

21-12-2021||India||India blocks 20 YouTube channels, 2 websites for spreading anti-India propaganda||The central government blocked 20 YouTube channels and two websites on Tuesday for spreading anti-India propaganda and fake news on the internet, according to the ministry of information and broadcasting. The government said that most of the content posted by the channels pertains to “subjects sensitive from the perspective of national security and are factually incorrect.”The decision to block the YouTube channels and websites were taken by the ministry in close coordination with the intelligence agencies. The ministry said that the now blocked channels and websites belonged to a coordinated disinformation network from Pakistan and used to post divisive content on Kashmir, Indian Army, Ram Mandir, minority communities, and CDS General Bipin Rawat, among other various sensitive subjects related to India.A network of YouTube channels of Pakistan-based The Naya Pakistan Group (NPG) and some other standalone channels, with a combined subscriber base of over 35 lakh, were involved in the disinformation campaign. The ministry said that some of the YouTube channels of the Naya Pakistan Group were being operated by “anchors of Pakistani news channels”.The YouTube channels allegedly tried to incite the religious minorities against the Union government by posting content related to farmers’ protests and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.“It was also feared that these YouTube channels would be used to post content to undermine the democratic process of the upcoming elections in five states,” the ministry added.The ministry, exercising emergency powers under Rule 16 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, requested the telecom department to direct the internet service providers for blocking of the YouTube channels and portals.The YouTube channels blocked by the government were operating under the name of The Punch Line, InternationalWeb News, Khalsa TV,  The Naked Truth, 48 News, Fictional, Historical Facts, Punjab Viral, Naya Pakistan Global, Cover Story, Go Global, eCommerce, Junaid Haleem Official, Tayyab Hanif, Zain Ali Official, Mohsin Rajput, Official, Kaneez Fatima, Sadaf Durrani, Mian Imran, Ahmad, Najam Ul Hassan, Bajwa, and News24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-blocks-20-youtube-channels-2-websites-for-spreading-anti-india-propaganda-101640081912481.html
21-12-2021||India||BJP’s biting response to Rahul Gandhi on his one-line tweet attack on PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday tweeted a sharp attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that there has been a spike in instances of lynching after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014.“Before 2014, the word ‘lynching’ was practically unheard of. #ThankYouModiJi,” the 51-year-old Congress leader said in a Twitter post on Tuesday in Hindi and English.Gandhi’s swipe at PM Modi comes against a backdrop of instances of lynching of two accused following instances of alleged desecrations at Sikh shrines in Punjab over the past week. On Saturday, a man was killed over an alleged sacrilege bid at the Golden Temple. The following day, a second person was beaten to death for reportedly disrespecting the Sikh flag at a gurudwara in Punjab’s Kapurthala district.Amid simmering tensions over the two incidents, a row broke out on Monday over Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s comment at a public meeting on Sunday who demanded public execution for those found guilty of sacrilege “Anyone can make a mistake, but this is not a mistake, this is a conspiracy to weaken and finish the society,” he added.Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Tom Vadakkan promptly clapped back. “The dynast should remember 1984 and the anti-Sikh riots — that’s what set precedent to the act of lynching,” said Vadakkan, who was in the Congress for years before the one-time aide to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, joined the BJP in 2020.“Why is Congress dragging BJP into this state (Punjab) matter? This is their election game plan.”Former minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar also hit back at Rahul Gandhi.“Get facts right. 2000+ Sikhs were lynched in 1984 & Congress justified it. Selective amnesia will not work. We condemn all lynching,” Javadekar said.The 1984 riots took place when mobs, some allegedly including members of the Congress party, killed members of the Sikh community in retaliation for the assasination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi’s by her Sikh bodyguards. Over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in Delhi alone.To be sure, the National Crime Records Bureau, the government agency mandated to compile crime statistics, does not maintain figures of lynching. It did make an effort in 2017 but never published the data that was collected, reportedly due to flaws in the data since lynching is not classified as a separate offence in the penal code.A Supreme Court recommendation in 2018 to enact a special law to penalise lynching is still pending consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thank-you-modiji-tweets-rahul-gandhi-in-new-swipe-at-pm-bjp-s-biting-response-101640082031761.html
21-12-2021||India||Marriage bill, house registrations signs of women empowerment, says PM Modi | Top quotes||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched several initiatives in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh for the welfare of girl children and women in the poll-bound state.The initiatives include online transfer of ₹1,000 crore into bank accounts of 1.60 lakh women self-help groups (SHGs) and transferring over ₹20 crore to more than 1 lakh beneficiaries under the Mukhya Mantri Kanya Sumangala Scheme.Modi also laid the foundation stones of 202 take-home ration stores, known as Supplementary Nutrition Manufacturing Units, in 43 districts of the state. These units will be built at the cost of about ₹1 crore per unit and are being funded by the SHGs.Addressing a massive gathering of women attendees, the PM said the work done for empowering women in UP is being witnessed across the country. The event was attended by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya among others.Here’s what Modi said at the Prayagraj event:1. I salute the holy land of Prayagraj, which is situated on the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, by bowing my head. For hundreds of years, Prayagraj has been a symbol of nari shakti.2. Before coming on stage, I interacted with women of various welfare schemes, they shared talks of self-confidence. The work for empowerment of women done in UP is being witnessed by the country.3. (The) UP government has entrusted responsibility of transactions worth ₹75,000 crore on the shoulders of our mothers and sisters… the better they perform, the more will be their earning.4. Most of the homes given under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana are being registered in women's names. In UP, 30 lakh homes have been given and 25 lakh of them are in the name of women.5. The double engine government (BJP in power in state and the Centre) has constantly strived to improve the lives of the women.6. When we took on the task of taking the country forward, we took upon the task of uplifting the women of the country and made schemes that would help right from their birth to becoming financially self reliant.7. Though women have been given respect in our culture, for decades, land and property were kept in the name of men only…But my government is now removing this anomaly.8. In homes where women for generations, had no property in their name, have the entire house in their name [now]. This is true women empowerment.9. Efforts are being made to increase the age of marriage for daughters to 21 years. The country is taking this decision for its daughters.10. UP had a mafia raj and criminals had a say in the government, something that made the women suffer. It was difficult for them to roam on the roads. They (women) couldn't do anything as often powerful people used to pressure officials. However, now the criminals in UP are in jail. [Now], UP is safe and full of hope and opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-bill-house-registrations-signs-of-women-empowerment-says-pm-modi-101640076955521.html
21-12-2021||India||There is one ultimate ‘holy cow’ and that is national security, says HC||India has "holy cows" grazing from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to Vadipatti in Tamil Nadu and one dare not poke fun at them, the Madras High Court has held and said the Constitution would probably do with an amendment for "duty to laugh." All over the country, national security happens to be the "ultimate holy cow," the Madras High Court Bench observed. The court's observation came while quashing a police FIR filed against a person for a Facebook post of photos with an accompanying caption "Trip to Sirumalai for shooting practice," apparently written in a lighter vein.Justice G R Swaminathan invoked well-known satirists, cartoonists and journalists and said had they authored the judgement, "they would have proposed a momentous amendment to the Constitution of India to incorporate sub-clause (l) in Article 51-A," which deals with duty related to abiding by the Constitution and uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India among others. "To this, the hypothetical author would have added one more fundamental duty- duty to laugh. The correlative right to be funny can be mined in Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India (the use of crypto vocabulary to be forgiven)," the judge said in his recent order. Being funny is one thing and poking fun at another is different altogether, he added. "Laugh at what? is a serious question. This is because we have holy cows grazing all over from Varanasi to Vadipatty. One dare not poke fun at them. There is however no single catalogue of holy cows. It varies from person to person and from region to region." "A real cow, even if terribly underfed and emaciated, shall be holy in Yogi's terrain. In West Bengal, Tagore is such an iconic figure that Khushwant Singh learnt the lesson at some cost. Coming to my own Tamil Desh, the all-time iconoclast “Periyar” Shri E V Ramasamy is a super-holy cow. In today's Kerala, Marx and Lenin are beyond the bounds of criticism or satire. Chhatrapati Shivaji and Veer Savarkar enjoy a similar immunity in Maharashtra. But all over India, there is one ultimate holy cow and that is national security”, the judge said. Petitioner Mathivanan, an office-bearer of CPI (ML), had sought quashing the FIR registered by Vadipatti police in Madurai over his Facebook post that carried his pictures of a visit to Siruamalai with the caption in Tamil-- "Thuppakki Payirchikaga Sirumalai Payanam," translating to "Trip to Sirumalai for shooting practice." "The petitioner herein is an important office-bearer of a not-so-important political party. CPI (ML) is now an over-ground organization which contests elections also. Paper warriors are also entitled to fantasise that they are swadeshi Che Guevaras," the judge said. "Revolutionaries, whether real or phoney, are not usually credited with any sense of humour (or at least this is the stereotype). For a change, the petitioner tried to be funny. Perhaps it was his maiden attempt at humour," the judge said. But the police did not "find it to be a joke" and booked him under different sections of IPC, including collecting arms with intention of waging war against the Government of India and criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication (IPC 507), the judge pointed out. He said invoking IPC Section 507 "makes me laugh." "Section 507 IPC can be invoked only if the person sending the communication had concealed his identity. The communication must be anonymous. In this case, the petitioner had posted the photographs along with the caption in his Facebook page. He has not concealed his identity. There is nothing anonymous about the act in question," he said. In fact, none of the ingredients set out in the sections under which he was booked were present in the case, the court said. "The very registration of the impugned FIR is absurd and an abuse of legal process. It stands quashed," the judge ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-is-one-ultimate-holy-cow-and-that-is-national-security-says-hc-101640079653340.html
21-12-2021||India||DGCA issues revised guidelines on breath analyser tests||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked all airlines to have doctors or paramedics or emergency medical technicians for pre-flight breath analyser tests to make the detection of blood alcohol levels more robust for their crew. The regulator has directed them to conduct post-flight examinations in the aircraft after arrival. If tested positive for the first time, the pilots can choose if they would want to get tested again with the same equipment or an alternate one.“It is a well-known fact that even when the blood alcohol levels are zero in the body, there could be some effect of a hangover, which is mainly due to congeners… Even 12 hours after a bout of drink, when blood alcohol level remains zero, there is a decrement in task performance. Alcohol present in the body even in small quantities jeopardises flight safety on several counts and is likely to adversely affect an aviator well into the hangover period,” said the revised air safety civil aviation requirement (CAR) document issued on Monday.It added that crewmembers of all flights originating from India will be subjected to pre-flight breath-analyser examination first at the departure airport.A DGCA official said if the breath-analyser examination is positive, a repeat test will be carried out after a maximum of 20-25 minutes. “As per the previous CAR, the time between first and second test was around 15 minutes. Once the crew is detected positive...(they) shall give a declaration in respect of the use of equipment (same or alternate) for the conduct of a second test...,” said the official, who did not want to be named.Also Read: CCI approves acquisition of shareholding in Air India by Tata SonsDuring this time, the DGCA said the crew member being subjected to the test will be allowed to wash face and rinse mouth if required. “Before the second test is carried out, a control test must be taken on the equipment being used, to verify the serviceability and correctness of the...equipment. Both the readings so obtained will be recorded and print out taken,” said the revised CAR. It highlighted the importance of an educational programme for crew members about the dangers of flying after consumption of alcohol.The revised rules said the post-flight examination of each crew of all scheduled flights originating from destinations outside India will be carried out at the first port of landing in India. “In case of diversion of flights, due to unforeseen circumstances, to an airport or in Aircraft on Ground... condition, where facility for pre-flight BA examination is not available, the flight crew and cabin crew shall undergo post-flight breath-analyser examination at the first landing.”All the breath-analyser examination positive/missed cases shall have to be reported within 24 hours. “All the Scheduled operators shall ensure that the BA examination is recorded on camera and recording is to be preserved for six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-issues-revised-guidelines-on-breath-analyser-tests-101640077771241.html

You (Modi) apologise to farmers, but do not remove the minister.”Gandhi also slammed Union minister Mishra's remark of calling the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri an “accident”. “We will not spare him (Ajay Mishra); today or tomorrow, he will be sent to jail,” Gandhi also told reporters.Also Read| Lakhimpur violence: Ashish Mishra’s second bail plea rejectedLast week, the Congress leader moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha over the special investigation team's (SIT) report which stated that the Lakhimpur Kheri incident was a deliberate, pre-planned conspiracy.As the opposition parties demanded a discussion on the incident in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Centre does not want to conduct it.“They are not allowing us to speak, that’s why the House is being disrupted. Their minister is involved in it (Lakhimpur Kheri incident)… So a discussion should be allowed, but they don’t want to discuss it,” Gandhi told reporters on December 15.Since the beginning of the Winter Session of Parliament, opposition parties have targeted the Centre over the incident, and have demanded Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's removal from the top post. They had also demanded a discussion on the SIT's report.Also Read| Ajay Mishra Teni skips event amid calls for his resignationOn Tuesday, Congress MPs moved a suspension of business notice in the Rajya Sabha and adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 .

21-12-2021||India||Marriage bill sent to standing committee as Lok Sabha MPs oppose amendment||Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani on Tuesday said the government recommended the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in the Lok Sabha be sent to a standing committee. The amended bill proposes to increase the age of marriage of women from 18 to 21 years   Introducing the amendment bill in the lower House of Parliament, Irani earlier said, “I would like to present that women equality in our country needs to be seen in (terms of) age of marriage. Invoking different marriage laws of different faiths, I rise to introduce the amendment bill.”However, opposition leaders, including Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Gaurav Gogoi, AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Trinamool Congress’ Saugata Roy raised their objections to the bill.Chowdhury said the government did not consult any of the stakeholders before introducing the amendment and suggested the bill be sent to the standing committee.Stating that this is the second or third time that the government is aggressively bringing in a bill without consulting the opposition, NCP MP Supriya Sule the former is not even sticking to the business advisory council.In response, Irani said, “After so many years of Independence, men and women need equal rights in matrimony. This amendment gives equality to men and women in allowing both to marry at 21. Our research shows that 21 lakh child marriages had to be stopped and many underage girls were found pregnant. So you are stopping women from their right to equality.”Gogoi said, “Even the law commission had objections to the bill so it should be sent to the standing committee.” Roy said he opposed the bill that was introduced in a hurry. “The minorities are totally opposed to the bill and stakeholders need to be consulted,” he added.Owaisi said, “This is against fundamental rights. An 18-year-old can vote, but cannot get married? What is your ‘beti bachao programme’ about?”Soon after, the House was adjourned for the day. (With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-introduces-marriage-bill-in-lok-sabha-amid-mps-oppose-move-101640077106682.html
21-12-2021||India||Govt trashes reports of record low job generation under MGNREGS in December||The Union rural development ministry on Tuesday rejected news reports that cited data for the first 17 days of December and said the lowest ever employment has been generated in the month so far under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).“The work done in a particular month is counted against the MR filled up during the month. The scheme allows seven days’ window for the entry of the data. Thus, full data of December is usually available about 10 days into the next month. Thus, a comparison based on the data for the first 17 days takes into account the person-days that have been generated during a minor fraction of the month of December,” the ministry said in a statement.It added during the current financial year, over 261 crore person-days has been generated under MGNREGS as per the demand by the beneficiaries.The ministry said funds allocated for the scheme this financial year are over 18% in comparison to the previous year. During the current financial year so far, over ₹74,388 crore have been released for the implementation of the scheme.“Govt of India is committed to releasing funds for wage and material payments for proper implementation of the scheme, as per the provisions of the act and guidelines applicable for central government as well as state governments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-trashes-reports-of-record-low-job-generation-under-mgnregs-in-december-101640076811062.html

21-12-2021||India||Plea to remove PM photo from jab certificate dismissed. HC orders ₹1 lakh fine||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s picture on Covid-19 vaccination certificates and fined the petitioner ₹1 lakh while calling the plea “frivolous” and “politically motivated”. It said Modi is the country’s Prime Minister and not that of any political party or ideology and that such a petition was “not expected from a citizen”.A single-judge bench of justice P V Kunhikrishnan said if the petitioner, Peter Myalparambhil, failed to pay the fine, the Kerala State Legal Service Authority can initiate recovery proceedings. The court said Myalparambhil wasted its valuable time and the fine is a message to those who come up with “frivolous pleas”.“This is a frivolous petition filed with ulterior motives and I have a strong doubt that there is political agenda also to the petitioner. This is a publicity-oriented petition. Therefore, it is a fit case to be dismissed with a heavy cost,” the court said. It added when thousands of appeals, bail pleas, and civil suits are pending before it, such petitions waste judicial time. Earlier, the court gave time to Myalparambhil to withdraw the petition, but he insisted on continuing with the hearing.While hearing the petition, the court earlier observed: “He (Modi) is our Prime Minister, not the PM of any other country. He came to power through mandate. Merely because you have political differences, you cannot challenge this. Why are of ashamed of our PM? 100 crore people do not have any issue with this, so why do you?”Myalparambhil moved the court in October saying Modi’s photo on the certificates “has no substance, utility or relevance”. His lawyer, Ajit M Joy, called the vaccine certificate his private space and added he has certain rights over it. He said since the petitioner paid for the vaccine, the state cannot take undue credit for this. Joy called it a violation of his fundamental rights and said there should be an option to issue certificates without Modi’s image. He pointed out vaccination certificates of other countries do not have the images of their heads of the government. Kunhikrishnan responded saying: “They may not be proud of their PM, but we are. He became the PM because of the mandate of the people. We may have different political opinions, but still, he is our PM.”The Centre’s lawyer defended the use of Modi’s image along with his words and said they will help create general awareness and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour.During the previous hearing, Kunhikrishnan said the plea had larger implications and asked if someone comes with a plea to remove Mahatma Gandhi’s image from the currency notes, how can it be allowed. But Joy said Gandhi’s photo was printed on the notes as per the Reserve Bank of India’s regulations. He added Modi’s photo on vaccination certificates was not affixed on the basis of any statutory provision or rule.

His name had featured in the first list of eight candidates that the Congress had announced for the Assembly elections slated to be held early next year.Earlier this month, former Goa chief minister Ravi Naik resigned as Congress MLA. Before him, Luizinho Faleiro, another former chief minister, resigned from the Congress and joined the Mamata Banerjee-led party that is making a keen effort at making its presence felt in the coastal state and has decided to contest the upcoming polls.Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress is on its way to another thumping victory in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections having been declared winner in 54 of the 144 seats and leading in another 78 as per the latest official trends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-mla-aleixo-reginaldo-joins-tmc-day-after-resigning-from-congress-101640070856460.html
21-12-2021||India||Centre plans review plea in Supreme Court for OBC quota in local body elections||NEW DELHI: The Union government plans to file a review petition in the Supreme Court to allow political reservation of other backward classes (OBC) in local bodies and municipal corporations “for the time being” till the states meet the criteria set by the top court, a government statement issued late on Monday said.The government plan comes after the Supreme Court, in separate verdicts delivered over the past fortnight, struck down 27% reservation for OBCs in local body elections in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh citing the absence of empirical data on OBC.“Government is also considering moving a review petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court to allow political reservation of OBCs in the local bodies/municipal corporations for the time being till the States comply with the triple test criteria set forth by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” the statement by the union ministry of social justice and empowerment on Monday said.The ministry said it is consulting the law ministry and other stakeholders, including ministries of panchayati raj, parliamentary affairs and home affairs, in this regard.The triple test outlined by the Supreme Court includes setting up a dedicated commission to conduct a rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness as regards local bodies within the state, specifying the proportion of reservation required to be provisioned local body-wise according to the commission’s recommendations, and ensuring that reservation doesn’t exceed 50% of the seats reserved in favour of SCs, STs and OBCs taken together.On December 6, a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar stayed the Maharashtra government’s ordinance through which the state sought to introduce 27% reservation for OBCs in all zilla parishads and panchayat samitis without collecting data on OBCs in every municipal body seat. “Your political compulsions cannot be the basis to undo our judgment,” the bench remarked.The state government asked the court to let them access caste data collected by the Centre under the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011. But this request was not accepted after the Centre insisted that the data was unusable. On December 15, the top court told Maharashtra that local body elections in the state will be held without any OBC reservation.On December 17, the same bench stayed OBC quota in civic polls in Madhya Pradesh underlining that “it (also) was in conflict with the decision of the Constitution Bench of this court in K. Krishna Murthy & Ors. versus Union of India and reiterated by a three-judge bench in Vikas Kishanrao Gawali vs. State of Maharashtra (decided on December 15),” the bench noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-review-plea-in-supreme-court-for-obc-quota-in-local-body-elections-101640070811313.html
21-12-2021||India||Kiren Rijiju gives presentation on need for electoral reforms bill at BJP meet||Union law minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday gave a presentation on the need for the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) parliamentary party meeting a day after the Lok Sabha approved the proposed legislation amid Opposition protests.The bill, which proposes to allow Election Commission officials to seek Aadhaar details of registered voters on a voluntary basis and make the language of the Representation of the People Act gender-neutral, is scheduled to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.“He (Rijiju) explained in detail the current problems and how this bill, once passed, will address the issues. These reforms have been discussed for a long time,” said a BJP lawmaker, who attended the meeting.While there has been stiff resistance from opposition parties to the bill, the government has maintained reforms are necessary. The government has said the linking of Aadhaar with electoral rolls will solve one of the major problems in electoral database management--multiple enrolments of the same people at different places.Also Read: Aadhaar and Voter ID link: Joining the strands of the debateAn official said registrations in the electoral rolls are based on applications by people eligible to be registered as voters. “This bill has a provision whereby the new applicant may voluntarily provide an Aadhaar number along with the application for the purpose of identity. No application will be rejected on the grounds that the Aadhaar number has not been provided.”The official said multiple registrations in electoral rolls are due to the frequent shifting of residences by electors. “Once Aadhaar linkage is achieved, the electoral roll data system will instantly alert the existence of previous registration(s) whenever a person applies for new registration. This will help in cleaning the electoral roll to a great extent and facilitate voter registration in the location at which they are ordinarily resident,” the official said, requesting anonymity.At the parliamentary party meeting, BJP president JP Nadda separately asked MPs to plan events in their constituencies on Good Governance Day, which is celebrated on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary on December 25.“He also asked MPs to organise events to promote sports in their constituencies. We have been celebrating December 25 as Good Governance Day for the past few years. This time also we will plan some events,” said another MP, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kiren-rijiju-gives-presentation-on-need-for-electoral-reforms-bill-at-bjp-meet-101640068650595.html
21-12-2021||India||Kerala high court dismisses plea questioning PM's photo on Covid certificate||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea seeking removal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's photograph from COVID-19 vaccination certificates and imposed a cost of ₹1 lakh on the petitioner by terming the petition as "frivolous", being "politically motivated" and a "publicity interest litigation". Justice P V Kunhikrishnan directed the petitioner -- Peter Myaliparampil -- to deposit the cost in favour of the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KeLSA) within six weeks. The court said in case of failure to deposit the cost within the stipulated period, KeLSA shall recover the amount from his assets by initiating revenue recovery proceedings against him. It said the cost was being imposed to let people and the society know that frivolous plea like this which waste judicial time will not be entertained by the court. The court also said that the "frivolous contentions" by the petitioner objecting to the PM's photo and his "morale-boosting message" on the vaccination certificate, was "not expected from a citizen of the country".It also said that when there are thousands of criminal appeals, bail pleas, civil suits and matrimonial cases pending in the courts, frivolous petitions like the instant one waste judicial time. The court had previously observed what was wrong in Covid-19 vaccination certificates carrying the photograph of the Prime Minister when he was elected to power by the people of the country. The court had also remarked, "They may not be proud of their PMs, we are proud of our PM" and had asked the petitioner "why are you ashamed of the Prime Minister? He came to power through the mandate of the people. we may have different political views, but he is still our PM." The petitioner had contended that the certificate was a private space with personal details on record and therefore, it was inappropriate to intrude into the privacy of an individual. He had contended that adding the Prime Minister's photo to the certificate was an intrusion into an individual's private space. The petitioner, a senior citizen, had contended in his plea that the Prime Minister's photo on his vaccination certificate was a violation of fundamental rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-dismisses-plea-questioning-pm-s-photo-on-covid-certificate-101640064587606.html

The bill is scheduled to be tabled in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.Congress lawmaker Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury called the bill an infringement upon the fundamental rights of privacy enunciated by the Supreme Court. “It will lead to mass disenfranchisement.” He said the use of Aadhaar authentication was solely permitted for welfare programmes and to link PAN cards.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi accused the Centre of curtailing the autonomy of the Election Commission. “The linking of IDs and Aadhaar violates the fundamental rights...Subjecting voter enrolment to Aadhaar violates the independent sanctity of the constitutional process.”Trinamool Congress lawmaker Saugata Roy cited the Supreme Court ruling and accused the Central government of interfering with the affairs of the Election Commission.Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor argued Aadhaar is only meant to be proof of residence. ‘It is not proof of citizenship. If you are...asking Aadhaar for voters, all you are getting is a document that reflects residence, not citizenship. You are potentially giving the vote to non-citizens.”Rijiju called the arguments against the bill unfound and added the Supreme Court’s judgment was being misinterpreted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-seek-scrutiny-of-electoral-reforms-bill-101640064930651.html

21-12-2021||India||Cold to severe cold wave conditions likely to continue till Wednesday||NEW DELHI: Cold to severe cold wave conditions are likely to continue till Wednesday in parts of northwestern India, while two consecutive western disturbances are likely to affect the western Himalayan region and bring scattered and light rain to the region over the next three days. The rain will help abate cold wave conditions, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.No significant change in minimum temperatures is likely in most parts of northwest, central, and east India over the next two days. Thereafter, there is likely to be a 3-5 degrees C rise in minimum temperatures across northwest India and a 2-4 degree C in central and east India.“The second western disturbance is an active one. It may cause scattered light rain over the plains. Due to the upcoming western disturbances, there is likely to be a respite from the ongoing cold wave from December 22 to 27. But due to associated clouding, day temperatures are likely to be below normal. So, it is too early to say how much respite we will have from the cold wave,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre.Also Read: Delhi to see shallow fog; Capital’s air quality in ‘very poor’ zoneLight to moderate isolated and scattered rainfall/snowfall was very likely in the Western Himalayan region from Wednesday to Saturday.IMD said light to moderate isolated and scattered rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning were expected in north-eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura from Tuesday to Friday.Ground frost has been reported from parts of the country, particularly east and west Rajasthan.

21-12-2021||India||First squadron of S-400 deployed in Punjab sector: Report||The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Monday first squadron of deployed Russia-made S-400 missile system in the Punjab sector, news agency ANI reported. This will give a boost to country's air defence capabilities."The first squadron is being deployed in the Punjab sector. The batteries of the first squadron would be capable of taking care of aerial threats from both Pakistan and China," ANI quoted government a official as saying on condition of anonymity.Earlier this month, foreign secretary Harsh V Shringla had announced that Russia has started deliveries of the surface-to-air long-range missile system. Shringla’s statement came soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India.During Putin’s day-long visit, Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov praised the S-400 air defence missile systems deal between his country and India, saying the United States tried to strong-arm India into opting out of the pact but New Delhi went through anyway.The US, which is also India’s main defence partner, had expressed its disapproval towards the S-400 missile deal but India contended that the negotiations began years before Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) was enacted, Hindustan Times reported earlier.A purchase agreement was signed in 2015 and a deal worth $4.5 billion was finalised in 2018. The US tried to stop it with counter offers of its rival Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAD) and Patriot systems. It was an offer that came too late.The US uses CAATSA to bring sanctions against nations that have economic and defence ties to Russia, North Korea and Iran. It used the law to earlier sanction trade partner China and Nato ally Turkey for purchasing the S-400 missile systems.The US had said in November that it is yet to determine whether it will waive those sanctions with respect to the deal between India and Russia.The S-400 air defence system was contracted for by India in a deal worth around ₹35,000 crore and five squadrons would be provided to India for tacking air threats from up to 400 km.The S-400 missile defence system is equipped with four different missiles which can engage enemy aircraft, ballistic missiles, and AWACS planes at 400 km, 250 km, the medium-range 120 km and the short-range 40 km.IAF officers and personnel have trained in Russia on the system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-squadron-of-s-400-deployed-in-punjab-sector-report-101640055551309.html

21-12-2021||India||Private bus operators in Kerala to go on indefinite strike from today||Private bus operators in Kerala will go on an indefinite strike from Tuesday over the delay by the state government to announce a hike in ticket prices.Addressing a press conference earlier this month, Lawrence Babu, the chairman of the Kerala State Private Bus Operators Federation (KSPBOF), said that the state government has been ignoring a discussion with the private bus operators on the issue for over a month.The demands of the bus operators, which have not yet been met, include a rise in the price of student tickets, diesel subsidy from the state government in wake of high prices of diesel, and a relaxation in road tax among others.Previously, the bus operators called off their strike on November 9 against low ticket prices, after they held a meeting with Kerala transport minister Antony Raju, according to a report by Livemint.Raju requested them to withdraw the strike by saying that their demands will be considered by the government. Issuing a statement, the bus operators association in the Kottayam city said Antony Raju assured them that their demands will be considered and further meetings will take place before November 18.However, no such discussions have been held till now.According to a report by Onmanorama, the private bus operators pointed out that the indefinite strike from Tuesday has been called as they are not in a position to continue their services because of the exorbitant costs of fuel and maintenance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-bus-operators-in-kerala-to-go-on-indefinite-strike-from-today-101640049329500.html

He had expressed concern over the attendance of lawmakers in Parliament and cautioned that unless they transform themselves, there could be changes.A party functionary, who attended the meeting, told Hindustan Times that the Prime Minister stressed that since it’s the people who elected MPs to represent them in Parliament, lawmakers should make it a priority to dutifully attend Parliament sessions.This was not the first time that PM Modi pulled up his party colleagues for not attending proceedings in Parliament, with similar concerns being aired during the monsoon and budget sessions.This was the first meeting to be held outside Parliament’s precincts due to ongoing work at the complex.The BJP-led government has been dealing with opposition protest in Parliament over the suspension of 12 lawmakers from the Rajya Sabha for their behaviour in the monsoon session of Parliament.Opposition members have been adamant that the chairperson should revisit the decision to suspend the MPs. They have also refused to apologise for disruptions in the monsoon session, a precondition set by the government for revoking the suspension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-hold-parliamentary-party-meeting-today-101640050358692.html

21-12-2021||India||AFSPA to continue in Assam, to be withdrawn if peace lasts : CM Himanta Sarma||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday said the state will continue to be under Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 and a decision on withdrawing it will be taken only if the present peace prevails for a longer term. He expressed apprehension that the militant groups might not reciprocate the same way if the AFSPA is withdrawn from Assam. Sarma, however, said that no state government wants to continue with AFSPA if the law and order situation is peaceful and conducive. "The Assam government is of the view that if this kind of peaceful situation continues at a later date we will be able to take a call on whether we need AFSPA in entire Assam or we need it only in some parts," Sarma told reporters here. He cited the example of Arunachal Pradesh, which decided to withdraw the Act in consultation with the central home ministry from many parts of the state, except in three districts. "AFSPA or not cannot be a call of the government. It has to depend on the overall situation, law and order situation of the state. Now suppose I withdraw, will that be reciprocated by the militant organisations? "If they do not withdraw and we do, the Army will not be able to carry out any operation meaning thereby you are inviting chaos. So I think AFSPA withdrawal is linked to the peace and stability of the state," Sarma said. Stating that no state government will want to continue with AFSPA if the law and order situation is peaceful and conducive, he said "I am only saying this in the context of our state and not Nagaland because I have no jurisdiction to do so. On Nagaland I do not have any assessment. I do not want to comment on the situation that exists in that state," he added. Nagaland Assembly on Monday unanimously adopted a resolution demanding that the Centre repeal AFSPA from the North East and specially from the state "so as to strengthen the ongoing efforts to find a peaceful political settlement to the Naga political issue". Thirteen civilians were gunned down by security foces at Oting village of Mon district on December 4 in a botched anti-insurgency operation leading to cries by civil groups and rights activists for repeal of the "draconian law". The chief ministers of Nagaland and Meghalaya had also sought the revocation of the Act. The Assam government had extended the existing "Disturbed Area" status of the state for another six months with effect from August 28, thereby continuing AFSPA in the state. The Act was imposed in Assam in November 1990 and has been extended every six months since then after a review by the state government. AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations anywhere and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives a certain level of immunity to the security forces in case of an operation going wrong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afspa-to-continue-in-assam-to-be-withdrawn-if-peace-lasts-cm-himanta-sarma-101640047994044.html
21-12-2021||India||Winter Session: JPC likely to table report Personal Data Protection Bill today||The Joint Committee of Parliament (JPC), which was examining the Personal Data Protection Bill, is expected to table its report on the floor of the House on Tuesday, according to news agency PTI.The Personal Data Protection Bill was brought in Parliament in 2019 and sought to provide for the protection of personal data of individuals and also establish a Data Protection Authority for the same. The bill also seeks to regulate the use of the data of individuals by the government and private companies.The bill was referred to the JPC for a careful examination, after opposition leaders opposed its certain provisions, including giving unbridled powers to the government and its agencies for use of personal data.On December 16, the JPC tabled the report on the Personal Data Protection Bill in both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. Hindustan Times earlier said that the report carried numerous suggestions including giving the government a wider berth on obligations and private companies a stricter guardrail to follow.However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Lok Sabha MP P P Chaudhary moved a motion on the same day seeking extension up to the last week of Parliament's winter session for the JCP to submit its report. The winter session will end on Thursday.And in November, the JPC adopted the report on the bill, which gave the government the powers to provide exemptions to its probe agencies from the provisions of the Act.

Let an intimation to that effect be sent to the concerned prison immediately,” said the bench, also comprising Justices S R Bhat and Bela M Trivedi.The apex court directed the state to place before it by March 1, 2022 the report of probation officer relating to the convict and also the report of jail administration about the nature of work done by him while in prison. The bench, which observed that psychological evaluation report of the convict be obtained, asked the director of an Indore-based hospital to constitute a team for his psychiatric evaluation.It said the report be placed before it by March 1. The top court said that jail authorities shall co-operate with the team of experts for facilitating access and due evaluation of the convict.“List for final disposal on March 22, 2022 before the appropriate court after seeking requisite directions from the CJI (Chief Justice of India),” the bench said in its December 15 order.The high court, in its verdict delivered in September this year, had affirmed the death sentence awarded by the trial court in August 2018 to two convicts in the case.In June 2018, the grandmother of the girl had lodged a report at a police station in Mandsaur that her granddaughter was missing from her school premises after the classes were over for the day. The police registered the case and on the next date, the girl was found in an injured condition and was taken to a hospital.The girl was provided treatment and she narrated the incident to the police about she was taken to a secluded spot and was raped. The trial court, after considering the evidence, awarded death penalty to the two convicts.“The facts of the present case reveal an ominous plot hatched by the appellants seeking to satiate their lust by breaching the confidence of the minor prosecutrix girl and then heaping miseries upon her by committing such forceful aggravated penetrative sexual assault which is most ruthless in nature,” the high court had said in its verdict while confirming the death sentence||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-capital-punishment-for-man-convicted-of-raping-mp-girl-101640026889946.html

This is a blatant violation. We can understand if common people or those not in power or those in the opposition do this. But should those in power do this,” the judge asked the state government.The judge also said that there were attempts by some people to tie him with a particular party or term him as a “sanghi” and added that neither he nor the high court can be cowed down by such attempts.The court was hearing a matter related to encroachment of public land.In another matter, where a cooperative society has alleged that a particular political party was illegally putting up flags and banners on its land, the court was told by the state government that action was being taken by some District Collectors (DCs) against illegal flag poles in the state and others will also do so.The state sought more time to place on record the action taken by all the DCs.The court, subsequently, listed the matter for hearing in January next year and directed all DCs to act as per its orders in its “true spirit” and without looking at the background or affiliation of the perpetrators or entity.“What is illegal should be treated as such,” the court said.The court had previously directed all DCs in the state to take action under the Land Conservancy Act against the illegal flag masts.On November 15, the court had given 10 days’ time for people to remove the illegal flag poles. On November 25, it directed the government to invoke provisions of Land Conservancy Act against all flag masts numbering 42,337 in the State.The court had said that if any new flag masts are erected illegally and not removed by the competent authorities, the latter would have to face the consequences mandated under the law.On November 1, the court passed an interim order directing that no illegal flag poles or masts be put up while the issue was being examined by it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-is-above-law-not-even-those-in-power-kerala-hc-101640026769849.html
