UPPCB officials said within NCR, steps are being taken to control local sources of pollution, such as vehicular pollution, road dust and pollution arising from construction-related activities. In the past six days alone, penalty to the tune of ₹37 lakh have been imposed on 72 individuals and establishments for violation of pollution norms. Most of these are for construction and road dust, while some are also for operation of diesel generator (DG) sets.“Since construction activities has been banned for now, most large projects are complying with the norms and have stopped work. However, there are still small plot owners who are continuing construction activities in the city. We have flying squads and teams in the field who are checking for such cases daily,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.He added there are instances of contractors of the Noida authority who are found not taking measures to control dust at their construction sites--- either by not keeping the construction material covered or not ensuring that the construction and demolition waste is disposed properly. “In some cases, we have penalised the contractors while in others, we have made the contractor pick up the waste from roadside and get it disposed at the designated site. We have also asked the Noida authority to carry out mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling along with the use of mist guns. We have asked the authority to sprinkle water regularly in some places where manual sweeping is done,” added Kumar.Additionally, the traffic police and the RTO have been asked to deploy more personnel in traffic prone areas to ensure vehicular movement does not stop and the traffic congestion does not aggravate the pollution levels in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-penalties-worth-70-lakh-imposed-since-grap-came-into-effect-on-oct-15-101638555413515.html

Their daughters were found in the house, and while the younger died, the elder daughter survived.Police has recovered a suicide note in which, the husband and wife have claimed that they themselves were committing suicide and no one else should be held responsible for the deaths. Police has sent the bodies for a post-mortem examination. The reason behind this extreme step is yet to be made clear and the police is working on the status of the man’s business to ascertain if their financial position could be a reason.“Yogesh Mishra had his office in Vanshi Vihar locality within the Sikandra police station limits of Agra city. He was engaged in the business of batteries and had an office on the first floor while the ground floor was lying vacant. An employee at the office reached on Friday morning and found both, Yogesh Mishra and his wife Pratichi Mishra lying dead” SSP, Agra, Sudhir Kumar Singh, said after inspecting the spot. “The body of Yogesh Mishra was found hanging while the body of his wife was lying on the ground. A forensic team and dog squad was called up and possible evidence was collected and the bodies were sent for a post-mortem examination, the SSP said. “On enquiry, it was found that both daughters of the couple were found lying in their house in Jagdishpura area. The younger daughter had died but the elder was unconscious but alive and was shifted to hospital for treatment,” Singh said. “A suicide note has been found from the office of Mishra and signed by both husband and wife. The couple took the responsibility of their own for suicide and have urged not to blame anyone for their deaths,” the SSP said. The incident has shocked the city and the police is now relying on the post-mortem examination report and clues to be obtained from the daughter under treatment.It appears that Yogesh Mishra had planned the deaths and might have given some poisonous substance to all three, including his wife and two daughters and then hanged himself in office. However, the elder daughter survived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-family-of-four-attempts-suicide-elder-daughter-survives-101638555354401.html

According to BMC officials, all these samples have been sent for genome sequencing.On Friday, two passengers and three contacts tested positive, however, one of them was not a resident of Mumbai. Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s health department on Friday, said, “We can confirm that 14 cases have been reported in Mumbai, of which 10 are passengers and four are contacts of these 10 passengers.”According to BMC officials, the first lot of 350 samples that were sent for genomic sequencing to detect the Omicron variant is expected to be out by Sunday or Monday. The BMC has sent around 350 samples from different categories including international passengers or contacts of passengers from high-risk countries.Further, according to BMC officials, owing to the outbreak of the Omicron variant, this year it will even appeal to citizens to take darshan online on the 65th death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar. However, those who have taken both doses of vaccine can go and take darshan physically. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednkar has appealed that citizens should cooperate with the BMC officials.The BMC in a statement on Friday said that they have ordered the closure of the Global Vipassana Pagoda at Gorai between December 5 and 7 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pagoda is a meditation centre and a monument built as a tribute to Lord Gautama Buddha. Hundreds of followers of Dr BR Ambedkar, who visit his memorial at Dadar on his death anniversary on December 6, also visit the pagoda. Civic officials believe the decision was taken owing to the prevailing situation of Covid-19 that has a threat from the omicron variant. The pagoda was shut in December 2020 also due to similar reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/14-samples-of-positive-patients-sent-for-genome-sequencing-bmc-101638555233175.html

03-12-2021||Lucknow||Like TMC did in WB, SP will ‘finish’ BJP in UP: Akhilesh||Hitting out at the UP government, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the way Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee “finished” Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in West Bengal, his party would do the same with the BJP in the upcoming assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. Speaking to reporters at a press conference before taking out his ongoing Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra in Jhansi on the last day of his three-day tour of Bundelkhand region, he said, “I welcome Mamata Banerjee. The way she finished BJP in Bengal, the SP will finish the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.”When a reporter asked him if West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will ride his rath, Akhilesh said: “When time comes, we will see”. Earlier, Samajwadi Party leaders privy to the matter had said that Banerjee may ride SP chief’s rath to drum up support for him as the next chief minister of the state. According to the party’s plan, three women leaders—Mamata Banerjee, Samajwadi Party MP and film personality Jaya Bachchan and former Kannauj MP and Akhilesh’s wife Dimple Yadav—will join Akhilesh’s Vijay Rath Yatra together.As for the Congress, Akhilesh said he did not know the party’s role in UP politics but added that the people would reject it. “It is possible that the party (Congress) may get zero seats,” he said. Akhilesh also said the Bahujan Samaj Party chief had a problem with the SP carrying the ideologies of Dr BR Ambedkar and Ram Manohar Lohia together.“The party (BJP) had secured all the seats in 2017 but this time the people would make it settle for zero seats. The people will close the doors of Bundelkhand on the BJP (in the 2022 UP polls) . The double engine (referring to the BJP governments in UP and at Centre) did nothing for the (Bundelkhand) region. Instead, it closed all the projects the previous government had started,” he said.Claiming that there a wave for a change in Uttar Pradesh, the SP leader alleged, “This government has done injustice using police to an extent that can’t be imagined. It discriminated against people on the basis of caste and religion.”In a reference to the recent inauguration of the Arjun Sahayak irrigation project by the Prime minister Narendra Modi in Mahoba, he claimed that it was inaugurated by his uncle in the past. “They changed the name and inaugurated it. This is what this government has been doing for last four-years-and-a-half,” he said and added if voted to power, the Samajwadi Party would ensure proper mechanism for water supply.Taking a dig at the BJP, he said, “Many grand events were held in Lucknow to bring investments and setting up of industries. Where are they ? The people would no longer accept the false promises. The issues such as inflation, unemployment and low income of farmers would seal the fate of the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/like-tmc-did-in-wb-sp-will-finish-bjp-in-up-akhilesh-101638554573638.html
03-12-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: In Other Times||Call it childhood’s innocence or arrogance — but we never thought it odd that throughout our growing years in Juhu, Sunday mornings were spent in a stately, book-lined lodge, singing ancient and new age hymns under the benign gaze of long-departed European spiritualists and occultists and one very alive and present Parsi heiress and cultural provocateur — Jer Jussawalla. Bright-eyed in our crisply- ironed whites, it was here, we’d congregate, to quickly slip on our coloured satin collars, as members of the international order of the round table, an outreach of the worldwide Theosophy movement, founded by the Russian dowager Helena Blavatsky, in the late 19th century. It was electric blue for the ‘pages’, parrot green for the ‘companions’, a deep purple for the ‘squires’ and finally, the order’s ultimate achievement –a jaunty pink, to signify the attainment of ‘knighthood’.As the first few notes of a furiously —pedalled organ rose —we had to form a queue in the lodge’s verandah, overlooking the small shed that housed my kindergarten school, and when the hymn had gathered momentum, the senior-most amongst us, had to knock three times on the door. “Who Stands Without?” a voice from inside would grandly demand. And on being satisfied with our response, the door would open and our little crocodile, led by a junior page, crushed under the weight of an enormous ceremonial sword and shield, followed by a ‘thurifer’ (whose job was to gracefully swing their ‘thurible’ so that the air was filled with the fragrance of heady loban) would make its entry.Inside, there’d be chairs arranged in a semi-circle around the empty ‘throne’ bedecked in red, representing the universal power of God, in whose direction there’d be salutations and obeisance and some pretty robust singing. And the ceremony would end with Jer’s fervent prayer, delivered with eyes closed, arms akimbo:‘O Hidden Life, vibrant in every atom;O Hidden Light, shining in every creature;O Hidden Love, embracing all in Oneness;May all who feel as one with Thee,Know they are therefore one with each other.’ She was born in 1918 to Gulistan Shroff and Jehangir Jussawalla, the latter, a wealthy businessman with interests across the world, who died relatively young, leaving the young Jer, her mother and aunt well provided for, with substantial properties in Juhu. It was not unusual for wealthy Parsis to acquire sea-facing bungalows there in those days (not a stone’s throw away stood the Tata weekend bungalow, where a young Ratan Tata would often visit,) and it was here that Jer, her mum and aunts settled in a fairytale, a sea-facing mansion called Besant Villa, named after the British human rights activist and social reformer —Annie Besant — in the sleepy verdant Theosophical Colony, predicated on and dedicated to the tenets of the relatively new religion, which drew equally from older European philosophies along with Hinduism and Buddhism.It could be argued that the widely travelled and freethinking Jer, the only child of wealthy parents (who was said to have been presented with an expensive automobile on her 14th birthday) and who was an exponent of the classical western and Indian arts such as Kathak, was an early feminist and bohemian; after all, she practiced yoga, swam daily in the Arabian sea, romped around the beach in shorts, meditated, expounded peace and universal brotherhood, never married and spent her money just as she pleased.That Theosophy, founded and championed by high-minded, freethinking refined European women, would appeal to the Jussawalla ladies, with their Iranian ancestry was a foregone conclusion, certainly, all that piano playing, old lace and incense appeared to be a natural fit, for both Jer and her mother and soon Besant Villa became the centrifugal force in its growth and dissemination in the sleepy suburb. This was just as well because it could have been just as likely that the ladies could have fallen under the thrall of that other great movement, founded by another European philosopher —Karl Marx— whose ideas had enchanted their immediate neighbours including Balraj Sahni and my late parents, whose cottages lay right next door in the same colony. ***If all this gives the impression that our childhood was an esoteric precocious phenomenon crammed with solemn rites and rituals, it would be half the truth. Because as much exposure as Jer afforded us to spirituality, through our Sunday round table meetings, she made sure that there was even more emphasis given to fun and games, outings and escapades. Most of these were centred around her capacious convertible jalopy, chauffeured by her trusty old driver, who would ferry at least a dozen or so high-spirited youth, standing on the back seat of the top-down car, singing at the top of their voices, to newer and ever invigorating adventures across the city. Chances are if you came across a vociferous bunch of young people singing robustly in the back seat of a vintage jalopy in the sixties and seventies, it was us - Mumbai’s answer to the Von Trapps, down to the last guitar chord.There were trips to old people’s homes to perform small tasks and services, weekends at the Muktananada ashram or field trips to hear Swami Chinmayanada speak, along with frequent picnics, bonfires and camping expeditions. And when we were not haring around the city, we were engrossed in putting up plays like Light of Asia and The Merchant of Venice at Besant Villa and at least once a year during our school vacations, Jer would cart us all off to a hill station, where amidst trekking and picnicking, we would be afforded a scholar’s insight into the works of Bach or Oscar Wilde.What is extraordinary and speaks of the times we lived in, is that as if all this exposure to the arts, culture and religions of the world were not enough, Jer undertook all the travel arrangements, responsibility and safety of over two dozen or more high spirited young people, with minimum fuss or expense, to the enduring gratitude of our parents who busy as they were making ends meet and fulfilling their creative pursuits never questioned her largesse or her motives.As for us children and its beneficiaries, it is with a measure of shame that I say that we accepted it all without giving it much thought as one of the neighbourhood’s rites of passage.It is only now when I look back that I marvel at how much it enriched and enhanced our lives and what an act of generosity it was. ***There are no monuments to Jer, who died after a long illness in 1989, nor any statues or tributes in her name. In fact, few people outside the circle of those whose lives she impacted, so memorably have even heard of her. When we- former members of the now-defunct Juhu Round Table meet as senior citizens we tend to speak of Jer and those magical days in awe and wonder. Did they really happen?For years I put off writing about Jer as I could not even lay my hands on a photograph of her. None of her relatives could produce one and I was told that most of her documents had been washed away in the high tide during Mumbai’s floods of 2005. Last year, Besant villa, which had once reverberated with the sound of music and dance and laughter was sold to a wealthy individual who will undoubtedly turn it into a swanky condominium, another Shangri-La of luxury on Mumbai’s skyline, leaving no trace of its legacy. Then, just as I was getting resigned to the thought that I’d have to consign my memories of Jer and the round table as yet another jewel in my private memory box, as these things often happen, my efforts finally paid off -and last week two hazy, black and white pictures arrived in my inbox.Not in the most perfect of condition, but there she was, with her familiar fine-boned features and eyes dancing with life and warmth. And I knew the time had come to share the extraordinary story of Jer Jussawalla and the immeasurable contribution she’d made to the lives of a whole swathe of us growing up in Mumbai, in a time so different from these days, when freethinking, intellectual curiosity and cultural vibrancy were encouraged and celebrated rather than silenced and victimised.Of course, it hadn’t been a dream. Such people and times had existed. After all, I have the photographs...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-in-other-times-101638554395944.html

The state also found one Covid-19 positive case out of 224 passengers who arrived from other countries. The state health department now has samples of 30 Covid-19 positive patients from high-risk countries, of which 28 samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune and Kasturba Hospital, Mumbai, for genomic sequencing to ascertain if the new variant has made its entry into the state or not. The results will come by early next week.“In an epidemic, we have to isolate, test, trace contacts, and the administration is following the protocol,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that the reports are expected to come by December 7.“Even as Maharashtra health department is on a high alert after two cases of Omicron variant were reported from its neighbouring state Karnataka, there is no plan to introduce any fresh restrictions in the state or at the entry points from Karnataka,” said Tope. The minister also said that the new strain of Covid-19 has mild symptoms. Tope said that he spoke to union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan over the situation in Karnataka. “So far, there are only two cases in Karnataka. At this point, it is not required to set up check posts and other things for two patients. As the situation develops, we will take decisions accordingly.” he added.The minister also said that the countries that have Covid-19 cases of Omicron variant have gone from 11 to 30 in two days. However, he said that people should not panic as the variant is believed to have mild symptoms, though it is highly transmissible. “There are few cases where patients had to be put under intensive care or on oxygen support. The fatality is negligible. The variant has 30 mutations, therefore, we need to take more precautions. I appeal to people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour, to get fully vaccinated, and wear a double mask,” the minister stated. Till Friday morning, 2,821 passengers arriving from high-risk countries at Mumbai airport were tested. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers, who have arrived since November 1 is underway.

UP minister Anil Rajbhar was also present on the occasion.Listing out the measures taken to help “divyangs”, the CM said, “The state government has increased the pension of ‘Divyangjan’. The budget of the department has also been increased. In collaboration with the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, programmes for distribution of artificial limbs to differently-able people were organised in every district.”He further said the state government was giving financial assistance of ₹20,000 each to persons with disabilities for the construction of shop, ₹10,000 each if they started working as street vendors and ₹10,000 for surgeries. “For the marriage of ‘Divyangjan’, if the couple are disabled, the state government gives ₹35,000 as incentives. Divyang people may travel for free in UP government buses,” Yogi said.Congratulating the heads of the associations always engaged for the betterment of persons with disabilities, the chief minister exhorted the ‘divyang’ people saying they can contribute to country’s development in multiple ways. ‘Divyang’ children who excelled in board exam were felicitated at the function. Besides, tricycles were also distributed to ‘divyang’ people.Shagun Singh, the incharge of artificial limb workshop in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at King George’s Medical University, was among those feted at the function.

03-12-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cabinet approves e-auction for mining||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh cabinet has approved a proposal to carry out mining in 12 blocks of minerals in select districts of Bundelkhand, mainly Sonebhadra and Lalitpur, through e-auction. There are indications that the 12 mineral blocks have rock phosphate, andalusite, gold, gluconite (potash) and iron ore. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, along with other cabinet ministers, approved the proposal through circulation method. Five of these 12 blocks are of andalusite and one of the ore of a platinum group metal. An official press statement said this was for the first time that the state government proposed to hold e-auction for mining of minerals. The state cabinet decided to appoint SBI Capital Market Limited as the transaction advisor for management of mining blocks of minerals through e-auction and nominate MMTC Limited for two years to provide auction platform. It may be mentioned that the Geological Survey of India identified five blocks of minerals for mining in Sonebhadra and Lalitpur districts. The state mining and mineral department has also found four blocks. On September 6 this year, the union mining ministry provided a report about three blocks found by the Geological Survey of India. With this a total of 12 blocks of minerals were available in the state, it said, adding, the decision was likely to lead to increase in the state government’s revenue, boost fertilizer industry and result in creation of jobs for people. Free treatment to journalists The state cabinet has decided to provide the facility of free treatment at private as well as government hospitals to nearly 5,000 journalists (accredited at district and state level) and their families under the Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan in the state. An official press statement said the state cabinet authorised the chief minister to take any decision or make any amendment in the scheme in future. It may be mentioned that the accredited journalists are entitled to free treatment at government hospitals like the common man. It was felt that the nature of work of journalists involved risk and as there was no scheme for free treatment at private hospitals, keeping in view the urgency of treatment, a decision was taken to cover them under the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-cabinet-approves-e-auction-for-mining-101638552953198.html

The arrested youths are cousins and are being questioned by police teams.One of the accused was in contact with the woman and killed her as she was pressuring him for marriage, police said.According to police sources, the prime suspect Shashi Patel was in regular contact with the woman. The woman even reached his house to pressurise him for marriage and threatened to disclose their relationship to his kin. She even issued a threat to approach the police if he refuses to marry her. The suspect and his cousin killed the woman to get rid of her. However, police officials are collecting concrete evidence against the two suspects before disclosing the workout.As per the investigations till now, Shashi Patel is a resident of Phapahmau, while his cousin Rajneesh lives in the Soroan area. Shashi met the woman at a coaching institute, and the duo exchanged mobile numbers and was in contact through calls and chatting on the mobile phone. Later, Shashi went to Delhi for a job and had a scuffle with the woman as she wanted to marry him. Shashi belonged to a different caste and was reluctant to marry her and wanted to get rid of her. He contacted his cousin Rajneesh and planned to kill the woman.As per the plan, Shashi came to Prayagraj and left his mobile in Delhi on November 21. Here, he met his cousin Rajneesh at Shantipuram, where they arranged for an iron rod. The duo entered the woman’s house late in the night and killed her parents while in their sleep. They then killed the woman’s brother and then raped and murdered the woman in the last. The woman was raped by only one of the youths.Police said that Shashi used to call and chat through Whatsapp and asked the woman to delete the chat history. Shashi called her on November 18 for the last time and assured her that he would marry her. After that Shashi did not make any calls and left his mobile in Delhi to avoid suspicion. He also asked his cousin to leave his mobile at home. After committing the murders, Shashi went to Kanpur and returned to Delhi via bus, while Rajneesh threw the rod in a drain before returning home.After the arrest of Pawan Saroj, the duo was convinced that they were safe. However, they came under suspicion after the recovery of deleted Whatsapp chats on the woman’s mobile. Police first traced Shashi and then detained Rajneesh for questioning.SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said suspects have been detained for questioning after receiving vital clues against them. However, other scientific evidence like fingerprints, call records etc…, are being gathered. Investigations in this direction were still underway, he added.It is worth mentioning that a 50-year-old man, his 47-year-old wife, 25-year-old daughter and 10-year-old differently-abled son was found murdered at their house in the Phaphamau area. An autopsy report suggested that the woman was raped before being killed. On the complaint of victims’ kin, police lodged an FIR against 11 persons with whom the family was locked in a property dispute and arrested 10 of them. However, police later arrested a 23-year-old labourer Pawan Kumar Saroj and claimed that he killed the woman and her family with some of his aides as she repelled her advances. The woman’s kin have raised doubts on police claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-two-new-suspects-detained-in-connection-with-phaphamau-rape-murders-101638551332946.html

Kothari was speaking at the inaugural function of a two-day national conference on ‘flexible academic programme’ (FAP) at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIIT-A) on Friday.

03-12-2021||Lucknow||PM to dedicate fertiliser factory, AIIMS to east UP on December 7||GORAKHPUR Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally inaugurate two key projects – a fertiliser factory and the newly constructed AIIMS – in Gorakhpur and dedicate them to the eastern UP region on December 7, district officials said on Friday. The PM had laid the foundation stones of these projects during a rally in the run-up to 2017 assembly elections on July 22, 2016 from Manbela ground in Gorakhpur.Modi will also inaugurate nine laboratories at the Regional Medical Research Centre at the BRD medical college, said officials. “The people of Purvanchal are happy as the PM is coming to gift them two important projects,” said BJP spokeperson Satyendra Sinha. The visit of the PM, who inaugurated the Kushinagar airport on October 20, assumes significance as UP elections are due early next year. The east UP region, including Gorakhpur, Basti, Azamgarh and Varanasi divisions, accounts for 164 assembly seats, of which BJP managed to win 115 in the previous elections. The AIIMS is being dubbed as a flagship project to give a boost to the medical infrastructure of east UP while the fertilizer factory could bolster the BJP dispensation’s farmer outreach. The factory, which was once used to be the pride of the region and was shut down following an accident in the early nineties, would also boost the agriculture sector and generate jobs here. With a capacity of manufacturing 3,850 metric tonnes of neem coated urea, the factory has been set up afresh by Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Limited (HURL). Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, as five-time MP of Gorakhpur, had remained vocal in Parliament for the revival of the fertiliser factory in Gorakhpur and raised the demand to restore the past glory of east UP. After becoming CM, Adityanath ensured that the two key projects were completed expeditiously. Meanwhile, tight security arrangements were made and the city was decked up with lights in wake of the PM’s visit. Roads leading to the rally ground were dotted with posters and banners with Modi’s images and appeals of local leaders urging people to attend the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-to-dedicate-fertiliser-factory-aiims-to-east-up-on-december-7-101638547011950.html

We approached people using the data from the CoWIN app, ‘my family my responsibility’ survey and the door-to-door drive since last month,” a medical officer from NMMC said.NMMC has, till now, conducted 363 sessions of ‘har ghar dastak’ programme in which 10,369 people have received their first dose and 18,035 received their second dose. The Urban Health Post heads had sensed a reluctance in some of the population to get vaccinated due to which the only way to get maximum vaccinated with their second dose was by going to them instead of waiting for them, said one of the UHP heads.“At times, people keep delaying their second dose thinking that they will take it soon but it never happens. So, when Asha workers reach out to them informing them that they do not have to go till UHP and just have to come out at the nearest camp, they come out to get the vaccination. Megaphones are used to announce in the area about the vaccination happening,” head of Turbhe UHP, Kailas Gaikwad, said.When faced with reluctance, the UHP heads have even visited places of worship with doctors to convince the religious leader of the place on why the vaccination is important. “There is also a theory among some of the alcoholics that if they take vaccination, they cannot consume alcohol for a few days,” the UHP head said.Many of them are turning up for the second dose for the certificate to get access to trains and malls. Thus, camps are set up at railway stations wherein 5,390 have been vaccinated so far.Ghansoli station has many MIDC companies nearby and this station has been getting the maximum response at camps. The reason being many a time when the workers reach the station for a ticket, they don’t get one without the certificate and then take the vaccine for the same at these camps.Meanwhile, due to the good response at the railway stations, NMMC has also added vaccination centres at Koparkhairane and Airoli.Meanwhile from Friday, the corporation also started vaccination sessions at markets in CBD, Karave village, Sector 48 in Nerul, Nerul Phase 2, Pawne, Juhugaon in Vashi and Ghansoli. “Ambulances are stationed at the market places and on the first day itself, 650 people got vaccinated,” a medical officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-vaccinates-70-of-target-population-with-second-dose-against-covid-101638546354674.html
03-12-2021||Lucknow||Bundelkhand Expressway to be operational this month: UP CM||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday stated that the Bundelkhand Expressway would be made operational this month and assured 24-hour power supply to all villages and cities across UP. He made these announcements while speaking at the PM Gati Shakti National Master zonal (North) programme here. “With the help of PM Gati Shakti programme, we were able to complete the Purvanchal Expressway in record time,” said the CM. “The programme has been very helpful in infrastructure development. Even during the pandemic, no development work was stopped in Uttar Pradesh,” said Adityanath. The CM said that PM Modi launched Gati Shakti – National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity – to give a new impetus to infrastructure-related projects within the country. It is a digital platform to bring 16 ministries including railways and roadways together for integrated planning and coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects.“Gati (speed) and Shakti (power) symbolise each other. PM Gati Shakti is becoming a big medium for boosting infrastructure development. During the earlier governments, the schemes of development were run at the speed of a tortoise,” he said.The CM said the state government had integrated the projects of 16 departments and agencies in the first phase to strengthen the PM Gati Shakti platform. In the second phase, 11 departments and agencies were being identified for integration on Gati Shakti portal.After Independence till 2017, only one and a half expressways were built in the state, while in the last four and a half years, Purvanchal Expressway has not only been completed, but Ganga Expressway, Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, and Gorakhpur Link Expressway will soon be available for people, he emphasised.The CM launched a scathing attack on the previous governments for “neglecting development in the state” and said the Noida International Airport was now being built on the same land of Bhatta Parsaul, which had been in the news for a long time for violent clashes between the police and farmers during the agitation against land acquisition.“The foundation stone of Jewar airport, Asia’s largest, in Noida has been laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 25. The farmers of Bhatta Parsaul happily gave their land to the government after our government was formed, that too only on twice the compensation rather than four times,” said Adityanath.The CM also said that till 2017, there were only four airports in UP – Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra. The present government started flights from Prayagraj, Kanpur, Hindon, Bareilly, and Kushinagar airports and the state now has nine functional airports, he added. Pointing out that law and order played an important role in the development of any state, Adityanath said: “After 2017, our government improved law and order and also implemented proper system for investment in the state,” He said Uttar Pradesh was at 14th position in ease of doing business in 2015-17, but now it was on No. 2 spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bundelkhand-expressway-to-be-operational-this-month-up-cm-101638546291904.html
03-12-2021||Mumbai||Merely 48% fully vaccinated against Covid in Thane||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has administered 21.67 lakh vaccine doses till now. Among these, 72% have received their first dose and merely 48% are fully vaccinated.In November, the city witnessed only 30% increase in vaccination. Despite mass vaccination drives, door-to-door vaccination and special camps held across the city by TMC, the vaccination drive increased by 26% till mid-November but hardly a 4% increase has been noted in the last ten days.Among the 21.67 lakh who have been vaccinated, 14.80% are those above 60 years of age, 26% are in the 45-60 years age group and 59.47% are in the 18-44 years of age.TMC officials have noticed reluctance in the minds of people who have taken the first dose. “The slum population seems to be hesitant to get fully vaccinated. They feel that the first dose will be enough to protect them from the virus. We have been insisting on only getting the first dose till now assuming that those who get jabbed the first time will come forward to get fully vaccinated. But we realised that a follow up is required,” said Naresh Mhaske, Thane mayor.Overall, looking at the number of vaccinations in each age group, 55% to 60% have received the first jab while 35% to 40% have received the second jab.Thane city has a population of 18 lakh to be vaccinated with two doses each. Overall, around 36 lakh doses need to be administered. However, only 21.67 lakh have been administered till now.“There might be a set of population that are not yet due for the second jab. Moreover, there could be a few more that got jabbed in neighbouring cities of Mumbai or Navi Mumbai. We have a team that calls those who have only taken the first dose of the vaccine and are due to take the second. Almost 80% of the calls we have made so far have been fully vaccinated elsewhere – in a different city or through workplace vaccinations,” said Dr Prasad Patil, vaccination officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/merely-48-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-in-thane-101638545154211.html

Train mows him down||BHOPAL: A 60-year-old man, crying hysterically on a railway track right next to his son’s body, was run over by a train in Madhya Pradesh’s Hoshangabad district late on Thursday evening.The man had seen his son die by suicide on the railway tracks moments earlier and was in a state of shock, police said. “His two brothers tried to alert him (about the approaching train) but he didn’t hear... and the train hit him.,” said Gurukaran Singh, superintendent of police of Hoshangabad.His 36-year-old son, the younger of his two children, had stomped out of their house in Shohagpur town just a short while earlier after a heated argument in the family. “He (son) also threatened of ending his life. The father and his two brothers also went after him,” Singh said about the heart-wrenching incident.The son went to the railway tracks not far from the house. “He jumped before a moving train and died. The man saw the accident and started crying loudly on the track,” the district police chief said. Soon after, another train came. The man and his son used to run a furniture shop in Shohagpur town. His elder son, 38, lived in Hoshangabad town, 70km away.The two bodies have been handed over to the family after autopsy, said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/man-sat-on-rail-track-crying-hysterically-after-seeing-son-die-also-mowed-down-101638544791705.html

03-12-2021||Mumbai||Ahead of civic polls, Congress reaches out to Gujarati voters||Ahead of the civic polls, Congress is looking to regain its base in the Gujarati community and have decided to highlight the economic distress and livelihood disruptions that happened due to the Union government’s decisions.The Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) is focusing on the economic hardships faced by the businessmen and small traders, among whom Gujarati-speakers form substantial numbers. To counter the sway of political Hindutva, the Congress will focus on specific caste groups like Patidars and Gujarati Dalits and will deploy its leaders from Gujarat to spread its message in the run-up to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. Mumbai Congress organised an interactive session with the Gujarati community in Ghatkopar on Tuesday. The session was addressed by Hardik Patel, the face of the Patidar community’s protests in Gujarat seeking reservations. Patel is also the working president of the Gujarat state Congress. “The Covid crisis exposed the real face of Narendra Modi. He did little to help the small traders and the poor. The government works for the benefit of a chosen few among the industrialists. The smaller traders and entrepreneurs are facing massive hardships…with little support from the government,” charged Bhai Jagtap, president, MRCC. Jagtap said that Patel would help sway voters from the Patidar community, which has significant numbers in Mumbai. The Mumbai Congress also plans to deploy other leaders from the Gujarat unit like the leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Chavda, senior leader Shaktisinh Gohil, and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani. “The middle-class and small traders and entrepreneurs have been hurt hard by demonetisation…but since they are into business, they cannot take a critical position openly as they fear retributive action by the present regime using agencies like the Income Tax (I.T) and Enforcement Directorate (ED). These people are very angry and upset and want to get rid of this dispensation,” Patel told HT, adding that the Central government had failed to create jobs and employment opportunities. He charged that the BJP and the RSS were trying to deflect blame by using communally polarising and emotive issues. “In politics, the mood of the people is fickle. There was a time when the Gujaratis were with the Congress in Mumbai… regardless of their political affiliations, the Gujaratis hail from the land of the Sardar (Patel). After all, (Mahatma) Gandhi and Sardar built the Congress. The people respect Congress and we are trying to meet their expectations. We will work to meet these aspirations and ensure that the Congress grows among the Gujaratis in Mumbai,” said Patel, while predicting a “shocking result” in the BMC polls. Mehul Vora, who heads the Gujarati cell of the Mumbai Congress, said that the massive groundswell of support from the Gujaratis had helped the BJP notch up significant seats from Mumbai in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Vora added that Gujarati speakers formed around 30 lakh in the city’s population, with a significant presence across the city, eastern and western suburbs. Vora blamed the triple whammy of demonetisation, a blanket rollout of GST with multiple tax rates and the lockdown for distress in the community, and society at large. “This had led them shifting loyalties to the Congress,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ahead-of-civic-polls-congress-reaches-out-to-gujarati-voters-101638543111264.html

03-12-2021||Mumbai||Need for Covid vaccination in HIV positive people: Study||Only 55% of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) globally have taken the Covid-19 vaccine, a new study published by researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has revealed. The team assessed vaccination data of 6,952 PLHIVs from 12 countries, who were enrolled in another randomised trial, including 469 patients from India. Their finding revealed the rate of vaccination among PLHIVs in South Asia, including India, was around 49% and that the vaccination rates varied significantly by geography. The study found that the Covid vaccination rates among PLHIVs were lowest in South Africa (18%), Uganda (3%) and Haiti (0%), while countries like the United States, Peru, Brazil had higher vaccination rates at 72%, 69% and 63% respectively. The vaccination rate in the Southeast Asia region was 41% and Sub-Saharan Africa was 18%. HIV attacks the immune system. Its chronic and advanced stage is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Due to the suppressed immunity of the infected patients, they become vulnerable to catching other bacterial, viral and fungal infections and are therefore at a high risk of catching Covid-19 as well. “As this is the first report of vaccination rates among a large, international cohort of people living with HIV from diverse Global Burden of Disease regions, these findings inform the field on overall and region-specific vaccination rates,” said Steven Grinspoon, chief of the Metabolism Unit at MGH and senior author of the study in a press statement. “Given that the data highlight major inequities in rates across regions, public health officials should use these data to increase efforts to provide access to vaccines for people living with HIV, particularly in those groups vulnerable to Covid-19 morbidity and mortality.” The study was published Journal of Infectious Diseases. India has around 23.49 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS, according to a 2019 estimate report of the Government of India. But country-wise estimates of how many PLHIVs have taken the Covid vaccine are not available. In Maharashtra, there are nearly 2.5 lakh people who are currently on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and just 20% have taken the Covid-19 shots. According to the Maharashtra AIDS Control Society (MDACS) around 50,687 PLHIVs have taken the first dose and 30,402 are fully vaccinated in the state. “There has been a lot of hesitancy among the PLHIVs to take the Covid jab since the beginning of the drive,” said Manoj Pardeshi, board member of the National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India. “Some believed that they would get Covid through the vaccine, while some were paranoid about falling severely ill. We have conducted several webinars, initiated discussions on WhatsApp and have been encouraging them to take the jabs. Our efforts have worked in several pockets where the vaccination coverage improved drastically,” he said citing the example of Pune where the overall PLHIV vaccination coverage stands at 98.7%. He said that a small number of the PLHIVs who have been bedridden or confined to their homes have not been covered. “We are now reaching out to the government authorities to allow home vaccination for them and also allow booster shots for PLHIVs as their immunity with the two doses of the Covid vaccine may still not be very high,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-for-covid-vaccination-in-hiv-positive-people-study-101638538791037.html
03-12-2021||Mumbai||Malik questions NCB’s motive behind seeking transfer of top cases||Mumbai Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) slammed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday for asking the state government to hand over the top five cases under the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of Maharashtra police’s investigation to them. NCP chief spokesperson and state minorities minister Nawab Malik asked on what basis did NCB decide which cases they wanted to take over and whether the central agency wanted to encroach on the state’s rights.According to Malik, Satya Narayan Pradhan, director-general, NCB, wrote a letter to Sanjay Pandey, director general of police (DG), Maharashtra on November 24 asking for the hand cases. “This was being under the directives of union home minister Amit Shah says the letter,” Malik said. He also tweeted a purported copy of the letter which said, “It is stated that states may, where found appropriate and expedient, consider handing over such cases (having inter-state and international ramifications) to NCB to undertake the task of trying to unearth the entire network. In this connection, DDsG (Region) and zonal directors of NCB (as per jurisdiction) will be calling on/ contacting you and follow-up with your office.”NCB deputy director general Mutha Ashok Jain did not respond to calls and messages when asked about the letter issued by NCB.“The union home minister expressed his desire that every state should identify a few such cases with inter-state and international ramifications and carry investigation to logical conclusions, especially in terms of identifying and unearthing the entire network,” the letter further states.“NCB wants the top five cases to be handed over to them. We want to know the criteria if top cases will be two grams, five grams, three tonnes (of drugs) or it will be based upon the mass publicity. Following the rights being provided to them, the state government’s with the help of their own units are taking action against the drug cartels. ANC has taken more actions compared to what NCB did. If you have your own unit, why do you want cases to be transferred? Do you want to end the state’s autonomy or extort money is a question,” Malik said questioning the motive behind the move.He also sought action in the 26 alleged bogus cases in which innocent people were framed and said, “It has become clear that the zonal unit is involved in extortion activities by forming a private army, in that situation the central government will have to answer as to why they want the transfer.”“Motive and intention of the #NCB upon reading this letter appears questionable? Why are they trying to infringe upon the rights of the state government when there is no provision in the NDPS act to do so? Is there an ulterior motive? NCB must answer the citizens of India,” Malik tweeted.

03-12-2021||Mumbai||Sino-Pakistani military ties, cooperation, a cause of concern: Vice Admiral Ajendra Bahadur Singh||Strong military ties between China and Pakistan is a cause of concern for the Indian Navy, said the flag officer commanding-in-chief of Western Naval Command, vice admiral, Ajendra Bahadur Singh. “Cooperation between them will remain a cause of concern,” said the vice admiral when asked about the Chinese military sales to Pakistan. Singh interacted with the media on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Indian Navy’s attack on Karachi harbour by Indian missile boats on December 4, during the 1971 war, celebrated as the Navy Day each year.In the first week of November, China handed over its Type 54A/P frigate rechristened as Pakistan Naval Ship (PNS) Tughril, claiming it will ensure a balance of power in the Indian Ocean.“China has been supplying a new generation of guided-missile destroyers to the Pakistan Navy. Pakistan had a very small navy, but recently there is a marked shift, as they have started acquiring new ships to enhance their naval capabilities,” Singh said commenting on the development. “China is also supplying them (Pakistan) submarines, but we are closely observing all the developments,” he added.The Pakistan Navy has also given contracts for the construction of eight Hangor-class submarines and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China.Recently, the Indian Navy also commissioned two submarines — INS Karanj and INS Vela and a destroyer, INS Visakhapatnam, having high indigenous content. Singh also spoke about the refit of the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya that is being done at Karwar, providing “immense economic benefits to the local industry.” The Indian Navy operates in a wide spectrum of operations, ranging from high-intensity warfare to providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Initially, the Western Naval Command’s focus was towards maintaining maritime security and stability through near-continuous surveillance and the presence of warships and submarines across its entire Area of Operations.It had undertaken massive Humanitarian and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations during Cyclone Tauktae in May, which turned out to be the largest search and rescue operation in the high seas, which saw the rescue of 188 persons. On the military front, it has planned Exercise Paschim Lehar on the west coast early in 2022, which will also witness participation from the Indian Army, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Coast Guard (ICG).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sinopakistani-military-ties-cooperation-a-cause-of-concern-vice-admiral-ajendra-bahadur-singh-101638537590852.html

This will save the hassle of getting individual permissions by the applicants and accelerate development in the region.Five out of the six blanket NOCs for Sector 1 (Vadghar), Sector 24 (Vahal 1), Sector 25 (Vahal 2), Sector 25A (Vahal 3), Pushpak Nagar have been extended till January to March 2024. Efforts are being made to extend the validity of remaining NOCs for the R-1 to R-5 (Vadghar 1) area.CIDCO VC-MD, Sanjay Mukherjee, said, “CIDCO had obtained a blanket NOC from AAI regarding permissible heights for the building in the rehabilitation area in the year 2015. The validity of the said NOC had lapsed in 2020. Therefore, the applicants seeking development permissions and occupancy certificates had to approach AAI individually for getting these NOCs. To resolve the issue, CIDCO management pursued the matter with AAI and has succeeded in getting extension in validity of these blanket NOCs.” He expressed that this decision would accelerate the development of the airport rehabilitation and resettlement area.After the extension was granted, in October-November 2021, CIDCO granted seven development permissions and issued 34 Occupancy Certificates in rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) pockets.The Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPRs) are applicable for CIDCO area. CIDCO had requested to permit row housing and semi-detached type development in the plots having area up to 450sqm in R&R pockets, which was considered by the state. Thereby, the plots allotted to PAPs in R&R pockets having area up to 450sqm can be developed in semi-detached and row house type pattern with permissible FSI of 1.5, within height of 13m (excluding the height of stilt floors for parking).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cidco-obtains-blanket-noc-from-airport-authority-of-india-for-permissible-heights-of-buildings-in-navi-mumbai-airport-rehabilitation-area-101638536634593.html
03-12-2021||Mumbai||Duration of traffic signals tweaked in Thane to ease congestion||In order to ease traffic congestion on arterial roads and busy junctions in the city, the Thane Traffic Police have started tweaking the duration of traffic signals during various time slots throughout the day.According to Traffic Police officials, the initiative was kicked off 15 days ago, and traffic patterns across Thane are still being studied so that the necessary changes can be made.Traffic police officials said that the idea was born from the observation that fixed traffic signal duration were the cause behind traffic jams at numerous junctions. Traffic signal durations are set to change automatically through the day with the duration ranging from 30 seconds to two-and-a-half minutes. The signals are operated by the Thane Municipal Corporation, and the duration is pre-programmed by civic officials.“In many cases, we observed traffic jams so long that by the time motorists at the end of the jam reached near the signal, it had already turned red again. This would cause them to stop at the same signal twice as well as cause another jam behind them due to the backlog from the previous signal. We even found some extreme cases where motorists had to stop thrice at the same signal in this manner,” DCP (Traffic), Balasaheb Patil, said.Accordingly, the Traffic Police started studying patterns during different time slots, like 8am to 11am, 11am to 4pm, 4pm to 6pm and 6pm to 8pm. The patterns were also divided on the basis of the lanes like Mumbai-bound lanes, Ghodbunder-bound lanes, etc. Police found that traffic patterns for each of these time slots as well as lanes were significantly different from each other.“For example, the Mumbai-bound lanes at Teen Haath Naka in Thane, both on the flyover as well as under it, witness the heaviest traffic from 8am to 11am and are relatively free in the evening. The situation is reversed from 6pm to 11pm. Accordingly, shortening the duration of the traffic signals during high-density hours on the relevant lanes worked wonders with traffic jams decreasing significantly,” Patil said.After noticing success during the initial phase of the experiment, the Traffic Police decided to implement the initiative throughout Thane City, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/duration-of-traffic-signals-tweaked-in-thane-to-ease-congestion-101638535972289.html

Adsul was summoned thrice by ED but he failed to show up for one reason or the other.The 74-year-old politician’s residential and office premises were raided by ED officials in September this year in connection with a money laundering case registered against him linked to the alleged bank fraud.His initial petition to cancel the ED case against him was rejected by a two-judge bench of the high court on October 14. In this petition, Adsul argued that the case smacked of political vendetta and selective approach by ED at the behest of Navneet Kaur Rana, an independent MP from Amravati after the high court cancelled and confiscated her caste certificate in June on his complaint.Adsul’s request for an arrest shield was rejected by a Mumbai special court last month, holding that the prima facie material against him was found to be substantial and satisfactory.The ED case was initiated after Adsul, a former chairman of the City Co-operative Bank, filed a complaint with the economic offences wing of the Mumbai Police alleging irregularities in loans granted by bank officials without securing adequate collateral in case of default.ED started investigating the former MP after the agency allegedly found that Anandrao Adsul was also a beneficiary of some of the loans extended by him without adequate collateral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-needs-to-grill-sena-leader-anandrao-adsul-says-hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-101638534530749.html
03-12-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Back to school considerations, beyond majority wins||The manner of democracy seems to be slowly evolving in Indian society, at least in Maharashtra and at least in the matter of education. Most of my life I have been passively suffering the “Majority wins!” notion of democracy. That’s how we used to select what game to play, what movie to watch, who gets to become team leader, and so on. Last month there was a flurry of activity in households with school-going children. A flurry initiated by a government decision. The decision was to reopen schools for physical attendance, giving some conclusion to the ongoing debate of education in post-pandemic era. (A decision which might soon change thanks to Omicron, but that itself is a sign of how governance itself is evolving into an alert and responsive institution). The government has been doing its job - and well at that. Its job is governance through law-making, policy, guidelines and so on. In the matter of education and schools, it has been consistently taking a policy and guidelines approach, which means it is taking decisions that have to be taken at the government level. A policy and guidelines approach provides a framework which defines boundaries, specifying what must be done, what should not be done, and creating space for industry, organisations and society at large to take more particular decisions in relation to their own responsibilities, without stepping on any rights that should not be stepped on. To be clear: government is aware that its decisions affect all schools in the country/state. (Am using the term government to include central and state governments instead of separating them since in my observation both are governing well and in alignment). So, schools can reopen for physical classes if they want to. It is not a law that they should. But if they do, they have to provide parents with the option of protecting their children as per their own assessment of risks by withholding or providing consent for physical school. Further, physical classes have to be conducted with appropriate protocols to ensure that the school is taking responsibility of keeping the environment safe. There are significant differences between government, government-aided and private schools. Significant differences. One of the key ambiguities of media reporting of education is that these differences are rarely reported or explained. Government policies and mandates affect each school type differently. Government and aided schools have responsibility of disseminating education to economically-challenged sections of society and as such, policies and guidelines become decisions for the schools since parents and children cannot afford to exercise preferences. The same policies and guidelines may become options for private schools where parents and students can afford to exercise preferences after weighing pros and cons against resources. International schools are higher up the ladder in private education, which also means that parents in such schools have greater say - but have often influenced school decisions on the basis of majority wins when governance has not been strong as in previous decades. Majority wins is a political concept requiring lobbying, consensus building, without any real check or balance of what is right or wrong or appropriate for all constituents. But that is not the case at the moment. A parent can choose what’s right for their children without having to take the child out of school even if a majority of others choose differently for their own reasons. Factors that affect children having to go back to physical school are many in debate and at least some of those factors have nothing to do with quality of education but to do with lifestyle and convenience. Two of the most used reasons in public policy debate is quality of in-person education and children getting left out of the mainstream due to online education. These can be valid reasons for government and aided schools, but lazy arguments when it comes to children in private and international schools, but I will leave that for another day. Our children go to Bharati Vidyapeeth’s Rabindranath Tagore School. Our family take on mode of schooling is unanimous: online. The children love online because quality of instruction is high, they get flexibility to manage their play and other activities and projects, the engagement and focus of teachers on child’s needs is excellent and they are at no additional risk of infection. We took the decision as a family after looking at the cyclical pattern of virus variants across the globe, cyclical pattern of lockdowns and restrictions, quality of life data on the aftermath of those who have been infected among our family and friends, and considering the quality of online education with respect to what our kids want to do as careers. We were able to take this call because the government provided the space for individual decisions and because the school delivered quality continuously and respects individual decisions. The education industry has been hit hard (like many others) and those employed in education have had (and still are having) a tough time. What requires attention - irrespective of the school type - is the plight of teachers. Teachers have been at the forefront of schools adapting to online teaching, then to blended teaching methods (online and offline). They have had to pick up a tremendous volume of technology skills while doing their regular work and also have had their administrative workload go up significantly. Many lost their democratic voice while they struggled to upskill and keep their jobs, some lost income, some others lost jobs, but all lost sleep and endured high levels of stress. Private schools have had as hard a time as other schools. They may not have the moral responsibility of disseminating education, but they do have responsibility of providing higher quality education to students who will hopefully improve many things for the country in the future. And they have been doing that and have also stood with parents in difficult times and maintained fee structures or cut back during the past year and half. Quality of education in a school comes from principals, teachers and other staff. It is important that schools are able to protect and enhance the employment of their staff. With governance and institutions doing their bit, I hope to have the courage and sense of responsibility to do my bit as a parent and to stand with schools and pay fees on time, and also keep in mind that reasonable hike requests from schools should not be contested on matters of physical or online school. Schools may pitch on the basis of infrastructure and facilities, but one doesn’t pay for real estate but for education. Above all else, principals and teachers are also regular people like us. They watch out for our children. We have to watch out for them. In a democracy, the eventual ideal is that everybody wins-not just the majority or the minority or interest groups.

Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital, said that the official order for suspension was issued on Thursday and an order for a departmental inquiry was also issued after a video clip showing the burnt victims not being attended properly became viral on social media.“Suspension order was issued after a thorough investigation of the video-clip, that became viral on the Internet. The doctors and the nurse suspended were seen in that video,” Bharmal said.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in charge of public health in the BMC said that a committee has been formed to probe the incident and action will be taken against the ones found guilty.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the BMC has blamed the ruling Shiv Sena for not taking prompt action against this incident. Earlier on Thursday, 11 BJP corporators resigned from the civic health committee. On Friday, the proceedings of the civic standing committee was adjourned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/4montholds-death-in-bdd-chawl-blaze-2-doctors-a-nurse-suspended-for-negligence-101638533810461.html
03-12-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body installs traffic signals with Marathi countdown timer||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has recently installed a few new traffic signals at the APMC market in Vashi, where the numbers displayed on the countdown timers appear in Marathi. This is the first time that motorists in Navi Mumbai have come across such traffic signals that display the countdown numbers in a regional language and not in English. The NMMC official said that they are doing this on a trial basis to understand the feasibility of the new system. A senior officer from the electrical department said, “We installed the new signals just a few days ago and will see the kind of response we receive from motorists. If a large number of motorists complain about it, we may even remove them. We also don’t have any plan to install more such traffic signals at other parts of the city.” A section of residents has welcomed the move; while some others have criticized the civic body for it. GB More, 52, a resident of Vashi said, “Marathi is the state language of Maharashtra and we don’t see anything wrong in using it in a few traffic signals. Because of such initiatives, people who do not know the language will also learn it.” Dolly Sharma, 28, a resident of Sanpada said, “NMMC is promoting Navi Mumbai as a city of international standard. Apart from people from across the country, a huge number of foreign nationals are also staying and working here. Those people will not understand the Marathi numbers and hence will face trouble. Personally, I found this move a little conservative.” The city traffic department said that the civic body neither informed them nor took their opinion before installing the new signals. Purushottam Karad, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, “As far as the new initiative is concerned, we really don’t have any idea about the motive of the civic officials. As these signals were installed just a few days ago, it will be too early to talk about their feasibility.”

Pincha said the SIT has started the probe. “I have met the relatives of the deceased person and watched a video of the wedding. It does not look like murder...however everything will be clear after the probe. SIT will probe... This does not look the case of beating for having dinner...”Banshidhar Arya, a local Dalit leader, said they have been camping in the man’s village after the incident and want justice for his family. “Police must start a probe soon so that justice can be ensured and punishment is given to the accused.

03-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No exam fee for SSC, HSC students who lost their parents to Covid-19||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government on Thursday announced that it was waiving off this year's exam fees for those Class 10 and Class 12 state board students who had lost their parents to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection during the pandemic. Calling the gesture a “small solace” on part of the government to the children who had to suffer heartbreak during this difficult phase, state government officials confirmed that the fee to be waived is for the board exams are set to be conducted in 2022.“A small solace from our side to the children who lost their parents to the pandemic,” Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad was quoted by the PTI news agency as saying. “The fee for state board exams 2021-22 is being waived off.” “We are aware that they have gone through a lot already, but their education must continue,” she added.The exam fees for Class 10 students appearing for the secondary school certificate (SSC) exam, and for Class 12 students appearing for the higher secondary certificate (HSC) exam varies from ₹300 to ₹500.The Maharashtra government has asked schools to submit the names of those students who lost their parents to the pandemic, so the administration can initiate appropriate proceedings to waive off their board exam fees. Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) had last month decided to refund only 20.85% of the nearly ₹104 crore collected as exam fees from approximately 2.9 million SSC and HSC students for the academic year 2020-21.The Bombay high court had on July 29 this year directed the state government to consider refunding exam fees after board exams were cancelled on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. SSC students paid ₹315 each as exam fee, of which the board agreed to refund ₹59, or 18.73 per cent of the original fees. Similarly, HSC students paid ₹415 each, but the board planned to return ₹94, or 22.65 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-no-exam-fee-for-ssc-hsc-students-who-lost-their-parents-to-covid19-101638528306424.html

03-12-2021||Delhi||Katrina Kaif jaise ladki chahiye: Matrimonial agents list demands of Delhi-NCR residents||What used to be the usual criteria to look for a prospective bride and groom? Educational qualification is one and salary/income was another. But that doesn’t seem to be enough today if the matrimonial advertisements are to be believed. Recently, one such matrimonial ad that went viral saw a groom-to-be demanding his prospective wife to have a specific bra size, waist size and even foot size! The ad, for sure, received a lot of backlash. But it seems that the list of absurd demands doesn’t end here, with weirder specifications adding up. “Tip top lagni chahiye ladki. My family is looking for a girl for me right now,” says Shubham Singla, civil engineer based in Punjabi Bagh, adding, “Many might give me dirty looks, but I have no qualms in saying that I want a bride who is beautiful and fair, to match my complexion and personality. And I also need someone who has a good sense of style so that we look good together.”This is just one instance. Matrimonial agents in the city list out many such specifications that people enlist, which go way beyond physical appearances. ‘No one is looking for gori girls anymore’Contrary to what is believed, Vidya, a matrimonial agent from south Delhi based Elite marriage bureau says there is very less demand for brides who have fair complexion; as opposed to the common belief. “People of late want a sober, simple and intelligent girl who is adjusting in nature. No one is looking for gori girls anymore because they feel fair girls are high maintenance. Instead, they want someone who can and will take care of their family,” she says.Starry demands!“Apna ladka chahe jaisa bhi ho, sabko bahu chahiye Katrina Kaif jaise! Those who register with us brief us saying we want so and so actor type ladki, when we ask them about their expectations,” says Mithun Kumar from VIP matrimonial services in Ashok Vihar, adding, “Jitne zyada paise wali family aati hai humare paas, utni hi popular actress type ladki chahiye hoti hai unko.”Shaadi ka budget pegle, ladke ki income baad mein“Sundar ladki toh almost sabhi ko chahiye hi hoti hai. But other than that, a lot of people are now very specific about the wedding budget. Family mein paise hone chahiye, apne status ke according shaadi ka arrangement chahiye, ye sab batein toh hum humesha se dekhte aa rahe hain. Par ab, pehle shaadi ka budget batate hain, aur phir ladka ya ladki ka salary package,” shares Nancy Naagar from north Delhi-based The Perfect Jodi. Kumar adds, “Those looking for prospective brides want the wedding to be a grand affair. So it’s not like they want only the girl’s side to foot the bill. They are more than happy to share the expenses of the wedding. But, they fix an amount, say for example 20 crore, and then say that they’ll spend half the amount and expect the girl’s side to spend the other half. Many families registering the names of their sons with us want ki unke shaadi wale budget ke according family dhundein hum.”Size of family mattersSpecifications about bride or groom’s looks are just one part of the long list of demands put forth by families looking for prospective daughter or son in law. Another aspect to this is to ensure their beloved child lives a smooth, unperturbed married life, too. “Almost all the girls and boys today want to stay away from their families. Toh jahan bhi joint family mein rehna hota hai ladka ya ladki ko, us ghar ke bachchon ke liye match fix karna gets very demanding for us. With time it’s becoming a very common specification from parents. Ab woh ye nahi sochte ki baad me bachchon ke bachche honge tab dada-dadi ya nana-nani hi yaad ayenge,” adds Naagar.‘Matchmaking hai ya showroom?’Matchmakers rue that even if a family likes another family and also the boy and girl seem compatible with each other, they often seem unsatisfied till we don’t show them more options. “Agar ladke ko ladki pasandh bhi aa jaye phir bhi family bolegi ki koi aur bhi dikhaye pehle. Unko lagta hai ki shayad koi better mil jaye. Ye matching hai ya showroom me kapde khareed rahe hain? And they keep insisting to see too many options together, which I feel mostly confuses everyone,” says says Mithun Kumar from VIP matrimonial services.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/katrina-kaif-jaise-ladki-chahiye-matrimonial-agents-list-demands-of-delhi-ncr-residents-101638528349768.html

The development in Rajasthan came to light a day after two men in Karnataka tested positive on Thursday for the Omicron variant of Covid-19 that was first detected in South Africa.Chief medical and health officer (Jaipur), Narottam Sharma, said a 71-year-old person was found positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. He said when they conducted contact tracing, they found four of his relatives had arrived from South Africa on November 25. Sharma said samples of 14 members of the family, including the four returnees, were taken. He added that these four, including two children aged seven and 12, were later also found positive for Covid-19.Also Read: Will Omicron variant cause third wave in India? How to prevent it? FAQs answeredSharma said the four live in South Africa and arrived in Jaipur with a Covid-19 negative report via Dubai. The family was tested in Dubai on November 22 and 23. The two adults among the four are fully vaccinated. Sharma said the four attended a wedding and came in contact with relatives from Sikar. Sharma said the district health officer in Sikar has been informed about this.“As per the guidelines, the positive patients have been admitted to the Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, which is dedicated for Covid-19. Re-sampling of the patients has been done and contact tracing is on. The samples for genome sequencing have been sent; the report is awaited.”The World Health Organisation declared Omicron a variant of concern last Friday. It suggested that preliminary evidence found an increased risk of reinfections as compared to other variants of concern. The new variant is heavily mutated with up to 30 mutations in the spike protein.India has added 11 regions, including all of Europe, to the list of the “at risk” countries from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on arrival in the country, including post-arrival testing for infection.State health minister Parsadi Lal Meena has separately ordered random sampling in crowded places such as markets, bus stands, railway stations, tourist places, and schools to control the Covid-19 spread. He added over 28,000 samples were being taken daily. Meena said this will be increased to 100,000.Rajasthan now has 213 active cases, compared to zero on November 1. Jaipur accounts for the bulk of them -114.

Also read: Traffic through Rohtang tunnel restricted after snowfallSalooni deputy superintendent of police Mayank Chaudhary said nearly 30 police personnel of Doda district of neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir raided the village, 80km from the district headquarters, in the wee hours in search of a girl who had eloped with her lover. They were carrying weapons and were accompanied by civilians. Their entry was also registered at the border police post at nearby Langera. “They had informed the station house officer (SHO) of Kihar police station about the operation but started the search without waiting for the local police,” said Chaudhary. The DSP said when the residents objected, the Jammu and Kashmir Police clashed with them and fired teargas shells at the villagers. “As the situation worsened, local residents informed the Himachal Pradesh Police after which a team from the Kihar police station was rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control,” he said. Some villagers were injured in the melee and were taken to the Kihar community health centre for treatment. Chaudhary said the villagers also alleged that the raiding cops were drunk and hence their medical examination was done. They are at Kihar police station at present. “The Jammu policemen said they used tear-gas shells in self-defence after the villagers attacked them. We have spoken to senior officials of Doda police. A report is being prepared that will be submitted to the Chamba superintendent of police after which further course of action will be decided,” Chaudhary said. Jaladi is a hamlet on the border of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The area is surrounded by dense forest and sensitive due to militant activities in the neighbouring UT.

Eight Omicron suspects were admitted to LNJP hospital yesterday. "Four suspects have been admitted today, out of which, two have been tested Covid-19 positive while the test results for the other two are awaited," the report said. Of these four suspects, two have come from the UK, one from France and one from the Netherlands, sources added.Samples of all four patients will be sent for genome sequencing on Friday, it said.Omicron: 9 international travellers in Mumbai test Covid positive; 1 from South AfricaOn Wednesday, six patients were referred to the hospital straight from the airport, medical director Suresh Kumar had said. Out of those six, four tested positive and two had symptoms, reports said.The health ministry on Friday said the severity of Omicron cases could be low because of the fast-paced vaccination in India and the population's high exposure to the Delta variant. "Given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to Delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low," the ministry said in a statement.All states are on alert after the Centre on Thursday said two Omicron cases have been confirmed in Karnataka, including a 66-year-old South African National, who travelled back to South Africa via Dubai and a 46-year-old doctor with no travel history.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/12-omicron-suspects-admitted-to-delhi-hospital-genome-sequencing-report-awaited-101638519939733.html

03-12-2021||Mumbai||28 samples from Maharashtra sent for genomic sequencing||Maharashtra government tested 861 international passengers until December 2, with three of them testing positive, according to data released by the state health department. Twenty-eight samples have been sent for genome sequencing, including the three found positive on Thursday. Their reports are awaited, officials said. Meanwhile, the state recorded 796 fresh Covid-19 infections pushing the cumulative cases to 6,637,221 on Thursday. The tally of active cases further reduced to 7,209 as 952 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. It also saw 24 casualties on Thursday and the number of fatalities stood at 141,049. Raigad reported the highest toll with twelve deaths. A health department release said, “Until today (Thursday) morning, 861 international passengers have been tested with RT-PCR and 3 of them have been found positive. Samples of all three patients have been sent for genomic sequencing. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers who arrived since November 1 is underway. A total of 28 samples from both airport and field surveillance have been sent for genomic sequencing. Out of these, 12 are sent to NIV, Pune and 16 to Kasturba Hospital laboratory (in Mumbai). Of the 28, 25 are international travellers and three are their close contacts.” The state has managed to diminish the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic even after lifting most of the curbs as no spike was recorded in the state after the festive season that lasted almost two months. But the situation has changed since the outbreak of the Omicron variant which is being called a super mutant owing to its transmissibility. On Thursday, the state health department said that there is not enough clarity on its severity, and more information is expected to be released in the next two weeks. It has also urged the people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and inform the state health authorities if they have international travel history from the last month and are not fully vaccinated. “On November 26, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the Covid-19 virus variant detected in South Africa and some other countries Omicron. It has also classified the Omicron variant as a ‘Variant of Concern’. Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics. While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause a severe disease and whether it will evade the immunity. More information is expected in the next two weeks or so,” stated the release. “Genetic changes or mutation in viruses is a natural phenomenon and people should not panic. The state health department appeals to the citizens that they should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, inform the state health department authorities if they have had an international travel history in the last month and those who have not taken Covid-19 vaccine or have had only one dose should complete their vaccination at the earliest,” it added. With 220 cases, Mumbai again reported the highest number of cases in the entire state and its tally reached a total of 763,206 cases till date. It also recorded one fatality taking the toll to 16,341. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 108,329 samples and had a positivity rate of 0.73%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 10.1%, according to the data issued by the state health department. The state also administered 938,930 vaccine doses on Thursday and has administered a total of 116,209,817 doses till date, according to the data available on the CoWin portal. 
03-12-2021||Bhopal||Bhopal gas leak: 37 years on, children not then born scarred forever||They were not born at the time but hundreds of children live the horrors of that intervening night of December 2-3, 1984, every minute of every day -- their bodies trapped forever in congenital disabilities such as blindness and cerebral palsy.Thirty-seven years and some three generations later, the darkness of that night when 40 tonnes of lethal methyl isocyanate leaked out of the Union Carbide plant hangs like an impenetrable cloud over the lives of untold thousands, including children as young as three whose parents were exposed to the toxin when they themselves were children.What did help was therapy and special education lessons. That has been impacted with the Covid pandemic and the months of lockdown that followed. As the world marks another anniversary, those that were left behind count their losses.The official number of deaths from what has come to be known as the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, among the world’s worst industrial disasters ever, was 2,259 but activists estimate the number could be well over 20,000, maybe double that.The effects were devastating for those who survived, and for the generations that followed. Adding to the long-term effects of those who inhaled the gas was the slow poisoning of the groundwater. Those exposed passed the effects on, leading to many children born with disabilities, including Down's syndrome, muscular dystrophy and attention-deficit disorders.Alfez is 11, Umair 13, Isha 19, Mohsin 25… Just some of the many who live their lives confined to their beds and inside their homes, helpless and totally dependent for their everyday needs. While studies continue and much is still to be known, the chain from that night 37 years ago is clear, said experts. And it is going on still.Azaan is only four years old. He has cerebral palsy, a debilitating, genetic condition that probably goes back to his grandparents who were exposed to MIC.“I was eight months pregnant when the gas tragedy happened. My daughter was born with nasal related complications though not severe,” said his grandmother.Azaan’s seizures have increased in the last six months, probably because he didn’t get regular therapy due to the lockdown. Help has come in the form of therapists from the Chingari Trust, a rehab centre, doing weekly home visits and video calls.Eleven-year-old Alfez, who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), leads a lonely life with few people to understand him. His mother Tarannum recalls taking him to a doctor when he wasn’t even a year old and being asked whether anyone in the family was affected in the gas tragedy.It finally turned out that his father Sajid, who was then just a year-and-a-half, had inhaled the gas. Decades down the line, when he had a child, the impact was passed on. And the doctor told Tarannum, “Alfez’s medical condition is congenital.”“The lockdown interrupted Alfez’s regular therapy (which includes speech, occupational and special education at Chingari Rehab Centre). His behaviour has changed. With regular therapy, Alfez had started to speak a bit. That has stopped and now he can’t even tell us when he needs to go the toilet and soils himself.”The behavioural problems of 13-year-old Umair Ahmed, who was born with Down’s Syndrome, have also exacerbated. Much loved by his family, he has started hitting out when someone comes too close because no therapy sessions have been happening. And his attention span has decreased,Umair’s father was just four in December 1984 when he was exposed to the poisonous gas. There could be other reasons for Umair’s medical conditions and research on genotoxic and long-term effects of MIC gas are still going on.The cases are many. Hidden in the bylanes of Bhopal, each story of despair lined with the silver of a loving family which looks after their children with care and empathy.Like 19-year-old Isha Ansari, who has spastic cerebral palsy, and doesn’t have use of her hands but like any other teenager loves listening to music, watching videos and playing on her mobile – operating it all with her toes.In her case, her mother Jainab was exposed to MIC. And both parents drank the contaminated groundwater for years.Amaan, 13, whose parents were exposed to the gas, also has cerebral palsy. He can’t eat himself but loves good clothes and good food, and even tries to do some writing.The lockdown has been tough.According to his family, Amaan was doing better with regular therapy but his condition has deteriorated now. He is not able to squat as he was earlier. He had also started articulating his words but has regressed to communicating through signals.Sixteen-year-old Zoya Khan, who has an intellectual disability with a wrist drop, holds her grandmother tight when she sleeps. “She looks for me,” the fond ‘dadi’, Asha Bi, said. A few months ago, Asha Bi lost her husband. The entire family – Asha Bi, her husband and her son – were affected by the gas leak.While Zoya’s father died a few years ago, the mother doesn’t keep well.Then there is the ever smiling Nida Khan, a 13-year-old who has Down’s Syndrome with alopecia, partial or complete lack of hair. Her mother Shabana Bi was seven when she inhaled the gas.Nida loves playing with her cousin, good clothes – shorts and dresses but not salwar kurta -- and her favourite film is “Chennai Express”.The progress made over the years has been hindered by no therapy. She is struggling with her speech. Four months ago, her father passed away. Though she hasn’t been told about it, she senses his absence and sometimes looks out of the window to say, ‘Abbu hain wahan’ (father is standing there)”.Not far away, Ayushi’s mother Jyoti kissed her on her forehead and said, “My daughter needs only two things; continuous love and regular therapy.” One is ever present for the child who has cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, the other not so much because of the pandemic.Before the lockdown, Ayushi, also 13, had learnt to sit better, started signalling when she was hungry or when she needed to go to the toilet, said Jyoti, who was five when she breathed in MIC.Her brother’s child also has medical complications like Ayushi. There could be other reasons for Ayushi’s and her cousin’s medical conditions but there are researches on genotoxic and long-term effects of MIC gas.Mohsin is older, 25 and confined to his bed. He would earlier talk and walk but fell 13 years ago and his cerebral palsy worsened.“Mohsin understands almost everything. He knows when guests come home. He recognizes us and he plays with me and his siblings. He smiles at us when he is happy”, his mother, who was three in 1984, said.And so it goes on – lives whose destinies were written that cold winter night when poison spread through the air and the water.When will it end? Experts are still looking for answers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bhopal-gas-leak-37-years-on-children-not-then-born-scarred-forever-101638498459473.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGIMER yet to apply for genome sequencing authorisation||Amid concerns of transmission of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, is unable to conduct whole genome sequencing of positive samples as it is yet to apply to the central government for authorisation.The PGIMER authorities said it will take at least another three months before the institute can officially start the process. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out the complete genetics of the virus and helps identify its variant, which aids timely surveillance and regulatory measures.Earlier, in July and August, the PGIMER’s department of virology had conducted a pilot project, in which medical experts conducted genome sequencing of some samples. The same samples were sent to other national institutes, and the PGIMER’s results were found matching with their results.“We are in the process of applying for the authorisation. It will be done within a month, and the Centre’s authorisation will take another couple of months,” said Dr Mini P Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 testing at the PGIMER.Dr Singh said that the PGIMER has an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved lab providing round-the-clock diagnostic services for 1,500 to 2,000 samples since the onset of the pandemic. “Further, we have been a centre of excellence and established more than 75 Covid-19 labs across North India as the mentor lab,” she said.At present, the PGIMER is sending its samples for genome sequencing to the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi. Since all states send their samples to the lab, test reports get delayed by over a month. The emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529), a new variant of concern of Covid-19, has attracted worldwide attention. It is believed to have originated in South Africa in an immune-compromised patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgimer-yet-to-apply-for-genome-sequencing-authorisation-101638481843170.html

The complaint was lodged by Gurwinder Singh, an agriculturist hailing from a village in Ajnala, Amritsar. In his complaint to the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh, Kuldeep Singh Chahal, Gurwinder alleged that Palwinder Singh, alias Happy hailing from Amritsar, Ravi Gupta and Chhatterpal Singh duped him of ₹16 lakh on the pretext of sending his wife abroad but neither they sent his wife abroad nor returned the money. Gurwinder said Chhatterpal had introduced him to Palwinder and Ravi as they were running an immigration consultancy, Future Framez, in Sector 34. He said the accused had demanded ₹16 lakh to send his wife Paramjit Kaur on a study visa to England. He was told the entire amount is to be paid in cash. Gurwinder had paid them the money after raising it by taking loans from friends and relatives and against his land on October 15, 2020. After taking money the accused stopped picking his phone and even closed the Chandigarh office. The police arrested Palwinder, who was produced in a court on Thursday that sent him to three-day police custody. The accused had cheating cases registered in Punjab and the police are getting details of the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/immigration-fraud-consultant-held-for-duping-amritsar-resident-of-16-lakh-in-chandigarh-101638481608893.html

No loss of life was reported but the fire spread panic among the residents of the area. Also, due to the congested road, the fire tender faced a lot of difficulties in reaching the spot, the residents said. Two fire tenders were pressed into service which took 25 minutes to douse the fire. The residents also alleged that they heard a minor blast from the tower during the fire. Umesh Gulyani, president of the Nayagaon market committee, said, “We have been pressing for the stationing of a fire tender here in Nayagaon but no action has been taken so far. Secondly, the streets are congested due to heavy traffic which hampers the movement of the fire tender. We demand that a sub-fire station must be established here.” The incident occurred at a mobile tower situated atop a shop after the generator set of the tower caught fire. The flames engulfed the entire tower within seconds and the residents ran out of their houses and shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-tragedy-averted-after-mobile-tower-catches-fire-in-nayagaon-101638481606595.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Chhota Rajan gang member among 5 arrested for robbing mother-son duo||A member of the Chhota Rajan gang from Mumbai is among five arrested for robbing senior citizen mother-son duo after drugging them in Sector 36, Chandigarh. The accused have been identified as Dilip Upadhyay, 36, from Mumbai; Lokendra Ranbhadur Swar, 41, from Bengaluru; Vishnu Bhagat Sodari, 28, from Maharashtra; Depender Bahadur Tadi, alias Basant Chettri, 22, and Milan Sonu, 20, both hailing from Nepal. Milan Sonu and Deepinder Bahadur worked as domestic help in a Sector-36 house and had on October 22 stolen cash and jewellery after sedating their employers — Sarvajit Kaur, 89, and her NRI son Surinder Pal Singh, 69. The police in a press statement said Upadhyay was a member of the Chhota Rajan gang and had three criminal cases registered against him in Maharashtra. The police said the accused were a member of a 12-member gang operating from Mumbai. Talking about their modus operandi, the police said the gang leader contacted Nepali youths, who are employed as servants or cooks, through social media and collected the data of their employers and their wealth. Thereafter, they lured servants or cooks by promising them money and their safe passage to Nepal. They also gave them intoxicants to serve their employers so that they could easily commit a theft when their employers are unconscious. The police said on October 15, the gang members reached Chandigarh from Mumbai, Nepal and Delhi and stayed at different hotels. Thereafter, they called up Milan Sonu and met at a park in Sector 35, Chandigarh, and hatched a conspiracy. As per the plan, Milan served food laced with intoxicants to his owners and committed the theft with the cooperation of the co-accused. After committing the theft, they fled to Maharashtra, Nepal and Delhi in separate groups. The police have recovered the cheque books of the complainants, Aadhar cards, ₹8,000 and jewellery from the accused. A case was registered on October 23 under Sections 328 and 381 of the IPC at the Sector 36 police station, Chandigarh, in this regard. The police said the gang had committed similar thefts of approximately ₹1 crore in November in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-chhota-rajan-gang-member-among-5-arrested-for-robbing-mother-son-duo-101638481605604.html

Warring, who was in Kharar to lay the foundation stone of the modern bus stand, claimed that Majithia would break the news of joining the BJP anytime. While reacting to AAP “theatrics”, he claimed that the entire opposition was rattled. Taking a potshot at Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, he said leaders like him were constrained to orchestrate inspection of a toilet at a school. Urging people to give the Congress power to keep serving Punjab in 2022, Warring said the entire world was talking about Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s work in two months. Almost 400 buses, including 70 of Badals, had been impounded, Warring said, adding that anyone flouting norms would not be spared at any cost.Lays stone of ₹6.5-cr bus standGiving a major fillip to the infrastructure in the region, Warring laid the foundation stone of the modern bus stand to be built here at a cost of ₹6.57 crore. The upcoming hi-tech bus stand will be equipped with all modern amenities. It will be developed on a 16 kanal land of the panchayat samiti in the heart of the city. “The chief minister had shared with me that he had once travelled to Kharar by bus to join an agitation and at that time buses did not stop at Kharar. He had then decided to ensure that the city gets a proper bus stand,” he said.Warring assured shopkeepers that nobody’s business would be impacted and they would be suitably accommodated in the upcoming complex. Dr Manohar Singh, younger brother of the chief minister, said the construction of the bus stand in Kharar had been the dream project of the chief minister.  He mentioned that the chief minister had recently laid the foundation stone of a state-of-the-art modern model school to be set up in an area of 5 acres at Badali village, an English medium school where around 5,000 students would be imparted quality education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-won-t-be-a-surprise-if-bikram-majithia-joins-bjp-says-amrinder-singh-raja-warring-101638481543063.html

In the letter, the GMADA chief said a notification under Section 11 of the land acquisition act, calling objections from landowners, was issued in February and October 2019 for different blocks of Aerotropolis and the revenue department was informed about the same. But despite this, the registrar of Mohali and sub-registrar of Zirakpur continued with land registration till August 2020, violating the act, wrote Ujwal, adding that strict action must be taken against the officials concerned.In September this year, GMADA had started issuing LoIs for 1,600 acres of land acquired for the township. It planned to complete the process within a couple of months and begin land development in November.However, now, it has been stated that around 500 landowners will not be issued LoIs as they got their land registered after the preliminary notification for land acquisition had been issued. So far, GMADA has issued LoIs for only 600 acres of the acquired land. The process is still pending for the remaining 1,000 acres. Gurminder Singh Bakarpur, one of the landowners, said, “What is our fault? They should take action against the revenue officers and allow us the letters of intent. We will move the Punjab and Haryana high court in this regard.”GMADA had started the process of land acquisition for Aerotropolis, its seventh independent township, in May 2017. In all, 1,600 acres of land were to be acquired on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road.

03-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The show must go on||The day’s previous screening didn’t take place. Nobody turned up, the gent sitting on the chair outside the theatre’s lobby explains.Raj is one of the only two surviving single-screen cinema halls in Gurugram, and perhaps the most surreal in the entire Delhi region. The ambience is unusually casual. The friendly man lounging on the chair is substituting for the box office window. Bhanu Pratap Singh is holding a sheaf of green old-fashioned movie tickets in his hands — ₹30 and ₹50 for the two “classes” respectively. Sitting beside him is Romi, the white Pomeranian who lives in the compound.The next show is supposed to begin 15 minutes later, at 3pm. Nobody is here yet.Managing to survive the multiplex era has distinguished Raj as a small wonder. And its survival in the ongoing age of the coronavirus pandemic (when so many thriving businesses have become history) makes it doubly wondrous.“We play the movie even if only one person arrives,” the ticket seller remarks.Dating back to the 1950s, the theatre sits on the vast Gurugram real estate like a guest who has overextended their stay despite taking up so much space in the house. The cinema, with its sprawling edifice, is clearly like the bulky movie halls from yesteryears. One expects a swanky shopping mall or a high-rise condo to swallow up these precious acres any moment now. A tall facade at the front hides a sloping tin roof.The lobby inside is empty, except for an attendant watching a movie on TV. The auditorium within is utterly quiet. Most of it consists of the ground-level seating called First Class (360 seats). The more exclusive Reserve Class (160 seats), which is the theatre’s balcony, is separated by a banister. The two sidewalls are punctuated by a long row of large ceiling fans.Soon, a man tiptoes in, carrying a paper cone filled with namkeen jhalmuri. He says he is taking a brief break from his work as a “kabadi walla”. Two more men arrive. Suddenly the wide screen lights up with a muffled sound. The movie, Garam Bazar, begins.Outside, next to the main gate, beside a series of four dry water taps, a handwritten flier cautions the audience to use face masks and to maintain doori (distancing).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-show-must-go-on-101638477961452.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||A week on, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur fails to reply to AICC show-cause notice on ‘anti-party activities’||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur has failed to respond to the show-cause notice that the All India Congress Committee (AICC) had served on her on November 24 for indulging in anti-party activities. The party had given her seven days to explain her stand on the issue of Amarinder’s exit from the party and her future plans. “We didn’t get any reply from her,” said AICC secretary and party’s Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary. Chaudhary evaded reply on as what action the party plans to take against her, saying he would not like to explain internal affairs of party in the media.Preneet was served the show-cause notice as she was seen as supporting Patiala mayor Sanjiv Sharma Bittu, who was openly siding with Amarinder, after he was asked to prove majority in the civic body House. Even Preneet had said that she was with her family (Amarinder) when the Congress served her notice. In the notice, the Congress had accused Preneet of anti-party activities, saying that ever since her husband resigned from the party and floated his own outfit Punjab Lok Congress, she made open announcements in the media about siding with her husband’s party.“Kindly explain your stand on this issue within a period of seven days. Otherwise, the party will be forced to take necessary disciplinary action,” the notice read.After Amarinder Singh resigned from the chief minister’s post after months of dissidence within the party and hinted that he would quit the Congress, Preneet had claimed that she had no intention of quitting the Congress at that time.Amarinder has already announced that he will be fighting the assembly elections from Patiala, which he represented in 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017. Despite repeated attempts, Preneet was not available for comments.
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP will field candidates from all 117 assembly segments in Punjab: Ashwani Sharma||Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said on Thursday that their party would field candidates from all 117 constituencies in the state Punjab in the upcoming assembly polls despite former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh having announced his pact with them.“We will fight to win and form government,” Sharma said, while talking to mediapersons in Hoshiarpur. Defending Amarinder on the issue of “unfulfilled promises,” he said that promises were made (with the electorate) by political parties and not individual leaders. Sharma questioned as to why people who were now accusing Captain of inaction were silent for all these years.“We have been opposing the Congress’ policies and its mischievous electoral agenda. The Congress formed the government by making false promises but we will not do so. We will take a vow to serve people,” he added.Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal were misleading people with tall promises which would never become a reality, he claimed.Whether the BJP would bet on Amarinder Singh or Delhi leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who, on Wednesday resigned as the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president and joined the saffron party, as its chief ministerial candidate, Sharma said it was for the parliamentary board to decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-will-field-candidates-from-all-117-assembly-segments-in-punjab-ashwani-sharma-101638477282575.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Not Channi, but it’s ‘changi’ sarkar: Punjab CM presents report card on his 72-day tenure||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday said that he was not someone who made mere announcements as nearly 60 pro-people decisions and initiatives were taken by the Congress government in the state since he took over and all of them were implemented.Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, he said, “People say it is ‘Channi sarkar’, but I am nobody. I say this is ‘changi sarkar’ (good government).” He shared details of development works and initiatives taken by the state government after he assumed the charge as CM in September, replacing Amarinder Singh. “I am not ‘ailaanjeet’ (one who only makes announcements). I am ‘vishwasjeet’ (one who wins people’s trust),” he added.“I am here to give a report card before people. We formed government to serve people. We will work with full honesty and transparency. I will not break people’s trust,” he said.Targeting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Channi said those who do not know anything about Punjab are questioning them about “aam aadmi”. They would not give anything where they have their government and making “false promises” with people of Punjab to “grab” power, he alleged.“We made power cheaper from November 1 by ₹3 per unit for those having load up to 7 kW. In Punjab, power is the cheapest in the entire India, I am making this claim, let anyone counter me,” said Channi, accusing rivals of “misleading” people.His political rivals, he said, were misleading the public because the bills recently issued were for October and the relief will get reflected in the coming bills, he said. ‘Only a Punjabi will govern Punjab’ Reacting to the criticism by the Aam admi party (AAP) over his recently made remark ‘kala angrez’ (black Englishman) against AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Channi said that the people of Punjab do not want an outsider to run the government in the state. “Also, he can’t fulfill the aspirations of Punjabis and doesn’t understand Punjabi culture and ethos. Punjabis don’t want Rs. 1,000. If he wanted to make an announcement just for the sake of it he would have announced ₹5,000 monthly honorarium,” he said. Channi said comparisons cannot be drawn between him and Kejriwal. “How can he compare himself with me? I am a true Punjabi, he’s an outsider. He can’t compete with me in understanding Punjab, its requirements, culture and ethos,” Channi said. Facing criticism, especially from the AAP over not showing any “zero” amount electricity bills, Channi said bills of 22 lakh households, who have connected load of up to 1 kilowatt and up to 200 units of consumption, are zero.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month had brought 1 lakh “zero” amount Delhi electricity bills and dared Channi to show even 1,000 such bills of his state. “A party chief (Kejriwal) has asked to show a single zero bill. I will show you lakhs of them in Punjab. All electricity arrears of households who have connected load up to 2 kW have been waived,” he said.Referring to Kejriwal’s announcement of giving ₹1,000 per month to women above 18 if his party comes to power, Channi asked him to first implement it in the national capital. “There (Delhi) he will not give anything, here he says ₹1,000 will be given. Are we fools?” he said.Facing criticism on sand rates, Channi said the rates have been fixed at ₹5.50 per cubic feet and anyone could procure at this rate from the quarry. He said his government was also considering reducing the transportation rates for sand.Evades reply on drug case On a query on the drug issue, the CM evaded reply, as according to him, the matter was in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “Please do not ask anything on drugs as it has bearing on the case in the court,” he said. Slamming the Shiromani Akali Dal over the farm laws, he said, “The SAD is mother of these laws. They passed a law of contract farming first and they showed it to their (erstwhile) ally BJP, which later brought farm laws.”On Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu, who has been targeting his own government over some issues, Channi said all issues will be resolved. “We are working under the party and we have to implement the policies of the party,” he said. Whether he sees himself as chief ministerial face for the elections, Channi said, “No. I did not see it earlier as well. My party made me (the CM). I was neither a candidate nor am I now. Whatever the party decides I abide by it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/not-channi-but-it-s-changi-sarkar-punjab-cm-presents-report-card-on-his-72-day-tenure-101638477170323.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Manjinder Sirsa forced to choose between BJP and jail: Akal Takht jathedar||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Thursday said that senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa was forced to join the BJP, claiming that jail was the other option given to him by the ruling party at the Centre. In a video statement, he said, “When foreign rulers, including the Mughals, came to India, they after occupying the country asked the people to choose either dharma (faith) or life.” “I had a telephonic conversation with Sirsa yesterday. It appeared to me that he too was offered two options. He was asked to either join BJP or go to jail. He faced the situation similar to that was prevailing during the foreign rule,” he said.The Delhi-based Sikh leaders are also responsible for this situation as they prepared the ground for Sirsa being forced to join the saffron party. “This is a political blunder,” he said.It’s unfortunate, says SGPC chiefShiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami also slammed Sirsa’s joining the BJP as unfortunate.“The Sikh Sangat in Delhi had given a big honour to Sirsa and the party (Shiromani Akali Dal) made him president of the DSGMC. His move has sparked outrage among the Sikh community,” he said. “Due to the three agri-marketing laws introduced by the BJP, farmers had to sit on the streets for a year, during which nearly 700 people lost their lives. By joining such a party, Sirsa has hurt the feelings of farmers as well as Sikhs”, Dhami added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manjinder-sirsa-forced-to-choose-between-bjp-and-jail-akal-takht-jathedar-101638476862629.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||It’s a direct attack on Sikh institutions, Panth: Sukhbir Badal on SAD’s Sirsa joining BJP||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday termed party leader and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s entry into the BJP as “a direct attack on Sikh institutions and the Khalsa Panth”. Addressing the media at Kartarpur in Jalandhar district where he was campaigning for SAD-BSP alliance candidate Balwinder Kumar, Sukhbir said the BJP used coercive and dirty tactics to make Sirsa join it. “This is the BJP’s revenge against us for breaking the alliance with it and quitting the Union cabinet to stand by farmers. But we have no regrets. We are really proud of our decision. We are ready to stand up to repression and will defeat them,” said the Akali leader. Sukhbir, who also paid obeisance at Dera Sachkhand Ballan, Dera Sant Baba Pritam Das Ji and other religious places, claimed that Sirsa sent him a copy of an FIR against him a day before his resignation and that he was asked to choose between jail or join the saffron party.The central government won’t let the Akali Dal’s elected office-bearers to take charge of the DSGMC despite securing victory in the elections. “I am disappointed that instead of being true to the traditions of his religion against repression, Sirsa chose to bow down,” said Sukhbir, adding that similar cases were registered against SAD (Delhi) president Harmeet Singh Kalka and 11 other members of the DSGMC. Sirsa’s move will not have any impact in Punjab as he has no following in the state, he said, adding, “Everybody in Punjab knows that he has no roots here.” Also, he did not rule out the possibility of the BJP government at the Centre targeting other Akali leaders. Senior leaders may join BJP todaySome senior leaders from different parties in Punjab are likely to join the BJP on Friday. State chief Ashwani Sharma has cancelled all programmes related to his field visits on Friday to remain present in the press conference on the directions of the party.

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Life next to landfill in Ward 26 a constant nightmare||Living right next to the Dadumajra landfill, residents of Ward Number 26 remain in anticipation of a solution to their miseries.The horrid stench is the least of residents’ troubles, as the dumping site has also exposed them to a plethora of health hazards, including allergies, asthma and skin ailments.Spread across 45.11 acres, the landfill is located right in the middle of the ward, which comprises Dadumajra Colony and village, Shahpur Colony and village, and Rehabilitation Colony, Sector 38 (W).Amid rising temperatures in the summer, fires are also commonplace at the site, leaving locals struggling with respiratory problems. Leachate leakage, every time it rains, pollutes the groundwater resources.City’s daily waste of around 450 metric tonnes (MT) is directed to this site every day, but less than 50 MT is processed at the nearby Solid Waste Processing Plant, leaving most of it rotting in the open.“For over 20 years now, the residents of Dadumajra Colony have been protesting for clearance of the dumping site, but the political representatives and MC officials have turned a blind eye to the matter. While a boundary wall has been erected around the landfill, little has been done to clear the towering legacy waste,” said Dyal Krishan, president, Dumping Ground Site Joint Action Committee.“Those living in the vicinity of the landfill are running out of resources to fund their healthcare bills. Apart from ailing health, residents even battle the stench through day and night,” he added.Absence of basic facilities and infrastructure in the ward makes matters worse. “Even though our village comes under MC’s purview, not a single park has been provided. No development work has been carried out to improve the villagers’ lives. Roads need immediate carpeting. Poor sanitation is also a cause of concern,” said Jasbir Singh, a resident of Dadumajra village. Though the residents of Rehabilitation Colony, Sector 38 (West) have access to clean drinking water and sewerage system, they say parks, roads and street lights require maintenance.Rinku Sharma, a local, said, “The councillor remains unapproachable, even though the infrastructure is crumbling. Roads need carpeting and parks need maintenance.

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Congress places it bets on familiar faces, kin of leaders in first list||The Chandigarh Congress on Thursday released its first list of 30 candidates for the municipal corporation elections scheduled for December 24. Seeking to return to winning ways in the city’s electoral politics after nearly a decade, the Congress is depending heavily on its seasoned campaigners.Some fresh faces have also been added, predominantly family members of Congress leaders, including incumbent state president’s son.Three of the sitting councillors - Gurbax Rawat, Satish Kumar Kainth and Ravinder Kaur Gujral have been retained. Former councillor Harpreet Kaur, who is the wife of sitting councillor Devinder Singh Babla, has been given ticket from Babla’s ward as it was reserved for women. The fate of its fifth sitting councillor Sheela Devi remains under suspense; the party is still to announce a candidate from her current ward area. The party’s state in-charge Harish Chaudhary on Thursday approved the list of candidates prepared by the state election committee. The committee, comprising Chandigarh state president Subhash Chawla and former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal among others, held a meeting on Thursday. “The committee scrunitised all applications in details and after discussion, finalised 30 candidates as party’s official candidates,” said a party spokesperson. The party had invited applications from prospective candidates and around 200 had applied for tickets. Facing factionalism and prospects of rebel candidates, the party was last to announce its first list of candidates among major parties. AAP announced its first list of 26 candidates on November 30 and BJP on Wednesday announced 23.Most of the party candidates who lost in previous MC election don’t find themselves in the list, though some have been given another chance. Party’s chief spokesperson and former deputy mayor Harmohinder Singh Lucky will again take on BJP’s Maheshinder Singh Sidhu from ward 2, which in 2016 election was ward 1. Lucky had lost to Sidhu in a close contest.Other last time losers in fray again include former mayor Kamlesh Banarasi Dass, Mahila Congress president Deipa Dubey, Ravi Thakur and Jasbir Singh Bunty. Turncoat Balwinder Kaur, sister of Babla, who contested and lost the last election in 2016 on a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) ticket, will contest this time on the Congress ticket from ward 22. Former councillor Jannat Jahan, former sarpanch of village Mauli Jagran Kartar Singh Thakur, brother of former Punjab minister Jagmohan Singh Kang’s brother and former councillor Jagjit Singh Kang are some of the other seasoned players in local politics who have been given tickets.Chawla’s son to contestThis election will see the entry of the city Congress president Subhash Chawla’s son Sumit Chawla into city’s electoral politics. He will contest from ward 14. Subhash, who took over as the Congress city president earlier this year, had lost his 2016 election to BJP’s Rajesh Kumar Gupta.Some of other new faces include chairman of MC’s door-to-door garbage collection federation Om Prakash Saini, wife of former mayor Gurcharan Dass Kala, Rajiv Kumar Moudgil, NSUI leader Sachin Galav, INTUC leader Naseeb Jakhar, former deputy mayor Pushpa Sharma’s daughter Saroj Sharma, former MC employee Gurcharan Singh, Youth congress leader Abhishek Sharma Shanky and Gurpeet Gabi, a local Congress leader.

Among those who protested were members of the teacher associations, student body Indian National Student Organisation (INSO) and INLD Students Organisation (ISO). Khattar visited the MDU and paid tributes to former Haryana deputy chief minister late Mangal Sen on his death anniversary and released a book on his life. He also inaugurated a renovated indoor gymnasium and laid the foundation stone of a kabaddi hall. Speaking on the occasion, Khattar said Mangal Sen contributed to society and nation with the mantra of ‘Sewa parmo dharam’. Jannayak Janta Party’s student wing INSO put up posters outside the MDU campus, questioning the educational qualifications of vice-chancellor Prof Rajbir Singh and seeking a probe into his PhD degree. Delegations of ISO, INSO and other student bodies submitted separate memorandums to chief minister Khattar and urged to revoke his government’s decision to recruit employees in universities through HPSC and HSSC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-invite-farmer-leaders-for-talks-on-unresolved-issues-khattar-101638475782948.html

He said, “The 2012 order by the Punjab and Haryana high court against the illegal extension of bus permits was not implemented properly. We have implemented it in toto and cancelled 680 such permits.”He stressed that if the illegal extension of permits had been revoked in 2012 itself, the state exchequer would have earned ₹1,380 crore, which could have been spent on public welfare.Alleging a ₹6,600 crore scam in the transport department for the past 14.5 years, Warring said a special investigation team will be formed to thoroughly investigate it and anyone found guilty, will not be spared.Taking a jibe at former CM Capt Amarinder Singh and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Warring alleged that both were hand in glove and sold the interests of the state to the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-roadways-daily-income-is-now-1-05-crore-warring-101638475426541.html

We will try and convince the central government to normalise trade relations with Pakistan, as it is beneficial for Punjab as well,” he added.The five-day expo, which will continue till December 6, has been organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) and hosted by the Punjab government, with an aim to strengthen industrial relations with nations within and beyond Asia.The event features traders from Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, along with some from countries like Egypt, Turkey, Thailand and Afghanistan.Soni appealed to industrialists to expand and establish new industries in Punjab, stating that the state government was fully committed to providing all kinds of facilities to the industry.Tejveer Singh, secretary, industry and commerce, said more than ₹1 lakh crore investment had been made in Punjab over the last four years. “We have identified tourism as a thrust sector, and will be providing many fiscal incentives to tourism and hospitality. This expo is back after one year and we know how much anticipation it creates. It helps our tourism and economy very positively,” he added.Earlier, PHDCCI secretary general Saurabh Sanyal urged the government to push for better trade relations with Pakistan, and invest more in tourism and start-up culture.RS Sachdeva, chair, Punjab state chapter, PHDCCI, echoed his sentiments and said, “Trade relations with neighbours are essential, especially for a border area like Amritsar. The government should also build exhibition centres and hotels to push for tourism, especially local tourism, as the pandemic has hampered international commute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-deputy-cm-urges-centre-to-strengthen-india-pakistan-trade-ties-101638475424252.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal promises free, high quality education to every child in Punjab||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday promised free and quality education in government schools to those born in Punjab and announced to give an ex gratia of ₹1 crore to families of the soldiers or police jawans who die in line of duty if AAP comes to power in the state. Giving free and quality education to all those born in Punjab will be the responsibility of our government, said Kejriwal while announcing his fourth “guarantee” for the people of Punjab during the party’s Tiranga Yatra in Pathankot. “Everyone, whether poor or rich, will get quality education. We will build new schools. Delhi’s 25% budget is used on education,” said Kejriwal. He said services of temporary teachers will be regularised and their pending issues will be resolved. “Like Delhi, I guarantee we will improve the education system in Punjab,” he said. “We will make Punjab an education hub,” he added. Hailing contribution of Punjabis, especially from the Gurdaspur and Pathankot, to the country’s defence forces, Kejriwal while announcing the “fifth guarantee”, said if any soldier from Punjab or police jawan lays down life in any operation, his party’s government will give a ex-gratia of ₹one crore to next of kin on Delhi’s pattern. Kejriwal has already promised up to 300 units of free electricity for each household, 24-hour power supply, free treatment and medicines at government hospitals besides ₹1,000 per month to women above 18 if his party comes to power in the state. Kejriwal also kept up the attack on Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over the “kale angrez” jibe, saying he may be dark complexioned but his intent is clear and he doesn’t make false promises. “Ever since I have announced that each woman in the state will be given ₹1,000 per month, Channi has been targeting me. A few days ago, he taunted me for wearing ordinary clothes, but I want to tell him I have no problem with this,” he said. “When I will give ₹1,000 to each woman, I will be happy to see our mothers and sisters purchasing new suits for themselves to wear,” the AAP leader said in Amritsar. Earlier, Kejriwal said: “The highest number of recruits in the Indian Army is from Pathankot and Gurdaspur, and several have sacrificed their lives while defending the borders of the nation.” The party leaders said the “Tiranga Yatra” was dedicated to the country’s unity, integrity and brave warriors. It started from the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chowk ( in Pathankot) with a large number of AAP leaders, volunteers and supporters, and ended at Dhangu Chowk on Dalhousie Road, after passing through various markets of the city.

According to the meteorological department of PAU, light drizzle is expected between December 3 and 5, which will help in bringing down the pollution level and settle the suspended particulate matter.According to the National Air Quality Index, a central agency monitoring pollution level, with 205 points, the air quality of the city remained in the ‘poor’ category and PM 2.5 remained the main contributor, which affects the lungs. Head of the climate change and agricultural meteorology department, Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, said the temperature on December 2 was the lowest recorded after 25 years.

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Challan no gospel truth, court ought to separate chaff from grain: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that a trial court is well within its power to summon additional accused even as his name did not figure in the challan presented by an investigating agency in a criminal case. The high court bench of justice Meenakshi I Mehta observed that charge-sheet submitted regarding the innocence of any person cannot be taken to be the gospel truth and the court is well within its power to “separate the chaff from the grains” to find out the truth regarding the culpability of any person who has not been arrayed as the accused or has not been sent up to face the trial. “...the same (evidence submitted) need not be of the level to come to the conclusion that if the evidence goes unrebutted, the same would lead to the conviction of the person proposed to be summoned as the additional accused and rather the same has to be just somewhat higher than the one required to be considered at the time of the framing of the charge,” the bench said. The court dismissed a plea from six persons, who were summoned as additional accused by the court. Their names figured in the FIR but after investigation, their names were dropped. Subsequently, they were summoned as additional accused by the trial court, a decision challenged in the high court in 2018. The FIR was registered on July 10, 2017 for criminal intimidation and under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Complainants, several villagers, belonging to Dalit community in Hansi area of Hisar, had stated that a scuffle broke out between some youngsters from Brahmin and Dalit communities over the turn to get water. Following the registration of an FIR, the accused party, the upper castes, threatened social boycott of the Dalits if they didn’t settle for a compromise. A ‘munadi (declaration)’ was effected that none of the members of Dalit community in the village will enter the fields belonging to the upper castes. Even the dairy owners stopped providing milk to Dalit families, it was alleged. Subsequently, when a challan was filed, only one person was named as accused by the police. During the trial, a witness reiterated allegations against the lone accused and even others and subsequently, the court ordered summoning of six more named in the FIR. The accused persons had submitted in high court that allegations against them were based on ‘hearsay’. Construing the allegations levelled in the FIR and reiterated by the complainant in his depositions as ‘hearsay evidence’ does not suffice at all, the court said, adding that at this stage, clean chit can’t be given to the petitioners at a time when lone accused also faces same set of allegations and is already facing the trial. It also came to light that the manner in which investigations were carried out is already before the Supreme Court.

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Minor among two held with illegal weapons in Faridkot||With the arrest of two persons, including a minor, with three illegal weapons near Bir Chahal in Faridkot, the district police on Thursday claimed to have averted a murder plot.

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Rohtak land release case: Haryana seeks recall of SC order for CBI probe||The BJP-led Haryana government has sought the recall of the July 7 Supreme Court (SC) orders whereby an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was ordered into the release of land in Rohtak to real estate developer, Uddar Gagan Properties, during the reign of Congress with Bhupinder Singh Hooda at the helm. The state government in a recall application filed before the apex court has taken the ground that handing over the case to the CBI at this stage was not in the interest of justice since a detailed inquiry has been conducted in the matter by the state government wherein all the legal and technical issues have already been considered. Also, disciplinary action against officials found guilty in an inquiry conducted by senior IAS officer Anurag Rastogi has been initiated and shall be concluded soon, it said. The state has argued that the facts concluded by Rastogi in his report were not taken clearly on record by the SC and July 7 orders were passed merely on the basis of submissions of amicus curiae. The recall application accompanied by an affidavit from director, town and country planning, K Makarand Pandurang, will be heard on December 6 by a bench of Justice Uday Umesh Lalit and Justice S Ravindra Bhat. “The judgment and order under review suffers from error apparent on the face of the record and that permitting the order to stand would occasion a failure of justice and that the judgment suffers from material irregularity which requires correction in review. In this case the inquiry has been properly conducted by the state government hence de-novo (fresh) inquiry by the CBI is in the teeth of the settled provisions of law,’’ said the interlocutory application. ‘CBI not to be influenced by multiple inquiries’ The SC in its July 7 order had said that the matter shall be looked into by the CBI without in any way being influenced by the reports and conclusions as stated in this order. The apex court was referring to the outcome of the multiple inquiries ordered by the state government which as per the amicus curiae, Jaideep Gupta, only concluded that there was “systemic failure” rather than considering the individual actions of those who were responsible. Grounds taken to seek recall of CBI probe order The state government in its recall application has also taken the ground that the principles applicable for transferring a case to the CBI as laid down by the apex court in various cases is not made out in the present case and therefore transfer of the case is not called for and to that extent the order warrants review, it said. The application said that explanation given in the July 7 judgment by relying upon the decision passed in the case of Rameshwar (Manesar land case) needs a second look in view of the law settled by the apex court in catena of judgments. “There is no similarity in the present case and the case relied upon by the apex court (Manesar). It is pertinent to mention that facts and issues involved in both the cases are different. Hence it would be grave miscarriage of justice to pronounce an identical order in the present case by equating it to Rameshwar matter. There are some vital facts to be taken into account in the present case which have escaped the attention of the SC,” the government has argued. The application also said that the SC in a catena of judgements held that only on account of special reasons where it is felt that an investigation by the local police would prove to be ineffective that directions have been given to the CBI to take up the investigation. There were no such special reasons in the instant case which warranted the directions being given to the CBI to conduct investigations, it said. The land matter and multiple inquiries •About 850 acres was proposed to be acquired in 2002 for residential-commercial sectors in Rohtak by HUDA. The award was though passed for 422 acres in April 2005. •Uddar Gagan Properties in March 2005 entered into collaboration agreements with farmers whose land was under acquisition. •The developer got a licence to develop a colony on 280 acres in June 2006 and the corresponding land was released from acquisition. •The licences were addressed to the owners but remitted to the builder. This was followed by execution of sale deeds in favour of the builder through power-of-attorney holder of the land owners. •In May 2016, the SC quashed the land released from acquisition and transferred licences to HUDA. •The SC also asked the state government to inquire into the legality and bona fides of the action of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the applications of the builder and releasing the land to it. •CM, ML Khattar on March 13, 2018 announced in the state assembly that the government has decided to refer the Uddar Gagan matter to CBI. He later backed down and instead ordered an inquiry by a retired judge, Justice RS Madan. •Justice (retd) Madan recommended another inquiry by a senior financial commissioner rank officer into the role of land acquisition officer (LAO), estate officer of HUDA and office of the Rohtak deputy commissioner regarding delivery of possession of the acquired land.

District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said none of the four persons testing positive were NRIs, nor they had any history of international travel. They have been quarantined and their samples sent for genome sequencing, he added. In the wake of the Union health ministry’s advisory on the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, the Punjab health department has issued guidelines asking frequent international travellers and NRIs visiting the state to undergo mandatory coronavirus tests. If tested positive, the passengers will have to go through a genome sequencing test to ensure that they are not suffering from the new virus variant, the advisory says. A letter in this regard was issued wherein the health department asked all civil surgeons, vice-chancellors of medical and animal husbandry universities, medical colleges and private testing laboratories to share the data of such patients.“If any international traveller comes to your institution or laboratory and is found corona positive, a sample should be sent immediately to the Government Medical College, Patiala, for genome-sequencing test,” the letter reads.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr SP Singh has also urged residents to get both the doses of vaccine at the earliest and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. It was on November 28 that the district had logged four Covid cases, while no infection was reported in Ludhiana on Wednesday. As many as 87,668 people in the district have tested positive so far, of whom 85,540 have successfully defeated the virus. The contagion has claimed 2,110 lives in the district till now.

Following the threats, the district administration and the Gurugram police have decided to deploy personnel on a large scale at the 20 designated namaz sites to prevent a law-and-order situation on Friday.“We are keeping a close watch on the situation and no one will be allowed to take law and order into their own hands and disturb peace in the city,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. The police have already prepared a plan and assigned duties to personnel to be deployed at the 20 designated sites, said officials. Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (west), said 700 police personnel will be deployed across the city, including 200 at the Sector 37 site, where namaz was disrupted last Friday too. “We are well-prepared and will take strict action against anyone who tries to disrupt namaz or try to disturb law and order. Quick response teams will be deployed along with rapid action force and there will be heavy police presence at all sites so that we can keep a close watch on suspects planning to disrupt namaz,” he said.Members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of Hindu right-wing groups, which has been protesting against namaz in public places, said they had given a month’s time to the administration to stop the practise of namaz being offered on public land. “Our only submission to the district administration was that prayers not be held in the open. But Muslims continued to do so. Now the situation is getting tense and despite an assurance that they will not do so, Muslims are still using open spaces and land which belongs to area residents,” said Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal adviser of the Samiti.Last month, the Gurugram administration reduced the number of designated namaz sites from 37 to 20 after objections were raised by residents in several areas. Dinesh Bharti, president of Bharat Mata Vahini, who was earlier arrested for interrupting namaz, also met the deputy commissioner on Thursday and handed over a memorandum. “I have also written to the chief minister and a complaint has been submitted at the CM’s window on Thursday. Issues related to open namaz are gaining momentum across the city and Hindu groups and locals are unhappy. There is only one solution and that is to stop namaz in the open; else there will be law and order issues,” he said.On Tuesday, a member of a Muslim group in Gurugram had filed a police complaint against three right-wing leaders — Dinesh Bharti, Kulbhushan Bhardwaj and Mahaveer Bhardwaj — for allegedly hurting religious sentiments with their remarks, while protesting against namaz in the open. No case has been registered as yet, said police, adding that allegations were being looked into.Altaf Ahmad, founder, Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, a civil society group, said they plan to meet the deputy commissioner of police, west, on Friday before the namaz to know why no FIR had been registered on their complaint. “We will also meet the deputy commissioner and seek an assurance on the safety and security of the faithful. The threats have become routine every Thursday and are unlikely to stop till the administration takes a strong view,” he said. Over the past three months, right-wing groups have tried to disrupt namaz being offered in open spaces in sectors 47, 12, 37 and Sirhaul Village. On November 5, Hindu groups organised a Govardhan Puja at the site in Sector 12A, where namaz used to be offered on Fridays. The protesters also performed a havan (puja) at a site designated for holding Friday prayers in Sector 37 and also disrupted namaz in Sirhaul village, Sector 18. Both the latter locations were among the 20 sites designated for Friday prayers by the district administration and Muslims who had to move away from the spots said such protests amounted to harassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rightwing-groups-threaten-to-disrupt-namaz-in-gurugram-today-101638474222448.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Maluka takes on Sisodia over ‘poor condition of schools’ in Punjab||The Congress government on Thursday got an unexpected support from veteran Akali leader Sikander Singh Maluka against attack by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the state of government schools and standard of education in Punjab.Former education minister Maluka, who has been nominated as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from the Rampura Phul seat, took to the social media to dismiss Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s charges that government schools in the state are in a shambles.He invited Sisodia to visit his native place Maluka in Bathinda district to compare the quality of education at the rural schools with institutes run by the Delhi government.On being contacted, Maluka, head of SAD’s farmer cell and core committee member, said he was hurt as the AAP leadership continued labelling Punjab an underdeveloped state in education and other sectors. There is always a scope for improvement and education should be a priority sector, he said. Maluka’s support to the Congress government may leave his party red-faced.“It is not that I have a soft corner for the Congress or the chief minister. But I do not agree with a tradition that a leader has to second unfounded charges by others to attack a common political opponent,” he added.Earlier in August this year too, Maluka had expressed strong resentment against the SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on the distribution of tickets.Maluka was keen to contest the forthcoming assembly polls from Maur and wanted his son to be fielded from Rampura Phul. He had also stated that the ‘one family, one ticket’ policy was selectively imposed on him.However, he later fell in line and agreed to contest from Rampura Phul, from where he would contest for a sixth consecutive term.“Image of Punjab is my priority. I stand against Congress politically, but consider it my duty to challenge any unfounded claims made by the AAP to portray Punjab in a bad light. I remained education minister in Parkash Singh Badal-led government for nearly two years and have seen the improvement in public education in the last over one decade. Few cases found here and there with poor facilities in schools cannot be generalised,” he added.Maluka said two government senior secondary schools at Maluka are known for maintaining high academic standards and having impressive infrastructure.“Students here excel in sports and co-curricular activities. Children from adjoining villages prefer studying at government schools. My village is not an exception but scores of government schools across the state have impressively improved their standards in the past over a decade,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/maluka-takes-on-sisodia-over-poor-condition-of-schools-in-punjab-101638474162888.html

Residing in Mohali currently, Dhilpreet said it was his ancestral property and a few neighbours had moved court in 2019 claiming that the site was reserved for a park when Raghunath Enclave was established. “The case is still subjudice, but it seems like the land mafia, which is allegedly patronised by a cabinet minister, is trying to grab the land with the help of MC,” Dhilpreet alleged.He claimed that MC officials conducted a demolition drive on Thursday morning in presence of heavy police force and razed the main gate and residential unit without serving any notice.“A part of Raghunath Enclave was carved out of our land when my grandfather sold it in the 80s. The ownership of the land in question has also been challenged earlier and the court had in 2012 and 2015 ordered that the land belongs to us. Further, the court ordered that even if the MC comes to know about any encroachment made by the owner, it has to follow procedure and serve notice before taking any action,” he said.“But the MC demolished the structure in contempt of the court orders. The MC is aiding the land mafia which is suspectedly trying to grab the land,” he added. “The MC teams have been visiting the site since the last week of October and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was also apprised of the same through an email in the past. A complaint regarding the same was also submitted with the vigilance department, but to no avail,” Dhilpreet said.“Furniture, air conditioner and other items kept inside the residential unit have also been damaged by the MC. We will file a contempt petition against the civic body. An FIR will also be lodged against the MC after discussing the matter with my lawyer,” he added.Meanwhile, assistant town planner (ATP) MS Bedi said as per the record, the site was earmarked for a park and the horticulture wing of MC was directed to construct the same at the site.“The horticulture wing apprised the senior officials of the encroachment on the site, following which the building branch was directed to demolish the structure. A notice was also served. The MC is not aware of the case filed by the locals in this regard and neither any court orders were presented by the owner or his staff at the site,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-helping-land-mafia-alleges-uk-national-civic-body-rebuts-charges-101638474042525.html
03-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka BJP MLA seeks reshuffle of cabinet citing inefficiency||The problems for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka continue to compound as its own legislator complained about non-performance of the state government. Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur city (Vijayapura), on Thursday said non-performers should be removed from the government. “After December 10, there will be big changes in the state. There will be a change in the cabinet. Those who are ministers, will take their performance into account and those who have non-performed will be changed,” Yatnal said. The statements come at a time when differences within the Bommai-led government appear to be on the rise. Senior BJP leader, who was upset on Basavaraj Bommai succeeding BS Yediyurappa, had even backed industries minister Murugesh Nirani Nirani the top job. Yatnal said there were no likely change of Bommai but added that “the person” Eshwarappa should become chief minister. Though Yatnal does not hold any senior positions within the party or government, the decision not to take action against his repeated tirades against Yediyurappa, several party colleagues and now Bommai indicates to the possibility that he may have the backing of the party high command, people aware of the developments said. Yatnal said ministers barely come to Vidhana Soudha and are instead running after the chief minister. The developments not helping the Bommai government that was already reeling under various charges of corruption including Bitcoin scandal and money laundering among others. “There is some dissatisfaction (within the party). To make that go, the chief minister must reshuffle the cabinet after consulting with all legislators,” Yatnal said. The legislator said the chief minister must review the performance of ministers every week or 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-bjp-mla-seeks-reshuffle-of-cabinet-citing-inefficiency-101638473987546.html

03-12-2021||Bangalore||Comedians slam Karnataka govt over growing ‘intolerance’||Comedians, members of the art fraternity in Bengaluru and other places fear the growing climate of intolerance in India’s IT capital continues to transform rapidly under the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its attitude to condone actions of vigilante groups.Opposition to standup acts by comedians Munawar Faruqui and Kunal Kamra, they add, are the latest in the long list of incidents of how these right wing groups and their political masters are choking what used to be a conducive space for artists to perform.“India is a parody account of democracy,” Kamra, the standup comedian, told Hindustan Times.Kamra’s scheduled show in Bengaluru was cancelled after the comedian received threats and venue organisers decided not to let out their space for his performance. Barely a week ago, comedian Munawar Faruqui too was forced to cancel his show after the police asked venue operators not to let out space as it could lead to disruption of peace, harmony and end up hurting religious sentiments.Once a melting pot of different cultures, music, art and people, Bengaluru has earned global acceptance for its prowess in technology and startups but has rescinded on its rich heritage, comedians say.Two rising comedians -- Arnav Rao and Kjelth Shrest -- were scheduled to record their shows before Kamra’s but the cancellation has thrown more challenges in their chosen career path.“Why are people who are against us not speaking up openly?” Rao asked as a significant section of this fraternity attribute a large part played by Tejsavi Surya, the firebrand and controversial BJP MP from Bengaluru South.The transformation in Bengaluru has been quite rapid as Kamra and Faruqui have performed several times in the city. Some shows are no more than a month old.“Standup comedy is about that person bringing his perspective, experience and world view. Kamra and Munawar have performed in Bengaluru before. Why are they suddenly persona non-grata? When somebody is threatened with violence, how is that overlooked?” Suman Kumar, a script writer and author said.So what changed!A section of the artists believe this kind of vigilantism is emboldened under chief minister Basvaraj Bommai who is trying hard to fit into the extreme right wing narrative after he was picked over several other senior BJP leaders to replace BS Yediyurappa.“For politicians it is the best way to get promoted and noticed,” Garv Malik, another standup comedian said. “I think our institutions are way stronger than what they think a comedian can cause harm.”Karnataka has seen a series of incidents where moral policing, hate crimes and communal violence appear to be on the rise.Three teenagers, who did a small dance video outside ‘Talacauvery’, considered a holy site in Kodagu district were warned and forced to apologise.Vigilantes parading as activists and “custodians of culture” are running riot in Karnataka, which at least until now, was considered among the more progressive states in the country.“When sentiments are hurt, it is natural that there are actions and reactions. Even the youth should keep in mind these sentiments and act accordingly,” Bommai said on October 13 which appeared to be justification of the rising instances of moral policing in the state.Groups that have openly threatened violence on anyone they consider “controversial” continue to carry out their acts with impunity, artists said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/comedians-slam-karnataka-govt-over-growing-intolerance-101638473804016.html
03-12-2021||Chandigarh||Implement schemes in Delhi first before making promises in Punjab: Majithia to Kejri||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday asked Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to first implement the promises he was making to the people of Punjab, including granting allowance of ₹1,000 per month to women as well as free power supply of 300 units per bill cycle, in Delhi if he was really sincere about keeping his word.“Kejriwal portrays to have a solution to every problem of other states, but he has no solution of problems of Delhi. He is promising to regularise contractual employees in Punjab, but why he is not making such employees regular in Delhi?” saked Majithia, who was here to campaign for Shutrana candidate Vaninder Kaur Loomba. Kejriwal had done nothing in Delhi till now except propaganda, he said, adding that “even the 200 units of power offered free of cost to citizens of Delhi are not utilised because the scheme has a clause that the entire amount will be charged if the consumption increases by even one unit above 200.” Majithia also asked state Congress president Navjot Sidhu to tell why he had failed to take up his challenge and appear in court in the drug case. “I had challenged him but he preferred to run away. I again challenge him to announce Charanjit Singh Channi as the party’s chief ministerial candidate if the former is doing such a good job,” he said. The SAD leader said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was trying to escape the responsibility for the abject failures of the Congress government by blaming former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for it. “The fact is that Channi was part of the team which swore on the Gutka Sahib along with Capt Amarinder. Channi has been a cabinet minister all along,” the SAD leader said.

This includes crop losses of nearly 10 lakh hectares that totalled that has led to damages to the tune of ₹8,960 crore, according to a statement by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA). “In November 2021 due to 2 successive depressions over the Bay of Bengal and a trough in the Arabian Sea caused unprecedented and insistent rainfall over the state. The state received widespread heavy rainfall and recorded 592% more than normal, which is the second-highest in the last 60 years. The region wise rainfall departures from normal shows that, South Interior Karnataka recorded 876% more rain, which is (the) highest in (the) last 60 years,” the government said in a statement on Thursday. “North interior Karnataka recorded 417% more, Malnad recorded 502% more, and the Coastal region recorded 498% more rain, which is 2nd highest in (the) last 60 years in all these three regions. The synoptic conditions, which triggered untimely heavy rainfall, led to a flood-like situation.” Over 376 animals have died in the state and 20,083 homes have been damaged in the rains that have battered Karnataka in October and November. Damages to civic and public infrastructure like roads, bridges, dams, tanks and electrical equipment have been estimated to ₹2,630 crore. However, under State Disaster Relief Fund norms, Karnataka can claim ₹1,281.92 crore, the government said in a statement on Thursday. Karnataka and several other states in the country continue to receive unseasonal rainfall that has added to the misery of the covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. Karnataka has been particularly vulnerable as the state swings between droughts and floods each year, adding to the piling problems for the state’s farming community who continue to endure hardships like plummeting prices of produce, damaged crops due to floods or droughts, lack of compensation and several other reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-govt-pegs-damage-due-to-rains-at-11k-cr-101638473687673.html

The court expressed its displeasure after perusing the affidavit filed by the head of the crime branch, which is investigating the cases against Mavunkal, in support of the application, “ascribing motives” to the judge of surprising the police with material from the public domain.Justice Ramachandran said the affidavit accused him of forcing the police to produce documents and “breaching confidentiality”.“If you wear khaki, it does not mean you can speak anything against the court. They (police) should know where they stand in protocol,” the judge added. The court noted that the tenor of the averments in the affidavit by a senior police officer was “overbearing and recriminatory”, adopted an “unmistakable condescending tone” with regard to judicial orders and observations, was “disturbing” and contained “misdirecting asseverations”. The court also noted that the averments in the affidavit were “sarcastic” and asked “is he (officer) trying to make fun of the court?” Mavunkal was arrested by the district Crime Branch which has been investigating a cheating case of ₹10 crore from different people. Mavunkal had allegedly borrowed the amount from various people saying he was in need of funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-high-court-slams-police-over-mavunkal-affidavit-101638473685370.html

The active Covid-19 case tally in the district now stands at 77, according to the officials.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram, said, “This is the highest number of Covid-19 cases Gurugram has witnessed since June. Infections had been in single digits or went up to a maximum of 11 or 12 cases a day in the past five months. There is no particular cause as to why so many Covid-19 cases were being detected in a single day. The patients were detected as part of a regular testing.

03-12-2021||Gurugram||Mercury falls in Gurugram after light rain, air likely to remain ‘very poor’||The city recorded a drop in the daytime temperature on Thursday after it rained intermittently since the morning, with the maximum temperature recorded at 18.6 degrees Celsius (°C) -- seven degrees below the normal. The minimum temperature, meanwhile, was recorded at 11.5 degrees Celsius -- four degrees above the normal.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurugram received a rainfall of 4mm till 5:30pm on Thursday. It rained due to a western disturbance, and the city witnessed cloudy skies since Wednesday, said officials.A weather bulletin issued by the Meteorological (Met) Centre Chandigarh on Thursday evening -- a regional centre of the IMD -- predicted that Haryana is likely to see mist or shallow fog at isolated places from Thursday to Sunday.“Under the influence of a western disturbance, seen as a cyclonic circulation over North Pakistan and the neighbourhood, isolated to scattered rainfall has been likely in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh between December 2 and 3. Due to this, Gurugram received a light rainfall on Thursday, which also brought down the maximum temperature by almost seven degrees below the normal,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Met Centre Chandigarh.At 377, Gurugram on Thursday recorded the air quality index (AQI) in the ‘very poor’ category for the ninth consecutive day, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Neighbouring Delhi and Faridabad recorded the AQIs at 429 and 428, respectively, both in the ‘severe’ category. In Gurugram, only the Gwal Pahari weather station recorded the AQI in the ‘severe’ zone on Thursday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) for Gurugram (north), said, “The air quality has been slightly better in Gurugram following the strict implementation of all directions by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). Teams of officials are keeping everything in check, and people violating norms are being penalised... Only the Gwal Pahari weather station recorded the air quality in the ‘severe’ category as local sources of pollution, such as road dust, is higher. But we have intensified the sprinkling of water there too.”City-based air quality experts, however, said that the difference in the quality of air in Delhi and Gurugram was due to different wind directions.Sachin Panwar, a Gurugram-based independent air quality scientist, said, “The actual difference in particulate matter (PM2.5) levels between both the cities is not much. The only difference is due to the wind direction. Delhi has primarily seen northwestern wind direction in the past few days, and Gurugram has seen westerly and northeasterly winds. That is why the surface wind in Gurugram was higher, and the pollutants could be dispersed.”Thursday’s rain is likely to help in bringing down the pollution levels in Gurugram over the next 24 hours, only if the intensity increases or the rain continues for a longer duration, he added. “The city is likely to see rainfall on Friday too, but if not, the air quality can worsen due to high moisture content in the air as the pollutants will get trapped and hold up in the lower atmosphere,” Panwar said.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System (AQEWS) forecast for Delhi-NCR, winds are likely to remain slow or calm in the region between December 3 and 5, which is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category because of this, according to the forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mercury-falls-in-gurugram-after-light-rain-air-likely-to-remain-very-poor-101638473625992.html
03-12-2021||Gurugram||Fresh TDR policy to help in land acquisition for critical infra in Gurugram||The Haryana government on Thursday notified a fresh Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) policy to allow several important rights to be monetised easily, said officials. The move comes with an aim to address the lack of roads and civic infrastructure in urban areas where land acquisition has become a major obstacle due to high cost.The fresh policy envisages that the TDR certificates, obtained by a landowner, can be divided into smaller parts so that these can be purchased and transferred digitally.Officials of department of town and country planning (DTCP) said that by making TDR certificates divisible and transferable, the policy could attract land owners who otherwise prefer to sell only the land. Land owners, whose land have been earmarked for roads, green belts, colleges, and hospitals in the development plan can apply for TDR certificates under the fresh policy.A TDR certificate refers to the government awarding extra floor area ratio to the land owner for surrendering part of his land for building a critical infrastructure.A land owner can monetise the certificate by selling it to a developer for the construction of an additional area according to the rules mentioned in the fresh policy.“The fresh TDR policy will attract more land owners as these certificates can be divided into smaller parts and also be transferred. Land is required to build critical infrastructure in many urban areas, but the cost of acquisition is too high, making it difficult to build roads and related amenities,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), adding that the new policy would be easier to implement.According to the policy, which was notified on November 16, TDR certificates issued in a specific development plan can be utilised in that plan only. The certificates can be split into multiple certificates, but not for a space less than 50 square metres; and can be transferred only through the DTCP portal. It also stated that any land can also be surrendered to set up sites such as colleges, hospitals, and other amenities which are considered part of external development. The TDR certificates shall be created, stored, and transferred only in digital format, it added. City-based landowners, meanwhile, said that this policy could help only if the TDR certificates can be monetised easily and are purchasable. “The land owners must be able to realise the cost of their land by selling these development rights with ease. Otherwise, these would become only a piece of paper. The government also needs to ensure a fair mechanism to be set up,” said Suresh Yadav, a land owner from Tikli village, adding that there was a need to ensure that these TDR certificates have wide acceptance among the developers. Pankaj Tomar, a real estate dealer, said that in the present era of cash crunch, this scheme can help in building key infrastructure and farmers can get the land monetised with the help of TDR certificates. “The city urgently needs roads, lanes, drains... and this policy could help in getting crucial land by making it easier for landowners to get TDR certificates,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fresh-tdr-policy-to-help-in-land-acquisition-for-critical-infra-in-gurugram-101638473624885.html
03-12-2021||Gurugram||Sirhaul underpass finally gets power line, lights to be turned on today: NHAI||Commuters at the Sirhaul underpass near Ambience Mall on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway will be able to use the underpass at night from Friday, after a month-long delay, as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has finally got an electricity connection there, officials said on Thursday.The underpass will be electrified from Friday after the NHAI got Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam’s (DHBVN) permission for electricity connection there on Thursday, said the NHAI officials. The highway authority used generator sets for lighting the road till now, and vehicular movements were closed there from 10pm every night.Saurabh Singhal, NHAI consultant, said that they had applied for the electricity connections a few months ago. “We have received the permission for the electricity connection on Thursday, and now the underpass will be operational during night as well, as there will be light all the time. We were forced to close it for vehicular movement during the night hours due to the lack of power connection, but it will remain operational now,” he said.The underpass near Ambience Mall was formally opened for traffic from November 1 this year, after the highway authority conducted a week-long trial to check safety and movement of vehicles inside the structure. Now, commuters do not have to go to Delhi’s Rajokri to take a U-turn, and can reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase 3 in a shorter period of time.The initial deadline for the completion of work at the underpass was September 2020, after it began on March 5, 2019. However, because of the government-imposed construction ban later that year due to pollution, and subsequently the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, the project got delayed several times. The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres, and the entire stretch including access roads is 1.5-kilometre-long with a 559-metre-long and seven-metre-wide service road.

In August, nearly 50% of the water supply was under NRW category, which has been brought down to 11% by November-end. We are trying to reduce it to below 10%... 10 such additional connections have been identified, which will also be disconnected,” said PK Aggarwal, smart city division, GMDA.Several illegal connections have been primarily identified in areas like Sheetla Mata Temple, Palam Vihar, Old Delhi-Gurugram road, and nearby areas. The focus is now on tapping illegal water connections in three to six inches long stretches, and fixing the smaller connections, according to the officials.The authority has been taking preventive measures like tapping flowing water which earlier used to get wasted, installing water flow meters, and setting up flow control devices for equitable distribution of water among others.Directing the officials concerned, Rajpal said, “Infra II division may take action for individual illegal connections and install meters on the line wherever needed. The leakage of water may be identified, and non-revenue water may be reduced by 2% more in the next two months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmda-taps-illegal-links-reduces-non-revenue-water-from-50-to-11-in-4-months-101638473622481.html
03-12-2021||Bangalore||‘No need to panic’, say govt, experts after Omicron cases in Karnataka||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Friday said the detection of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is not a reason for panic. All in the active cases of the new variant reported in the state, all patients are either asymptomatic or showing mild symptoms, said the minister on Thursday. Talking to the media in Bengaluru, the minister said in Delta variants there were several complications such as breathing problems, however, no such problems have been reported in the case of the new variant. “The symptoms are very mild, but we request people to take all precautions as earlier, especially wearing masks. From our end, we will increase testing in the coming days and take all measures needed. We are on top of the situation, there is no need for panic,” he said. Dr CN Manjunath, a member of the technical advisory committee (TAC), said it was a natural process that the virus mutates, and “we are learning about it”. “From what we have understood so far, especially from those working closely with the variant in South Africa, is that the virus is not dangerous. In more than 95% of the cases, no hospitalisation was required. So, I don’t think there is any need for panic,” he said. The doctor said the Omicron has created a panic among people and it was important that the government and other agencies should provide sufficient information to the people to ensure that the panic is addressed. “As of now, this is just a name change. From Delta, we are seeing Omicron. As long as we follow the Covid-19 protocols, it will not create another wave,” he added. Talking about the further steps taken by the government, KV Trilok Chandra, special commissioner (health), BBMP, said steps will be taken to increase testing and vaccination in the city. “A meeting has been called by the chief minister, following which more measures to be taken to control the variant would be announced,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-need-to-panic-say-govt-experts-after-omicron-cases-in-karnataka-101638473562395.html

03-12-2021||Bangalore||Doctor with no foreign travel history infected with Omicron: Karnataka govt||Officials of the health department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) remain clueless about how a person got infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus any history of international travel.Unlike other infected person, who travelled from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, patient number two is a local resident and doesn’t have any history of international travel, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said. As per the chronology given by the BBMP, the first case of Omicron reported in Karnataka was that of the 66-year-old South African, who arrived in Bengaluru on November 20. He tested positive for the virus on the same day, and he was isolated. BBMP reports read that none of his 24 primary contacts and 240 secondary contacts tested positive for the virus. BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta told HT that patient number two didn’t have any contact with the South African national. The report on patient number two says that he is a 46-year-old resident of Bengaluru and was working as a health care worker. Health minister Sudhakar further confirmed that he was a doctor working with a private hospital in the city. He developed fever and body ache on November 21 and tested positive the next day. Since he had a low CT value (which indicates a high viral load), his sample was sent for genomic sequencing. When asked how patient number two got the new variant without travelling abroad or coming in contact with South African national, Sudhakar said: “The patient must have come in contact with someone with travel history. We are still tracking it.” The BBMP commissioner refused to comment on the issue. The government has also confirmed that the patient was in home isolation between November 22 to 24 and on November 25, he was shifted to a hospital. However, he was discharged on November 27. The patient number two had 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts. Out of which, three primary contacts and two secondary contacts have tested positive for Covid. They are currently at a government hospital, and they are not showing any severe symptoms. A senior health department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the department or the BBMP doesn’t have any information about the source of the variant. “We believe the answer for this question could be found in the contact tracing. He will verify if any of the patient’s contacts have travelled abroad,” he said. However, K V Thrilok Chandra, special commissioner, BBMP (health), told HT that none five contacts of patient number two have any travel history. “As of now we don’t know how he (patient number two) got the new variant,” said Chandra. A member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee said it was possible that variant must have entered the state before restrictions were put in place. “It is conjecture at this point, and it would be difficult to give a definite answer. Since all patients and their contacts have no history of travel, we can also assume that the variant must have come early. But there is no need to panic. There is no evidence suggesting that this variant is deadly. So, we should focus on handling this variant,” said the doctor who didn’t want to be named. 
03-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC raps cops for transferring sexual assault case to Ghaziabad without pro||“It is unfortunate that institutions supposed to protect the life and liberty of common citizens are quick to shirk their responsibilities,” the Delhi high court said while strictly censuring the Delhi Police for its conduct in transferring a case of sexual assault of a woman to a police station in Ghaziabad.Justice Subramonium Prasad said the failure to register a regular FIR cost precious time that could have been utilised in conducting the investigation and could have also led to the destruction of crucial evidence.“This court finds it unfortunate that institutions that are supposed to protect the life and liberty of common citizens are quick to shirk their responsibilities. This invariably weakens the trust of common citizens that is imposed in these investigative agencies,” the court said in a 15-page judgment passed on November 30.The observations came on plea by a woman resident of Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, who alleged that she was sexually assaulted and raped in multiple places, including Delhi, over a prolonged period of time, spanning several years. The woman sought restoration of investigation by the GTB Enclave police station in Delhi, which she claimed had illegally transferred her case to the Indirapuram police station in Ghaziabad.The woman said on July 23, 2019, she filed an FIR disclosing various incidents of sexual assault and rape committed against her between 2008 and 2019 at various places, including in a place under the jurisdiction of GTB Enclave police station. The Delhi Police registered a “Zero FIR” and transferred the investigation to the UP Police.A Zero FIR can be lodged at any police station, irrespective of where the crime has taken place.The plea sought directions to the station house officer of the GTB Enclave station to continue the investigation by registering the FIR and withdrawing the one given to Indirapuram police station.Directing the GTB Enclave police station to register a regular FIR and investigate the case, the court said the GTB enclave police did not delve into whether the petitioner resided in the city or what the specific time, date and place of the alleged incident was .“By embarking on a journey of trying to get the investigation transferred to Ghaziabad, station GTB Enclave has displayed a failure in dispensation of their obligation to take into account the seriousness and gravity of the offence that has been disclosed by the petitioner in the complaint,” the court said.It said that it is irrelevant that the petitioner is not a resident of Delhi and mere disclosure that one of the incidents had taken place within the vicinity of GTB Enclave police station was sufficient for an FIR to be registered at that station, and not a Zero FIR, as was done in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-raps-cops-for-transferring-sexual-assault-case-to-ghaziabad-without-probe-101638473442451.html

03-12-2021||Chandigarh||PAU employees’ protest enters Day 2||The hunger strike launched by the Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) teachers’ association leader HS Kingra entered its second day on Thursday. According to an association member, Kingra was showing sign of weakness but he is still keeping well. On the other hand, DPL employees of PAU continued to stage a protest outside Thapar Hall of university on Thursday. The protesting employees stated that they have been working at meagre income and many of them have been working on contractual basis for the past 20 years, but still they are not being regularised.The employees have been protesting in open ground for the past three days and intend to continue their agitation until their demands are met.It may be noted here that on Wednesday, the teachers’ unions of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), along with members of the Chowkidar DPL PAU Welfare Association, had carried out a massive protest rally outside the Thapar Hall of the PAU.The teachers’ union had demanded revision of the UGC pay scales and withdrawal of the decision to unlink universities from the scales, while contractual and DPL employees pressed for regularisation of old employees and increase in pay scale.Ashwani Kumar, president of the GADVASU Teachers Association, had said that higher educational institutes from across the state remained closed in support the ongoing protest.Addressing the protesters, Jagwant Singh, general secretary of the PFUCTO, had criticised the state government for its inability to address the “genuine” demands.“The government is bent upon destroying the public funding education institutions as they are hand in glove with private universities. This struggle is less about the scales and more about the future of higher education,” he had saidChamkaur Singh, president of the Chowkidar DPL PAU Welfare Association, had said they would continue to fight for their demands. The security guards, gardeners and other employees had also left their duties at 5pm and joined the protest outside Thapar Hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pau-employees-protest-enters-day-2-101638473088438.html
03-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka on alert after 2 positive Omicron results||The union health ministry on Thursday said India’s first cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 were reported from Bengaluru in Karnataka, triggering an alarm bell in the state.“Two cases of Omicron have been found positive on a 66-year-old male and a 46-year-old male. We got the results very late last (Wednesday) night,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary at the union ministry of health and family welfare, told reporters in Delhi. “All primary and secondary contacts have been identified and are under isolation.”While Agarwal refused to divulge any more details about the two positive cases, Gaurav Gupta, commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), said one of the patients is a South African national who arrived in Bengaluru on November 20 and the second patient is a health worker in Bengaluru.The confirmation came after genome sequencing results returned from a laboratory under the INSACOG after the samples were sent by the Karnataka government for verification.The World Health Organization (WHO) labelled Omicron a virus of concern on last Friday, and the UN health body suggested that preliminary evidence found an increased risk of re-infection with this variant, as compared to other variants of concern.Talking to HT, Gupta said patient number one, who is a South African, came to Bengaluru on November 20. “The patient is 66-year-old. His samples were collected on November 20, at the (Kempegowda) international airport on the day of his arrival. He had come from South Africa via Dubai. He came to India with an RT-PCR negative test report, but he was tested positive,” said Gupta.A report from BBMP read that after the Covid test, he had checked into a hotel in the city. After he tested positive, a doctor from the Urban Primary Health Care Centre visited him for a physical triage and found him to be asymptomatic and was asked to isolate himself at the hotel. “On November 22, his test samples were collected and sent for genomic sequencing via BBMP,” read the report.It further added that the patient took self-examination on November 23 and was tested negative. On getting this negative report at 12.34 am on November 27 he left from Bengaluru to Dubai. The local authorities were informed when he left.Karnataka’s minister for health and family welfare Dr K Sudhakar said patient number 1 had 24 primary contacts and 240 secondary contacts. “The samples were collected from these contacts on November 22 and 23. All of them have tested negative. Even though they have tested negative, we are constantly monitoring their health,” the minister said.Unlike the first patient, who arrived from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, patient number two is a resident of Bengaluru without any travel history. According to BBMP’s report, patient number two is a 44-year-old male and a health care worker.“On November 21, he developed fever and body ache. He underwent an RT-PCR test on November 22 around 10 am and by 4 pm, he was declared Covid positive. Since he had a low CT value (which indicates a high viral load), his sample was sent for genomic sequencing,” read the report.The patient was in home isolation between November 22 to 24. On November 25, he was shifted to a hospital and was discharged on November 27, said the report. “He (patient number 2) had 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts. Out of which, three primary contacts and two secondary contacts have tested positive for Covid-19. They are currently at a government hospital, and they are not showing any severe symptoms. We have sent their samples for genome sequencing,” said the health minister.It remains unclear how patient number two, who doesn’t have a travel history or contact with patient number one contracted the new variant which wasn’t detected in India before. “No comments,” said BBMP commissioner Gupta when asked about the source of the new variant in the second patient.Health minister Sudhakar too didn’t give any answer to this question.Following the detection of the new variant, the Karnataka government has asked the concerned officials to increase testing and tracking at the various airports in Karnataka. The government on Tuesday issued directions to test all international passengers arriving in the state. BBMP commissioner Gupta said while the guidelines for the general public – such as avoiding crowds and wearing masks – continue, the BBMP will increase the number of samples sent for genome sequencing.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in New Delhi to meet union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to seek permission to administer the third dose of vaccine to frontline workers in the state, is expected to return to Bengaluru on Friday. Officials at CM’s office said a high-level meeting will be held on his arrival to discuss further steps to be taken.

03-12-2021||Noida||30 beds reserved at Noida Covid Hospital for international travellers||With cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 coming to the fore in India and the state government issuing directions to check the spread of the infection, the district health department on Thursday reserved 30 beds in two wards of Noida Covid Hospital in Sector 39 for all international travellers who test positive for Covid-19.Both the district administration and the health department are taking precautionary measures to tackle any sudden surge in Covid-19 cases or any case of the Omicron variant in Gautam Budh Nagar. All oxygen plants set up over the past six months are also being reviewed to see if they are functional.Depending on the severity of cases, patients will be either transferred to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida or be treated in the Noida Covid hospital, said officials.“Most L-1 (non-critical) patients may be in home isolation; L-2 (complicated) patients will be taken to the Noida Covid Hospital and L-3 (critical) patients will be taken to GIMS. If cases increase further, we will scale up the number of beds at other facilities,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer.However, no separate ward has been allocated for patients infected with the Omicron variant or those travelling from high-risk countries. Officials said with about 55 countries already on red alert, nearly all international travellers need to be monitored. Also, by the time reports of the genome testing--to determine the variant of the virus--arrive, the treatment of the patient will already begin. “We held discussions and initially thought of reserving one facility for patients infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19. We don’t have a single case of the Omicron variant yet. The test reports take time to come and isolation is done as soon as possible,” said Dr Sharma.The department has received a list of 292 international travellers who arrived in Noida between November 15 and 29 from ‘at risk’ countries. The list includes all countries in Europe, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. There are about 44 European countries.Of the 292 travellers, 45 of them were tracked till Thursday morning while teams have been deployed to track other travellers. Officials said it is a difficult task to track all travellers as often they cannot be contacted at the addresses and contact numbers provided to them.Officials said that no sample has been sent yet for genome testing in the district as none of the 292 travellers who arrived in Noida from high-risk countries have tested positive for Covid-19. However, officials admitted that cases are expected to increase as more travellers will be tracked over the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/30-beds-reserved-at-noida-covid-hospital-for-international-travellers-101638472062207.html
03-12-2021||Noida||Private school in Noida running without recognition from state education dept||A private school in Noida’s Sector 40 has been found to be allegedly running without recognition from the district basic education department and has been summoned to give a clarification for the same on December 6, failing which it will face strict action. According to a letter issued by the assistant director of basic education, Meerut division, to basic education officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, The Khaitan School in Noida’s Sector 40 has neither acquired recognition from the district basic education officer nor from the assistant director of education (basic), Meerut division for the basic school (classes 1-8). The letter, dated November 15, states that under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (2009), the school cannot operate without a certificate of recognition from the state education department. The BSA has been directed by the assistant director to take appropriate action against the school according to the rules and regulations of the Act. “As per rules, every school has to give a declaration form to the district basic education officer, informing about their intention to start primary school. After three months, the department inspects the school and issues the recognition certificate 60 days from the inspection. Only then the basic school, that is classes 1-8, can be started,” said Dharmendra Saxena, district basic education officer. Saxena said the school has the recognition for holding classes 9-12, which has to be obtained from the district inspector of schools. On Thursday, Saxena summoned the school to give a clarification by December 6, failing which action will be taken against the institution.“A teacher from the school filed a complaint with the joint director of the state education department regarding the school’s recognition, following which it was found that they have not been recognized by the education department,” said Saxena. The Khaitan School was established in 1995 in Noida and currently has over 3,900 students enrolled from nursery to Class 12. Reena Singh, principal of the school, has refuted the allegations. “We have all the required documents to show that we are recognized by the state government’s education department. These allegations are baseless and have been levelled against the school with vested interests,” she said. Saxena added that the matter will be investigated. “We have summoned the school authorities and their documents will be checked. We will impose a penalty on the school if they are found to be in violation of the rules. If the school is found to not have taken recognition, they will be asked to apply for it.” Meanwhile, Manoj Kataria, founder of Gautam Budh Nagar Parents Welfare Society (GBPWS), said parents are shocked to learn about the allegations. “Such allegations on a reputed city school have come as a shock to parents whose children have been studying there. We hope authorities conduct a survey of all other schools in the district as well so that such discrepancies can come to the fore”.

A place has to be designated and after that, police should act strictly to block the roads during the protest.” The industrialists stated that the police were also urged to intensify patrolling especially in industrial areas and focal points to stop the incidents of snatching from labourers/workers. Prominent industrialists including SC Ralhan, SS Bhogal and Avtar Bhogal participated in the event.Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar stated that industrialists demanded a solution for the problem of traffic jams, especially near Preet Palace in the morning when they leave for work. Further, the police were urged to intensify patrolling, especially in old city areas including Gandhi Nagar and Dal Bazar, as snatchings have been recently reported from the areas even during the day.Senior vice-president of PPF, Neeraj Satija, said, “The aim of the meeting was to bridge the gap between the police and industry. Various issues were raised and Bhullar assured that the problems will be solved in the coming time.

They sought waiver of interest on the ground after the Yeida failed to give them possession of their plots, saying they should be free of paying an interest imposed on the remaining cost of plots.“Why should we pay interest on the remaining plot cost, when the Yeida is yet to ready the industrial sector, develop basic civic facilities, and handover possession of the plots? We demand that the Yeida declares a ‘zero period’ from the date of allotment to the date of possession, enabling the allottees to only pay the principal cost of plots... The authority has urged us to withdraw the case (filed in Allahabad high court), and it has only approved an interest waiver for two years, but that is not enough,” said Righabh Nigam, secretary of Yamuna Expressway Entrepreneurs Association (YEEA).Yeida launched the scheme in 2013, with promises of offering plot possessions at the earliest. It had allotted 816 plots in Sector 32, located along the 165km Yamuna Expressway, at a rate of ₹5,500 per square meters. According to the scheme, the authority had allowed the allottees to pay half-yearly instalments for the plot cost, and charged 12% interest on the same.The authority has failed to develop roads, drains, water lines, electricity networks, and other utility services among others. It could not even hand over possession of the plots as the authority itself is yet to acquire patches of the land in Sector 32 from farmers, said the officials.“The farmers still perform agricultural activities on these land patches. It should either handover possession to the allottees, or waive off interest on the plot cost,” said Tejveer Rana, president of the YEEA.On July 23 this year, Yeida decided to waive off interest for two years -- from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020 -- after the allottees refused to pay the interest for the entire period. The authority said that they have developed all the basic civic amenities in some parts of the land, and the remaining land is being acquired. “We will soon acquire the remaining land and handover the possession to the people concerned,” said a Yeida official, requesting anonymity.Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Yeida, refused to comment on the issue as the matter is on trial in the Allahabad high court.
03-12-2021||Delhi||Frequent closures a logistical nightmare, say Delhi schools||With the Delhi government announcing the closure of schools on account of pollution once again, schools said they are now compelled to put their plans of full-fledged resumption of classes and various services on hold. The uncertainty surrounding in-person classes has also created logistical challenges, they said. Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 Delhi private schools as members, said abrupt and frequent closures were leading to a learning loss among children and also preventing schools from making any long-term plans. “We had just reopened after making so many arrangements and now schools have been asked to shut again. We are compelled to change the timetable every time such decisions are announced. All our planning has gone haywire. Teachers and students are confused since there is not much predictability. We don’t know whether we will be able to conduct final exams in schools or not,” said Acharya. She said parents were also under pressure since they had recently purchased new uniforms and made arrangements with private transportation services for ferrying their wards to school and back. The frequent closures have disrupted transport services, canteen and cafeteria functioning, and also the working of non-teaching staff. “Parents were arranging for carpool services and vans so that they could send children to school. Even uniforms were purchased. All that has been derailed. Working parents, especially, will have to reschedule their days now that schools are closed again,” said Acharya. Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School, Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, said the on and off nature of in-person classes was causing a lot of logistical challenges. He said the school employed several contractual employees and relieving them of duty time and again was inconvenient for both parties concerned. “We had called these employees back to work in the hopes that in-person classes would continue normally. Now, we will have to lay them off for some days at least. Their income is also affected,” said Sehgal. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, said repeated closure of schools was disappointing and sought a long-term solution since pollution spikes have become an annual phenomenon. “Policymakers must come together and deliberate on the rising pollution levels. Shutting schools is a symptomatic treatment. We need a strategic therapy for a long-term solution,” said Joshi. The school’s plans of starting the school bus service from Monday have been halted due to the closure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/frequent-closures-a-logistical-nightmare-say-delhi-schools-101638471711849.html
03-12-2021||Lucknow||Temples not an election issue for BJP: Maurya||PRAYAGRAJ: UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said on Thursday that temples and temple corridors were not election issues for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Reiterating his controversial statement made in a tweet on Wednesday wherein he spoke about construction of a grand temple in Mathura, Maurya said while a grand Ram temple was being constructed in Ayodhya and work was underway on the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi, wait was on for the construction of a temple at Krishna Janmabhoomi site in Mathura, believed by millions of Hindus as the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The temple site, a subject of multiple court cases, is located inside an Aurangzeb-era mosque in Mathura and shares its premises with a prominent Krishna temple. Maurya maintained that the allegations of polarization being levelled against him for his tweet were wrong. In an informal chat with media persons here where he laid the foundation stone for the construction of UP Public Service Commission’s residential campus in Rajapur, Maurya said, “I am a devotee of Lord Ram, Shiva and Krishna and have expressed my feelings as a devotee. Those who used to oppose Shri Ram temple continuously are now going to bow their heads on the doorsteps of Ramlalla. In the coming time, the same scene will be seen in Kashi and Mathura also.” On November 28, the Mathura district administration had imposed prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 following an announcement by the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha to install an idol of lord Krishna at the deity’s “actual birthplace”, which it claims is inside the mosque. After the foundation stone laying ceremony, Maurya left for Kaushambi where he held meetings with BJP office-bearers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/temples-not-an-election-issue-for-bjp-maurya-101638471462184.html
03-12-2021||Delhi||Work starts on Delhi’s first pet crematorium; to be ready by March||In about a year, Delhi will have two pet crematoria, managed by the municipal corporations of Delhi. The work orders have been issued for the facility being built by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in Dwarka’s Sector 29, official said on Thursday, while the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to build a facility and the corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel has included the project in the budgetary proposals for 2022-23. A senior veterinary department official from North corporation said the request has already been sent to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the land-owning agency, for allocation of land. “The primary goal is to ensure the scientific disposal of pet carcasses, especially those of dogs that are suspected to be rabid; the carcasses should not end up at landfill sites,” a north corporation official said, adding that the project will be taken up on pulic-private partnership (PPP) model, once the DDA approves the land.Meanwhile, after several plan revisions, the work order for the pet crematorium in Dwarka’s Sector 29 have finally been issued. Dr Ravindra Sharma, director of veterinary services, SDMC, said the project will be carried out on a PPP model and the private company has started site levelling and foundation work. “According to the final site plan, two furnaces with 150kg and 200kg capacity are being set up at the crematorium being built over a 700 square metre area. The 150kg unit will be used for pets while the 200kg furnace will be used for stray dogs,” he added. Sharma said the design of the crematorium incorporates wet scrubbers and air purifiers and the facility will be largely smokeless and eco-friendly.SDMC has fixed two slabs for dog cremations — ₹2,000 for a less than 30kg dog carcass and ₹3,000 for dogs weighing more than 30kg. “The cremation of a dog takes about 1 to 1.5 hours and there will be a cooling off period of 30 minutes,” the veterinary director said. The site plan also incorporates lockers for storage of ashes and also a prayer room.The south corporation has a four acre plot in Sector 29 where the civic body plans to set up a dog complex, apart from the crematorium. A sterilisation centre for dogs is currently operational. The site had become a point of controversy in April and May, when the city was faced its worst wave of Covid-19 yet and mortality rates shot up.The civic body had decided to create temporary pyre platforms there with a goal of expanding the daily cremation capacity. Ultimately, the site was never used for human cremations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-starts-on-delhi-s-first-pet-crematorium-to-be-ready-by-march-101638471343677.html
03-12-2021||Noida||Toll tax on Delhi-Meerut Expressway may start from next week, says NHAI||The collection of toll tax on the Delhi Meerut Expressway is likely to begin next week as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has taken up the process of calculating the toll tax after its toll fee notification was recently approved by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). The DME was thrown open to the public in April this year but no toll tax was being charged from commuters plying on the stretch. According to the NHAI, levying a toll tax on the expressway has the potential to fetch an annual turnover of about ₹111.39 crore with cars/jeeps/light motor vehicles accounting for about 82% of the traffic and bus/trucks and other heavy vehicles accounting for 14%. The 59.77km 14-lane DME has three phases — Phase 1 links Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate; Phase 2 connects UP Gate and Dasna and Phase 4 connects Dasna and Meerut. Phase 4 is a six-lane 32-km access-controlled alignment between Dasna and Meerut. “The toll fee notification has been approved by the ministry (MoRTH;) this also includes the method to calculate the rates. A gazette notification will be issued soon. Once we receive the gazette notification, the toll rates will be published,” said Arvind Kumar, project director of NHAI. “We are expecting to complete the process of finalising the toll rates in the next two to three days; the toll collection is likely to start from next week.The company selected for toll collection has been asked to ready its equipment for the trial run,” said Kumar. Earlier in August, the NHAI rolled out tentative toll rates for the expressway when it invited bids from interested agencies. According to the proposed rates, a car travelling the full length of the DME will have to shell out ₹140 as toll tax, which is about ₹2.33/ kilometre of the distance travelled. For the purpose of calculating the distance travelled, the NHAI has installed automatic number-plate readers (ANPRs) at all entry and exit points. The entry/exit points of the expressway are located at Akshardham, Indirapuram, near Dasna, near the interchange of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, near Bhojpur and near Partapur in Meerut. NHAI officials said that the toll tax will be determined by the distance travelled and the amount will get deducted from the FASTag system linked to the vehicle. In case of vehicles which don’t have FASTags, the authority will charge double the toll tax at the exit points. In February, the Union government had made it mandatory for all vehicles to be linked to the FASTag system, which enables a vehicle to pass through toll plazas without having to pay in cash and cut traffic queues. “No two-wheelers, three-wheelers or slow-moving vehicles will be allowed on the expressway lanes,” said an official from NHAI. The DME has three inner lanes on each side, which are dedicated expressway lanes. Four outer lanes on each side are dedicated highway lanes, where commuting will be toll free.
03-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools shut again after push from SC||Hours after the Supreme Court criticised the reopening of schools as pollution levels shot back up, the Delhi government ordered all educational institutes shut until further orders -- a move experts said will prolong the learning crisis wrought by Covid-19 while doing little for the health of children who are likely to be exposed to the same air at home.Also Read | SC pulls up Delhi govt for opening schools amid rising air pollution levelThe air quality index (AQI) shot up to the severely polluted category to reach 429 at 4pm on Thursday, as a thick smog hung in the air under overcast skies. The rapid deterioration prompted the top court to take a hard line during the hearing, when it set a 24-hour ultimatum for the Delhi and Union governments to act on pollution.“The schools had remained closed for a very long time and the decision to reopen them was made because pollution levels were decreasing in Delhi at that time. But as we can see right now, the pollution levels have started rising again. The government is constantly monitoring the situation. We have now decided to close the schools for all classes, once again from tomorrow (Friday),” environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday, shortly after the court hearing.The apex court on Thursday expressed its dissatisfaction with the measures to control high pollution levels.“We feel that nothing is happening and the pollution keeps increasing... only time is being wasted,” Chief Justice NV Ramana said during the hearing, giving the Centre 24 hours to come with a “creative” action plan.The court specifically criticised the Delhi government’s decision to reopen schools and said that “three-year-olds and four-year-olds are going to schools but adults are working from home”.Also Read | Frequent closures a logistical nightmare, say Delhi schoolsAbhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the Delhi government, said: “There are various reports on learning loss due to school closure during the pandemic and therefore, it was decided to reopen the schools with the option of online teaching. But if this court wants us to reconsider, we will do it.”To this, the judges said: “Don’t use our shoulders to fire shots. You are the government. You do your work. Who will sit at home when you open schools? You tell us about your decision tomorrow”.After the Covid-19 outbreak first hit India, schools in Delhi were closed on March 12, 2020. On January 18, 2021, schools were opened for classes 10 and 12, keeping practical work and board exam preparations in mind. On February 5, schools were reopened for the students of classes 9 and 11. The second wave of Covid-19 forced schools shut again from April 9. From September, reopening began in phases: with classes opening for 9-12 grades first, before the remaining were allowed to return to in-person attendance from November 1.Pollution then forced schools to shut again for 13 days.The month went on to record the worst air quality since, 2015, when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started maintaining pollution records.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said the frequent closure of schools was taking a toll on children, who were disappointed and perplexed by the abrupt closure. Joshi said relying too much on online classes will have long-term consequences for students.“Schooling is an important part of growing children’s life. Their childhood is getting affected due to the closure of schools. Schools are not a place for academics alone. The whole process of growing up and making friends, social and emotional interactions, has been affected. Adolescent children especially are getting affected. Their confidence is taking a toll. We can notice how students are becoming unsure of themselves,” said Joshi.The position was echoed by clinicians. “Children or adults are born to co-regulate. After staying at for home so long due to Covid, they were already tired. With the closure of schools once again, they are disenchanted. Children are craving a sense of normalcy. Their mood, appetite, attention space, and interaction are getting affected as they stay at home for long,” said Clinical psychologist Dr Seema Hingorani, describing what she said were mental health impacts of keeping children away from schools.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia clarified that even as schools shut, examinations for classes 10 and 12 will continue as before. “In view of pollution, all schools in Delhi will remain closed till further orders. However, the examinations related to the board will run as per the pre-determined schedule,” tweeted Sisodia on Thursday. Schools will also be allowed to conduct examinations for students in classes 9 and 11, school heads and officials in the education department said.On the directions of the Supreme Court, Delhi over the last one month has intermittently imposed a ban on the entry of trucks into the city, except those carrying essential items, banned construction activities and had also closed schools briefly.Currently, all of these restrictions have been reimposed.“For the past two months, we have been running an anti-dust campaign. All construction-demolition work is already suspended in Delhi, trucks from outside Delhi are also banned from entering Delhi,” Rai said.He added, “We have also started a special bus service to and from government offices so that people don’t have to take their private vehicles to come to work. The capacity of metros and buses has already been increased. I would appeal to everyone that they should use public transport and avoid using private vehicles as much as they can.”Experts said that Delhi cannot rely on emergency action and ignore pollution control measures year-round.“This season is proof that we need to concentrate more on comprehensive pollution control measures instead of only waking up when the pollution levels start worsening. Fire fighting can only help to a certain extent but unless emission from pollution sources is controlled throughout the year, you will not see any concrete difference,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).
03-12-2021||Delhi||Over 100 cases of child pornography registered, 50 held in Delhi in two days||The Delhi Police said on Thursday that it has registered over a 100 cases of child pornography, in the past couple of days, and arrested nearly 50 persons in connection with these cases, as part of a newly launched drive to tackle the crime, which is rampant on social media and the internet. Most of these cases were registered and persons arrested based on inputs received from a US-based agency that works on identifying missing and exploited children, police said. The cases were registered at the cyber police station created in each of the 15 police districts of Delhi. More registration of cases and arrests of suspects are likely in the coming days, senior police officers privy to the operation said.Deputy commissioner of police, intelligence fusion and strategic operations (IFSO) KPS Malhotra said the cases were registered and arrests made following preliminary investigations carried out by cyber experts posted with the IFSO. He said child pornographic contents on the internet were detected and the alleged offenders were identified with the help of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), a USA-based private organisation, which is working on such cyber crimes in coordination with India’s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).Malhotra said NCMEC works on cases of missing and exploited children and it had coordination with all the major social media platforms to trace such children. “The NCMEC also scans the contents of the internet to identify child exploitation videos, child pornographic contents, online enticements and contact offences,” said Malhotra.A contact offence is criminal offence such as rape, assault, or robbery in which there is a physical contact between the victim and perpetrater, police said.“The NCMEC reviews these reports and shares them with the appropriate law enforcement agency or the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force in the US. In addition to the information provided by the reporting party, NCMEC typically adds geo-location information (if appropriate) and cross-references identifying information such as email addresses, user names, or IP addresses with the existing Cyber Tipline Reports (a centralised reporting system in the US to flag instances of online exploitation of children). The details are shared with nodal agencies of the country concerned and further distributed to the state concerned,” he said.According to Malhotra, the Delhi Police also receives similar information from NCMEC. The inputs received in the recent past were developed by cyber experts posted in the IFSO stations. The IP addresses and other details of persons, who uploaded objectionable content related to child pornography, were collected and verified.“Once the crimes and the location of the offenders were confirmed, cases were registered at the cyber police station concerned and the suspects arrested. So far, 50 such suspects have been arrested. The number will increase in the coming days. We (Delhi Police) have a zero-tolerance policy against child exploitation and child pornography,” Malhotra said.
03-12-2021||Delhi||Price of ‘popular’ rapid PCR test slashed by ₹400 at Delhi airport, to cost ₹3,500||The cost of the rapid PCR test at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport has been reduced from ₹3,900 to ₹3,500, officials said on Thursday, adding that the price was slashed after finding that these tests had more takers as compared to the RT-PCR tests, which costs only ₹500. What makes these rapid PCR tests more popular is the rapid turnaround time, as its name suggests — a person gets a report within 45-60 minutes as opposed to the four-hour waiting time for an RT-PCR test report.Following the new guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on November 26, passengers from “high risk” countries — South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel and all European countries— are now required to take a Covid-19 test on their arrival at the airport, even if they are in possession of a negative test report, obtained within 72 hours prior to boarding, or are fully vaccinated. The heightened vigilance in the country is to keep at bay the Omicron variant of the Covid virus, which was declared a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO) recently.Also Read | Long queues at Delhi airport as checks to keep Omicron at bay kick inChetan Kohli, COO at Genestrings Diagnostic, which runs the Covid-19 testing facility at the Delhi airport, said almost 75% of all fliers from high-risk countries were opting for a rapid PCR test over the RT-PCR test, simply because of the reduced waiting time. “The decision to reduce the cost was a conscious one. We are not focusing on profits but to provide accessible testing to all fliers,” said Kohli.Genestrings says till 7pm Thursday, over 3,000 tests were conducted, while on Wednesday, the first day of the new guidelines, around 2,100 tests were conducted. “The data of positive cases will be shared directly with the Delhi government,” he added.Also Read | 4 more international travellers test Covid positive at Delhi airport: OfficialsRapid tests were launched at the Delhi airport in August 2021, at a starting cost of ₹4,500. Officials say over time, they have been able to reduce the cost of raw materials and testing kits. “As compared to the European market, these rates are fairly low. We have been able to optimize testing and reduce the price from the initial ₹4,500 to the present ₹3,500,” Kohli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/price-of-popular-rapid-pcr-test-slashed-by-400-at-delhi-airport-to-cost-3500-101638471114664.html

The conservation initiative at Nizamuddin bagged the Award of Excellence and Special Recognition for Sustainable Development Award. The conservation project is the only award-winning entry from India. Conservation efforts at Nizamuddin Basti are being undertaken by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture in partnership with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Archaeological Survey of India, Delhi Urban Heritage Foundation and the Dargah Committee and resident community groups of Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti since 2007. The conservation efforts include the restoration of over 20 historic monuments clustered around the 14th century mausoleum of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Stakeholders are also working towards the revival of local crafts and job creation. The citation of the award states that the jury applauded the Nizamuddin Basti project for its “outstanding achievement in placing heritage at the heart of the sustainable development agenda” and noted that “through an innovative People-Public-Private partnership model, the project overcame major socio-economic challenges and improved health, education and well-being, particularly for women and youth”. Ratish Nanda, CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture India, said that the trust had tried to demonstrate that conservation and development were interlinked through its work at Nizamuddin. “We have tried to leverage cultural assets for socio-economic development of the community. The monuments have been coupled with performance areas and water-harvesting facilities have been created near the baolis. Through our efforts, we have demonstrated that conservation and development go hand in hand and cultural assets can be used to improve quality of life,” said Nanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-nizamuddin-basti-conservation-project-wins-two-unesco-awards-101638471043659.html
03-12-2021||Noida||Uttar Pradesh issues fresh guidelines for claiming Covid death compensation||The Uttar Pradesh government late Wednesday issued a fresh set of guidelines stating that a compensation of ₹50,000 must be paid to the next of kin of each patient who died of Covid-19 in the state. According to the guidelines issued by additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, the scope of what constitutes a Covid-19 death has also been widened to include patients who died within 30 days of a positive Covid test or within 30 days of them being clinically ascertained to be Covid positive, both in-facility and outside. The guidelines also include patients who were in hospital/in-patient facility for a period of 30 days but died later, after being discharged. It also said if a death due to Covid is not indicated in the death certificate, it should not hinder the compensation process as documents such as the RT-PCR/rapid antigen test/clinical determination through investigation will be sufficient to make a successful claim. The district officials said the latest order, with a broadened scope to determine eligibility, will increase the number of applications from families claiming Covid deaths. The state’s directions came in the wake of a petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, a resident of Ghaziabad, before the Supreme Court. On October 4, the court passed an order making ex gratia payments mandatory. While passing the order, the a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said: “...it can be presumed either no wide publicity has been given by the concerned states or UTs with regard to the compensation offered for death of a person who had died due to Covid-19 or the concerned claimant is not made aware where to apply.”According to the state control room figures, Uttar Pradesh recorded 22,911 Covid deaths till November 30. These include 461 deaths in Ghaziabad and another 467 in Gautam Budh Nagar. According to the government’s submission to the Centre, the state received 3,071 applications for compensation, against the 22,898 deaths reported till November 26. It added that an amount of ₹541.5 lakh was disbursed as ex gratia to 1,083 families and the remaining claims are being processed.“The Supreme Court constituted a grievance committee on my petition. The purpose of the said committee is to provide a platform to those families who believe that their family member(s) died of Covid-19 but because one reason or the other, they could not get a Covid death certificate,” said Bansal. “If a family succeeds in its claims, then definitely the state’s tally of Covid deaths will increase,” he said. Officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said the latest guidelines is likely to increase the number of applications seeking ex gratia.  “We are expecting more people to apply for compensation as the scope of deaths has been broadened for awarding compensation. It is now up to the state officials whether they will correspondingly increase the official Covid death toll or not,” said Ravi Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance and revenue), Ghaziabad. However, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar Suhas LY said the guidelines may not impact the Covid death toll much. “The guidelines issued have a broader scope for the deaths but it seems that it is for the purpose of awarding compensation. It may not increase the overall death count as such,” he added. Health experts said there could be patients who died after testing negative for Covid-19. “If the guidelines have increased the scope of deaths, then there is every possibility that more applications will pour in. Further, there is no harm if the death count increases. If families of such patients get compensated after ascertainment of death due to Covid, such cases should be included in the death toll,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). 
03-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: MCD schools add over 150,000 students as enrolments jump||The number of students who enrolled in primary schools run by Delhi’s three municipal corporations witnessed a significant increase in the current academic year (2021-22). The data from the education departments of the three civic bodies shows that the enrolment figures in the 700 schools of North Delhi Municipal Corporation (North DMC) primary schools went from 267,000 in the last year to 341,000 in the current academic year. Similarly, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (EDMC) 354 schools witnessed an increase from 162,000 students to 225,000 while the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) numbers went up from 291,000 to 305,000 in 592 primary schools.Cumulatively, the number of primary school students enrolled in the 1,646 schools run by the three corporations has gone up from 720,000 in 2020-21 to 871,000 this year.Meanwhile, school closures and mergers in the last six years have led to the number of primary schools reducing from 719 to 700 under North DMC; 605 to 592 under SDMC; and 367 to 354 under EDMC, the official data shows.Municipal functionaries attribute the jump in numbers to the facilities being provided in the schools. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the schools provide students with free education, bags, dry ration as well as multiple subsidies. “We have also decided to start offering English medium education in all our schools based on the demands of the parents,” Aggarwal said, adding that the trans-Yamuna area comprises a large number of households from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Inderjeet Seharwat, leader of the House in SDMC, said special drives have been carried out by SDMC teachers to survey drop-outs and municipal schools have witnessed improvement in standards.In September, the Delhi government also reported a similar trend of a large number of students shifting from private schools to government schools. Around 240,000 students studying in various private schools applied for admission to government schools in the Capital and, over 160,000 students were admitted to government schools. According to data released by the directorate of education, 236,522 applications were received by about 1,030 government schools.To be sure, the rise in government school enrolment numbers is being observed all over India. Last month, Pratham’s annual status of education report (ASER) 2021 analysed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns on schooling in 25 states and union territories. ASER suggested a shift from private to government schools as enrolment in private schools decreased from 32.5% in 2018 to 24.4% in 2021.The private school association states that poor economic condition, free dry ration and closure of private primary schools led to this situation. RC Jain, president of Delhi State Public School Management Association, said that a large number of private primary and nursery schools closed down due to high building rentals, salaries and associated operational costs. “The paying capacity of parents has also reduced due to the pandemic. When the schools reopen, we will see a reverse migration,” he added.Khagesh Jha, an education activist, who heads the organisation Forum for Indian Parents, said that the main reason behind the rise in enrolment is that the families are no longer able to afford private school education and prefer the free alternative-- government schools. “There has been no improvement in the education being provided in these schools. The shift is taking place due to economic distress,” he said. Jha added that the enrolment data needs to be audited against the physical attendance of students when the schools reopen fully.

03-12-2021||Pune||Number of students in Pune’s civic schools dwindling||PUNE: While the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021 indicates that more students have enrolled in government schools vis-à-vis private schools during the pandemic, admissions to civic schools in Pune have continued to drop according to civic officials. In the past four years, the number of students in civic schools has dropped by 6,750.As per data from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) education department, the number of students studying across all classes in civic schools has gone down year after year. This is so despite the fact that Pune district’s zilla parishad (ZP) schools are seeing a rise in admission rates due to Covid-19.Despite being called ‘the Oxford of the east’, Pune city’s very own civic schools are not seeing a positive response from both students and parents in the city. As per data from the PMC education department, the strength of students has been decreasing year after year over the past four years. This is in contradiction with the rise in admissions in zilla parishad schools in the past three years, which rose from 233,977 in 2019 to 235,000 till July 16, 2021, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 19, 2021. The primary reason for this rise is the high school fees charged by private schools which feel even higher due to the financial hit taken by the middle class during the pandemic.Additional municipal commissioner Dnyaneshwar Molak who heads the education department, said, “It is true that admissions in government schools are rising as more parents are now preferring government schools mainly because of the constant calls by private schools to pay up fees and parents unable to afford the fees. Out of the 256 schools that the PMC runs, 51 are English medium schools since more parents now prefer education in the English medium. We also have one CBSE board school named after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at Parvati. We are also working on various strategies to attract more parents into enrolling their kids in PMC-run schools and also to upgrade our school’s education methods with the latest techniques.” ASER’s annual report has shown that more students are being enrolled in government schools owing to the high fees in private schools and the pandemic- and lockdown-induced inflation. However with regard to Pune city schools, the strength of students in civic schools continues to fall year after year. The Pune zilla parishad (ZP) has also seen a rise in the number of admissions however the civic-run schools in the city are yet to see any positive growth Overall strength of students in PMC schools2018 – 95,3852019 – 92,7422020- 90,4382021 – 88,635 *Source: PMC education department||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/number-of-students-in-pune-s-civic-schools-dwindling-101638470863380.html
03-12-2021||Delhi||MRP set for 428 liquor brands, govt tells Delhi HC||The Delhi government on Thursday informed the high court that it has registered 489 alcohol brands, of which it fixed the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for 428 till November 30.In a chart the Delhi government provided justice Rekha Palli with, it said that out of the 428 brands of alcohol with fixed MRPs, 300 were Indian brands and 128 were foreign.The document was provided to the court while it was hearing a plea by 16 retail liquor vendors, challenging the Delhi government’s decision to levy license fees from November 1, 2021.The petition sought that the collection of license fees be postponed till November 17, while contending that the MRPs had not yet been fixed.On the last date, the court had recorded the assurance of the Delhi government that it would not take any coercive action against the petitioners for non-payment of the license fees.The court had asked the Delhi government to give an updated chart on the registered brands.On Thursday, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that in the wake of the recent developments, the petitioners cannot be provided with interim protection throughout.The court agreed to the contention, however, since the chart was not on record, the judge posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday. It granted time to the petitioners to go through the chart submitted by the Delhi government.The petitioners, represented by advocate Sanjay Abbott and Tanmay Mehta, are successful bidders of L-7Z (zonal licence for retail vend of Indian liquor and foreign liquor) and L-7V (retail vend of Indian liquor, foreign liquor in a zone).The pleas sought to restrain the government from demanding the sums of money in the form of licence fees or security deposit and also to direct the authorities not to levy or demand licence fees from successful bidders until the government performs its own obligations under the tender terms and conditions and the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-2022.One of the pleas filed by the 16 retailers said there was a great delay in initiating the process of registration of brands and fixation of MRP by the Delhi government.It claimed that until October 30, not even a single brand had been registered within Delhi under the new excise policy, nor had the MRP been fixed for various liquor brands.It said the process for determination of MRP for retail sale is a time-consuming exercise and if the scheduled date of commencement of business is November 17, as specified by the government, it is a complete breach of obligations on the part of the authorities in delaying the registration of brands and determination of MRP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mrp-set-for-428-liquor-brands-govt-tells-delhi-hc-101638470804252.html

She also said the public should compel them to do the politics based on development and welfare instead of religion and community. Addressing the party’s ‘Pratigya Rally’ in Moradabad on Thursday, Priyanka tendered her apology for arriving at her ‘sasural’ ( in-laws’ home) after a long time. She welcomed all party leaders and guests after mentioning their names in her ‘sasural’. “ Mai aap sabhi ka apni sasural me swagat karti hu”, ( I welcome you all at my in-laws’ place) she said.

Police have recovered eight laptops, four mobile phones and two knives from the suspects-- Mohammad Uzair (23), and Mohammad Aman (22), both residents of Kiratpur in Bijnor.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said police had received complaints of mobile phones and laptops getting stolen from the areas falling under the jurisdiction of Sector 39 police station. “We registered cases and launched the investigation. We found that the modus operandi in each of the theft case was same. We scanned CCTV footage and found the suspects used to carry a bag on their shoulder to pretend as students. They used to check different rooms in the PGs and steal valuables,” said Singh.On Thursday, police received information about the movement of the suspects in Noida’s Sector 98 area. “A team from Sector 39 reached the spot and found two suspects riding a motorcycle. The police checked their bags and found the stolen mobile phones and laptops,” said Singh. The suspects had stolen the motorcycle, which they were riding, six months ago from New Delhi, said police. During the interrogation, the suspects revealed that sometimes they roamed in different sectors and societies and identified cars which had laptop bags inside. “They used to break the windows and steal laptops and valuables. They then sold the stolen valuables to people in their native village in Kiratpur. They also sold the valuables in Delhi,” said police. Singh said 18 cases of theft were registered against the suspects at different police stations in Noida. “Four other members of the gang are on the run. The two suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-men-arrested-for-stealing-mobile-phones-laptops-in-noida-101638470683842.html
03-12-2021||Delhi||Open, shut case: Umpteen closures widening learning gap, say Delhi schools||The repeated closure of schools is harming learning and adversely impacting the mental development of children, heads of schools in the national capital said on Thursday, after the state government’s latest closure order, which came after censure from the Supreme Court over Delhi’s hazardous air quality levels.Administrators pointed out that shutting schools was not a solution to Delhi’s prevailing pollution problem and that frequent closures had thrown schools into disarray, while leaving students and other stakeholder continually uncertain.Also Read | Delhi schools shut again after push from SCSudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said, “We need a sustainable solution to counter pollution. How can schools be closed on and off in line with the AQI levels,” said Acharya, who is principal of ITL Public School in Dwarka.Schools have been shut four separate times since March last year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice in less than three weeks because of the pollution. Experts have, however, repeatedly pointed that the pollution levels are as bad indoors as they are outside, if not worse. Schools were allowed to call all students for in-person classes starting November 1. They were then shut for a week on November 13, after the top court then pulled up authorities over the city’s air quality. Schools then reopened three days ago, on November 29 as pollution eased marginally.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that the frequent closure of schools was taking a toll on children, who were disappointed and perplexed by the repeated shutdowns. She said an “over-reliance” on online classes will have long-term consequences for children.“School is an important part of a growing child’s life. Their childhood is getting affected due to the closure of schools. Schools are not a place for academics alone. The whole process of growing up and making friends, social and emotional interactions, has been affected. Adolescent children especially are getting affected. Their confidence is taking a toll. We can notice how students are becoming unsure of themselves,” said Joshi.Manika Sharma, director of The Shri Ram Schools in Delhi-NCR, said that the uncertainty surrounding closures was taking a toll on children who were happy to be back in school after a long time.“The closure order is disappointing. It’s important for children to come to school and be with friends and teachers. For their mental health, it’s important that they mingle around. The school is taking care of them and following all protocols,” said Sharma.Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Private Unaided Schools, a consortium of more than 2000 schools across Delhi, said that children were gradually getting used to the routine of coming to school but the closure had put everyone on the back foot again. “The entire private school fraternity has been disturbed for two years. Everyone must come together to support children coming back to school,” said Arora.Dr Suneela Garg, professor in the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and member of the Lancet Commission on Covid-19-India, said, “It makes no sense to close schools at the moment for air-pollution. the air that the children breathe is the same at their home and at the schools. Yes, the children should not be allowed to play in the open when the pollution levels are high. But, they have already lost out on so much because of the Covid-related closures. Schools should remain open with social distancing, masking, and hand hygiene practises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/open-shut-case-umpteen-closures-widening-learning-gap-say-delhi-schools-101638470682588.html
03-12-2021||Delhi||Traffic disrupted as group of farmers headed to central Delhi is stopped at Mukarba Chowk||Traffic movement was disrupted for nearly an hour on one side of the road (towards Delhi) between Singhu border and Mukarba Chowk in outer Delhi on Thursday afternoon as the police placed barricades and stationed vehicles to stop around 70 farmers, including Nihangs (armed Sikh warriors), from moving towards central Delhi in their private vehicles.On being stopped, protesters told the police that they were headed to Gurdwara Bangla Sahib in New Delhi to pay tributes before leaving for their respective home towns. Since no prior permission was taken from the police for the journey en masse, the police refused to allow them passage, even for the purpose of visiting the gurdwara.A few senior police officers, including deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Brijendra Yadav, arrived at the spot and pacified the agitated farmers and Nihangs. When farmers insisted that they only wanted to visit the gurdwara and not hold any protest, senior officers put forward certain conditions that included travelling on buses arranged by the police and returning to the protest venue after paying tributes at the gurdwara, police officers present at the spot said.“They accepted our conditions, parked their vehicles on the roadside and boarded two buses arranged by us. Escorted by police, the buses reached Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, where farmers paid tributes and returned to the Singhu border protest venue on the same buses,” said DCP Yadav.Police said the group of 70, including Nihangs, women and children, managed to enter Delhi around 2pm, using alternative routes passing through Singhu village. Since they were in private vehicles and crossed the border in a scattered manner, the police personnel present at the border could not spot them. But as vehicles grouped on the main highway, a few personnel spotted Nihangs in a few vehicles and alerted senior officers.At Mukarba Chowk, about 10 kilometres from Singhu border, police placed multiple layers of barricades on the carriageway towards Delhi and stopped all vehicles. Due to the barricading, movement of vehicles was disrupted and as tailbacks lengthened, diversions were made through alternative routes. After nearly an hour, the barricades were removed and traffic restored, the police said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the protest against the now repealed farm laws, are continuing with their protest at Delhi’s borders demanding a legal guarantee for MSP (minimum support price) for crops and withdrawal of cases against farmers, among others. On Monday, Parliament passed the bill for repealing the three contentious farm law, 10 days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the laws will be taken back in the face of sustained protests, lasting for almost a year. President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday gave his assent to the Farm Laws Repeal Act 2021, effectively repealing the laws.When asked about Thursday’s incident, SKM leader Sarvan Singh Pandher said, “The SKM is unaware of any such movement to Delhi as they had not informed us about it. It seems that some farmers planned to visit the gurdwara to pay tributes for our successful agitation that forced the government to repeal the three farm laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traffic-disrupted-as-group-of-farmers-headed-to-central-delhi-is-stopped-at-mukarba-chowk-101638470625665.html
03-12-2021||Other||Krishna Janambhoomi-Shahi Eidgah issue: Mathura police on alert despite Hindu bodies calling off protests||The district administration and police are working to ensure foolproof security in and around the Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah in Mathura city area despite various Hindu organisations calling off their proposed protests in the region on December 6. Additional police force has been called from nearby districts to ensure enough security. The city area has been divided in different zones for better management, officials said. Organisations, including the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) had earlier given a call for ‘jalabhishek’ on December 6 at the birth place of Lord Krishna, that they claim is inside the Shahi Eidgah which shares its boundary with adjoining Sri Krishna Janambhoomi. ABHM president Rajyashri Chaudhari later withdrew the call and many others followed suit. “ABHM, Sri Krishna Janambhoomi Mukti Dal, Narayani Sena and Dev Murari Bapu have called off their proposed protests and marches on December 6 but we aren’t taking any chances. We have appealed to people outside Mathura to avoid visiting the city on December 6. No permission has been granted to any individual or organisations for protests. Prohibitory orders have been enforced and strict action would be taken against the violators,” said SSP Mathura Dr Gaurav Grover. “The city police will be assisted by PAC. The CRPF is deployed at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah. The city has been divided in eight sectors, 4 zones and 2 super zones for efficient monitoring. Police and its cyber cell are keeping an eye on social media and those spreading rumours are being warned to respect the sensitivity of issue,” the SSP said. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had tweeted on Wednesday that like Ayodhya and Kashi, preparations were underway for a grand temple in Mathura. Thakur Raghuraj Singh, a BJP leader in Aligarh supported Maurya. “The deputy CM is justified in his demand on ‘janambhoomi’ of Lord Krishna,” Singh said. 
03-12-2021||Noida||Police launch probe after journalist receives threats from terrorist outfit||Police have registered an FIR against unidentified persons after a journalist, Aditya Raj Kaul, allegedly received five threat mails from ISIS Kashmir last month. Kaul has been a journalist for over 13 years and worked with several prestigious organisations. He filed a complaint at Surajpur police station on November 24 and a case was registered on November 27. “Most of my reportage revolves around Kashmir and Pakistan-based terrorist organisations and their activities against Indian security forces and common people. I had widely reported on the recent killing of Hindu minority community in Kashmir and also non-local street vendors from Bihar and UP. I had also widely written on the successful visit of home minister Amit Shah to Kashmir,” Kaul said in his FIR. Talking to HT, Kaul said he received the first three threat emails on November 23 from isiskashmir@gmail.com and two more from an email id isiskashmir@yahoo.com on November 28. “I have been vocal for these issues on social media, due to which the suspects sent me these threat emails. They do not want me to write. These are the same kind of threat messages that BJP MP Gautam Gambhir recently received. The same email IDs have been used in both the cases,” he said. “We accept the responsibility for Pathankot blast. We will also target politicians and journalists in the upcoming elections in Kashmir,” reads one of the emails. In another email,the suspect warned Kaul--“Do anything but you are on our hit list, you can’t hide in Delhi for long.” The journalist said he has also informed Delhi police’s cyber cell about the issue. “The agencies investigating the matter informed me that the origin of these emails is Karachi in Pakistan. Noida police have provided me with a personal security officer,” he said.Deputy commissioner of police (intelligence fusion and strategic operations, IFSO) KPS Malhotra said, “We received a complaint and carried out the technical investigation, which traced the IP addresses of the concerned email IDs to Karachi. Further technical examination is being carried out by our teams to get some more breakthroughs.”Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said a case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “The cyber cell is investigating the matter. Primary investigation shows the IP addresses used in these emails are from outside India. We have scaled up security and patrolling outside the journalist’s house,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/police-launch-probe-after-journalist-receives-threats-from-terrorist-outfit-101638470442480.html
03-12-2021||Delhi||Ghazipur landfill bio-mining: Inert disposal to be carried out; rates fixed for transportation||The standing committee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) approved the proposal for the disposal of inert material generated by the bio-mining of Ghazipur landfill site on Thursday. As part of the ₹7,74 crore project, the inert material will be deposited in low-lying areas of Tughlaqabad, Mithapur, Maharani Bagh, and other designated sites, the proposal cleared by the committee states. The civic body also fixed the rates for transportation of the inert material. The proposal states that ₹10.8 per tonne per kilometre will be charged for a distance of 10-20km while ₹8.74 per tonne per kilometre will be charged for distance beyond 20 kilometres.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the agency will have to manage the loading, transportation as well as unloading of inert material, for which sites have been designated. “The disposal of inert material generated after the bio-mining process remains one of the key challenges. We will call for open tenders to find the lowest bidders for transporting inert material,” he remarked.Bio-mining through trommel machines separates various components of legacy waste such as plastic, paper, cloth, sand, bricks etc. Excavation and mining of old legacy waste is carried out and it is fed into the main trommel through a conveyor belt. The trommel consists of a cylindrical rotating sieve while air is blown from one end to the other. Heavy stuff like soil, stones fall closer through the cylindrical sieve while lighter components like plastic/paper fall at the farthest end. The various components of mixed waste can be separated based on varying size or sieves or holes in the trommel machine. A senior EDMC official said that the Ghazipur landfill site has about 140 lakh tonnes of legacy waste accumulated over past two decades and though the various constituent components of waste vary, the trommelling process leads to 65-70% inert material generation(90095 lakh tonnes). “Shortage of space for disposal of inert material has been a primary hurdle in execution of the landfill levelling project,” the official remarked.The EDMC project report states that National Highways Authority of India has agreed to take inert material for construction projects in Maharani Bagh near DND, Maharani Bagh to Jaitpur junction, Jaitpur to sectors 62-65 and Faridabad-Ballabhgarh bypass section of NH-148. “A communication has also been received from DDA to use inert at one of its Tughlaqabad site,” the report states. The proposal cleared on Thursday targets at clearing 2 lakh tonnes of inert material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghazipur-landfill-bio-mining-inert-disposal-to-be-carried-out-rates-fixed-for-transportation-101638470328263.html

Issue notices to respondent numbers 1, 2, 3,6 and 8 on all permissible modes, notice returnable on January 3, 2022,” read the court order by NGT.The residents of the society claim that the sarpanch and the panchayat of Maan village dump raw, untreated sewage, garbage, and on occasion, burn the collected garbage in the south side of the residential project.When the project was under construction, the home-buyers invested money for the green cover and clean environment. However, after the possession of the houses in 2019, the Maan panchayat has cut trees to make access roads to the open ground adjacent to the project where they dump garbage and sewage. A letter to that effect was written to MPCB and other respondents in 2020 but fell on deaf ears, according to the residents. The registrar of NGT had also issued letters to the respondents before the original application was registered at the tribunal before it was registered as a case. However, that letter also met with zero response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ngt-send-notice-to-maan-gram-panchayat-over-garbage-sewage-dumping-101638470326957.html

Deshmukh, who resigned later, has denied the charge.The inquiry commission looking into these allegations directed Singh to record his statement, but the IPS officer, who was virtually incommunicado since May, turned up only last week after the Supreme Court granted him relief from arrest.According to the home department official cited above, as the state does not have the power to dismiss any IPS officer, it will submit a detailed report to the central government along with an inquiry report for further action.“We will send a detailed report on the charges faced by him and the outcome of the investigation. The decision whether to recommend his dismissal will be taken at an appropriate time,” the official added.The order also said that during the suspension period, Singh should not leave his headquarter, the office of DG Home Guard, without permission of the state director general of police.Besides Singh, deputy commissioner of police Parag Manere was also suspended under similar charges. During the period of Manere’s suspension his headquarter will be Nagpur SP office and he will not be able to leave it sans permission. Singh was found guilty in a departmental inquiry by additional chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty for dereliction of duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-suspended-for-dereliction-of-duty-101638465041527.html
