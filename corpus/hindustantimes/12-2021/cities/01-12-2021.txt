01-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra health minister allays concerns over Omicron variant||Seeking to allay fears over the transmission of Omicron – the new variant of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, public health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said no confirmed case of the strain had been detected in the state so far. “In Maharashtra, there is not even one patient who has tested positive for Omicron,” Tope said on Wednesday. A resident of Dombivali, who had returned from South Africa, had tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, his swab samples have been sent for genetic sequencing to the genome sequencing laboratory in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC’s) Kasturba Hospital for analysis. The health minister said till the time that the report was not received, there was no cause for panic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not yet specified if the new strain is virulent and leads to a rise in hospitalizations. He, however, stressed on the need for Covid-appropriate behavior by the people. Maharashtra on Wednesday, recorded 767 new Covid-19 cases, marginally higher than 678 on the previous day. Wednesday also saw 28 deaths due to the virus, and the number of active cases stood at 7,391, with 74,812 people in home quarantine and 923 in institutional quarantine. “Experts from the Maharashtra Task Force (of doctors) got in touch with experts from South Africa. Their opinion is that the virulence factor, which leads to the patient needing hospitalization and oxygen support, was not present. The RT-PCR test can identify the Omicron strain. The WHO is, however, yet to express its opinion on whether the strain can escape vaccine (antibodies). This is expected to take a fortnight,” explained Tope. Issues like the need for the existing vaccines to be upgraded would be decided upon subsequently. Tope said local authorities in many urban areas had decided to reopen schools on 15 December. By then, the behavioral pattern of the new strain in countries across the world would be clear. The education department has allowed schools to reopen from Wednesday and some educational institutions in rural areas have begun functioning. The pediatric task force had said that the present outbreak was under control, which led to the public health and education departments decide on reopening schools after adhering to safety protocols. The minister added as per the updated protocols, international passengers who arrive in Maharashtra, will have to get a RT-PCR test done on arrival, and would be immediately hospitalized for treatment if found to be positive. Those traveling from the 11 high-risk nations will have to compulsorily quarantine themselves for a week either in hotels or in institutional facilities. They will have to undergo a RT-PCR test after seven days and will be allowed to go home if they test negative. The samples of those who test positive will be sent for genomic sequencing. The state government is also working on increasing the number of genetic sequencing laboratories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-health-minister-allays-concerns-over-omicron-variant-101638383176264.html
01-12-2021||Delhi||NDMC nod for multi-storey shopping centre and bus terminus near Shivaji Stadium||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has decided to set up a multilevel bus terminus and commercial complex near Shivaji Stadium, Connaught Place, as part of a ₹50 crore revamp project for the existing terminus there. Kuljeet Chahal, council member, said the decision was taken in a council meeting on Sunday. The Shivaji Stadium project will be a first of its kind in Delhi-NCR — one that will integrate commercial space with a large transportation hub and parking facility. “The multilevel bus terminal building will have a commercial space of more than 30,000 square feet. Our goal is to recover the initial input cost within the first three years of the project execution. The council plans to raise a revenue of ₹.5-3 crore a month from renting out the commercial space,” he said.He further said the capacity of the existing parking area will be doubled. “This will be a complete green project with installation of solar panels to sustain the power demand of the integrated facility. Currently, passengers are forced to stand in the open area and we have decided to create covered waiting areas with provision of drinking water and cafeteria,” he said. The whole complex will be differently-abled friendly and this prestigious space at the heart of the NDMC area will be showcased with international level facilities. A model of the integrated complex shows that the facility will have two basement levels for parking, a ground floor for the bus terminus and two upper floors for commercial space. Chahal said the parking area will be equipped with charging points for electric vehicles as well.An NDMC official said the transport hub will have seamless integration of public transport as well as bicycle sharing stations, autorickshaws and taxis. The council on Sunday also cleared the redevelopment and maintenance of Hanuman Vatika at Hanuman Mandir and the mechanised cleaning of Connaught Place corridors, prominent markets and business hub areas. Satish Upadhyay, NDMC vice-chairman, said the redevelopment of Hanuman Vatika is of great importance to devotees who visit the temple every week. “An aesthetic look, in keeping with the religious dignity of the area, was needed to make the temple a prominent religious place in New Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmcnod-for-multi-storey-shopping-centre-and-bus-terminus-near-shivaji-stadium-101638383118440.html

Yogi Adityanath, who was in Ayodhya to attend a function at Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vidyapeeth, also hit out at previous governments. “Back then, the governments used to be pseudo secular,” he said, adding that a misinformation campaign was carried out about the Vedas. “Facts were distorted,” he said, adding that the temple town has witnessed a long struggle of over 500 years.“From time to time, the temple city and all that it stood for were targeted, but Ayodhya never accepted injustice,” he added.

01-12-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad high court dismisses PIL against ‘sugam darshan’ in KV temple||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad High Court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) petition challenging the ‘sugam darshan’ system in Kashi Vishwanath Temple at Varanasi. Dismissing the PIL filed by one Gajendra Singh Yadav, a division bench comprising justices Manoj Misra and Sameer Jain observed,” Having considered the rival submissions and having noticed the statutory provisions, we are of the view that once the Board of Trustees are vested with the power to fix fees for the performance of any worship, service, rituals, ceremony or religious observance in the temple and in exercise of such power, they take a decision to provide a facility of ‘sugam darshan’ for those who, on account of their disability, be it physical or otherwise, cannot wait in a queue and, while taking such decision, they do not exclude the common class from exercising their right of worship or perform Puja as per religious practices. In our view, the decision of the Board of Trustees does not fall within the ambit of judicial review.” The petitioner had filed the present PIL with regard to the decision of the Board of Trustees to have a system of ‘sugam darshan’ (easy holy glimpse), which, according to the petitioner, violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth) 25 (Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) and 26 (Freedom to manage religious affairs) of the Constitution of India. It was further submitted by the petitioner that Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, is constituted under the provisions of UP Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983 (for short the1983, Act) had certain duties cast upon it by Section 14 of the 1983 Act. One such duty was to provide facilities for the proper performance of worship by the pilgrims and worshippers. It was the case of the petitioner that by providing a special facility of ‘sugam darshan’ on payment of certain charges, in effect, the Board of Trustees had excluded the common man from exercising his right of worship and performing necessary religious practices. However, while opposing the writ petition, it was submitted by state counsel that section 15 of the 1983 Act provided that the Board shall exercise all such powers, as are necessary for or incidental to the performance of its duties and functions under the Act and in particular shall have power to fix fees for the performance of any worship, service, ritual, ceremony or religious observance in the Temple. The court gave this decision on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-high-court-dismisses-pil-against-sugam-darshan-in-kv-temple-101638381915952.html
01-12-2021||Mumbai||No mandatory RT-PCR test for domestic flyers in Maha||Mumbai A day after the Maharashtra government issued orders for stricter air travel curbs to contain the spread of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that it has deferred the point mandating negative RT-PCR test 48 hours prior to entering Maharashtra for domestic travellers. This move came after the union health ministry asked Maharashtra to “align” its orders with the union government’s guidelines. The state government, however, is not going to scale down its orders, which includes seven-day institutional quarantine and compulsory RT-PCR for all international passengers. A letter dated December 1 from Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to the additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said that the state’s order was in “divergence” with the guidelines issued by the union health ministry.“At present, we have deferred the clause which mandated negative RT-PCR tests for domestic passengers. The necessary order will be issued in the immediate future. I don’t think there is any logic in keeping this clause...I think we have to fall in line with the Government of India’s guidelines,” Tope told HT.Maharashtra chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty, who signed the order on Tuesday, said that the Centre’s letter was an “advisory” and that the Centre’s guidelines can’t restrict the state from including additional conditions. Chakrabarty said that the Centre’s advisory would be “considered as would be required in the context of a specific situation in the state.”“We have received a letter from the union health secretary which is an advisory that says we should modify our orders in accordance with directions of the Government of India. It is an advisory but that does not prevent the state government to include certain conditions which may be necessary for the containment of the new variant. For now, we will continue with the guidelines which were issued yesterday,” Chakrabarty told HT. Senior bureaucrats said that Dr Vyas is expected to respond to the letter stating that the orders issued by the State were in accordance with the Centre’s guidelines. Meanwhile, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a circular on Wednesday said the Maharashtra government’s order making institutional quarantine of one week compulsory for all international passengers from risk countries landing in Mumbai, will be effective from 11.59 pm of December 2, 2021 (Thursday night). However, all international fliers will still have to undertake mandatory and self-paid RT-PCR tests at the airport upon arrival, effectively immediately, as per a separate order issued by the Government of India on November 30. BMC has decided to give a window of two days for all international fliers before implementing the state guidelines. In its circular on Wednesday, BMC said that since many fliers will have already finalised their plans of travel, maybe on the move, or might even be airborne and unaware of these guidelines, a window of two days shall be given to all passengers arriving in Mumbai from at-risk countries. This will avoid major inconveniences to passengers and also give them time to recast their travel plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-mandatory-rt-pcr-test-for-domestic-flyers-in-maha-101638381195942.html

The clarification came hours after the Centre wrote a letter to the state government. Speaking in Jalna, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, said, “The state has drafted its guidelines as per Centre’s notification. A fully-vaccinated local domestic passenger, who has taken both doses of vaccine, can travel without RT-PCR. However, those coming to India from high-risk countries and then taking connecting flights to travel within Maharashtra will have to undergo quarantine and also RT-PCR tests.” Tope said that as per the updated protocols, international passengers who arrive in Maharashtra will have to get an RT-PCR test on arrival, and would be immediately hospitalised for treatment if found to be positive. Those travelling from the 11 high-risk nations will have to compulsorily quarantine themselves for a week, either in hotels or in institutional facilities. They will have to undergo an RT-PCR test after seven days and will be allowed to go home if they test negative. The samples of those who test positive will be sent for genomic sequencing. Seeking to allay fears over the transmission of the Omicron variant, Tope said that no confirmed case of the strain had been detected in the state so far. Tope said that till the time they don’t receive the report of the genome sequence of the sample of the Dombivali man, threre was no cause for panic. However, he stressed the need for Covid-appropriate behaviour. Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 767 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, marginally higher than 678 on the previous day. Wednesday also saw 28 deaths due to the virus, and the number of active cases stood at 7,391, with 74,812 people in home quarantine and 923 in institutional quarantine. “Experts from the Maharashtra task force got in touch with experts from South Africa.

Several campaigns are being run to motivate people for taking the Covid vaccine jab.“People are coming on time for their second dose. This is increasing the vaccination coverage in the state capital,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, the chief medical officer of Lucknow.He also said, “Apart from running Covid vaccination centres till 10pm, mobile vans facilitate vaccination under the cluster model for those who are unable to move out of their homes.”“With a major chunk of the eligible population taking their second dose now, we can cross the 90% mark by January,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, association of international doctors.Lucknow tops all 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh and experts say vaccination coverage in the state capital is essential to check the spread of the Covid infection.“Lucknow has a major floating population that visits it for a day or two for some work and goes back. If all Lucknowites are vaccinated, they will remain safe and will not spread the infection,” said Dr PK Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/half-of-eligible-lucknowites-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-101638380355837.html

In fact, it will be the last session of the 17th assembly when the state government convenes the winter session of the state legislature later this month. The assembly polls are due early next year.“Yes, Uttar Pradesh assembly’s strength is set to come down to 403 at the end of the term of state assembly, if no steps are taken to extend the term of reservation for the Anglo-Indian community for another 10 years. The provision for reservation to the community ended on January 25, 2020 after 70 years,” said those aware of the development.The Uttar Pradesh assembly has a seat reserved for a nominated member of the Anglo-Indian community. Denzil Godin is the nominated member from the community in the state assembly and his term expires in 2022. The state assembly had on December 31, 2019 ratified the Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill 2019, providing for extension of reservation of seats to scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs) in the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies for a period of another 10 years, up to January 25, 2030.Godin said several all India associations of the Anglo-Indian community have petitioned the Prime Minister, the Union law minister and at various other levels of the Union government to reconsider the decision and extend reservation for the community for another 10 years.“We have met personally at various levels and hope the Union government will take a decision soon to extend the reservation in the interest of the nation,” said Godin.“The Constitution provided for reservation initially for 10 years only. It has been extended again and again up to now. Reservation is not the need of the community. The government may think for measures that help the community than giving reservation,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.The state assembly’s strength was 431 members before 1967. This included one nominated member of the Anglo-Indian community. The strength was later revised to 426 members, including a nominated Anglo-Indian community member. On November 9, 2000, the strength of the UP legislative assembly was reduced to 404, including one nominated Anglo-Indian member, following the creation of the new state of Uttarakhand from the undivided Uttar Pradesh.VOTE ON ACCOUNT MAY BE PASSED IN WINTER SESSION With the winter session of the state legislature, likely to be convened later this month, set to be the last one before the 2022 UP assembly elections, the state government proposes to get a vote on account for a part of the financial year 2022-2023 passed in the house. There are also indications that the state government may present the second supplementary demands of grants for 2021-2022 in the state legislature to make some populist announcements ahead of the polls. 
01-12-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav embarks on yatra in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday embarked on the fifth leg of his Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, where he asked people if they wanted a Yogi sarkar (Yogi government) or a Yogya sarkar (able government). “Those who cannot operate a laptop cannot give it to the young people either,” he said, apparently taking pot shots at chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Akhilesh Yadav was addressing a rally at Banda’s Government Inter College in Uttar Pradesh. “You are just getting assurances for the last four years and a half from the government for laptops. Now, when elections are approaching, they are promising laptops and tablets. He will not give them,” the former chief minister said. He also countered the dynastic jibe being thrown at him from time to time. Yadav alleged this government did not help people during the Covid lockdown and left them to fend for themselves. “We have families and know the pain of families. Those who do not have families, how can they relate to the pain of those with families?” he said. Trying to reach out to BEd, TET (Teachers’ Eligibility Test) and Shiksha Mitra aspirants, Akhilesh Yadav claimed the BJP government did nothing for them in more than four years. The government’s advertisements were all a lie, he claimed. They had promised that people wearing slippers would be able to undertake air travel, but the fact is farmers are not getting fertilizers on the ground, the Samajwadi Party chief alleged. “The farmers are spending days in the field to save their crops from stray cattle,” he further said, assuring the farmers that they would be given free irrigation if the SP was voted to power. He said the double engine government had failed in Bundelkhand where nothing was done since 2017. The people here supported the BJP in the general elections in 2014 and 2019 and the assembly elections of 2017, he said. All that happened, he pointed out, in the name of development was a change in the name of projects that the SP government had initiated for Bundelkhand. About 32 lakh people were below the poverty line in Bundelkhand, he said, adding this government has run bulldozers on the people who, in turn, will “bulldoze” the BJP government in this election. The region where the BJP has 19 assembly seats and four Lok Sabha seats has seen intense political activity in the past fortnight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed public meetings in Mahoba and Jhansi on November 19 and chief minister Yogi Adityanath made three visits. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has already visited the region twice for interaction with women in Chitrakoot and a big rally in Mahoba. Akhilesh Yadav would remain in Bundelkhand for three days in a bid to help his party regain the ground it lost in the region in 2017. In response to Akhilesh Yadav’s remarks, UP BJP secretary Chandramohan said, “A political party which has never looked beyond its family and caste, and whose political chief openly talks about love for Jinnah, can hardly be deemed trustworthy. Naturally, fearing rejection, the SP leadership appears to have lost the plot altogether. The 2022 UP polls would establish this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-embarks-on-yatra-in-bundelkhand-region-of-uttar-pradesh-101638379155478.html
01-12-2021||Lucknow||UPTET paper leak: Printing job given to Delhi firm in violation of norms: STF probe||LUCKNOW Investigations into the UP Teachers’ Eligibility Test-2021 (UPTET) question paper leak case revealed that the suspended secretary of Exam Regulatory Authority (ERA), UP, Sanjay Kumar Upadhyay, had given the job of printing question papers to a Delhi firm in violation of norms set for the purpose, said STF officials here on Wednesday.Upadhyay, a 1995 batch PCS officer, had overlooked four other printing firms to give the work order to Rai Anoop Prasad’s firm – RSM Finserv Ltd, Badarpur, New Delhi, said an official. He said Prasad’s firm did not fulfill security criteria required for printing question papers of an exam to be conducted on such a large scale. A total of 19,99,418 examinees were supposed to write the UPTET scheduled in two shifts at 2,736 centres across 75 districts of UP on Sunday, but the exam was cancelled after the paper leak.The official said that investigation clearly hinted that Upadhyay preferred Prasad’s firm for the job despite being aware that it was not suitable for the work. Serious lapses on the security front came to fore in printing of question papers, following which the examination process was compromised, he added. He said Upadhyay, who was arrested on Wednesday morning, had been taken to Gautam Buddh Nagar for initiation of further legal proceedings in connection with a case registered against him after the arrest of the printing firm director on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uptet-paper-leak-printing-job-given-to-delhi-firm-in-violation-of-norms-stf-probe-101638379035814.html

Incentives worth ₹11,000 will be provided to the ward, which has the best cleaning and decoration,” he said while reviewing preparations for the inauguration of the KV Corridor at a meeting with senior officials.

01-12-2021||Lucknow||UP deputy CM stirs Hindutva pot, hints at grand temple in Mathura||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya stirred the Hindutva pot in the poll-bound state on Wednesday as he tweeted that construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi was underway and Mathura would be next. Maurya is a close aide of former Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) chief late Ashok Singhal, who had led the Ayodhya agitation. His comments led to opposition parties accusing the BJP of playing polarization politics ahead of the 2022 UP polls. Mathura is part of western UP, where the BJP was expected to incur losses due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation and Maurya’s pinned tweet was seen as a deliberate attempt to queer the pitch. “Ayodhya aur Kashi mein bhavya mandir nirman jaari hai, Mathura ki taiyyari hai (Grand temples are being constructed in Ayodhya and Kashi and Mathura would be next),” Maurya said in his now viral tweet, which he signed off with three hashtags of Hindu deities: #Jaishri Ram, #Jai Shiv Shambhu, #Jai Shri Radhe Krishna. Maurya’s tweet coincided with right wing body Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) calling off its proposed programme to place an idol of Lord Krishna at Eidgah that borders the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple to offer ‘jalabhishek’ on December 6. Section 144, prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons, was already in place in Mathura. Eidgah, where Muslims offer prayers and Krishna Janmabhoomi are located side by side and Hindu organizations have filed various litigations in Mathura civil court, each of them claiming, that Eidgah was built on the land where Lord Krishna was born. When contacted, the deputy chief minister said the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya had made “Hindus and Ram bhakts happy.” He added: “During the time of the Ayodhya agitation, we would raise the slogan that Ayodhya is ours, now is the turn of Kashi and Mathura. The Kashi Vishwanath corridor has come up in Varanasi and naturally it would be the turn of Mathura next.” Maurya said: “With the blessings of the people, we are confident that the ancient glory of our grand heritage would be restored.” The Congress and the Samajwadi Party wasted no time in hitting back at the BJP. “The game plan is clear. A day before union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to western UP, a deliberate attempt has been made to polarise the society on religious lines. The BJP is back to Hindu-Muslim politics,” said Zishan Haider, spokesperson. Congress. Samajwadi Party spokesman IP Singh said the tweet showed that the BJP was feeling the heat. “They are losing and there could be no better confirmation,” he said. However, UP BJP leader Navin Srivastava defended Maurya. “There is nothing wrong in what Keshav ji said. We all should be proud of our heritage. Shame on these political parties who first tried to stall the construction of Ram temple and now are back to playing their favorite appeasement politics,” sai Srivastava.

01-12-2021||Lucknow||BSP leader says farm laws will be back after UP polls||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra on Wednesday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that the withdrawal of the three contentious farm laws was only till the UP polls. “These three farm laws would be reintroduced once the UP polls are over,” Satish Chandra Mishra said at a party workers’ meeting in Kaushambi district of Uttar Pradesh. He also used the occasion to appeal to the people to vote for Dashrath Lal Pasi, Neetu Kannaujia and Atul Dwivedi, the party candidates from the Khaga, Manjhanpur and the Chayal assembly constituencies. “More than 700 farmers lost their lives in the over a year-long agitation and this government and its party leaders kept on calling the farmers terrorists and criminals. To date, families of those 700 plus farmers have neither been given any compensation nor the deceased farmers’ kin been considered for jobs,” Mishra said.(The government has said there is no record of any farmer having died during the protests).The BSP leader claimed that contrary to expectations, the government at the Centre had no plans to enact a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for its produce.“No law is going to be enacted on MSP for if that happened the government won’t be able to loot the farmers,” he said.The BSP leader said Kaushambi district was formed when BSP chief Mayawati was in power and said that today the district has developed due to that decision by the BSP government.Claiming that Uttar Pradesh was most unsafe for women, the BSP leader also hit out at the opposition Samajwadi Party. Reacting to Mishra’s remarks, UP BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava said, “This is expected posturing from a frustrated opposition which has seen the writing on the wall and is thus getting desperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-leader-says-farm-laws-will-be-back-after-up-polls-101638377055099.html
01-12-2021||Patna||MLAs say ignored at events launching infra projects, CM trashes charge||Bihar Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday dismissed accusations made by opposition as well as ruling alliance legislators that local MLAs are often not invited at events where foundation stone for new projects are laid by the chief minister himself and that many of the projects launched in a bulk manner remain incomplete.“This perception is not correct. As a matter of rule, there are standing instructions to all departments from my side that wherever I, as chief minister, grace any event for foundation stone laying of new projects, all local MLAs, MPs and former MPs should be invited. In fact, I never attend any foundation stone laying events of new projects unless I am told that the tendering process of the proposed project has already been done to ensure such projects are completed on time,” Kumar said. The issue was raised by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA and former minister Nitish Mishra in a call attention motion in the state assembly. Mishra said that after 2020 assembly polls, local MLAs often are not being informed by rural works department about new road projects being launched under PMGSY( Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) and MMGSY(Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana) and at times, the local MLAs are not invited at foundation stone laying events of the department. Joining the debate, opposition legislators like Awadh Bihari Choudhary of the Rashtriya Janat Dal (RJD) and Vijay Shankar Dubey of Congress supported Mishra’s contention. “When these projects are launched in a bulk manner by the chief minister remain incomplete, people corner local legislators and they have to face the brunt,” they said. Mishra said that as a local MLA from Jhanjharpur, he had not been provided a list of roads being taken up under PMGSY for last many months and was not aware of how many projects were going on in his constituency. Rural works department minister Jayant Raj said he would provide the list of all such projects in various districts and constituencies to all MLAs within a week.Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary too assured the House that if there had been lapses in sharing of information, action would be initiated against erring officials. Opposition members, however, insisted the chief minister reply in the matter. “I heard some of the members, including some former ministers, raising this issue. I want to ask them what was the practice during their time. In my tenure, I have issued guidelines long back. But yes, if there is any discrepancy, inform us about it and we will look into it,” CM Kumar said.The chief minister also took potshots at the Nitish Mishra. “You yourself have remained a minister for long, but now you are raising questions. Why don’t you now share all things that happened in your time with the current rural works minister,” Kumar said, implying that there were many discrepancies during Mishra’s tenure as rural development minister.

With the concerns around Omicron leading to Centre revising its guidelines and putting in place stringent checking, the authorities have intensified their search.Some of these returnees were tested and none of the samples were found to be infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr B S Saitya said on Wednesday that in total, 150 people returned to Indore from abroad in the last one month."So far, we have traced 50 people, out of about 150 who have returned home in Indore from abroad during last one month. Samples of the 50 traced persons were tested and none of them were found to be infected with Covid-19," Drd Saitya was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We are searching for the remaining 100 people so that their samples can also be collected and tested," he added.Indore collector Manish Singh asked the industrial and business establishments in the district to ensure that all their employees get the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine within the stipulated period, failing which an FIR will be registered against the employers concerned under the Epidemic Diseases Act.Singh said the district administration is currently sealing such establishments, where the employees have not received a second dose of the vaccine in the stipulated time limit.According to officials, 30.82 lakh eligible people in Indore have received their first dose of the vaccine while 24.87 lakh of them have been administered both the jabs.

01-12-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: High court grants default bail to Sudha Bharadwaj; pleas of 8 others rejected||The Bombay high court on Wednesday granted default bail to activist Sudha Bharadwaj but rejected the applications of eight co-accused facing terrorism and conspiracy charges for allegedly fomenting violence in Bhima Koregaon village in 2018.This is the first time that a person accused in the high-profile case has been granted default bail, which can be given if a person is jailed for more than 90 days without a charge sheet. One of the other accused, poet Varavara Rao, is out on medical bail and a second accused, Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, died in July. All other 14 accused are in custody as undertrial prisoners. A division bench of justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said Bharadwaj filed her default bail application on November 26, 2018 -- before the expiry of the detention period cutoff on January 25, 2019 -- but her application was valid. The chargesheet was filed on February 21, 2019. “On the touchstone of the guarantee of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution, in our view, to deprive the applicant Sudha Bharadwaj of the indefeasible right on the premise that the application preferred on 26th November 2018 was premature, would be taking a too technical and formalistic view of the matter,” said the 120-page order. “In our view, all the requisite conditions to release the applicant Sudha Bharadwaj on default bail stood fully satisfied,” the judges added. The bench directed Bharadwaj, currently lodged in the Byculla women’s jail, be produced before the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on December 8 for deciding the conditions of her bail and date of release. It rejected NIA’s request for a stay on Bharadwaj’s bail for two weeks. But the court held that Bharadwaj’s co-accused -- Rao, Sudhir Dhawale, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen and Surendra Gadling -- didn’t qualify for automatic bail.At least 16 activists, lawyers and authors are facing charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for participating in alleged Maoist conspiracy to trigger violence on January 1, 2018 in Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra’s Pune district. The event, attended mostly by Dalit communities, marked the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war. The activists are accused of delivering inflammatory speeches during an event called Elgar Parishad organised in Pune on December 31, 2017. The activists have denied all charges and accused the prosecution of planting evidence. Bharadwaj, arguably the most prominent of the arrested activists, applied for default bail arguing that sessions judge K D Vadane, who granted Pune Police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018 to file the chargesheet, did not have jurisdiction to do so as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases.Her advocate, Yug Chaudhry, cited responses from the high court’s registry under the Right to Information Act to say that Vadane was not competent to hear matters under UAPA. He added Vadane was not even authorised as a special judge to take cognisance of the Pune Police’s supplementary charge sheet filed on February 21, 2019. Chaudhry cited a Supreme Court judgement that held only special courts can hear cases under the UAPA. The other applications argued that additional sessions judges of the Pune sessions court had not been designated as special judges and therefore, could not have taken cognisance of their case registered under UAPA. But the HC found that the other petitions were not filed before the chargesheet or supplementary chargesheet were submitted, and therefore could not be allowed. A default bail application under section 167 (2) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) can be filed when an investigating agency does not file a charge sheet within 90 days of arresting an accused. The 90-day period can be extended by a court if it feels that the prosecution deserves more time. But the HC found that the sessions judge was not authorised to do so under law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-high-court-grants-default-bail-to-sudha-bharadwaj-pleas-of-8-others-rejected-101638376575152.html
01-12-2021||Patna||HC asks CID to probe judge assault case||The Patna High Court on Wednesday asked the crime investigation department (CID) of Bihar Police to probe the case of alleged assault on a judge in Madhubani district by police officers last month and fixed the next hearing for December 8. Avinash Kumar, additional district judge (ADJ) at Jhanjharpur in Madhubani, was allegedly assaulted in his chamber by two policemen on November 18.Handing over the probe to CID, the HC directed the state government that there should not be any interference of Madhubani police in the investigation. During the hearing, state’s advocate general Lalit Kishore said, “If the court wants to get an inquiry conducted by the CBI or other agencies, it can be done.”As per the ADJ’s complaint, station house officer (SHO) of Ghoghardiha police station, Gopal Krishna, and sub-inspector Abhimanyu Kumar Sharma entered his chamber on November 18, abused and assaulted him and even pointed a pistol at him. Within hours of the incident, the HC took suo motu cognisance and Chief Justice Sanjay Karol set up a special division bench to hear the matter. Later, Krishna was removed from the post of SHO of Ghoghardiha police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hc-asks-cid-to-probe-judge-assault-case-101638376455154.html

Four patients’ eyes were removed at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital,” he said on Wednesday, adding that two more patients are admitted at the SKMCH.Sharma said he has sought the list of all patients operated upon at the eye hospital on November 22. “We will contact each of these patients to take stock of health status. We have also sought information about the doctors who performed the operations,” he said, while vowing stern action against those found guilty.Prima facie, the incident seems to have occurred owing to factors like poor sterilisation and hygiene, among others, he said. “Things would be clear after medical investigation (culture) report arrives,” he said.Preliminary investigation has revealed that as many as 65 patients underwent surgery at the hospital on November 22 itself.Muzaffarpur’s district magistrate Pranav Kumar said, “We have ordered to stop any more operations at the hospital. We will also recommend cancellation of its registration if any doctor is found guilty.”Dr Rajeev Kumar Singh, head of department of eye at the SKMCH, said the patients were critically afflicted with panophthalmitis (severe eye infections). “They all would be under our observation for next few days,” he said.Sanjay Kumar Sah, manager at the SKMCH, said 14 patients were admitted in the hospital with severe eye infection but three of them left the hospital against medical advice.One such patient, Jaitoon Khatoon, in her late 60s, said, “There isn’t any male member in my family to look after me. So, we had no other option but to leave the hospital.” Khatoon, a resident of Bhatauna Kani village in Muzaffarpur district and a daily wage earner, said the vision in her eye is gone.One of her relative, Maroon Khatoon, said she accompanied her to SKMCH where she was advised removal of her infected eye as the last option. “After that, she refused to stay there,” she said.Khatoon is not the lone case of this kind. HT came across patients who, despite suffering from severe eye infections, preferred not to undergo treatment for one reason or other. “It will cost me ₹ 600 again to visit a hospital at Muzaffarpur. Where will this money come from?” asked Jumarati Miyan.“Panophthalmitis can have potentially serious complications and can be fatal if left untreated,” said Dr Sumit Kumar, assistant professor at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) at Bettiah.Meanwhile, Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital wore a deserted look on Wednesday. “We have stopped entertaining patients even in our OPD,” said an employee.A four-member team constituted to probe the matter found that as many as 65 patients, mostly daily wage earners, had undergone surgery for cataract at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital on November 22.“We came about the camp through announcements made in our villages,” said Shahela Khatoon.owever, Rohit Kumar, grandson of Kaushlya Devi whose eye had to be removed, said, “Patients’ poor personal hygiene and ignorance of instruments sterilisation were quite obvious during the free camp.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muzaffarpur-nine-more-patients-eyes-removed-after-botched-cataract-surgery-101638376335070.html

Even as Banerjee remarked that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was almost non-existent, Sena and NCP said that all opposition parties must come together to mount a formidable front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A day after Banerjee met Sena MP Sanjay Raut, the latter said that the issues between the TMC and Congress were related to state politics and hinted that an opposition front without the Congress is unthinkable. “It is NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s opinion that everyone must come together,” he stated. Meanwhile, NCP leaders believe that Banerjee is trying to register her presence as an anti-Narendra Modi force and said that Congress’ inclusion is important as it is the only party with a pan-India presence.Talking about Banerjee being a one of the prominent leaders in the country along with Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar, Raut refused to comment on West Bengal’s state politics but pointed out that there is an issue. “The Left parties were decimated in West Bengal, the existence of Congress is no longer there and Mamata Didi got a historic victory against the BJP. Didi is originally from Congress. Definitely, there is an issue between the two parties but still, we think that if we have to fight against BJP, we have to move forward together,” Raut said.Over the years, the relationship between the Sena leadership and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has warmed up. A key part of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, Sena can’t afford to antagonise Congress as it has national aspirations. A senior Sena leader, requesting anonymity said, “We cannot overlook the fact that Congress is a party that is strong at the grassroots. It has chief ministers in three states. A front without the Congress is not possible.”A senior NCP leader under the conditions of anonymity said that out of 543 Lok Sabha seats, Congress is in direct contest with BJP on nearly 250 seats. “It means that without Congress, no such front would be a practical option. Unless there is a thought process going on under which Congress and third front are ready to contest on their own and a decision will be taken post polls. But it seems too far-fetched,” the leader added.Party national spokesperson Nawab Malik said that Mamata Banerjee is playing the role of a buffer for those who didn’t want to go with Congress, which will prevent them from allying with BJP. “Those who are not happy with Congress can join hands with her instead of going with BJP. In a way, she is stopping BJP from becoming more powerful. However, the NCP’s stand is very clear that no united front can be made without Congress,” Malik told HT.On speculation that the TMC chief is trying to establish her leadership among opposition parties, he said it is too early to say that. “This is just the beginning as we have a long way ahead. We see it as an attempt to unite anti-BJP parties,” the state minority affairs minister said.Meanwhile, Raut dubbed the central agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation, Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, and Narcotics Control Bureau, as BJP “karyakartas” which have “terrorised” states such as Maharashtra and West Bengal.“The BJP’s workers, including ED, CBI, I-T Department and NCB have terrorised the states and are trying to destabilise the functioning of the government. These BJP workers are doing similar work in West Bengal as well. West Bengal and Maharashtra will fight against the injustice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/united-front-without-congress-not-feasible-state-leaders-tell-mamata-101638373814832.html
01-12-2021||Patna||Will write to CM Nitish seeking state-specific caste census: Tejashwi||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday declared that he will write to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to press the demand for headcount of OBCs with the help of the state's own resources, since the Centre has slammed its doors shut on caste census.Yadav, who is the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, made a statement to the effect while talking to journalists outside the House, where the winter session is underway.“Union minister Nityanand Rai yesterday reiterated that the census schedule will not include castes other than the SCs and STs. So a state-specific exercise is the only option left before Bihar," he said.Admitting that the chief minister had acted on his request during the monsoon session, which resulted in an all-party delegation calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press the demand for caste census, Yadav alleged that Kumar has been, of late, dragging his feet.“The Centre had made its intentions clear long back. The CM said he would convene an all-party meeting to discuss modalities of conducting the survey on a state level after by-polls to a couple of assembly seats. Nearly a month has elapsed since the by-elections. There should not be procrastination," said the RJD leader.The OBCs have dominated politics in Bihar since the Mandal churn of the 1990s to which both Nitish Kumar, de facto leader of the JD(U), and Tejashwi's father Lalu Prasad, owe their rise.Unanimous resolutions have been passed by the state legislature twice in favour of a caste census, which, its champions believe, will pave way for better disbursement of social justice and welfare schemes.Yadav was also asked about the chief minister having taken exception, on the previous day, to his habit of posting on social media letters he wrote to the latter.“I always do so only after making sure that the letter has been received. What is wrong in this? This is just a way to ensure that moral pressure is on the CM to act quickly on a matter since it is in public domain," said the 32-year-old techno savvy leader.Referring to empty liquor bottles being found inside the legislature premises on Tuesday, Yadav said, “It proves what we have always said – prohibition in Bihar is a farce."“Once again complicity of the administrative machinery in illegal liquor business stands exposed. How else could these bottles have been smuggled into Bihar, in first place, from some other state? These must have crossed numerous checkpoints before reaching Patna and landing inside the premises," the former deputy CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/will-write-to-cm-nitish-seeking-state-specific-caste-census-tejashwi-101638372971303.html
01-12-2021||Mumbai||After unseasonal rains, Mumbai sees second coolest December day since 2010||The city woke up to unseasonal rains on Wednesday, due to a cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea and a trough passing below Kutch. Though showers did not bring relief from the high minimum temperatures, Mumbai at 24.8 degrees Celsius witnessed its second coolest December day since 2010. “A cyclonic circulation lies over the southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea, and a trough in lower levels runs from this cyclonic circulation to Kutch across North East Arabian Sea. The system is very likely to interact with an approaching western disturbance. Under the influence of these weather systems, a wet spell is expected over parts of Maharashtra in the next 24 hours with gradual reduction thereafter,” said an India Meteorological Department (IMD) official from the Regional Meteorological Centre, Mumbai. Throughout the day, on Wednesday (between 8.30am and 5.30pm), the IMD recorded 28.6mm rain at the Santacruz weather station, which is a representative of Mumbai, while it rained 27.6mm in south Mumbai. Humidity levels stood at 93% in south Mumbai and 96% in the suburbs. Rain during the early hours of Wednesday till 8.30am was 1.2mm at the Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai and 0.6 mm at Santacruz, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai. As a result of light showers and cloudy conditions, the maximum temperature in the suburbs dropped to 24.8 degrees Celsius (8.5 degree Celsius drop since Tuesday). The maximum temperature in Colaba was also 24.8 degrees Celsius, which was 7.4 degrees Celsius dip from the previous day. The minimum temperature in the suburbs was recorded at 23.8 degrees Celsius, while south Mumbai recorded 24.5 degrees Celsius. Rains in December are rare for the city. However, last year 0.7mm was recorded on December 11 due to the presence of a low-pressure weather system in the Arabian Sea. In 2019, 1.2 mm was recorded on December 5 due to a weather depression in the Arabian Sea. Between December 5 and 6, 2017, Mumbai suburbs recorded 53.8mm rain while south Mumbai recorded 82.2mm as Cyclone Ockhi went past the city. It was also the all-time high December rain for Mumbai. IMD has forecast light to moderate rain and thundershowers on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-unseasonal-rains-mumbai-sees-second-coolest-december-day-since-2010-101638372674998.html
01-12-2021||Mumbai||HC sets aside proclamation against Param Bir Singh’s co-accused extortion case||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday set aside the proclamation order published against Vinay Singh in connection with an extortion case filed at Goregaon police station against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and others, which was later transferred to the crime branch. The counsel for Vinay Singh argued that the November 17 proclamation order, declaring his client as an absconding accused, was not issued after following due procedure and the 30-day notice to appear before the court was also not published properly; hence the magistrate court order should be set aside and quashed. The single-judge bench of justice SK Shinde, while hearing the writ petition of Vinay Singh, was informed by advocate Aniket Nikam that after the sessions court had rejected the anticipatory bail application (ABA) of his client in September 2021, he had applied for the same in the HC in October 2021. A letter informing the senior inspector, crime branch unit 11 of Kandivli, about the same was also written. The petition of Vinay further states that even though an ABA was filed in HC, assistant police inspector of crime branch unit 11 and investigating officer Vishal Patil had moved an application for issuance of proclamation and attachments of Vinay’s property on November 17. The 37th additional metropolitan magistrate court without seeking an affidavit from Patil, to support his application, had issued the proclamation. Nikam argued that under section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) a person against whom a proclamation has to be issued, should be asked to appear in “not less than 30 days” however, the proclamation issued by the magistrate court said “within 30 days” which was not as per the stipulations of section 82, hence, the form of the proclamation was not valid and should be set aside. The court accepted the argument and held that the form, in which, the proclamation was published was not proper and hence set it aside. Special public prosecutor advocate Shekhar Jagtap for the state sought a stay on the operation of the order but was rejected and the petition was disposed of. The case relates to a complaint filed by Bimal Agarwal, a hotelier and civic contractor, based on which the Goregaon police had booked Param Bir Singh, along with Riyaz Bhati, Vinay Singh, Sumit Singh and Alpesh Patel, and dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-sets-aside-proclamation-against-param-bir-singh-s-co-accused-extortion-case-101638371354966.html

An RT-PCR test was done on the 32-year-old passenger at the Delhi airport after which he was allowed to board the flight to Mumbai. After arriving in Mumbai, he went to his house by hiring a private cab. Meanwhile, his sample tested positive for Covid.The authorities, then, began contract tracing of passengers a few rows around the seat of the infected passengers.“We received a list of 42 passengers who travelled with the 32-year-old who tested positive on November 24 at the Delhi airport. When we checked and traced the 42 passengers, we found that one of the co-passengers is also from Dombivli. We sent a team to his house and conducted an RT-PCR test of four members from the family including him,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.None of the four showed any symptoms, she added. “The report of the RT-PCR test is expected on Thursday.

Nahargarh Fort was visited by 366,000 tourists between April and November this year while Amer Fort had a footfall of 495,000 during the same period.The Rajasthan government has approached the Supreme Court against the NGT order to seek a stay. The Supreme Court, which took up the case on Wednesday, has put off the hearing to January.The closure of commercial activities at the two forts on Wednesday follows an order by Pradeep Kumar Gawande, director of Rajasthan’s archaeology and museums department a day earlier. Gawande’s order said the bar on commercial activities will continue till a decision on the special leave petition (SLP) filed in the Supreme Court is received.On October 4, NGT directed the government to shut all commercial activities in the notified forest area of Nahargarh wildlife sanctuary from December 1. The NGT order also directed the government to discontinue the light and sound programme in the area of wildlife sanctuary but has not prohibited parking of vehicles or entry of visitors to the forts.It, however, told the forest department to install noise barriers to mitigate noise generated by the vehicles. The area of Nahargarh Wildlife Sanctuary was notified in 1980 by the Rajasthan government – both monuments are located in the sanctuary area, and are maintained by the archeology department.Tour operator, Sanjay Kaushik said both sites are prominent monuments of Jaipur and such decisions will certainly affect tourism. The decision should be reconsidered as it adds to the state’s revenue and funds maintenance of the sites, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-stops-commercial-activities-at-nahargarh-and-amer-forts-101638364153833.html

According to senior officials of the BMC, there is no local fire station on the eastern side of Borivli and in case of a fire or related emergency, help would arrive from the nearby Dahisar and Kandivli fire stations. Vaqar Javeed, assistant municipal commissioner from R/Central (R/C) ward that covers the Borivli area shared that the responsibility of constructing the fire station was given to the Building Construction department, however, the local ward office took the charge from them for the same.“The land on which the fire station is being built was already reserved for this purpose; however, no action was taken throughout the years. It would have taken more time for the Building Construction department to construct the station, which is why the ward office went ahead and took the responsibility into its own hands. The buildings department had also handed over the allotted funds to us to expedite the process,” Javeed said.Meanwhile, a senior official from the fire brigade said that a dedicated fire station was absolutely a necessity in this area.“Fire station is the need of the hour here as help would reach fast in case of an emergency. This is one of the largest municipal wards in the city and several pockets in the eastern side are densely populated, including some slum areas,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-set-up-first-fire-station-in-borivli-east-101638364094157.html
01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Perils of making MSP a legal obligation||Farm leaders are demanding legal status for the minimum support price (MSP). It is a vexed policy issue and requires diligent handling. First, it must be recognised that the farm sector in 54 countries survives on 700 billion dollars subsidies, be it the US, UK, Europe, Japan, China, or any other country. China spends the largest amount, four times what the US provides to the farmers. The US, for example, has the 2021 farm sector budget amounting to more than 146.5 billion dollars and direct income support of 46.5 billion dollars to the farmers that are 1.5% of the population. In Covid years, the US disbursed 21.5 billion dollars to farmers in two rounds. We have some 60% population engaged in agriculture and we have more than four times the population of the US. Considering the geographical area, the US is three times larger than India. As to the financial resources, India is no match to the US or any other developed country. It is not, therefore, possible for India to be as liberal in providing subsidies to the farmers. In the same way, considering the human pressure on land, India cannot match developed countries. Yet, the need for subsidising the agriculture sector is paramount within the financial resources the country has. Subsidise through income support system What matters more is how the farm sector is subsidised. One way is to subsidise the inputs and provide higher prices than what the supply demand equilibrium would determine. The other approach is to subsidise through the income support system. The two approaches have different implications. Whereas the first approach distorts the market equilibrium, the second does not. For example, US farm crop prices have increased by only 25% from 1990 to 2019. Milk, beef, and pork prices have registered a marginal increase and have not changed much over three decades. The produce, therefore, is competitive in the international market, while the subsidies to the farmers have increased substantially under the income support system. This system has a charge on the budget, but farmers are compensated, and consumers do not suffer price instability because the prices are determined by supply and demand situation that gives perfect market clearance and production pattern automatically adjusts to the changing consumption pattern. In case of input subsidies and output pricing, the charge on the budget is the same. But only a small portion of farmers is benefited through higher use of subsidised inputs and higher prices of their larger marketable surplus. Small and marginal farmers are left high and dry. Neither input subsidies nor the higher product prices are the remedy for their financial problems. Farmers after all are not one homogeneous lot. There are marginal famers, owning less than one acre and some farmers cultivating hundreds of acres. When all farmers are lumped up, bigger farmers gain, and small and marginal farmers stand nowhere. Therefore, farmers should preferably be subsidised through income support system, focused more on marginal, small, and medium farmers. Thus, support to farmers, interests of consumers, and adjustment of production pattern with constantly changing consumption pattern must be met with the direct help to the farmer without distorting the market equilibrium that is beneficial to the consumers and makes the produce competitive in the international market. Assured market price/price support through MSP or any other manner should be replaced with income support to the farmers, letting the market clearance take place through the price determined by the supply demand situation. With respect to the MSP, the concept means the government standing in the market as a buyer of last resort. This is to make sure that the farmer does not go out of business due to a slump in the market. Legalising MSP suicidal for govt The mandate of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is that farmers get assured price, consumers’ interests are kept in view, and production pattern adjusts to the changing consumption pattern. This was necessitated when the country was deficit in foodgrains. Thus, the focus of the government was on increasing production of food grains with assured prices, procurement, and distribution through the public distribution system. Though MSP was announced for 22 crops, yet the government bought only the food grains through the Food Corporation of India, and some cotton for the government ginning mills through Cotton Corporation of India. The basic requirements being that when MSP should be higher than the market price, it should be procured by the government. Otherwise, the MSP carries no meaning. Except for wheat, rice, and cotton, and sometimes for coarse grains, MSPs were kept below the market prices; hence there was no procurement, and the MSP remained dysfunctional. In my opinion after providing direct income support to the farmers of the country, the government should enter the market as a competitive buyer to meet its distributional requirements and exports, if necessary. There is no point in declaring MSPs for so many commodities which the government does not and should not buy. If the MSP is made legal, what would the government do to dispose of the procured produce at a price higher than the market price? The government is not a trader after all. Legalising MSP will be suicidal for the government and will hit the interest of farmers and consumers. It will also not allow the diversification of crop patterns in the problem areas in Punjab and Haryana. The writer is a noted farm economist. Views expressed are personal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/perils-of-making-msp-a-legal-obligation-101638363913640.html
01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Talent in each one of us needs constant honing||I was at my maternal village of Butala not far from Amritsar the day its first hockey Olympian, Dilpreet Singh Bal, was offered a rousing reception as he arrived from Tokyo with a bronze medal. The following morning, Balwinder Singh Bal, his father, took me along to Dilpreet’s school in the village, where he was invited as chief guest in the morning assembly. We witnessed another warm welcome for the Olympian with excitement and pride among students and staff. It was inspiring to listen to Dilpreet addressing the gathering, sharing how his dreams took birth and how he pursued them, besides his memories from the classroom to the school grounds. It was followed by thought-provoking speeches by the principal and other staff members. They ardently talked about valuing one’s talent and dreams. That memorable morning landed in my mind as I sat by the window, leading me to indulge in a monologue, beginning and concluding with tales of talent. It’s a universal fact that each one of us is blessed with a unique talent, often hidden deep inside. Some discover it, others don’t, but just discovering or unearthing it isn’t enough for talent needs constant honing. Most essentially, we should have the discipline for it. American author Jim Rohn frequently termed discipline as the bridge between goals and accomplishment. There is, however, one crucial stage, where unfortunately many give up. A stage where we have to fight for our dreams, and at times it begins from home itself, with our family members raising doubts about our chosen path. We are constantly questioned but if we have a strong self-belief in our dreams and ourselves, we can never be affected by the pressures around us. Self-belief keeps us connected to our passion. The ability to handle constant rejections is another test and it seems to me that wherever we are being tested, in any form – our dreams are somewhere watching us, taking cognizance of how strong or weak we are for them. I’m reminded of American novelist Erica Jong’s words, “Everyone has talent. What’s rare is the courage to follow it to the dark places, where it leads.” And one day, it is these dark places, where we are rigorously tested, that lead us to the most happening light of our lives. Giving up for whatever reason, be it ‘my elders wanted me to pursue something else’ as many sadly share, we end up blaming and remain filled with regret throughout life’s journey. In other words, we become victim and not what we could have been. When we stay glued to our talent, life turns so interesting and meaningful; from ordinary it becomes extraordinary as the Japanese book, Ikigai: The Secret To Long And Happy Life, also explains. In fact, its title Ikigai also means finding a talent in oneself to make life fascinating. Once we have found our talent, we plant Ikigai in our lives and it always gives us more than our expectations. I am experiencing my Ikigai through writing and I absolutely adore it. Despite rejections at times, I keep going on to stay connected with my Ikigai because its presence in life matters greatly. rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor

01-12-2021||Mumbai||Make drugs for HIV opportunistic infections widely available: Activists||The lack of essential medicines required for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections is causing a lot of suffering among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients. This issue has been raised by a group of experts, patient-activists and organisations in a letter sent to the Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) on World AIDS Day on Wednesday. HIV attacks the immune system. Its chronic and advanced stage is known as AIDS. Due to the suppressed immunity of the infected patients, they become vulnerable to catching other bacterial, viral and fungal infections. For instance, tuberculosis (TB) is the commonest opportunistic infection among HIV/AIDS patients. Other common infections include pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) that causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, cryptococcal meningitis, a painful fungal infection of the brain, cytomegalovirus (CMV) that commonly infects the gastrointestinal tract, toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that causes muscle pain and fever among other infections. “There is a range of medications indicated for HIV/AIDS patients in order to keep these opportunistic infections at bay, boost the immune system and reduce the side effects of existing medications,” said activist Ganesh Acharya, who is one of the 24 signatories to the letter sent to the government. “But many of these drugs are unavailable or irregularly available in the public sector. For instance, fluconazole, a common and cheap medication to treat fungal infections are never available in centres. Another important medication known as pyridoxine recommended for HIV patients to tackle the vitamin B6 deficiency is always unavailable,” he said. According to Acharya, despite the revised National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) IV emphasising the management of opportunistic infections, most centres delay prescribing these medicines. He cited a case of a 50-year-old Thane resident who was diagnosed and registered in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in Mumbai but was never prescribed any of the preventive drugs despite his CD4 cell count being below 200. CD4 cells are white blood cells that fight infection in the body. A low CD4 count is an indication to put HIV patients on preventive therapies as they are bound to catch opportunistic infections. “Many of these patients are already malnourished, and their nutritive intake does not match the level required to combat the impact of medications they take,” said Elizabeth Selhore, co-founder of Pune-based no-profit Sahara that works in the field of drug use and HIV/AIDS. “Preventive therapies and drugs to tackle the opportunistic infections are therefore crucial for their survival and good health,” she said adding that some of the common drugs that were earlier available under the NACP are not given anymore. In their letter, the activists and organisations have urged that the drugs should be procured centrally by the NACO for better availability. “Even today, in the era of antiretroviral therapy, we are losing people living with HIV to AIDS-related illnesses such as TB, pneumocystis pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV, and toxoplasmosis,” said the letter. “We are concerned that people living with HIV in India currently do not have access to the complete package of screening tests, prophylaxis and treatments needed to reduce deaths due to advanced HIV disease,” it added. Mumbai-based infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar (not a signatory) said that opportunistic infections become life-threatening for HIV/AIDS patients. “The sooner the treatment for such infections is started, the better for patients to cope,” said Dr Nagvekar adding that the number of HIV cases has come down over the years only because the ART treatment is started soon as a person tests positive, unlike earlier when ART was started only after the CD4 count reached a certain level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/make-drugs-for-hiv-opportunistic-infections-widely-available-activists-101638362894097.html

As per the complaint, a hawker approached the girl’s mother at her residence to sell a plastic bucket in exchange for old clothes or old mobile phones. When the mother proceeded to her room, the hawker followed her and pressed a chloroform-laced cloth on her mouth, due to which, the mother lost her consciousness, said a police officer. The woman hawker then picked up the baby girl, who was sleeping at the time, and fled from the house, the officer added.

01-12-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: When Shaniwarwada screamed “Uncle save me”||The 18th century will be remembered in history as century of Maratha confederacy where almost two third of Hindostan was under direct or indirect control of Marathas. During ascendancy of Madhavrao, the Peshwa treasury was debt ridden and losses during Panipat had weakened and depleted the army and military resources. Madhavrao I, the young Peshwa, in no time enforced strict discipline and accountability in management of the state affairs. The corrupt and non-performing officers were reprimanded and punished if the performance was poor. Madhavrao I himself was a man of great character and did not overindulge in luxuries offered by his Peshwa position. He was pious at heart, ardent Ganesha worshipper and spent his time in charity and prayers. His strict and ethical behaviour was feared by many, especially the servants at Shaniwarwada! He made sure that the revenue collection was maximised and efficient through stricter administrative control. It was ensured that the revenue was channelised for activities related to people’s welfare. Military powers were further strengthened by addition of ungraded artillery and recruitment of able cavalry. His strategic vision and command of various Maratha sardars such as Patwardhans, Phadke, Pethe, Panse and Holkars Scindia and Gaikwead led to massive expansion of Maratha territory and gain of new territory beyond Panipat. Madhavrao found a great ally in Ram Shastri Prabhine who was apex judge of Maratha empire. Ramshastri hailed from a small village of Mahuli in Satara and had humble beginning. During childhood as he worked as “water-carrier boy” at a Brahmin’s household, he was insulted for coveting the “Bhikbali” ear ornament of head of the house. Enraged with the insult and embarassment, Ramshastri decided to seek the highest scholarship which would gain him recognition in society. He went on to study at Kashi in the North and within no time achieved the great scholarship through learning of Vedas and Dharmashastras. His talent was recognised by Nanasaheb Peshwa in 1751 and quickly rose to the post of judge by 1759 through display of intellect, unimpeachable character and wisdom in granting justice. When appointed to the post of chief justice, he had taken written assurance from Nana Phadnavis (finance and home minister for Peshwas) and Sakharam Bapu Bokil (a senior minister and diplomat) that there would be no interference from then in running of judiciary affairs. He had, at times, reminded young Madhavrao Peshwa of his responsibility towards welfare of people and state affairs. His integrity and scrupulous conduct established hold over ailing Maratha judiciary system, bringing respite to masses. Raghunathrao Peshwa, younger brother of Nanasaheb and uncle of Madhavrao, was appointed as regent when Madhavrao was appointed to hold Peshwa office. Raghobadada was a great commander who proved his mantle during Nanasaheb’s reign and had achieved astonishing success. His ambitions of higher power and authority were, however, squashed with Madhavrao’s appointment. Thus, since early days of Madhavrao’s tenure, Raghobadada’s distrustful actions during military campaigns of Marathas turned out to be in direct conflict with Madhavrao’s plans. Raghobadada’s men waged war in Maratha territories and started harassing and looting masses. Madhavrao attempted making peace with uncle Raghunathrao, but was betrayed and defeated by treacherous tactics of Raghobadada. Raghobadada made Sakharam Bapu Bokil his ally and started influencing decision of Peshwa courts. Angered with the repeated attempts of Raghobadada to overthrow and murder him, Madhavrao finally waged a war against him and put him under house arrest at Shaniwarwada on June 10, 1768 along with Sakharam Bapu. Madhavrao Peshwa later led a united front of Maratha Sardars to north and employed clever diplomatic tactics to finally resurrect the Maratha empire by establishing hold over Delhi. However, Madhavrao was infected with tuberculosis around 1770s and within two years, it brought an unfortunate end of young Peshwa. Nearing his end, Madhavrao released Raghobadada and made him take vow in front of Peshwa family deities to protect and look after younger brother Narayanrao Peshwa. Seventeen-year-old, Narayanrao (younger brother of Madhavrao and third son of Nanasaheb) was appointed as next Peshwa and once again, the Peshwa position eluded Raghoba. Released from prison and appointed as regent, Raghobadada’s ambitions could not be satiated and he began plotting against naive Narayanrao. Narayanrao in his time tried emulating his brother Madhavrao, adopted stringent measures against uncle Raghunathrao and put him under informal house arrest at Shaniwarwada. This further infuriated Raghobadada whose rebellious and intentions knew no bounds. Naive Narayanrao, however, was unaware of conspiracy Raghobadada had been hatching with aid of Sumer Singh Gardi. Sumersingh was promised charge of three forts and 10 lakh rupees in return of catching the young Peshwa. On the fateful day of August 30, 1773, ten-month-old Peshwa, visited Parvati hill as part of his daily ritual and stopped by maternal uncle’s mansion Sardar Raste to discuss administrative affairs. Planning to solve payment related disputes after the lunch, Narayanrao went to Shaniwarwada to have food and quick nap. Sumer Singh and Muhammad Isaf made their way to Peshwa’s private chambers, killing the servants and placing their own soldiers in the chambers. Hearing commotion, Narayanrao woke up and on enquiry, his servant informed him of the squirmish outside. Narayanrao went first to Parvatibai who advised him to hide. But, Narayanrao wishing to defend himself, started making his way towards Devghar where Raghunathrao was performing prayers. He sought refuge with uncle and pleaded “ Uncle save me, Uncle, save me!” Raghobadada took pity on him and asked Sumer Singh to spare his life and capture him. But Sumer Singh refuse to follow his order point blank, fearing punishment and killed young Peshwa, ruthlessly. The legend goes that the content of letter send to Sumer Singh had been modified from “capturing Peshwa” to “killing Peshwa”! Legends blame this act on Anandibai, wife of Raghoba, who exercised great control over Raghoba. This horrific act at the heart of royal mansion, Shaniwarwada, send chills all across entire Maratha empire. It is said that Narayanrao’s dead body was cut into pieces and cremated on the river bank. Raghunathrao tried to take over the power, but Chhatrapati refused to acknowledge his claim. It was the band of able ministers, “Barbhai” under leadership of Nana Phadnavis who saw that the perpetrators were punished and their properties were confiscated. The chief justice, Ramshastri Prabhune passed the most crucial judgement of punishing this heinous act with death sentence to Raghunathrao Peshwa and those involved. Raghunathrao fled Pune, was captured by “Barbhai” and kept under house arrest along with his wife Anandibai till his last days. This horrific incidence casted a long shadow on future of Maratha empire leading to political debacles on top positions within empire. The city lore claims that the Narayanrao’s ghost wanders the ruins of Shaniwarwada to present day calling out “Uncle, save me!” Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

CBI had arrested Jagtap from his residence on October 31, 2021 following Rashmi Shukla’s report of August 26, 2020, named Jagtap as one of the middlemen who helped secure cream postings for senior police officials by bribing two political heavy weights including Anil Deshmukh. The transfer and postings case is a strand of the main case of extortion, registered against the former minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader.It was also revealed that Jagtap’s phone was tapped to gather information on the alleged transfers and postings racket. His advocate Jatin Shah alleged the phone tapping by the State Intelligence Department was illegal citing it as a ground for grant of bail among other arguments. He also claimed absence of any material before court suggesting Jagtap had played any role in the alleged scam.Shah said the tapping was illegal and violative of Jagtap’s right to privacy and cited a March 2021 report by Sitaram Kunte, the then Maharashtra chief secretary, to claim that the surveillance was not authorised and therefore needed to be kept out of consideration by the court. The CBI opposed his bail application saying the case was at an important stage of investigation.Also Read: OPS-EPS duo amends AIADMK bylaws to shut doors on VK Sasikala The special court, however, refused to enter into the controversy over phone tapping. “In my view, this court, while deciding the application for bail cannot venture to determine whether the order of the State Intelligence Department, Government of Maharashtra was ultra vires of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and violated the fundamental rights of the applicant,” special judge D P Shingade said, steering clear of the matter while granting bail to Jagtap. The court ordered the 45-year-old businessman to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of ₹50,000 and one or two sureties in the same amount. CBI registered the case on April 21 after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh, who was then the home minister of Maharashtra, of instructing Mumbai police officers, including dismissed officer Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore from various bars in Mumbai as extortion money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/transfers-scam-jagtap-gets-bail-court-stays-clear-of-phone-tapping-legality-101638352692910.html

In this journey, approval has been received for Phase-1 of 'Gorakhpur Metrolight Rail Project' in the meeting of Public Investment Board (PIB). Greetings to all! And hearty thanks to respected Prime Minister,” Adityanath posted on Koo.The Uttar Pradesh government is constructing the metrolite in three cities - Gorakhpur, Prayagraj and Meerut. The detailed project report was approved and sent to the Centre in the month of September.The state government wants to run metro services in these cities to improve connectivity. But due to lower ridership projection, the authorities decided to go for metrolite which will act as a feeder service.The metrolite system has lower passenger capacity but costs less than a metro line. The metrolite trains, however, do have a dedicated track built at the ground level and separated from the roads either with fence or walls.It is usually compared to an upgraded version of the tram system. Subways or overhead bridges are used to commute from one platform to another.Meerut met the required parametres for a proper metro train but the project was halted due to Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) which will connect the city to national capital Delhi. The UP government has prepared a revised DPR for metrolite in Meerut.The metrolite system has an automated ticketing system (like the regular metro) and ticket checkers are deployed at stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gorakhpur-metrolite-phase-1-project-gets-pib-approval-yogi-adityanath-101638349072269.html

I had already served for six years as a chief minister and I told him that we don’t want any of our MLAs and MLCs as ministers in the government. I told him that we will support you unconditionally, but please don’t bring them (BJP) here (in J&K),” Abdullah was quoted as speaking at a public gathering by news agency ANI.Quoting a famous couplet to take a jibe at Sayeed, the National Conference leaders said, “He (Mufti Mohammad Sayeed), however, might have had some compulsions at that time. ‘Lamhon ne khata ki, sadiyon ne saza paayi.’  Now, we do not know for how long we will be punished for that one wrong decision because not even a single promise made to us post-revocation of Article 370 has been fulfilled,” Omar said at a gathering in Kishtwar.The former chief minister said he feared the BJP would “advantage” of weaknesses of political parties in Kashmir. “They (BJP) took advantage of our weakness and I knew it. That’s why I offered my hand of friendship to late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed sahib. Soon after 2014 assembly elections, I had cautioned him that the path being chosen by him (exploring possibilities of forming a coalition government with the BJP) would be very dangerous for Kashmir and we may not survive by this decision of yours.”Abdullah claimed that had the the National Conference have come to power in the previous assembly elections, there would have been no revocation of the special status granted to Kashmir and no land allotted under the Roshni Act would have been taken back and no jobs would have gone to the outsiders.In the 2014 assembly elections, the PDP had won 28 seats while th BJP got 25 seats, the NC 15 and the Congress 12.On February 27, 2015, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sealed an alliance between the PDP and the BJP to form a coalition government.On March 1, 2015, Sayeed took oath as the chief minister of the PDP-BJP combine in a ceremony that was attended by PM Modi and other leaders.However, on June 19, 2018, the three-year-old coalition government collapsed after the BJP pulled out of the alliance over worsening security scenario and bitter political feuds between the two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/omar-abdullah-blames-mufti-mohammad-sayeed-for-abrogation-of-article-370-in-jk-101638337498221.html

And nurseries in Delhi-NCR are reporting an increase in their sales amid the pollution rampant in the Capital. Repunjai Saini, owner, Priya Nursery near India Gate, says the market is now seeing new buyers of such plants. “The AQI got fairly better in between, but it went back to severe. People want to be prepared and are buying such plants anticipating the smoggy days ahead. There is a definite increase in demand but prices have not risen,” he says. “Bahut log aise plants le rahein hain. Sansevieria khareedne aa rahe hain bahut log. Pura din hum air purifying plants dikhate hi rehte hain. Itna pollution jo ho gaya hai,” says Mosim Khan, from Masjid Nursery, Pandara Road. Echoing similar sentiments, Nidhant Dahiya, owner of Osho Vatika Nursery, Sector 13, Gurugram, says, “Ficus tree is a popular option, besides areca palms and peace lily that remain favourites.” For residents such as Simi Arora, the plants are a great add-on for the interiors. “My son got air purifying plants for the health benefits. But they serve a dual purpose as they look good too. I have even bought them for a friend.” Gurugram-based Sarika Panda Bhatt shares, “I have air purifying plants in every room. November was really bad with respect to AQI. Ab air purifier kitna hi chalaoge? These plants give me some mental satisfaction.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more on Facebook and Twitter

On December 1 (Wednesday) and 2 (Thursday), winds are likely to be calm, reducing ventilation and leading to deterioration in the air quality,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-levels-in-delhi-increased-slightly-101638335259357.html
01-12-2021||Lucknow||Connect with Muslims, Jats: Maya to cadre||Reiterating her resolve to go solo in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Tuesday called upon her cadre to connect with Muslim and Jat communities, especially in the 86 reserved seats of the poll-bound state. The BSP had won just 2 of these 86 reserved seats in the 2017 UP polls in which the BJP dominated, with 70 of its 312 lawmakers winning on these reserved seats to hand over a clear majority to the BJP. She told the cadre that her party was confident of coming to power on its own as in 2007. Back then, Mayawati had won 62 of these reserved seats. “I have tasked my party cadres specifically on general seats as well. But for now, I have summoned Muslim and Jats and told them to focus on reserved seats,” Mayawati said while interacting with newspersons after her meeting. “Muslims feel harassed and have got fake cases on them by the BJP government,” she said later. Asked if this showcased a shift in Mayawati’s soft Hindutva approach, a party leader said, “Behenji has already said if voted to power, the BSP government would continue with development works in Hindu holy cities of Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi. We are speaking up for all, not any one caste or community.” Mayawati also reached out to the Jats, the community with majority of farmers who were earlier seeking rollback of farm laws and pushing for a separate law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.Her message to the minorities along with her focus on reserved seats caught attention of political experts. “Mayawati’s Muslim pitch could be viewed as an attempt to stop the minority vote from going largely to the Samajwadi Party, which, too, appears to be making efforts to woo the minorities. In fact, just as the SP, the BSP too appears anxious to woo all major vote banks,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran political observer. Mayawati has also tasked her nephew Akash along with Kapil Mishra, the son of her party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, to connect with the young. On if she would meet Bhim army chief Chandrashekhar who has been meeting political parties, Mawati said, “I have said that we will contest the elections on our own. Then where is the question of such a meeting,” she asked. She also backed the demand for a caste census, an issue on which she is on the same page with arch rival Samajwadi Party. “The centre is neglecting this demand by the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) due to its casteist mentality,” Mayawati said. In response to another query, Mayawati urged the government to reconsider the decision to suspend 12 Rajya Sabha MPs for entire winter session of Parliament.

Banerjee, who is on a two-day tour of the country’s financial capital will also attend a host of events, including an entrepreneur's conference. She said could not meet her Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray as he is recuperating from a recent surgery.The meetings coming in the wake of the Trinamool Congress’s attempts to spread its wings beyond Bengal is being seen as an outreach to fellow opposition leaders by the party supremo.It also comes amid further straining of ties between the Congress and the Banerjee-led party with several leaders switching over to the ruling Bengal camp in the past few months.Banerjee made her party’s ambitions for a larger national role clear ever since its landslide victory in the Bengal Assembly election earlier this year. The TMC has since inducted several Congress leaders in its fold.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 2) Balwinder Singh Randhawa said, “One gang member would drive the vehicle, while the other two posed as passengers. They would then take the passenger to isolated areas and rob them.” Station house officer Amandeep Singh Brar said Rajpal is already facing trial in six cases, including snatching and drug peddling. “Fifteen snatching cases have been registered against the accused in two months,” he said.

01-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An edifice of loss||It is among Delhi’s most melancholic souvenirs. One of the domes no longer exists. The missing portion is wrapped in a blue tarpaulin, like a makeshift bandage on an amputation wound.One morning in July last year, thunder, lightning and rain fell fatally on Masjid Mubarak Begum in the Walled City’s Chawri Bazar, causing a dome to splinter into uneven halves. The old building now appears reconciled to the impairment.This afternoon, a lone man is reclined in the courtyard. The open space is more like a deck, for the mosque rests on a plinth high enough to stay disconnected from the chaos of the bazaar. Directly underneath lies machine parts shops, spilling over with nuts, bolts, cables and welding rod electrodes. The narrow door to the mosque, downstairs, punctuates the market’s congested corridor like a hole in the wall. The steep staircase gives way to an ambience that is exact inverse of the bazaar -- serene, still and sky-filled.The red sandstone structure originally had three domes. It’s the central dome, the biggest, that was destroyed by the monsoon storm.Built in 1823, the mosque was named after one of many “bibis” of David Ochterlony, Delhi’s first British resident. Said to have started in the Mughal-era city as a courtesan, Mubarak Begum gradually came to command the respectability owed to a sophisticated society hostess. The site of the legendary Dilli ki Aakhiri Shama, Delhi’s last great mushaira, or poetry soiree, was her haveli. Forty poets were said to be present that night, including Mirza Ghalib.Today, crammed in by commonplace modernity, it is impossible to imagine the mosque’s original setting. The dimly lit prayer chamber is currently locked, and opens only during the prescribed prayer hours. In fact, gazing upon the damaged edifice from the pavement below gives the viewer a more realistic sense of its place in the contemporary world.From here, Mubarak Begum looks angelic, but diminished. May be because the disorderly bazaar dominates the panorama so thoroughly, the domes appear to be farther than they truly are. Gaze longer, and it is like seeing something that has already dissolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-edifice-of-loss-101638304204196.html

If the case is sub judice, which it is, who gave him the right to pronounce a judgment? And if the “sub judice” logic doesn’t stop him from pronouncing such outrageous judgments, then what stops him from sharing the evidence, party leader Prem Singh Chandumajra asked.BJP state general secretary Subhash Sharma on Tuesday said Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was suffering from amnesia as it was the Congress which promised to waive farm loans in the last assembly elections. Referring to Channi’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking debt waiver for farmers, Sharma said this was a classic case of passing the buck. In a letter to the CM, Sharma reminded him that the Congress leaders misled the farmers of the state and distributed forms in villages. “This was a fraud played by the ruling party on hardworking farmers who believed them in a hope that their loans would be waived,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-says-cm-channi-gone-berserk-bjp-says-he-s-suffering-from-amnesia-101638302374688.html

A high drama took place when Bittu and senior deputy mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi, who was given the charge of acting mayor, chaired meetings with officials and listened to grievances of the general public. The state government is yet to take any decision on Bittu suspension. “I am still the mayor as the House members resorted to undemocratic means to suspend me from the post. Moreover, there is neither any decision on my suspension nor anyone was given the officiating charge,” said Bittu.Yogi said Bittu has completely failed to maintain the sanctity of the House. “The House has already suspended him and appointed me as acting mayor,” he said.Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra said he failed to understand in which capacity Bittu attended office on Tuesday. “The MC general House is supreme and its decision must be respected. The mayor has already lost majority among elected councillors and therefore he has no right to sit on the mayoral chair,” Mohindra said. He added that the government is already examining the proceedings sent by the MC on the mayor’s suspension.“The decision in this regard will be taken soon,” Mohindra said.On November 25, Bittu was suspended after he failed to prove majority in a high-voltage meeting held in the presence former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his bête noire cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra.The House has 60 councillors, including 59 from the Congress. Most of them were given tickets on the recommendation of Amarinder’s wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur. Of the total House strength of 63 (after including the three MLAs), 35 councillors voted against Bittu, while 25 voted in his favour. Two members of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) abstained from voting.

He also questioned AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal’s promise of ₹1,000 monthly allowance to women. Sidhu, who was here to meet party leaders, councillors and industrialists at circuit house, said the investment summit in 2015 organised by the then SAD-BJP government was an eyewash as out of the ₹1.20-lakh crore investment promise, only ₹6,000 crore came in. “None of the five businessmen considered close to SAD chief, including NK Sharma and Rajinder Gupta, invested a single penny. And to top it all, ₹5 crore was spent on advertisements,” Sidhu said. “On the other hand, during our summit we promised investment worth ₹1-lakh crore, out of which, commercial productivity of 52% of the promised money has already started,” he said. The Punjab Congress chief said under his vision of “Punjab Model” for ease of doing business, there will be a single-window system for all the government approvals. “Why a person has to make repeated rounds of government offices for approvals. It should be done online,” he said. Without naming former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Sidhu said those who failed to deliver were shown the door. He said the Congress party wishes to stop the exodus of youngsters from the state and plans to create employment opportunities. Targeting Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal, Sidhu said unemployment has increased seven times in Delhi. On Kejriwal’s promise of ₹1,000 per month allowance to all women above 18 in Punjab, Sidhu said “money does not grow on trees and asked the Delhi CM how many women have been given such an allowance in Delhi”. Sidhu was accompanied by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and some local party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-targets-sukhbir-kejriwal-at-ludhiana-meet-101638301236982.html
01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Employee shouldn’t overreact if asked to explain facts: Punjab and Haryana high court||An employee should not show over-anxiety or over-reaction simply because the employer has asked him/her to explain certain facts, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said. “The employer has got administrative control over the employees working in its establishment. If the employer feels that an employee has committed some misconduct or has indulged in an activity, which is in violation of conduct rules, then the employer certainly has a right to seek explanation from the employee in the regard,” the bench of justice HS Madaan said. The court was hearing a plea from one Satyawan Singh, who retired as superintending engineer, Gurugram municipal corporation. He had sought quashing of a show-cause notice issued to him in 2020 over withdrawal of promotion orders. The Haryana government had told court that show-cause notice was served on the petitioner but instead of clarifying his position, he approached the court. The government had pointed to an alleged anomaly in his promotion case, which the department sought to be corrected and initiated the process for which he was served notice to state his position. The court observed that none of the order or notice given to him has immediate adverse effect. “The petitioner ought to have replied to the show-cause notice and appeared for personal hearing before the competent authority to present his view point. The respondents having not taken a final decision in the matter, the petitioner is feeling agitated unnecessarily and has rushed to the court,” the court said dismissing the plea on the grounds that it was premature. The court further observed the wrong done or some illegality committed in the process can certainly be probed, by observing rule of natural justice. It is not a case of review of any promotion carried out by earlier members of the department, rather a wrong is being sought to be undone, the court added.

After deceiving and betraying the trust of farmers, Channi is again trying to deceive them by saying that their loans will be waived in conjunction with the Centre.” Accusing Channi of committing a crime against farmers as well as people at large, Sukhbir said his letter was not worth the paper it was printed on. “It is a matter of record that the complete farm loan waiver was promised by the Congress and not by the central government,” he added. Writing to the Centre and urging it to take on half the responsibility amounted to playing with the sentiments of farmers, the SAD leader said. “Everyone knows this letter has no locus standi and will not be considered. This will give the Congress an excuse to play politics on the issue by blaming the central government,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-resorting-to-trickery-to-avoid-fulfilling-pre-poll-promises-sukhbir-badal-101638300997507.html

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt may provide MSP on 113 crops, if Centre doesn’t: Agriculture minister Nabha||Punjab agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha said that the Punjab government is likely to prepare a plan to give minimum support price (MSP) to farmers on 113 crops, excluding wheat and paddy, if the Centre failed to provide the same. Addressing a press conference in Jalandhar, the minister underlined that the Centre should announce guarantee on MSP so that the interests of the farming community could be protected. “We welcome the move to repeal the three farm laws but the Centre should announce MSP on crops without any further delay. We hope that the Union government would accede to farmers’ demands of providing guarantee on MSP. The state government has formulated a ‘vision document’ aimed at transforming the farming sector,” he added. The vision document emphasises the need for integrating technology with agriculture so that farmers could increase their income and bring down expenditure, he said. The use of drones and other latest equipment would be made to realise this goal, he said, adding that to implement the ‘vision document’ the state will be divided into six zones. Also, the government is also in the process of roping in experts to uplift the farming sector, the minister said. Expressing concern over the death of over 700 farmers during the agitation against the contentious farm laws, Nabha said that these lives could have been saved had the Union government adopted a humane approach towards farmers. The state government is making concerted efforts to promote crop-residue management practices and subsidies ranging from 60 to 80 percent on such equipment were being provided to farmers, he added. Later, Nabha told HT over phone that the farmer unions in a meeting with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh had given a list of 113 crops, including cash crops and those in horticulture, seeking MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-may-provide-msp-on-113-crops-if-centre-doesn-t-agriculture-minister-nabha-101638300754840.html

The estimated population of PLHIV (people living with HIV) in the state is 1.60 lakh and only 93,000 of them are currently registered with the UPSACS and getting treatment. “We are working to identify the remaining about 69,000 people quickly so that they can also get treatment facility. Avoiding unsafe sex is the key factor to avoid HIV infection and we are making effort to ensure that all must know this,” said Dr Preeti Pathak, in-charge ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society. She said, “Estimated PLHIV population is taken out every alternate year by the National AIDS Control Organisation for each state. The matrix spectrum is used to come to the conclusion regarding the estimated PLHIV population.” Doctors said, using protection, particularly when you are not aware of HIV status of the other person, is only way to avoid HIV infection. “Use of protection such as condom saves one from sexually transmitted disease. Condoms are 98% effective in protection against most sexually transmitted infections,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general of Association of International Doctors. “HIV spreads mostly from the high-risk groups such as sex workers or men having sex with men. We are consistently focusing upon such high-risk groups,” said Dr Preeti. According to the National Family Health Survey (5th round), there are 466 ICTCs in Uttar Pradesh where a person can get counselling and test facility for HIV, of his own free will or as advised by a medical provider. The 93,000 PLHIV are already getting medicines from 50 ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres in the state. The report of the 5th round of the health survey also suggests the need for increased focus upon HIV awareness. It says 13.1% women between the age of 15 and 49 years while 22.1% men in same age group have comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS in UP. Significantly, 64.6% women know consistent use of condom can reduce the chance of getting HIV AIDS while 78.2% men in the age group of 15 and 49 years also know this, the report says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/world-aids-day-around-70-000-hiv-infected-people-in-uttar-pradesh-as-per-upsacs-estimate-101638300635720.html

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi blames Badals for 2015 sacrilege, police firing; vows to act||Blaming the Badal family for the Bargari sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday claimed that the bullets fired at Sikh protesters in October 2015 also went through his chest and now the perpetrators of the crime will not be spared. Addressing a gathering of Congress workers at the new grain market in Kotkapura, the CM said, “The real perpetrators of this unpardonable crime were very much part of the passage of the Centre’s three farm laws. I will not comment more on this as the matter was sub judice.” Accusing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of making false promises, the Punjab Channi said his Delhi counterpart and party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal was an imposter.“His announcements and schemes are not for the welfare of the public even in Delhi, what to talk about Punjab. The free electricity announced in Delhi up to 400 units is nothing but a gimmick. The Delhi government charges a hefty amount if the consumption is beyond 400 units, which is normal for any household,” Channi said. Kejriwal doesn’t know who is Punjab’s ‘aam aadmi’ (common man) since he is an outsider, he said. “Why a person from other state should rule Punjab? He announced ₹1,000 per month each for women. But he should implemented this in Delhi first. Even out of 20 MLAs in Punjab, nine have left AAP. If their own MLAs don’t trust Kejriwal, why would people,” Channi asked.Also, the CM announced ₹15 crore each for “an overall development” of the Kotkapura and Jaitu constituencies. Couldn’t impound a single bus without CM’s support: Warring Transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said that had it not been the support of CM Channi, he would not have been able to impound even a single bus for flouting the norms. “He (CM) told me on day 1 that he wanted to finish the transport mafia in Punjab and action should be taken against such bus operators. The buses of Badals operating illegally have been impounded. They had to pay ₹14 crore in taxes to the transport department,” Warring added. “If people want development, elect the “aam mukh mantri di sarkar” (common man’s government) once again,” he added.He’s gone ‘berserk’, says Akali Dal The Akali Dal accused Channi of going “berserk” in the face of repeated rebuffs to his vendetta tactics, saying his self-contradictory utterances on sacrilege and police firing incidents were nothing more than the ravings of a frustrated man who knows that his game is up and his days numbered. “On the one hand, Channi tells brazen lies on sacrilege and firing and on the other, he runs away to take shelter behind the “sub judice” excuse. If the case is sub judice, which it is, who gave him the right to pronounce a judgment? And if the “sub judice” logic doesn’t stop him from pronouncing such outrageous judgments, then what stops him from sharing the evidence,” party leader Prem Singh Chandumajra asked.

A complaint in the matter was lodged by Dattaray Narayan Gavare (52) a resident of Vitthalwadi in Shirur, Pune. One of the accused men has been identified as Bharat Gopinath Chavan, according to the police. “It is a huge sum for a farmer. We have contacted the farmer and the bank to get more details. The amount is provided to the farmer by the sugar processing factories. Now it is an uphill task for the farmer to hire a new labour force and also repay the factory,” said Police naik Bharat Koli of Shikrapur police station, who is investigating the case. The complainant farmer claimed to have made cash and online transactions through UPI as well as NEFT between September 8 and October 18.

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Provide opportunities, not freebies: Faridkot traders to Sisodia||Businessmen and traders of Faridkot on Tuesday told Delhi chief minister Manish Sisodia that the people in the state need employment and trade opportunities, not freebies. Sisodia interacted with traders, businessmen, industrialists, transporters and shopkeepers in Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) programme “Vyapariyan te Karobariyan nal Manish Sisodia ji di galbaat” in Faridkot on Tuesday. “Don’t promise electricity or commodities for free. These things we can purchase ourselves if provided enough trade and employment opportunities in the state. We want you to promise to bring industry or a university to our area so that we can develop. This will create business and employment opportunities,” said Rajan Thakur, a trader. Varinder Shah, Faridkot Vyapar Mandal president said that don’t hook our people on freebies. He said the freebies are given from the taxpayer’s money and its burnt will be faced by the industry, which is already collapsing in the state. “Already, due to lack of business and job opportunities young generation is moving abroad for better future. Foreign countries are developing rapidly using our youth while we are moving backwards because of this. Instead of freebies, promise to provide low-interest loans, develop industrial infrastructure and markets for easy trade,” he said. Ravinder Bugra, a trader said that 600 units of free electricity is not a solution and this will not give many advantages if people do not have trade opportunities. “Give us trade and we are ready to pay bills. Due to the free availability of various goods people are becoming addicts, give them employment so they stay busy in work,” he said. Answering questions of traders, Sisodia said give the politics of honesty to the businessman, business will progress itself. He said no state can progress without the progress of business, but for this unnecessary restrictions imposed on trade will have to be removed and the harassment of the trader will have to stop.“After the formation of the AAP government, the politics of honesty, fairness, development and betterment of education will be done by completely eliminating corruption, like Delhi in Punjab also, the traders will be made partners in the government, policies will be made and implemented only after discussion with them. AAP government has done all this in Delhi but the governments in Punjab so far have done nothing but betrayed Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/provide-opportunities-not-freebies-faridkot-traders-to-sisodia-101638300455589.html

To press for their demands, the protesters on Tuesday locked the gate of the Zirakpur municipal corporation (MC) and did not allow the MC vehicle to pick up the garbage from collection points.The protesters wanted the state government to do away with the clause which stated that for regularising contractual employees they should have a domicile of Punjab. They said most of the employees, who were working with the Zirakpur MC for the past two decades, were from Panchkula.Sweepers’ union president Pradeep Sood and office president Ravinderpal Singh while addressing the protesting workers said if their demand were not fulfilled, they would intensify the protest. “We have been requesting the civic body to regularise the contractual employees, but nothing has been done,” they said.Joint action committee president Sukhdev Chaudhary said the entire city was stinking and officials concerned were not doing anything.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-stinks-as-sanitation-workers-strike-enters-day-2-101638300402623.html

After waiting for four years, he moved the forum in 2016.The forum in its orders, dated April 20, 2016, directed the builder to refund the amount along with 12% interest from the dates of deposits till payment along with compensation of ₹50,000 within 30 days. After Ahluwalia failed to comply, a show-cause notice was issued to him.Forum president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said: “(Ahluwalia’s) presence was procured by sending production warrants since the accused is already in Burail Jail in some other case... He was given sufficient time to deposit the amount, but he was reluctant to do so. In this case, the accused in a statement recorded that he is not in a position to make the payment to the complainant.”The order stated that from his behaviour, it is clear the builder did not intend to pay the amount to the complainant in the future too, “which clearly proves that he has admitted his guilt”.“Since the accused is very blunt and straightforward in his statement and has clearly shown his intention not to comply with the orders of this commission and pleads guilty, we feel that we are left with no other option except to punish him under Section 72 of the Act for wilful and intentional disobedience of our orders... we feel that the very purpose of the Consumer Protection Act will fail if persons like the accused are not brought to book and punished in accordance with the law,” the order mentioned.

The report, however, is yet to be taken by the PU senate, the university’s governing body.A faculty member, Ikreet Singh Bal, said, “The DACP of the MoHFW has been notified since 2008 and the PU has also been informed in 2017 by the University Grants Commission (UGC) that for the faculty of dentistry, the norms/regulations of the MoHFW will apply.

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||GMADA: Aerotropolis township project in doldrums||With the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) halting the process to issue letters of intent (LoIs) to around 500 land owners, the Aerotropolis project, an extension of Aerocity, is in the doldrums.It was in September when GMADA started issuing LoIs for 1,600 acres of land acquired for the township. It planned to complete the process within a couple of months and begin the land development in November. However, now, it has stated that around 500 land owners will not be issued LoIs as they got their land registered after the preliminary notification for land acquisition had been issued. So far, GMADA has issued LoIs for only 600 acres of the acquired land. The process is still pending for the remaining 1,000 acres. A senior GMADA official, who is associated with the project, admitted that the project will get delayed as around 500 cases of landlords have been sent to the district court for decision. “GMADA cannot take a decision on it as the financial transaction has taken place between the buyer and seller,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.The move has led to a strong resentment among the affected land owners. Gurminder Singh Bakarpur, one of the land owners, said: “GMADA is blaming us and putting the project on the back burner just to benefit private players in Aerocity. Why didn’t the officials tell the revenue department to stop registering the land?”Another land owner, Sukhminder Singh, said: “If they fail to resolve the issue, we will seek legal help. After a protest last week, housing minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria assured us that he will get it approved in the cabinet. But nothing has been done. We will wait for some more time, failing which, we will intensify our protest.”The project so farIt was in May 2017 when GMADA started the process of land acquisition for Aerotropolis, the seventh independent township being developed by it. In all, 1,600 acres of land were acquired on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road.GMADA issued notifications under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act in February and August last year for different blocks. The section pertains to preliminary notification for acquiring land and calling objections from land owners.In February this year, compensation was announced for the 1,600-acre acquired land in 11 villages — Bakarpur, Rurka, Safipur, Matran, Siaun, Manauli, Patton, Saini Majra, Chau Majra, Naraingarh and Chhat. The compensation ranged from ₹1.82 crore to ₹4 crore per acre, the highest provided by GMADA to date.While 1,400 acres are privately owned, the remaining is panchayat land. Owners of around 1,300 acres applied for the land pooling scheme instead of monetary compensation. As per the policy, for every one acre of land acquired from them, they will get 1,000 square yards of developed residential plots and 200 square yards of commercial plots, excluding parking.

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: Rift out in open in AAP over nominee list||A day after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announced its first list of 26 candidates for the municipal corporation (MC) polls, internal party fissures burst out in the open.Several of the party office-bearers and workers voiced opposition to the party’s decisions and some even said they would stand as rebel candidates in the elections.Some party workers even burnt the effigies of convener Prem Garg, party co-in-charge Pardeep Chhabra, party in-charge Jarnail Singh and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal in Sector 25.On Monday late night, the party announced the name of its 26 candidates out of the total 35 MC wards.Stating that he was kept out of the process of selection of candidates, party’s election campaign in-charge Chandermukhi Sharma said, “There is a lot of opposition to the party’s decision on candidate selection. Party workers met me all day on Tuesday expressing their anger at the local leadership ignoring merit and opting to go for their own loyalists. I could only tell them that I was not consulted on the matter.”Last evening, Jarnail Singh had rushed to Sharma’s house to bring him on board but Sharma stuck to his guns.The party is struggling with factionalism as four different groups have emerged under Garg, Chhabra, Sharma and former MP Harmohan Dhawan.The anger has been brewing in the party for some time now but has come out in the open only after the announcement of party tickets. The long-time party workers have been not happy with the recent joinees from the Congress getting a bigger role in the party affairs.A large number of Congress leaders joined the party after former Congress city president Chhabra joined the party in August this year. In the candidature list also on a number of seats recent Congress joinees have been preferred over older AAP members.Sahil Chawar, founder member of the party in the city and youth state general secretary, said, “It is disappointing that loyal party workers have been ignored and tickets have been given to the recent joinees from the BJP and the Congress. For the last more than 10 years, I have dedicatedly worked for the party but this is what we have received in return.”Another founder member of the party in the city and party’s vice-president Yogesh Arora Soni said, “By ignoring merit in candidate selection, the party is inflicting self-damage. It can cost it the election also. But being a loyal party worker, I will stick to the party.”Stating that candidates are being para-dropped, party’s vice-president Sanjeev Kochhar said, “I have decided to contest the MC elections from Ward number 32 as an Independent candidate and will be filing my nomination papers in a couple of days.”Chawar said after consulting his supporters he would file nomination as an Independent candidate from Ward number 4.Responding to criticism, Garg, said, “Delhi appointed observers covering all the wards. On recommendations party had to choose one candidate out of two. So, some dedicated workers also had to be left out. We respect workers right to protest.”Contest elections, Kejriwal tells senior leaders In a bid to curb factionalism in the party, AAP supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday night asked leaders of all four factions in the party to contest the election themselves. Garg, who received a call from Kejriwal, said, “He has asked all senior leaders of the party to contest the elections. We will hold a meeting in this regard on Wednesday and decide on the matter.”This is expected to bring supporters of all factions to work together and quell centripetal forces in the party.Previously, Garg, Chhabra, Sharma and Dhawan’s son Bikram Dhawan (party’s senior vice-president) had all decided against standing in the elections.

This year, the city received 0.2 mm rain on November 3, after which the month remained dry, leading to a deficit of 98%. “This year, we didn’t receive any active western disturbances (WD) in the month. Usually we receive a couple of such systems in November. However, this year they affected hilly areas in Himachal Pradesh, causing snowfall there but no rainfall in this region,” said IMD, Chandigarh, director Manmohan Singh.What lies aheadMeanwhile, a system of WD will remain active in the region from Wednesday onwards, but is unlikely to bring any rain to the city. However, cloudy weather will make the mercury drop for a couple of days. Another active system is expected to reach the city around December 5, and light rain can be expected.Singh said temperature had remained along normal lines in November with the maximum peaking at 30.2°C (on November 1) and the minimum plunging to 8.8°C (on November 29).

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers advance wheat sowing in Punjab’s Malwa belt||Sowing of wheat, the main rabi crop of south Malwa belt of Punjab, is expected to be over two weeks earlier than the regular trend in the region.Agriculture experts attribute the early sowing to pink bollworm infestation as cotton growers preferred to clear fields well before the traditional period for wheat sowing.Fazilka chief agriculture officer Resham Singh said as per regular practice, wheat sowing in the south Malwa belt lasts till December 15 or even later as farmers switch to rabi sowing after harvesting third and final picking of cotton bolls. After facing a drastic fall in cotton yield due to the pest attack, farmers hope for a bumper winter crop.But prevailing high temperature makes them worry about the wheat crop that is in the last stage of sowing in most part of southern Punjab.Seven districts of the region have 13.35 lakh hectares under wheat and sowing has been completed in over 90%, said officials. The semi-arid districts of Bathinda, Mansa, Fazilka and Muktsar, known as the cotton belt, comprise 61% or have 8.19 lakh hectare land under wheat cultivation of southern Punjab.Agriculture authorities said most of these districts are done with over 90% sowing whereas Moga, Ferozepur and Faridkot have nearly accomplished the target of sowing of the winter crop as harvesting of basmati rice is almost over.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Pakhar Singh said of an estimated 2.54 lakh hectares under wheat, sowing has been completed on 2.5 lakh hectares in the district.In Mansa, of the 1.7 lakh hectares, sowing is over on 1.55 lakh hectares whereas wheat has been sown on 2.14 lakh hectares in Muktsar.Of the targeted 2 lakh hectares, only 20,000 hectares are left in Fazilka that is expected to be over by this week, said officials. Progressive farmer Baldev Singh of Bathinda’s Bajak village said the pest attack caused widespread damage and growers did not see any benefit in the third picking of cotton bolls. “A light rainfall at this stage will bring much relief for the rabi crop growers,” he said.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) principal agronomist and wheat expert Hari Ram said unlike the last five years, this time the day temperature is about 2 degrees Celsius higher. “But the weather condition is not adverse to wheat. Also, notwithstanding the shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser, farmers switched to the alternatives advised by the PAU and the state agriculture department. Preliminary yield is unexpected to be affected but the real picture will be known later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-advance-wheat-sowing-in-punjab-s-malwa-belt-101638300215795.html

The men are all in judicial custody at Yerawada prison. Chavanke is a havaldar in the Indian Army and had come to his hometown, Nashik for a vacation. Patil used to contact aspirants on phone while Vaidya ensured physical confiscation of original documents from them. Chavanke was presented as the person who could help them get through shortcomings in medical test results while Dukre would help them in forging other documentation like residential proof, according to the police. “These accused made applicants believe that they could help them get into the army as well as police forces. They also told the applicants that they have done so earlier and the shortcomings found in the medical test results could be managed through their contacts in the medical teams conducting the medical teams in any recruitment process. We were provided with an audio on November 9 with these claims being made in it. Based on that recording, we tracked a person who was in possession of such a leaked paper and registered a case-based complaint against him. We found the other accused in Sangli and Nashik. We are looking for one more person,” said commissioner Prakash. They were found with original records of Class 10 and 12 of the complainant boy and 10 other such boys.

01-12-2021||Pune||Traders, shopkeepers upset over being heavily fined for customers violating Covid norms||PUNE: Traders across the state are furious over the new guidelines issued by the state government in light of the threat posed by the new ‘Omicron’ variant of Covid-19 as imposition of heavy fines for violating vaccine-related norms will lead to more corruption, according to them.The Maharashtra government on Saturday issued new guidelines where the owner of a shop, establishment or office will be fined Rs10,000 if a customer enters the premises without being fully vaccinated. If the shop, establishment or office is found not following Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB), it will be fined Rs50,000. The customer on the other hand will be fined Rs500 for violating CAB. The state government has made it mandatory for people to be fully vaccinated to access public places and public transport.Lalit Gandhi, president of the Maharatta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MACCIA), said, “Traders are already facing many challenges in bringing back the business they’ve lost in the last two years due to the Covid pandemic. Many establishments have already shut and the new guidelines will make it even more difficult for us to do business as checking vaccine certificates will keep us completely busy when that is not our job.”“The heavy penalty has left scope for corruption and pressure on traders. If anyone has to avoid paying such a high fine, the law enforcement agencies, including the police department or any other government officials will seek bribes which we have seen earlier as well,” Gandhi said.Fatehchand Ranka, president, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said, “Pune traders and all other traders and shop-owners across the state have always supported the state government in following safety measures till now. By imposing such high penalty, the government is again creating issues and we request that these high penalties on shop, office and any establishment-owners be immediately withdrawn.”The new guidelines have been issued in light of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – which has been named Omicron by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The variant, B.1.1.529, was first reported from South Africa, which has tagged it as a ‘variant of concern’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traders-shopkeepers-upset-over-being-heavily-fined-for-customers-violating-covid-norms-101638299314611.html
01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Row erupts over name of CMCH’s cardiology centre||A section of employees of Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and a faction of the Christian community have raised objections over the cardiology centre at the institute being named after industrialist-cum-philanthropist NC Gupta and accused director Dr William Bhatti of ignoring the constitution of the institution. The protestors on Tuesday led by Avinash Kumar, Samson Dogar and Raman Kumar carried out a candle march at Kalvari Church, CNI.Samson Dogar, a member of the Christian community, said, “Our continuous objections against naming any department after a donor or a philanthropist has failed to elicit a response from the director. We have tried to explain our point of view to Dr Bhatti and informed him that as per the constitution of CMCH, Ludhiana Society Clause Number 12 of the Memorandum of Association, the society shall not accept any gift, grant or benefit of any kind which carries with it any condition or obligation. However, the CMC constitution was ignored by accepting donations and changing the name after the donor.” It all started when the renovation of the cardiology centre was discussed at the administrative committee meetings of CMCH. However, a resolution regarding renaming the centre was never adopted, added Dogar.On the other hand, Dr Bhatti slammed his critics and asked them to shun their regressive propaganda and work for the betterment of the medical institute. He said that residents of Ludhiana have always risen above religion, cast or creed and donated generously for the development of the institution and putting a name on the wall was a gesture of paying gratitude to the philanthropist and in no manner a violation of minority institution and it was not done under any condition or obligation.He said that 127 years ago, Ludhianvis had welcomed Dr Edith Mary Brown, founder of the institute, with open arms. From monetary help to offering their land, residents had made a huge contribution in establishing the prestigious medical institution.“Similarly, in the tough times of the first and second Covid wave, generous people came forward and contributed. City-based NGOs also donated wholeheartedly to establish a level- 2 Covid facility. If we are expressing our gratitude by merely writing their name, it is not an infringement of the medical institute’s constitution,” said Dr Bhatti.The premier and oldest healthcare institution of the state is a Christian minority Institution which was established by English missionary Dr Edith Mary Brown in 1894.ContentionA press release issued by the protesting group in the evening stated that junior doctors’ salaries and retired employees’ pensions have not paid for four to six months. The number of patients has reduced drastically, as there has been an exodus of doctor’s and other staff. The staff feels alienated and are victimised by the director as he listens only to his closed coterie.The release further stated that the Christian community has been sparring with Dr Bhatti since April 2021 as the CMC administration had reportedly signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a renowned knitting yarn group of the city, which has been pushing for three different departments to be named after it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-row-erupts-over-name-of-cmch-s-cardiology-centre-101638299197552.html

This has deeply hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims. Needless to say, they are repeatedly doing these acts that are prejudicial to the maintenance of communal harmony,” he said.Saleem said he also gave to the police a pen drive containing links to the videos where the people named in the complaint can purportedly be seen mocking the Muslim community and threatening them with violence.Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (west), said they have received the complaint and are verifying the facts. “We are investigating to ascertain the facts.

Due to continued protests, the district administration in early November reduced the number of designated public sites for Friday prayers from 37 to 20.Altaf Ahmad, a representative of the Muslim community, said the intervention of the police and the administration in the matter has been lacking over the past few weeks. “Since the time the Govardhan Puja was held in Sector 12A namaz site, we have seen the administration and police taking a step back.

The work on the Metro link was expected to start by April-end 2020, but the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MHUA) is yet to give its final approvals for the project.“We hope that the authority will soon receive necessary approvals from the MHUA soon,” said Mishra.The work on this project with a budget of ₹2,682 crore will be done in two phases.According to the detailed project report (DPR) submitted in December 2016, the first phase of the 9.15km will have five Metro stations -- sectors 122 and 123, Greater Noida sector 2 and 4, and Ecotech. In the second phase of the 5.8km link, four Metro stations -- Greater Noida sectors 3, 10, 12 and Knowledge Park V -- will be developed. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be completed by 2022.

In the absence of clear guidelines issued by the state government, neither school buses nor vans are operational, yet. The association of school buses and vans has written a letter to the state transport commissioner to issue guidelines, but parents are worried about sending their children to school as most of them are working and depend on transport facilities.Mahesh Solanki, a parent from NIBM Kondhwa area, said, “My son is in Class 3 and the school is around 8 km from our residence. Before the pandemic, he used to go to school daily by the private school bus and now as schools are about to start offline classes, our school bus operator has said that there are no clear guidelines so they are not starting the service yet.”Another parent Neelima Gandhi said, “Both my daughters used to go to school by school van as my husband and me are both working professionals. As our offices too have started, we are completely dependent upon the school van for transportation. So we hope that school vans start their services soon and our children can travel safely to school.”Kiran Desai, executive president, Pune Bus Owners’ Association, said, “There is need to have clear guidelines to start the service as there are already many rules and regulations for school buses regarding safety measures, bus attendants and drivers. We have sent a letter in this regard to the state transport commissioner demanding that guidelines be issued. There are many aspects and safety measures which need to be taken while transporting students to school. Once we get the guidelines, buses and vans will begin operating. Also, the fees will be increased this year due to the hike in fuel prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/school-buses-vans-in-pune-won-t-operate-till-guidelines-issued-101638298598268.html
01-12-2021||Lucknow||Teacher test paper leak: Director of Delhi firm hired for printing papers among 2 held||The UP Police’s special task force (STF) arrested the director of a Delhi-based printing press from Gautam Budh Nagar and another key accused from Baghpat district, for their alleged involvement in the question paper leak of the UP Teachers’ Eligibility Test 2021 (UPTET-2021), said police on Tuesday. UPTET is a state-level exam conducted once a year to enable candidates to gain eligibility to teach primary classes (1 to 5) and upper primary classes (6 to 8) in government schools. The government had to cancel UPTET-2021 scheduled for Sunday (November 28) after the leak was brought to the fore with the arrest of 29 people from five districts of Uttar Pradesh and the recovery of question papers from some of them on Saturday night (November 27), just hours ahead of Sunday’s exam. Eighteen people were arrested from Prayagraj, four from Lucknow, three each from Shamli and Ayodhya, while one person was arrested from Kaushambi district in connection with the paper leak, the police said. In a press note, the UP STF stated that the accused, Rai Anoop Prasad, director of RSM Finserv Ltd, Badarpur, New Delhi, was arrested on Tuesday evening. He was first called to the STF office in Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday for questioning and was arrested on Tuesday after it was found that he did not maintain secrecy while printing the question paper, read the statement. During questioning, Prasad revealed that the secretary of the exam regulatory authority (ERA) issued a work order to his printing firm on October 26 for the UPTET-2021 question papers. He was found to have violated the secrecy protocol while printing the papers following which they got leaked and the exam cancelled, said a senior STF officer, asking not to be named. He said Prasad was booked under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and sent to jail after being produced before a court. Earlier on Monday night, the STF arrested another key accused from Baraut area of Baghpat district. According to the STF press note, the accused, Rahul Chowdhury, 30, of Chajjarpur village in Baghpat, was arrested from his shoe shop near Vedic Degree College in Baghpat. One set of question papers for the second shift of UPTET-2021 and admit cards of some examinees were recovered from his possession, it said. The press note stated that Rahul along with one Feroz, a resident of Baghpat’s Kirthal, and Balram Rathi of Shahpur, Muzaffarnagar, operated the racket out of the shoe shop. During interrogation, Rahul revealed that he arranged the UPTET question paper from a man named Ravi, of Kandhla in Shamli district, on Saturday night. He allegedly sold these papers to several people for a sum of ₹50,000 per candidate, said STF officers. An officer said Rahul told them that there was also a plan to compromise the ongoing online examinations for recruitment of sub-inspectors to UP Police. For that the accused had allegedly set up a computer lab to hack the online examination portal, but they could not do so, due to the alertness of NCEIT, the agency to which the conduct of the online exam has been outsourced. The officer said Rahul was planning to hand over UPTET question papers and admit cards to Feroz but the police arrested him before he could do so. As many as 19,99,418 examinees were supposed to write the UPTET-2021 scheduled to be held in two shifts across 2,736 centres in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/teacher-test-paper-leak-director-of-delhi-firm-hired-for-printing-papers-among-2-held-101638298596434.html
01-12-2021||Noida||Air quality in Noida, Ghaziabad improves to ‘poor’ after a week||After a week of battling “very poor” air quality, the three cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida got some reprieve on Tuesday when conditions improved slightly to allow the cities to register an air quality index (AQI) in the “poor” category. According to the 4pm bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ghaziabad on Tuesday registered an AQI of 287, Greater Noida 254, and Noida 291, all figures in the “poor” category. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. “The lower pollution levels is a result of meteorological conditions. In Ghaziabad, the monitoring station in Loni is still giving high readings which is affecting the overall AQI of the city. We are trying to find out the (local) sources in Loni and take corrective measures,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). The last time the three cities experienced “poor” AQI was on November 23, when Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida recorded AQIs of 268, 255 and 252, respectively. Prior to November 23, the Ghaziabad city recorded “poor” air quality of 297 on October 30 while Noida recorded AQI of 292 on October 31.Experts said the slight improvement is due to wind speed, which is likely to change directions from Wednesday. “The present winds are north-westerly and they are likely to change to easterly from Wednesday. On December 2, there is a possibility of cloudy sky and also a likelihood of drizzle in the wake of a western disturbance. On December 5 and 6, another western disturbance is expected which is likely to bring rain in the National Capital Region (NCR). Heavy rainfall is expected in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. It is from December 7 and 8 that temperature will start dropping even more,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department. A western disturbance is an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure that travels from the “western” to the eastern direction, and bring with it rain, fog or snow to the northern states.Environmentalists said lower levels of pollution, whenever they have happened this season, have been as a result of meteorological conditions, rather than targeted interventions. “The winds helped in dispersion of pollutants and a western disturbance will positively impact and bring down the pollution in the coming days. It is more of a correction due to meteorological conditions — the local sources have remained as it is. There is lot of dust on roads and vehicular traffic has more or less remained same,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The forecast from the Union ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said on Tuesday that on December 1 and 2, winds are likely to be calm reducing the ventilation leading to a deterioration in air quality. “From December 3 onwards, winds are expected to increase but AQI is likely to remain in ”very poor” category. Farm fires count is 186 and its share in PM2.5 is 1%. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” the Safar forecast said. The mixing height is the height at which air and suspended particles mix above the ground.A lower mixing height means the pollutants remain trapped closer to the surface.
01-12-2021||Delhi||85% had antibody count in adequate levels: Delhi sero survey||Over 85% of samples that tested positive for antibodies against Covid-19 in Delhi’s September serological survey had enough neutralising antibodies to stop virus replication in the lab, according to a detailed report submitted to the Delhi government this week.At least 97% of Delhi’s residents had antibodies against the virus, the preliminary report submitted in mid-November showed.“What this finding means is that a high proportion of the 97% people who were found to have antibodies can effectively fight off an infection,” one of the reseachers said, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Up to 64k beds, better oxygen infra: Delhi ready for Omicron, says CM KejriwalThe report will be released soon, a Delhi government official said, also declining to be named. The latest report is likely to contain details on vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in the capital city.The test for neutralising antibodies was carried out at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences for a portion of the 28,000 samples collected for the serological survey. It was the first time an exercise was conducted to find out the proportion of people with antibodies who could fight off an infection.The usual sero-surveillance depends on a semi-quantitative test for the antibody IgG that the body develops 10 to 14 days after an infection. The tests show whether a person has the antibody and whether the levels are high or low, but it does not give a specific quantity. In comparison, a complete antibody profile test shows the various types of antibodies as well as their levels.Neutralising antibodies are important as they directly tackle the virus and either destroy it or prevent it from entering human cells. It means that even after someone gets infected, they are unlikely to have a full-blown disease. Neutralising antibodies develop within the first week of symptoms starting to show and last for six months to a year.“Not only have we seen that 85% of the samples were able to neutralise the virus, we have also seen high levels of antibodies in these individuals, said a second researcher involved in the survey. “We saw IgG antibody levels ranging from 1 to 22 among the samples, with the median being 11,” this person added on condition of anonymity.That is a high level. The Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences required a person to have an IgG of 5 to donate convalescent plasma when the therapy was being used for treatment of those with Covid-19. An IgG antibody level of 5 was enough to ensure that it worked even at a dilution of 1: 80 for neutralising antibodies, as recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research.
01-12-2021||Noida||At 64, Gautam Budh Nagar sees spike in Covid cases for second month||Gautam Budh Nagar reported 64 Covid-19 cases in November, higher than October’s 57, said officials on Tuesday.The cases had been showing a declining trend till September after the second wave peaked in June 2021. However, cases have been marginally increasing in the district for the past two month, and the total number of cases reported in November is higher than the past three months -- August, September and October.Following a surge in the cases between March and June -- during the second Covid-19 wave this year -- the numbers had been declining since July. According to the official figures, 156 Covid-19 cases were reported in July, 51 in August, and 46 in September.In Uttar Pradesh, Gautam Budh Nagar ranks second with eight active Covid-19 cases, just after Lucknow with 15 cases as of November 29 (Monday).With the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus being a “variant of concern”, the Uttar Pradesh government has also issued directions to the health department regarding tests on suspected patients. According to orders issued by the state government, all international travellers coming from “high-risk countries” have to get themselves tested at the airport and be under home isolation for a week. The list includes all countries in Europe (with the United Kingdom), South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.Top officials from Noida said that additional precautions are also being taken as international travellers come to Noida from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in New Delhi.“We have ramped up surveillance and testing, and are also collecting lists of travellers from all the relevant authorities. In case a person tests positive, all primary contacts will be traced and tested... We will ensure that we send every sample of positive international travellers for genome sequencing through the laboratory at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences​(GIMS). Though it is not mandatory, we want to be careful that we don’t miss any carrier of the Omicron variant. The results, however, may take nearly a week to come in,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar.Health officials, meanwhile, said that one of the main reasons that Noida records a high number of Covid-19 cases is that the district usually sees a lot of travellers. Additionally, the festival season, followed by weddings, have resulted in an increased crowding. However, the increasing number of cases is not a cause of concern.“We have not imposed restrictions yet. So, precaution is the key to keep the Covid-19 spread in check. People should ensure that they follow the Covid protocols, maintain social distancing, and sanitise their hands at regular intervals. Unnecessary interactions should be avoided as much as possible,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO) of Noida.The district has recorded 62,940 Covid-19 cases and 467 deaths so far. The fatality rate is at 0.7%, and the positivity rate in Noida is less than 0.1%. Officials said that among those who tested positive this month, only a very few were hospitalised and none of them needed oxygen support. At present, all the eight Covid-19 patients are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/at-64-gautam-budh-nagar-sees-spike-in-covid-cases-for-second-month-101638298474371.html
01-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Man killed as car overturns near Iffco Chowk||A 20-year-old man was killed after his car hit a divider, flipped twice and turned turtle near Iffco Chowk on Monday night, police said on Tuesday. The deceased was identified as Shubham Sehrawat, a resident of Sector 17C. He used to run a paying guest accommodation in the area and was also studying in a college, said police. The incident took place around 1am when Sehrawat was returning home after attending a wedding function on Sheetla Mata Road, they said. “We got information about the accident from some passersby. The car flipped at least twice and landed on the road connecting Sector 17/18 dividing road,” said Ashok Kumar, sub-inspector at Sector 18 police station, who is the investigating officer in the case. Based on preliminary investigation and statements of the eyewitnesses, Kumar said it seems that Sehrawat was speeding due to which he lost control of the vehicle and hit the divider. “He was bleeding profusely and was unconscious when the police team reached the spot. He was taken to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead,” the officer said. The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at Sector 18 police station. A post-mortem examination of the body was done and it was handed over to the family on Tuesday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-man-killed-as-car-overturns-near-iffco-chowk-101638298416235.html
01-12-2021||Chandigarh||After Covid, surge in dengue cases adds to hospital burden in Ludhiana||Healthcare workers had just breathed a sigh of relief after the coronavirus pandemic, which had overwhelmed hospitals for over a year, finally abated when the mosquito-borne dengue disease reared its head again. Feverish patients are yet again flocking to already overburdened hospitals. Ludhiana alone has 1,789 confirmed cases, 4,587 suspected dengue cases and 10 suspected deaths. The figures are in the ballpark of the 2015 dengue epidemic, when 1,876 confirmed dengue cases had been reported. Dengue cases had seemed to be in control before September, when the cases had first started spiking. However, in October, the cases had spiralled out of control, with the district logging 1,100 fresh cases, against 151 in September, 23 in August, eight in July, and two in June. Come December, there has been a dip in dengue cases in rural areas, while cases continue to be reported from the city. Out the 1,789 cases confirmed cases, 1,322 cases have been reported from the city. A medical officer, requesting anonymity, attributes this to higher population density in urban areas, and residents’ lackadaisical approach towards hygiene, which allowed fresh water to accumulate in and around their houses.”The medical officer said residents were reluctant in letting the health department teams check their houses for larvae after an outbreak.Dengue wing staffer gets infected The health department’s failure to mitigate the crisis can be gauged from the fact that a healthworker attached with the dengue wing had to be hospitalised after contracting the infection. It was only after the staffer fell sick that larvae were destroyed from the office of the health department in Civil Lines.A medical officer with the health department said the eggs of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are vectors for the dengue disease, can survive for a very long time. “When the conditions get favourable, these eggs sprout and spread the virus. This was seen this year, after late rainfall allowed the mosquitoes to breed,” he said. Related CoverageIncreased testing behind spike in figures: Civil surgeon Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh says rise in the number of confirmed cases, indicated more testing. “We have asked private hospital authorities and members of the Indian Medical Association to share the details of patients testing positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, a parameter to detect dengue. The data should be known so that timely treatment and preventative measures can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus.”The health department has said that though a fall in the mercury has led to a dip in the number of cases, it has urged residents to not lower their guard and follow the guidelines issued by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-covid-surge-in-dengue-cases-adds-to-hospital-burden-in-ludhiana-101638298415098.html

The Ramayan recounts how Lord Hanuman, also called Maruthi (son of Wind God), flew and got the all-important Sanjeevani to save the life of Laxman, during the epic battle between Lord Ram and Ravan.Inspired by Lord Hanuman, the drone, Maruthi 2.0, was designed and developed by two alumni of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT)-Allahabad.The hexa-rotor drone can fly for 45 minutes at a stretch and can carry 10kg weight for 22 km in a single flight, said Kishan Tiwari, 24, who along with his senior, Rimanshu Pandey, 27 launched a start-up. Technology in Space and Aero Works (TSAW) Drones was registered with the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs in 2019 and has its head office in Gurugram, Haryana.He said that the start-up has recently penned a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Simply Blood, a well-known NGO based in New Delhi, to transport blood in remote and inaccessible villages of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to begin with. Tiwari, who is the founder and CEO of the start-up, penned the MoU while Kiran Verma, the founder of Simply Blood did the honours on behalf of his NGO.“The plan is to then extend the services to such sites in other states, including UP as well,” added Tiwari, a 2019 pass-out of BTech (Mechanical Engineering) course of MNNIT, who hails from Deoria.He said that costing around ₹14 lakh, each drone will make a delivery of the essential drugs and blood at an economical cost and also train individuals to help agencies employing these drones in these tasks.Rimanshu Pandey, a 2015 BTech (Civil Engineering) pass-out of MNNIT, who hails from Lucknow, handles the programming part of these drones. “Maruthi 2.0 is a sturdy, hexa-rotor drone. Once programmed, it can fly on its own to a destination along the charted route and make a delivery up to 22 km away, and then after a battery change, return to the site of flight origin using 4G or 5G networks. It also has the ability to scan a QR code and identify a destination and then make a delivery—all on its own,” he explained.
01-12-2021||Delhi||Up to 64k beds, better oxygen infra: Delhi ready for Omicron, says CM Kejriwal||Delhi is prepared to set up 63,800 Covid-19 beds, some at a short notice of two weeks, in case there is an outbreak of the Omicron variant of the disease in the city, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday.Kejriwal chaired a meeting of concerned departments to review Delhi’s preparedness in case of a third wave in the country owing to the new Omicron variant. Delhi has 30,000 oxygen beds ready, of which 10,000 are intensive care unit (ICU) beds, he said at a virtual media briefing. During the second wave (fourth for Delhi), the national capital scaled up beds with oxygen supply up to 25,000. As many as 6,800 additional ICU beds are being made and will be ready by February next year, the chief minister said.Also Read | From December, India imposes new rules for international arrivals over omicron scare“We will have nearly 17,000 ICU beds alone in Delhi soon. In addition to the 30,000 beds, we have also planned that each ward will have 100 oxygen beds, which will be set up in a short notice of just two weeks, if needed. This way, Delhi will have 63,800 beds in case a third wave hits the city,” Kejriwal said.The manpower required to attend the high number of beds is also being arranged and people are being provided training, he said. In June and July, the government built a force of 5,000 so-called community nursing assistants by training youth aged 18 and above who had completed high school so that they could help medical professionals in case of a third wave.Also Read | ‘Full, booster doses key as new variants emerge’“We hope that the Omicron variant doesn’t reach Delhi, but we’re making arrangements to deal with it nonetheless. During the last wave, we faced a grave shortage of oxygen. At present, all hospitals in Delhi have a combined capacity of 750MT. The problem we faced last time was that of oxygen storage and transportation. We could not store the oxygen which the Centre used to send through trains or transport them due lack of tankers. Now we have 442MT of storage capacity for oxygen, which we did not have during the last wave. We are also buying 15 tankers, which will be here in a month or so,” the chief minister said.The city endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left health infrastructure overrun, overwhelmed medical workers, and led to crematoriums running out of space. Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection between April and May alone. Cases in the city begin to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19 onwards.Also Read | Blanket travel bans will not prevent Omicron spread, says WHO“Earlier Delhi had zero capacity of producing oxygen. Now, we have PSA plants that can generate up to 121MT oxygen per day. Last time we had no spare capacity for oxygen cylinders. Now, we have 6,000 D-type empty cylinders, which we have imported from China, and which will help in setting up makeshift oxygen beds if required. At present, we have three private oxygen refilling plants in Delhi, which now have a capacity of 1,500MT per day. In addition, the Delhi government has also set up two bottling plants with nearly 1,400MT capacity per day. So, we now have a daily capacity of 2,900MT to refill cylinders in Delhi now,” Kejriwal said.To ensure proper oxygen management, a pain point identified during the last wave in Delhi, where there was hardly any accountability in terms of optimal utilisation of oxygen by hospitals and nursing homes, the government has decided to install telemetry devices on all oxygen tankers, be it of private entities or government, to monitor oxygen availability and delivery on a real time basis through a common command and control centre.The chief minister said the administration is now placing orders for 32 types of medicines required to treat Covid-19 patients to create a buffer stock of two months. The teams involved in tracking home isolation patients earlier have also been asked to set up the necessary infrastructure for making follow-up calls once again if the need arises.“The vaccination status in Delhi is good. Around 97% of Delhi’s citizens have received the first dose and 57% the second dose,” the chief minister said. “I appeal to those who have not got their second dose to take the jab as soon as possible. We sincerely hope that the Omicron variant and the third Covid-19 wave doesn’t come. But even if it does, we are ready to tackle it. The people of Delhi need not worry.”In India, no case of the heavily mutated Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 has been detected, even as one cluster each in Maharashtra and Karnataka are being investigated.
01-12-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad: Two held for installing card skimming device at ATMs||The Faridabad police on Monday arrested two men for allegedly installing a skimming device and duplicate keypad at more than 30 ATMs in different cities, including Faridabad, Gurugram, and Kolkata. Police have also recovered about ₹3.20 lakh from their possession. The suspects were identified as Amit Kumar and Manoj Kumar from Fatehpur Beri in Delhi, who have been jailed several times for ATM fraud, police said, adding that they had formed a gang in April this year with the help of an Uzbekistan national, identified as John Philo Azim, who had taught them tricks to take out money from ATMs using such devices. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects had taken out cash from an ATM at Mujesar Gate last week and a case was registered against them. They were arrested from Sector 9 crossing on Monday night while they were trying to target another ATM in the area, he said. “There are six members in the gang. The two other gang members, including Azim, were earlier arrested in April from Heili Mandi in Gurugram and Delhi, and are lodged in Faridabad jail,” Kadiyan said, adding that the remaining two are still at large. Police said that Manoj had met Azim last year in a Kolkata jail. Kadiyan said Azim was arrested on charges of fraud and theft in several states. “They both came out on bail and formed a gang and started visiting ATMs in different states. “We received several complaints from across the city where money was withdrawn from ATMs through cloned cards,” he said. Police said a team started analysing the CCTV footage from different ATMs and found that two men were tampering with the machine. On Monday, the police team saw two men entering an ATM with covered faces and kept a close watch on them. “When they did not come out for 10 minutes, two policemen went inside and caught them red-handed,” said Kadiyan. The suspects used to surf the internet to know the latest modus operandi, said police. During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they used to install a data skimmer in the opening of ATM machine where the card is inserted to clone debit card details. They used to place a duplicate keypad on the original which used to help them copy PIN numbers. “They used to replicate the stolen data on gift cards having metallic stripe using a software and card cloning device. The cloned cards were then used to withdraw money,” said Kadiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-two-held-for-installing-card-skimming-device-at-atms-101638298295661.html

Their samples have now been sent for genome sequencing.Of the three, one is from Pune city, who returned from Zambia on November 20, and two are from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), who returned from Nigeria.Public health department in their official statement on Tuesday said, “Currently, there are six passengers who arrived from South Africa or other high-risk countries in the state who have tested positive. Of those who have come from South Africa and other countries, one each has been found in Mumbai corporation, Kalyan-Dombivali corporation, Meera-Bhayandar corporation and Pune. This is in addition to two passengers who arrived from Nigeria who have been found in the Pimpri-Chinchwad corporation area. All their samples have been sent for genetic sequencing and their contact tracing is underway. All these passengers, although Covid-19 positive, are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Citizens should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and inform the authorities if they have international travel history in the last month. Those who have not taken the Covid-19 vaccine, or have had only one dose should complete their vaccination at the earliest”.Dr Pradeep Awte added: “ WHO has also classified the Omicron variant as a ‘variant of concern’. Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics. While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause a severe disease and whether it will evade the immunity. More information is expected in the next two weeks.“Against this background, surveillance of international passengers has been started as per guidelines given by the Government of India. Passengers arriving from Europe and 11 other countries where the Omicron variant has been detected will be tested with RT-PCR and positive samples will be sent for whole genome sequencing. Additionally, those who are found RT-PCR negative will also be quarantined for seven days before testing again. If found positive this time, their samples too will be sent for genomic sequencing. RT-PCR tests will be done for a random 5% of the passengers arriving from countries other than the listed ones, and positive samples among them will be sent for genomic sequencing,” he added.The Pune resident who returned from Zambia, an African country bordering Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, all high-risk countries with regards to the Omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2 variant, has tested positive for Covid-19, officials said on Tuesday. The passenger returned to India on November 20 and all his high-risk contacts have tested negative for the infection. The person is currently asymptomatic and is isolating at home.The patient’s sample has now been by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) sent for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology to ascertain of he is infected with new variant.Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of the PMC health department said, “The patient along with the family returned to Pune on November 20, via Mumbai airport and then they took a cab and returned to Pune. The patient, a 60-year old man, felt discomfort and stomach pain following which he got himself tested at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital and tested positive for the infection.”The genome sequencing results will come in in a week’s time, said PMC health officials.The person is almost nearing the completion of the 14-day isolation period as per current protocol.Dr Bharti also added that the patient is currently asymptomatic. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awte also confirmed the case.As of now, PMC is still awaiting a list of all the international travellers who have come to Pune from various countries and could now be part of the “at risk” countries.As of now the civic body has got the names of 40 international travellers who arrived at Pune airport from various countries like Turkey, UK, Madrid and Dubai and is tracking them as per the revised guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, in light of this new variant.Dr Bharti further said, “The Indian Council of Medical Research, in a video conference held on Tuesday has assured us that the current set of RTPCR kits and Rapid Antigen Test kits would be able to detect the Omicron variant.”The World Health Organisation (WHO) too confirmed in its technical brief on November 27 that most diagnostic tests can detect the Omicron variant.As of November 29, countries included in the “at risk” list for Omicron are: South Africa, Botswana. Netherlands, Hong Kong, Belgium, Israel, Australia, England, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Austria and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/3-in-pune-district-back-from-african-countries-test-positive-for-covid19-101638297995099.html

We also organised workshops at 21 schools, and sensitised 5,980 students and 286 teachers,” Saha said.He also said that violations like riding motorcycles without helmets in Gautam Budh Nagar usually tops the list. “We made wearing helmets a mandatory thing even for pillion riders. People have started following traffic rules, and we hope that such violations will decrease in the coming days, with the ongoing enforcement drive,” he added.To encourage motorcycle riders to wear helmets, the Noida traffic police has also planned to launch a helmet bank where people can get free helmets to be used for a week, Saha said.In November, the traffic police also issued fines against other violations like triple loading on bikes (748), no entry (711), pollution (632), hooters (258), using cellphone while driving (160), black films (134), and others (194). “We issued ₹29.9 lakh as fines to these violators in November. The number of fines and the fine amount may increase as some e-challan data have not been updated. The traffic police issued 507,257 fines and collected ₹4.22 crore from the violators from January to November this year,” according to Saha.413 vehicles -- older than 10 years or 15 years (diesel/petrol), or vehicles creating pollution -- were also seized in November, he added.The traffic police, meanwhile, plans to engage school students as traffic volunteers. “We have nearly 1,000 traffic volunteers, and are planning to invite young volunteers to participate in our programmes to create traffic awareness.

01-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: DTCP to introduce penalty for building plan violators||htreporters@hindustantimes.comThe department of town and country planning (DTCP) has proposed to impose a monetary penalty on owners of buildings/flats who make illegal additions to their structures after obtaining occupancy certificates (OCs) to curb such constructions, said officials on Tuesday. The department also wants that a substantial penalty should be imposed on the owners who have illegally converted their houses into guest houses in residential colonies across the city. “The proposal is being finalised and will soon be sent to the headquarters for approval. We are planning that financial penalty, which is presently imposed on commercial properties, for building plan violations should be similarly imposed on residential segment. It will help curb any such violations,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement).The DTCP officials said that at present any such violations may see withdrawal of OC and sealing of property, after which the owner seeks permission for de-sealing the property and agrees to remove illegal constructions. In the past two weeks, the department has cancelled around 50 OCs issued to building owners for indulging in building plan violations. The department is also proposing that a substantial penalty be authorised against property owners, who use their houses as guest houses without permission. “A substantial penalty is needed to discourage people from converting houses into guest houses,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, Gurugram. In a related development, an enforcement team on Tuesday visited Aloha group housing society in Sector 57 after complaints were made by residents regarding non-compliance of norms and lack of occupancy certificate to the project. “We heard the residents and issued directions to the representative of the developer to apply for the requisite permission within one month. Other issues raised by residents will also be resolved,” said Bhath. A representative of the Aloha Developers did not respond to phone calls and messages sent by HT for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-dtcp-to-introduce-penalty-for-building-plan-violators-101638297694283.html
