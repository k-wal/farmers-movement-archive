The department also asked the developers that violations such as construction of rooms in stilts and conversion of balconies into kitchens/bathrooms will not be allowed. The meeting has followed a month-long drive against building plan violations by the department in which over 50 occupancy certificates were cancelled. Members of the Home Developers Association, Gurugram, attended the meeting. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the meeting was held to make the builders aware that such violations were serious and could land the property owners, architects and contractors in trouble. “All the stakeholders are responsible for following the rules. If there are violations on a large scale, then everyone will be held accountable,” he said. During the meeting, Bhath said that a clear message was given that action would be taken against everyone carrying out zoning violations. “We have asked the association to hold meetings with their members and make them aware about the rules. We have also asked them to submit the modalities which could help prevent such violations,” he said. Narender Yadav, newly elected president of the Home Developers Association, said that they discussed all aspects of the issue and assured the officials that they would work with the department to minimise such violations. “We will conduct workshops, hold meetings and make the contractors aware about the prevention of such violations. Construction of rooms is the biggest issue and we will check it in future,” he said. Meanwhile, the DTCP on Saturday held a meeting to discuss ways for creating awareness among the property owners against such violations. “We are also planning to launch an awareness campaign on this issue,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-building-plan-violations-won-t-be-allowed-dtcp-tells-developers-101638642557718.html

04-12-2021||Pune||Over 1.3 million due for second dose of Covishield in Pune, highest in state||Out of the 8.8 million beneficiaries who are due for their second dose, 1.3 million are in Pune district alone, making it the highest in the state. These beneficiaries are due for the second dose of Covishield. Pune is followed by Mumbai that has 700,000 beneficiaries and then Kolhapur that has 550,000 beneficiaries due for their second dose. With regards to the second dose of Covaxin, Pune is among the top three districts that have the highest number of beneficiaries who are eligible to get the second shot but are due. As per the state health department, despite the availability of the vaccines, people are reluctant to take the second dose as the fear of Covid-19 has reduced. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC immunisation officer said, “With new variant Omicron looming over us, people are definitely taking the vaccine as we are seeing a rise of beneficiaries taking both the shots. With government making full vaccination compulsory for commercial activities, and the wake of the new variant, the demand for vaccination has gone up in proportion to the fear.”About 54.43 per cent of the district’s eligible population aged between 18-45 are fully vaccinated and 98.41 per cent have received their first dose. This takes Pune to the second spot among the districts who have fully vaccinated beneficiaries.With regards to the population aged 45 plus, Pune stands at 15th position as the elderly citizens in the district are reluctant to take the vaccine. Only 85.18 per cent of the population has got the first shot and 63.10 per cent of the 45 plus age group has been fully vaccinated. The state health department’s Adverse Effects Following Immunization (AEFI) also states that Pune has a nominal number of AEFI registered among Covid19 vaccine beneficiaries, 363 of 357 were minor, five were serious and one severe AEFI incidents were reported in the entire district.

04-12-2021||Noida||Work on Delhi-Baghpat link to speed up: NHAI||After Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid foundation stone of the Delhi-Dehradun Economic Corridor (DDEC) on Saturday, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that developmental works will now expedite at different stretches, including a 32km link from Akshardham in New Delhi to Khekra in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat.The DDEC from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) junction in Baghpat to Dehradun, which is pegged at a cost of ₹8,300 crore, will offer the commuters in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida a better access to the DDEC. The estimated cost of the entire corridor from Delhi to Dehradun is ₹12,000 crore, said the officials.The DDEC will reduce the time taken to cover the distance between Delhi and Dehradun from six hours to nearly two and half hours, they added.The NHAI officials said that the work for the 32km stretch along Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, linking the DDEC, has been allotted. The stretch will have six lanes on the elevated section, and three lanes on each side will be on the ground level which will serve as service roads.“The 32km stretch has two links -- one in Delhi and the other in Uttar Pradesh. Work on both links have been allotted. The work for the second stretch in Ghaziabad’s Loni portion has started, and the work for the Delhi section will also start soon. It is estimated that the stretch is likely to see nearly 50,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day,” said an officer of NHAI, requesting anonymity.“We need nearly 15 hectares of land for planting 5,000 trees, as compensatory afforestation there. With the Prime Minister laying the foundation stone of the economic corridor, we are hopeful that the work will now be expedited,” the officer added.The project is scheduled to be completed within 2.5 years, according to the officials.Apart from the 32km link in Delhi-NCR, the UP jurisdiction from Baghpat to Saharanpur also has a 119km stretch.“With the Prime Minister laying the foundation stone of the DDEC, various works including land procurement in different states are likely to be expedited... and the project itself will see a boost. We have nearly 119 kilometres in our jurisdiction -- from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway to Saharanpur -- and most of the works have been awarded, except for works on a 25-km stretch. It is likely that the work will start on a full scale in the coming days,” said SK Mishra, project director, NHAI.While laying the foundation stone of different projects in Dehradun on Saturday, PM Modi said, “When it (DDEC) is ready, the time taken to travel from Delhi to Dehradun will be almost half of what it is now.”The DDEC will have seven major interchanges for better connectivity to Haridwar, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Yamuna Nagar, Baghpat, Meerut and Baraut. It will also have the largest wildlife elevated corridor of 12km in Asia, for unrestricted wildlife movement. The 340-metre-long tunnel near Daat Kali temple in Dehradun will also help in reducing any impact on the wildlife there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-delhi-baghpat-link-to-speed-upnhai-101638642019393.html
04-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Woman accused of killing six-year-old daughter nabbed||Police arrested a woman from Noida’s Naya village on Saturday for allegedly killing her six-year-old daughter last month, said officials.The suspect -- identified as Anuradha (goes by first name), 38, a resident of Noida Sector 93 -- had allegedly planned to frame her husband for the murder, and get all his personal assets and house in Noida and another (native house) in Aligarh, according to the police.The suspect’s husband, Ramkumar Sharma, 40, filed a missing complaint of their daughter -- Honey -- at the Phase 2 police station on November 11 this year. On the basis of his complaint, an FIR under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 363 (kidnapping) was registered against unidentified persons the same day, said the officials.“We launched a probe and found the missing girl’s body from a park in Noida Sector 108 on November 13. The girl was strangled. No signs of sexual assault were found on her body... The case was then registered under IPC Section 302 (murder) and a hunt to nab the suspect was underway since then,” said Sujeet Upadhyay, station house officer (SHO), Phase 2 police station in Noida.During interrogation, police got to know that Anuradha divorced her ex-husband and left her two daughters in Aligarh, and married Ramkumar in 2010. In her second marriage, Anuradha gave birth to four girls -- two of them, Kirti and Honey, stayed with them in Noida, and two of their daughters were adopted by the family members of Ramkumar.SHO Upadhyay said, “We found out during interrogation that Anuradha had a fear that Ramkumar would give his properties in Noida and Aligarh to his relatives as she could not give birth to a son. She allegedly made a plan to frame him in a crime, get him arrested, and eventually occupy their houses in Noida and Aligarh. That is why, Anuradha allegedly strangled her daughter Honey in a secluded place on November 11 and dumped her body at the park.”The same day, Anuradha went to Greater Noida on the pretext of buying medicines. “Initially, she misled the police during interrogation by saying that she was in Greater Noida the day her daughter was kidnapped and murdered. As we continued the interrogation, Anuradha did not turn up at the police station when summoned. She had been missing since the last week of November,” the SHO added.Police smelled foul play in the case and launched a search to nab her. On Friday, police nabbed Anuradha from her brother’s house in Naya village. She was produced before a magistrate and sent to judicial custody on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-woman-accused-of-killing-six-year-old-daughter-nabbed-101638642017602.html
04-12-2021||Pune||Vax or mask? Pune businesses weigh which mandate to follow||Though the government has made it mandatory for establishments to check vaccination certificates, many have not been doing so. However, these establishments have made wearing masks and temperature check compulsory for all who will enter their shop premises. At the same time, supermarkets like D-Mart have started checking certificates of both doses, without which customers are not being allowed inside the premises. On November 29, the state government issued an order, according to which, without a vaccination certificate, an individual is not allowed to step in public places or either use public transport. “We have already opposed the Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB) guidelines. No other state has been given such guidelines, except for Maharashtra. All the shopkeepers and customers are strictly following temperature checks and wearing of masks guidelines regularly,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of the Trade Association of Pune (FTAP). However, grocery marts like D-mart and sports clubs like Deccan Gymkhana have started asking for vaccination certificates or an RT-PCR negative report, done 72 hours prior. “Since international tournaments have started in the Deccan Gymkhana tennis courts we are making it mandatory to check Covid vaccination certificates,” said an official from the Deccan Gymkhana tennis courts. D-mart, watch guard said, “We have been asking for vaccination certificates since the past two days. Those who have not completed vaccination are not allowed inside.” “We are making sure that customers are masked-up and regular temperature checks are done at all our retail putlets. Even customers are supporting i and are following all the guidelines,” said Saurabh Gadgil, chairman and managing director, PNG Jewellers.

04-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad recorded ‘good’ air on just 10 days this year, AQI still ‘very poor’||Residents of Ghaziabad breathed in “good” quality of air -- with an air quality index (AQI) between zero and 50 -- only 10 days this year, said weather experts on Saturday.Figures released by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) indicate that the city recorded 20 days with an AQI in the ‘severe’ category and 75 days with an AQI in the ‘very poor’ category.According to the official government data, Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 “non-attainment cities” in Uttar Pradesh, with high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared ‘non-attainment’ if they do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM10) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a period of five years.“The fewer number of ‘good’ air days this year is due to the fact that the city is situated in the Indo-Gangetic plain, where the dust content is naturally high. Even during the coronavirus-imposed lockdown, the pollution levels reduced a bit, but the AQI was not in the ‘good’ category... The impact of vehicular emission and adverse meteorological conditions also impact the city’s AQI on a regular basis,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Between January and November this year, days with a ‘very poor’ quality of air increased to 75, against 67 and 62 days during 2019 and 2020, respectively.The figures, however, also indicated that the condition has improved a little as in 2020 and 2019, which saw only 13 and three days with an AQI in the ‘good’ category, but none in the months of April, May and June when the lockdown restrictions were first imposed after the Covid-19 outbreak across the country. 2021 saw 100 ‘moderate’ days, against 122 in 2020 and 93 in 2019, according to the figures.Pollution levels under the ‘moderate’ category causes “breathing discomfort to the people along with lungs, asthma and heart diseases”.“We have about 15-20 patients daily, and they have symptoms related to bronchial asthma, infection in the respiratory tract, among others. These also get aggravated due to higher pollution levels, and some patients also suffer from skin infection, heart issues, and irritation to eyes. The frequency of such patients increases to nearly 100-150 per day during winters. Pollution is one of the major factors affecting such patients,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital.Environmentalists, meanwhile, said that all the pollution abatement measures should continue round the year, instead of agencies concerned taking such steps only during the winter season, and that is “the need of the hour”.“If agencies concerned are sincere enough, they must take up pollution abatement measures round the year. However, there is a lack of enforcement on the ground level, and it is only during the monsoon or rainfall that the pollution levels decline. Local factors like garbage burning, road dust, and vehicular emission continue to add to the high pollution levels every day. The administration must have a local policy to combat pollution round the year,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.This year, since Diwali on November 4, the city has been recording the AQI levels only in the ‘severe’, ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ category.According to figures released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Saturday, the three cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida recorded the AQI at 327, 335, and 355, respectively -- all in the ‘very poor’ category.According to a System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) forecast on Saturday, wind speeds are likely to be low in the next two days (December 5 and 6), and reducing ventilation will lead to a degradation in the air quality, but within the ‘very poor’ category only.“From December 7, winds are likely to increase dispersing pollutants, but the AQI is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category. Partly cloudy sky and low mixing layer height are preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” said the Safar forecast.
04-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s first Omicron case in Kalyan-Dombivli; no need to panic, says Tope||A 33-year-old unvaccinated man who returned from South Africa to Kalyan-Dombivli near Mumbai tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19, Maharashtra health department said on Saturday. This is India’s fourth confirmed case of the new strain. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said the probable third wave of Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra could be of the Omicron variant if precautions are not taken. He added that the new strain is mild and does not cause severe disease that requires mass hospitalisation. The infected person arrived in Mumbai from Cape Town via Dubai and New Delhi on November 24, according to a statement from the state health department. The department said the man’s 12 high-risk contacts and 23 low-risk contacts were traced and found negative for Covid-19. Additionally, 25 of his co-passengers on the Delhi-Mumbai flight also tested negative. “On November 24, the passenger got mild fever. However, no other symptoms were observed. The mildly symptomatic patient is being treated at the Covid Care Centre in Kalyan-Dombivali,” a statement from the state health department said. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said, “The patient’s condition is stable and he has no symptoms. He is in quarantine at a civic centre. We have tested his family, his society neighbours, his cab driver and his doctor. All are negative.” According to Suryavanshi, KDMC currently has only one functional Covid care centre on account of fewer cases being reported every day. As of Saturday, December 4, there were only 190 active cases in the KDMC jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a 60-year-old male, who arrived from Zambia, has tested negative for the new variant. Instead, a sub-lineage of the Delta variant was detected in the sample that was tested at the National Institute of Virology in Pune, the state health department said. Four international travellers from Thane, too, tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. Three of the four had returned from The Netherlands and one from Canada, informed Sandeep Malvi, additional municipal commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation. Malvi said all four are in institutional quarantine. All four samples have been sent for genome sequencing. Earlier, Tope said the panic over Omicron is understandable due to people’s experience in the first and second waves of Covid-19 infections. Tope said that the third wave of Covid-19 could be of Omicron, as the variant is said to be highly transmissible. “As per the available information, this variant doesn’t cause severe disease leading to mass hospitalisation, [subsequent] need for oxygen, and an increased fatality. Omicron’s transmissibility is fast, and there is definitely a fear of a rise in infection due to the new variant. If we don’t take precautions the third wave could be of Omicron, even though it is milder [than Delta variant],” Tope said in Jalna on Saturday. Until Saturday morning, 3,839 passengers arriving from at-risk countries for Omicron at Mumbai airport have been tested with RT-PCR. Besides, 344 out of 17,107 passengers who arrived from other countries have also been tested. “Since December 1, 2021, eight passengers have been tested positive for Covid-19 and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers who have arrived since November 1 is underway,” the statement added. The minister added that people need not panic but must strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviour including social distancing, double masking, and vaccinating themselves. “There is no need to fear Omicron. Experts have said that it is not dangerous. People must keep up their immunity, wear masks, and get vaccinated.” Meanwhile, Maharashtra added 782 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the tally to 6,638,071. The state added 14 fatalities, pushing the toll to 141,163. Active cases stood at 7,129 on Saturday. Mumbai added 213 cases, pushing its tally to 763,616. It also recorded four fatalities, taking the toll to 16348. The state’s daily positivity rate on Saturday was 0.63%, while the overall positivity rate stood at 10.06%. (Inputs from Sajana Nambiar)
04-12-2021||Lucknow||OPD services hit for two hours as junior doctors stage protest at SRNH||PRAYAGRAJ: Health services were badly affected at the busy SRN Hospital of MLN medical College here on Saturday as junior resident doctors observed strike. The junior doctors boycotted work as part of a nationwide strike called to show displeasure due to no first-year counselling of post graduate courses for a year. Due to the strike, patients, especially those coming from far-flung areas, faced hardships for the first two hours of OPD. As the junior doctors blocked the passage of the hall where the registration slips for OPD are issued, many patients had to wait for getting the slips and approaching senior doctors. The junior doctors maintained that due to no counselling for a year, the load of first year PG students was falling on second- and third-year students. Hence the workload was increasing and although the association had raised the concern, the government was not listening. When the senior doctor sat in the OPD, they managed to attend only a few patients who came with old prescriptions in the first two hours even as there was a huge crowd at the prescription counter. The protesting resident doctors also took out a candle-light procession in the evening. The junior doctors gathered at SRN hospital and raised their demand vigorously. The doctors said that this was a symbolic demonstration and if the demands were not accepted, the agitation would be intensified and even emergency services would be stopped at SRN. “Our demands are justified as we are here to serve the patients and for this we constantly work peacefully under pressure. When there was a nationwide strike, we joined our association. If the demand is not accepted, then the scope of the movement will be increased,” said Dr Sarvesh Pathak, office-bearer of the Prayagraj unit of the association. However, at around 11am, the principal of MLN Medical College, Dr SP Singh, met the agitating junior resident doctors and persuaded them to call off the protest. “It is true that the services were affected for some time, but later senior doctors attended the OPD and all were treated. OT also functioned normally”, said Dr Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/opd-services-hit-for-two-hours-as-junior-doctors-stage-protest-at-srnh-101638641837810.html
04-12-2021||Pune||New girl’s school at Pune’s Bhide Wada to have 19th-century architecture, advanced technology classes||The historic Bhide Wada, the building where India’s first girls’ school was started by Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule in 1848, will be redeveloped as a national monument and will house a girl’s school. The work on expanding the Bhide Wada will commence soon. The seven-storey structure will have five floors reserved for the school which will have all the modern amenities. The school will be run by PMC, and the basement will house shops, which are already located there. Professor Hari Narke, former head of the Mahatma Phule chair in Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) shared his insights on the proposed monument at the Bhide Wada. Last week, after conducting a meeting with officials, Chhagan Bhujbal, minister of food, civic supplies and customer protection announced that a school for girls will be started in Bhide Wada. According to Professor Narke, the proposed school will have an appearance of the 19th century Bhide Wada and will be the centre of advanced knowledge. “We aim to have a school which will groom the opinion makers in the 21st century. Topics related to advanced technology such as artificial intelligence and programming will be incorporated. The school will prepare girls to pursue higher education from any reputed world university such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard,” Narke. He was also present at the meeting held by Bhujbal and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar with the officials, wherein the officials were asked to expedite the process to develop the national monument at Phulewada and memorial of Savitribai Phule. Narke said that there is also a plan to install memorials of other associates of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule who helped the couple start the school at Bhide Wada. “Bhujbal suggested that every student must know the history and legacy of the school, hence, memorials of companions from Brahmin and Maratha communities who helped start the school will be constructed. We are also planning to display the social reforms that took place in the 19th and 20th centuries through pictures in the rest of the area,” he said. Currently, the school is in a dilapidated state after it was shut down almost 15 years ago. The redevelopment will be done by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The plan to redevelop Bhide Wada as a national monument has not taken off due to issues related to opposition from shop owners, who run their business from the premises. Ajit Pawar has told the administration to hold a meeting regarding rehabilitation of commercial occupants and residents living in the building and chalk out the land acquisition process and settle the matter amicably. According to Narke, construction work of the monument is expected to start in early 2022.

Meanwhile, four people were booked under provisions of Information Technology Act for positing provocative posts on social media and two cases each were registered at Govind Nagar and Kotwali police stations of Mathura. “Police have referred the posts to its cyber cell and action will follow. Two cases have been registered at Govind Nagar police station and two at Kotwali police station against the account holders after provocative messages were posted on social media,” informed Vijay Kumar Singh, the in charge of Govind Nagar police station. Earlier, various organizations, including Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha , had given calls to conduct ‘jalabhishek’ at Eidgah adjoining Sri Krishna Janambhoomi. The calls were later withdrawn but Mathura police are in no mood to take chances and have stepped up vigil for December 6. It was on December 6, 1992, that the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished at the site of a temple-mosque dispute. Under heavy police arrangement, the Friday Namaz was offered at the Shahi Masjid Idgah here. “The namaz was offered in a congenial environment,” SSP Gaurav Grover said. He said entry into the Idgah was granted on the basis of Aadhaar card. “I am happy that there is no change in cordial and affectionate environment in Mathura,” the senior official said. To control any untoward incident, district magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal and SSP Grover stationed themselves at the Deeg Gate police outpost, which is very close to the Idgah. In view of December 6, Grover said permission to hold traditional rituals by four organisations Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, Srikrishna Janmabhumi Nirman Nyas, Narayani Sena and Srikrishna Mukti Dal had been rejected. Narrating the details of force to be deployed, the officials said, five additional SPs, 14 Deputy-SPs, 40 inspectors, 1400 head constables and constables, 10 companies of PAC and six of RAF are being deployed from Saturday evening.

Police officer Navnath Rangat testified before the special judge for Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act cases S R Navandar on Saturday. Pune police had registered the First Information Report on the basis of Rangat's complaint on the day of the murder. The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the case later. Rangat told special prosecutor Prakash Suryawanshi that on August 20, 2013, he was on `Naka-Bandi' (vehicle checking) duty near the Omkareshwar temple when he spotted some people gathered on the bridge. When he reached there he saw a person (Dabholkar) lying in a pool of blood with two live bullets near him, and alerted Vishrambag Police station and the control room, he said. During cross-examination, defense lawyer Prakash Salsingikar pointed our that as per Rangat's statement of July 4, 2014, to CBI deputy superintendent D S Chauhan, he was not present at the Naka Bandi spot, but was taking rest at the Shaniwar Peth police chowky. He even called his wife from the landline of the police chowky around 7.20 am. Sometime later an aged person approached him and informed him about a man lying on the bridge in a pool of blood, the lawyer said, citing the CBI statement. Only then Rangat rushed towards the crime scene, advocate Salsingikar claimed. Rangat said the version recorded by the CBI, based on his Call Data Record, was not true. The defense also claimed that Rangat had denied seeing any person or motorbike passing when he was on Naka-Bandi duty. The court will examine Dabholkar's son Dr Hamid Dabholkar on December 18. The CBI has charge sheeted Virendrasinh Tawde, Sachin Andure, Sharad Kalaskar, Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave as accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dabholkar-murder-defense-questions-complainant-s-version-of-events-101638640312638.html
04-12-2021||Other||Gurugram: Capacity of C&D plant at Basai increased to 1,000 tonnes a day||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) can now process more construction and demolition (C&D) waste than what the city produces on a daily basis. Officials on Saturday said that the civic body has more than tripled its daily processing capacity at its Basai C&D processing plant from 300 tonnes per day (TPD) to 1,000 TPD.According to the MCG’s estimates, the city produces around 850 tonnes C&D waste daily.The increase in processing capacity will help expedite the clearing of legacy C&D waste scattered across the city, the officials said, adding that the plant started operating at its increased capacity early this week. The C&D plant at Basai was started in December 2019. “Initially, almost all the processed waste was being stored on the plant’s premises and earlier this year started overflowing beyond its boundary wall. To deal with the situation, in September, the MCG procured five acres of land from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority right opposite the plant site to store more processed waste,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The officials said that the availability of more space has facilitated in increasing the plant’s processing capacity.“Following procurement of land, we started storing processed waste on it. Then directions were issued to the concessionaire to increase the plant’s processing capacity to 1,000 tonnes. With this, work on clearing legacy waste will now be expedited,” said Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer (Swachh Bharat Mission), MCG.The officials said that the city has about 900,000 tonnes of legacy C&D waste which will be cleared in the next four years. Any waste dumped at one particular location for more than one month is considered the legacy waste, they said.In July this year, the MCG had issued a release stating that they have five designated locations at Sector 56, Kadipur, Transport Nagar, Wazirabad, and Sector 110 for dumping C&D waste. In September, the civic body also identified a new location in Basai as well as one near Baliawas village for the purpose.However, despite these designated sites, illegal dumping of C&D waste is rampant across the city, especially in newly developed sectors, areas around Golf Course Extension Road, Sector 29, and along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, said environmentalists. “Increasing the Basai plant capacity is not going to solve the MCG’s problems completely in tackling C&D waste. Two other challenges for MCG are ensuring that all C&D waste is only dumped at its designated sites and that illegal dumping is curbed due to fear of inviting heavy penalties. Otherwise, this violation will continue to be rampant across the city, and efforts against reducing C&D waste will not yield desired results,” said Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist.

We had told the forest staff that we will not be able to shift the animal at night," Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) run Kamla Nehru Zoo in-charge Uttam Yadav said. On Thursday, when the zoo staff went to the cage to shift the cub, they found that the mesh of the cage had been broken and the animal was missing, Yadav said. According to officials, the forest department and IMC were investigating the matter, but no one has been held accountable as yet. One of the largest animal welfare organisations in India – People For Animals – Indore president Priyanshu Jain said, “There appears to be serious negligence on the part of the forest department and zoo workers and the responsible people should face legal action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/forest-officials-search-for-injured-leopard-cub-missing-from-indore-zoo-premises-101638639125376.html
04-12-2021||Lucknow||Nowadays political persons are thinking they are above law: Allahabad HC||While rejecting the bail application of former MLA from Kasganj Hasrat Ullah Sherwani, who was convicted by a lower court of assaulting a person in the police lock-up over nine years ago, the Allahabad high court observed, “Nowadays, the legislatures and political persons are thinking themselves as above the law. This menace cannot be lightly taken and should be dealt with iron hand.” The appellant—Hasrat Ullah Sherwani—was a sitting MLA when the incident had taken place on August 30, 2012. He represented the Kasganj assembly constituency of UP’s Etah district from 2007 till 2012. Hearing the appeal filed by Sherwani seeking suspension of sentence and his release on bail during the pendency of the appeal against lower court’s conviction order, Justice Mohd Aslam observed, “It was his duty to raise the issue of misuse of law in Assembly and get it remedied but instead of it he himself misused the law and took law in his hand and pressurized the police personnel to adopt third degree and get him lodged in police lock up, this act of the accused amounts to misuse of police machinery, therefore, his act deserves no sympathy instead of condemnation”.The additional district and sessions judge, Kasganj, had on August 25, 2021 convicted Sherwani and seven others under various Sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC),including the offence of attempt to murder. As per the prosecution case, one Shamshad was lodged in the police lock-up in connection with some case. On August 30, 2012 at 2 pm, the accused-appellant Sherwani, the then MLA, along with other persons, including his relatives and supporters, came to the police station and instructed the police to beat Shamshad.After that Sherwani, armed with rifle and gun, along with his supporters who were armed with sticks proceeded towards the police lock-up and caught hold of Shamshad’s hand in the lock-up from outside and assaulted him with an intention to kill him by the butt of the rifle and other guns and sticks. However, he was saved when the then station house officer Ram Murti Yadav intervened.Thereafter, Shamshad lodged a First Information Report in this connection against the appellant and seven others on September 14, 2012 at Dhalana police station of Kasganj. The court has listed the appeal against the lower court’s judgment for hearing on January 10, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nowadays-political-persons-are-thinking-they-are-above-law-allahabad-hc-101638639857371.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||'Biggest expose': AAP alleges illegal sand mining in Punjab CM's constituency||Ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha on Saturday claimed that he found illegal sand mining being carried out in Chamkaur Sahib, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s constituency. Raghav Chadha made the accusation following his visit to Jindapur village in Chamkaur Sahib."Illegal sand mining in Charanjit Singh Channi constituency has been exposed. It is the biggest expose which will shake Punjab's politics," Chadha told reporters, according to news agency PTI."We are in Jindapur village, which is in the chief minister's constituency Chamkaur Sahib. Illegal sand mining is going on here openly. Sand is being illegally ferried in trucks," the AAP leader claimed.The AAP leader also went on to attack the ruling Congress in the state, saying the party was "patronising" the sand mafia.Recalling that Channi had declared that those connected to the sand mafia should not try to approach him, Chadha said, “But here we can see this mafia is enjoying the patronage of the ruling outfit.”Chadha said as per their estimates, 800 to 1,000 trucks, called tippers, filled with sand were being taken out from the site. "Right under the chief minister's nose and in his own constituency, this illegal activity is going on," PTI quoted him as saying."Channi's hoardings can be seen in the state that his government has checked various mafia. The truth is that in his own constituency illegal mining is going, so his claims are hollow. Another claim that people were getting sand at ₹5 per cubic feet is also hollow," Chadha claimed.On Friday, Charanjit Singh Channi attacked his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal calling him a "power greedy outsider" who wants to rule the state and accused him of misleading Punjabis. Channi also claimed that the AAP supremo had little knowledge about the state and was "groping in the dark for fulfilling his lust of power".Notably, Punjab is headed for assembly elections in early 2022. The Aam Aadmi Party is trying to come to power in the state after retaining its rule in neighbouring Delhi for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/biggest-expose-aap-alleges-illegal-sand-mining-in-punjab-cm-s-constituency-101638636434203.html

Earlier in view of the drastic decline in Covid-19 cases in Prayagraj and the country, the institute had started allowing students back on its campus in phases. The first to return were doctoral and post graduate students from July 2021 followed by select undergraduate students who were facing resources problem at home from September. “The lists of these students were prepared with the help of institute’s ‘Students’ Gymkhana’, the students’ representative body. The plan was to allow another batch of 250 students facing resources problems back on the campus. However, now this has been deferred,” said Vijay Kumar Chaurasiya, associate dean (student affairs), IIIT-A.The decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of all deans and heads of departments chaired by IIIT-A director prof P Nagabhushan on Thursday, he added. “In the high-level meeting, the members assessed the Covid situation, especially the cases of Omicron variant in the country, and decided that the institute is not allowing any student back on the campus for the time being. It was further decided that those who were earlier given permission to join back campus but could not join the institute due to some personal reasons would also not be allowed to join the campus till further orders,” he said. The official said, however, the 200-odd who had returned and after due process allowed to stay in hostels would continue to stay on the campus. “These students can also attend their labs and take the online classes using the resources made available by the institute,” Chaurasiya added.Similarly, the newly admitted first year students who are to report at the institute from December 20 and complete various formalities of admission too would be allowed to do so. “The plan is to closely monitor this evolving situation and then take a call in due course in accordance with directions from the union ministry of education,” he said.Further, all students have been requested to refrain from writing individual emails for joining the campus physically and instead send their request to the Students’ Gymkhana because all future decisions in this regard will be made as per the recommendation of the Gymkhana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/omicron-threat-iiit-a-halts-phased-opening-of-campus-for-now-101638638716884.html

Under its impact, Puri may experience the wind in the range of 45-50 km per hour. But districts like Ganjam, Gajapati and Puri may experience very heavy rainfall from tonight. However, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar would see heavy rainfall as was being predicted earlier,” said senior scientist Uma Shankar Das of Regional Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar. The gusting speed of the wind is likely to go up to 70 kmph in Puri.Districts like Balasore and Bhadrak may see heavy rainfall from Sunday evening as the system moves north-northeastwards along Odisha coast towards West Bengal coast after reaching Puri on Sunday noon.But farmers in coastal Odisha districts of Puri, Balasore, Bhadrak and Ganjam are worried as the rains would spoil their ripened paddy as well as vegetables they had grown. Already affected by delayed rainfall as well as the pandemic, paddy farmers and vegetable growers hoped for a decent harvest this season. But cyclonic storm ‘Jawad’ may have dashed their hopes.“Though we had managed to harvest paddy, we could not carry the crop to the safety of our home. There is not much time left,” said a farmer in the Balasore district. In Puri district, vegetable farmers resorted to distress sale of cauliflowers to ₹3 per piece afraid of the rains waterlogging their fields. “We had taken loans to carry out cauliflower farming and hoped to earn a decent sum this winter as the prices are still high in local markets. But that seems a remote possibility now,” said another farmer in Pipili block of Puri district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyclonic-storm-jawad-weakens-to-deep-depression-odisha-relieved-101638637820769.html

Chadha (63-65-64-66), 33, leading by one shot at the end of round three, sank four birdies, to end up with an impressive winning total of 21-under 258.Chadha negotiated the tough conditions to perfection through the week as he went error-free for 71 holes after his bogey on the first hole in round one. Abhijit thus lifted his third title, which also accounted for his first win in six years. He took home prize of Rs. 6.46 lakh to move up nine spots to 15th place in the PGTI Order of Merit.Rookie Kartik Sharma (66-60-67-71) of Gurugram, who was placed second, one shot off the lead, after round three, returned a one-over 71 on the final day to finish second at 15-under 264. Kartik’s round featured a birdie and two bogeys as the putts didn’t roll in for him. Nonetheless, it was a career-best finish for the left-hander who moved up seven spots to 18th place in PGTI’s merit list. It was also Kartik’s fifth top-10 this season.Kolkata’s Sunit Chowrasia shot the day’s best score for the second day in succession to finish third at 13-under 266. In round four, Chowrasia’s 65 was matched by Chandigarh’s Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (tied eighth at seven-under 272), Bengaluru’s C Muniyappa (tied 17th at three-under 276) and Gurugram’s Ankur Chadha (tied 26th at two-over 281).The par for the course was 70 during round four.

The day witnessed a light drizzle in the afternoon towards the closing stages of the tournament.Abhijit Singh Chadha, a silver medalist from the 2010 Asian Games, dominated the proceedings from the outset in round four as he began pulling away from the rest of the field early on. After nearest challenger Kartik missed the green and the subsequent chip-putts to drop bogeys on the second and third, Abhijit further capitalized with 10-feet birdie conversions on the fifth and sixth to stretch his lead to a massive five shots.Thereafter, Kartik could not convert his opportunities on the greens and Abhijit maintained his lead before further extending it with birdies on the 16th and 17th, making a mammoth 66-feet putt on the latter. Chadha finally emerged triumphant by six shots after Sharma picked up a birdie on the 18th hole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pune-golf-championship-chandigarh-s-abhijit-walks-away-with-title-101638637817898.html

However, those who visit physically, will be allowed at the holy site only if they are fully vaccinated.The civic body has decided to provide visuals of the memorial on its social media handles to avoid crowding at the memorial. As per the BMC’s estimates, nearly 10 lakh people from different parts of the country visit Chaitya Bhoomi every year on December 6. Nearly 500 stalls are set up to sell books, lamps, calendars, decorations, posters, T-shirts, watches and many other such items. However, this year no such permission is given.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We are technically only allowing the fully vaccinated. We have appealed to the citizens to not gather at Chaitya Bhoomi and opt for the online event.”Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednkar appealed that citizens should cooperate with the BMC officials in order to follow Covid-19 appropriate norms. On the other hand, Prakash Ambedkar, prominent Dalit leader and great-grandson of Dr Ambedkar, appealed to the followers of the Dalit icon not to visit the memorial on December 6 to avoid crowding. He urged them to stay at home instead of travelling all the way to Dadar, at a time when following Covid-appropriate behaviour is the necessity. Civic officials said that people can visit Chaitya Bhoomi virtually on the civic body’s social media handles. Every year on December 6, thousands of followers of Dr Ambedkar, as well as political workers, visit Chaitya Bhoomi, a memorial built at Dadar beach where Dr Ambedkar was cremated after he died in 1956.Meanwhile, the BMC in a statement on Friday said that they have ordered the closure of the Global Vipassana Pagoda at Gorai between December 5 and 7, owing to the pandemic.

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Second meeting with farmers soon: Khattar at Karnal open session||Hundreds of people with their written complaints queued up outside Karnal’s PWD rest house for the redressal of their grievances at chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s open session. Heavy police deployment and barricading was in place and the visitors were made to go through several security checkpoints to enter the venue. Arpita of Araipura in Gharaunda had reached there with her complaint against an encroachment on her land. She said she had to wait for several hours for her turn to raise her concern with the chief minister. Another man waiting in the line, Joginder Sahani, 78, of Karnal, said he had come to apprise the chief minister of a “scam” in the construction of the boundary wall of a cremation ground wherein a notice has been served by the Karnal municipal corporation. He said they had already raised the issue with the local authorities, but could not get any satisfactory response. There were several others who could not have a word with the chief minister and later returned by handing over their written complaints. During the four-hour open session, Khattar tried to sort out about 300 complaints on the spot and 165 complaints were heard one by one. In most of the complaints, directions were issued to the officers concerned for immediate redressal. Due to a huge rush, the chief minister could not address all visitors, but assured them required action. The chief minister said the open session was organised after a long gap due to the pandemic. Khattar said around 25 complaints were from nearby districts, but most of the people returned satisfied. All officers of Karnal district administration, including deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, besides superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia also attended the session.The last such session was organised in June last year at the same venue and the one before that was held in November 2019. In October, former Haryana chief minister and leader of opposition in the state assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda had also held an open session in Karnal and interacted with the people over the problems being faced by them during the BJP rule. Committee to hold talks with farmers: CM Reacting over Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s decision to form a five-member committee to discuss the pending issues with the government, the chief minister said either the state government or the Centre will constitute a panel to hold talks with the farmers on other issues, including the MSP.About the Friday’s meeting with farmers, Khattar said the talks could not reach any conclusion on some issues. The chief minister did not disclose why the talks remained inconclusive, but said that more meetings could be organised anytime in future. Replying a question that Haryana was in favour to reduce the National Capital Region (NCR) to a 100km radius, the chief minister said most of the parts of the state included in the NCR could not be developed and therefore there is a need to reduce this area as the state government will work in the development of these areas too.
04-12-2021||Lucknow||Omicron scare casts shadow over eastern UP saree business||The detection of highly contagious new variant of Crononavirus-- Omicron-- in Karnataka has started to show cascading effect on saree trade in eastern Uttar Pradesh, including Varanasi, with many southern states cancelling their orders leading to a dip in production by around 30%, say traders of the region.“A variety of sarees, including semi silk and silk, are weaved in Varanasi and adjoining areas like Mau in eastern UP. The wholesalers and retailers from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra buy sarees from us and sell them in their local markets,” says Mau-based saree trader Mushtaq Ahmad.But with Karnataka reporting two cases of Omicron, many southern states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana have cancelled 25% of their orders fearing lockdown.“This has made the situation very difficult for saree traders in UP who had already faced a lot of hardship during the first and second waves of the pandemic,” he said.“The situation started looking up since July 2021 and traders were hoping for a better scenario. In September, Mau and Varanasi based manufacturers started receiving orders for Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana where these sarees are well-liked for their designs. The festive and marriage seasons came as a little boost for the entire saree business. But with this new threat, the scene is once again looking bleak,” said Mushtaq. As per the trader, over two dozen silk saree wholesalers from Maharashtra and Karnataka were to visit Mau and Varanasi for placing new orders. But all of them have cancelled their trips. “As a result, we have decreased our production by up to 30%,” he added. Another Mau trader Zail Ali said: “What is the use of making more sarees, when the wholesalers have started cancelling the orders.”Babu Bhai, a Varanasi-based master weaver and saree manufacturer said: “I have heard about the threat of the new corona variant. Many wholesalers, who buy sarees from us, have cancelled their orders fearing that market may see a steep fall in buyers in case Omicron spreads its tentacle. The production has been decreased by 25%.”The adverse effect of this is not just limited to the sellers but weavers too are affected. “The cancellation of orders from wholesalers will have a direct impact on the livelihood of weavers of sarees, who work on powerlooms on a daily wage basis. With drying up of orders, powerlooms may have to shut their shops rendering these weavers out of job,” said Saif Ansari, a Varanasi-based trader.The saree industry, including Banarsi sarees and silk products’, has an annual business between ₹3000 crore and ₹5000 crore. Varanasi region’s saree business generates employment for over 3 lakh people, including 2.5 lakh weavers.

This is to be done by the DIOSs via online portal between December 3 and 12,” said Naval Kishore, secretary, UPSESSB-Prayagraj. A helpline number -- 8468007598-- has also been issued so that there is no difficulty in sending the requisition and details. It has specially been advised to the DIOSs that only verified requisitions of the vacant posts be sent after careful examination, he added. A missive in this regard has also been sent by the UPSESSB secretary to all DIOSs via e-mail marked “Very Important”. The DIOSs have also been asked to make sure that there are no vacant posts in the district other than those whose details are being sent. A certificate in this regard will also have to be given to the selection board, read the missive, a copy of which is with HT. An advertisement is expected to be released soon in this regard. The UPSESSB had earlier released an advertisement for the recruitment of 15,508 teachers on October 29, 2020 after a gap of almost four years of conducting last recruitment process. However, the advertisement was canceled due to legal hurdles. The recruitment against 15,198 vacant posts of teachers then re-started on March 15, 2021.The Supreme Court had ordered completing of this recruitment by October 31, 2021 following which the UPSESSB completed the recruitment process within the set deadline. For this recruitment, the information of vacant posts had been sought till October 2019. However, now that two years have passed since then, information regarding vacant posts has been sought keeping in mind teachers who are retiring till March 31, 2022. Principals too would be selected in this new recruitment drive. The UPSESSB has not issued an advertisement for recruitment of principals since 2013 and there is presently a significant shortage of principals in government-aided secondary schools. In the requisition sought by the board two years ago, 1453 posts of principals were found vacant. Since then a large number of principals have retired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mega-recruitment-of-teachers-principals-in-up-government-aided-secondary-schools-on-cards-before-polls-101638636497492.html

The bail was granted by the court of Additional Sessions Judge RV Jagtap after argument on a bail application made by advocate Aashutosh Srivastava on her behalf. Advocate Pravin Chavan is the special public prosecutor in the case. The decision was made on December 1 and the order was made available on December 3. A case against the DSK couple was registered in Sangli in May 2018 based on a complaint lodged by a retired government employee who invested ₹8,95,000 based on newspaper advertisement by the realtor to get 12% interest rate promised in the ads. “The Bombay High Court has already granted bail to our client in the main case which includes case under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act (MPID) registered at Pune. This is the second case in which she has been granted bail by the lower court itself. There is a third case in Kolhapur and two more cases at Pune for VAT and Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) which are ongoing. We have applied for bail/s in the local court/s in those cases. If and when she is granted bail in these, she will be able to come out of jail,” said advocate Srivastava. The couple and some of their family members and colleagues are lodged in the Yerawada Central jail since the couple’s arrest in 2018 from a hotel in Delhi. While Hemanti was granted bail, Deepak Kulkarni was denied bail by the Bombay High Court. Therefore, the defence lawyers have approached the Supreme Court with his bail application. About 32,000 investors have lost over ₹2,043 crore in the form of fixed deposits which DSK’s development company accepted for decades. After building a goodwill among people for multiple years by giving return on investment, the payments in the FD scheme started faltering around 2017-2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dsk-case-hemanti-kulkarni-gets-bail-in-a-case-registered-by-sangli-police-101638635596061.html

However, the cases have dropped by 5%.The civic body is also insisting on more RT-PCR tests rather than antigen tests. The corporation had a ratio of 40% RT-PCR and 60% antigen testing earlier, which is now increased to 55% RT-PCR and 45% antigen testing.The corporation has also issued notification to housing societies asking them to make sure that the international travellers under quarantine do not step out.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “Fortunately now, the high-risk countries are only three – South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe. We are notifying the housing societies about the international travellers coming back and asking them to make sure that they are following the quarantine rules. Also, if anyone from a high-risk country is found positive, the whole society will be sealed.”The corporation also plans to issue a notification to all service providers like petrol pumps, shops and commercial places that no service should be provided to a person who has not completed both vaccine doses. “In case a person has a medical condition that does not allow him to get vaccinated, he should have a doctor’s certificate to access any service. Even the housing societies would be asked to take watchmen, maids, housekeeping and other staff only those who have taken both the doses,” Bangar said.Currently, the average daily cases reported in NMMC are 21, down from 22 last week and from 45 a month ago. The testing currently done is on an average 7,999 which was 7,478 till last week. The doubling rate has also increased to 4,381 from 3,808 days. There are a total of 239 active cases now.Apart from testing, NMMC is also stressing on strict vigilance on masks in order to make sure that there is no surge again.“Every time the cases go down, the common public has a notion that the Covid has gone. Covid has not gone, nobody knows how many mutations would come and how many modifications would happen in the vaccine. Everyone needs to keep on making sure to wear the masks. While the delta variant needs an interaction with a positive person for around 30 minutes, the Omicron variant just needs five to ten minutes,” Bangar said. While the fine for the public is ₹500 for not wearing a mask, he has warned his NMMC staff that the fine would be more for them if found without a mask to ensure that they do not set an example of not taking the pandemic seriously.Besides testing, vaccination too has been getting a good response now, said Bangar. “Due to the media speaking about Omicron now, the response over the few days for vaccination is good compared to what it was a month ago. But it should also be kept in mind that just because one is vaccinated, wearing the mask should not be stopped,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amidst-omicron-scare-navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-increases-testing-by-7-in-one-week-101638633676742.html

It was a complete flop show,” said party vice president Suryakant Dhasmana.Dhasmana added, “During his address, PM Modi again mentioned the double engine government (BJP government at both Centre and state) for the development of the state. He did the same during previous elections in 2017. But it has been almost five years that the BJP has come to power in the state, but their double engine government failed to even start. It was because of this, that they have to change three drivers (CM) of that engine.”He said that the PM earlier promised to reduce inflation by reducing the prices of fuel and other essential items.“Instead, the inflation has only increased with the prices of essential items skyrocketing. People of the state have now understood that he has come again to befool them with fake tall claims. But this won’t happen again and the BJP will be taught a lesson in 2022 polls by the people,” said Dhasmana.The BJP however, termed the rally a successful one.“PM Modi’s event was a huge success which was evident with the fact that people from far away places had come to listen to him because he had a special affection towards Uttarakhand. He is the world’s most popular leader and under his leadership, the state is witnessing many significant development projects. Congress’ protests show their frustration,” said party state general secretary Kuldeep Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/congress-holds-protest-against-pm-modi-call-his-rally-flop-show-101638633436036.html

For the last three days, she had been trying to purchase fertilizer, unsuccessfully. “Today (Friday) is the third day when I am returning home without fertilizer. I reach BISCOMAUN (Bihar state co-operative marketing union ltd.) at 3 am. After 14 hours, I had to return empty-handed,” she says, expressing frustration over unavailability of fertilizer, especially DAP (diammonia phosphate) urgently needed for wheat crop. “Untimely rains destroyed our paddy and now the government is spoiling our prospects for rabi,” she laments.In south Bihar, farmers are on the boil due to unprecedented fertilizer shortage in peak Rabi sowing season. In protest, they have been blocking roads, pelting stones and raising slogans against the central government allegedly for sending Bihar quota fertilizer to Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to win the coming assembly elections.Only 14% of required DAP and 16% of required urea fertilizers have been received in four districts of Shahabad region, namely Rohtas, Kaimur, Buxar and Bhojpur. The region, which produced biggest share of paddy and wheat in the state, is called granary of Bihar.“In Kaimur district, only 1,275.75 metric tonnes (MTs) of DAP and 4,442 MTs of urea fertilizer have been against the demand of 8,999 MTs and 27,000 MTs, respectively, for Rabi season,” district agriculture officer Rewati Raman said, adding that 1000 MTs of DAP would arrive next week. Rabi sowing season in the region starts from November 15 and ends on December 15.Dhananjay Tiwary of Rampur, a big farmer, said that the central government had created an artificial crisis by sending the Bihar quota of fertilizers to the poll-bound UP and Punjab and state government is silent. The shortage, predictably, has led to a black market.The government rate for 50 kg bag for DAP is fixed at ₹1,200 and at ₹266 for urea, the DAO said.In the black market, however, fertilizers brought from UP are selling at much higher prices. Farmer Bajarangi Singh of Bhagwanpur said that the desired quantity of DAP and urea was available in black market at ₹1500 and ₹350 per bag. According to Singh, the agriculture department was giving only two bags of fertilizer to one farmer. Since the soil was drying fast, farmers had no option than purchase fertilizer from black market to sow wheat in time.The fertilizer crisis has also threatened to hamper sowing of rabi crops in Darbhanga. “Firstly, fertilizers like DAP (diammonia phosphate) and potash are not easily available in the market. If at all it is available, the prices have gone through the roof. Purchasing fertilizers at an exorbitant rate is beyond our reach,” says Hemchandra Singh, a farmer in Hayaghat block. Many farmers in Kushothar panchayat under Bahadurpur block alleged that a large number of unlicensed fertilizer, seeds and pesticides shops had cropped up in the area these days. “We have directed officials concerned to keep a strict vigil on the fertilizer distributors regarding the shortage and black marketing of fertilizers in the district,” Darbhanga district magistrate Thiyagrajan SM said.Shortage of fertilizer has also Seemanchal region where about 85 per cent people depend on farming.Sunil Kumar Jha, 45, of Japharpur village in Purnia said ‘We have been running from shop to shop, but cannot get DAP fertilizer urgently required for wheat sowing.”Agriculture department officials, however say the crisis will end very soon and DAP supply has even resumed. “At the same time, we are advising farming community to use alternate methods so that rabi crops don’t get affected,” Purnia district agriculture officer Prakash Chandra Mishra said.Inputs from Bishnu K Jha and Aditya Nath Jha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-rabi-sowing-bihar-farmers-face-fertiliser-crisis-101638632717398.html

Till December 2, the Covid death figures in the state stood at 9,664. However, as per the figures uploaded by the health department on December 3 late night, the deaths in Bihar increased by 2425.The change in figures was effected on the basis of compensation claims cleared across the state, officials of the health department said. The last audit of the Covid-19 death toll was done on June 9 last year, which added 9,375 more deaths, an increase of 72.8% over the 5,424 deaths attributed to the virus in the state till then. The change in the total number of fatalities done after a 20-day exercise to audit Covid deaths on directions of the Patna high court that spotted discrepancies in figures cited by different agencies in one district.“These deaths had remained unaccounted earlier. Applications for seeking a compensation of ₹4 lakh being provided by the Bihar government had been lying for a long time in districts. After verification of papers, the figures have been uploaded on the website,” said Bihar’s health minister Mangal Pandey. “There is nothing to hide. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had announced to provide compensation of ₹4 lakh to each family who died of Covid on the production of proper papers. These additional death figures are nothing but only those whose papers were found correct,” he said. Of the 2425 deaths, the maximum increase is from Patna (445), followed by Vaishali (210), Katihar (174), Gopalganj (162) and Jehananbad (135).The increase reflects deaths reported at private hospitals, in transit to health facilities, under home isolation and those dying of post-Covid complications after they tested negative, said a health department official, wishing not to be quoted.In August, Hindustan Times had reported that there were at least 251,000 excess deaths registered under the Civil Registration System (CRS) in Bihar since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak (from March 2020 to May 2021), which is 48.6 times the official number of confirmed coronavirus deaths (5,163) in the state in the same period.

Ramnaresh Paswan, deputy superintendent of police (SDP), Muzaffarpur Town, said, “The sealing was needed for the team of medical experts to investigate the matter.”On Thursday, police had lodged an FIR against 14 people in the case.Health minister Mangal Pandey, who met some of the patients admitted at Patna’s IGIMS, said, “Three persons underwent operation after admission at IGIMS on Friday night. Of the 65 cases operated on November 22 at the Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital, we are trying to locate others who were from districts of Sheohar, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, and even Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh,” said the minister.Meanwhile, Muzaffarpur chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday came out in support of doctors named in the FIR and blamed hospital management for tragedy. “Prima facie, much of the onus lies with hospital management as operation theatre and equipment are maintained by management, besides procurement of medicines.

04-12-2021||Ranchi||Paddy procurement: Around 65000 ‘farmers’ under scanner in Jharkhand||Around 65,000 people who sold paddy to the government under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime during the previous financial year are under scanner for allegedly fleecing the government by pretending to be farmers with fake registration. Around 1.79 lakh farmers had registered last year for the purpose and the state procured 62.8 lakh tons paddy against the target of 60 lakh tons. However, after scrutiny, the state government now feels that around 65,000 of those farmers who sold paddy to the government might have used wrongful means to get themselves registered. “These 65,000 farmers are having ration cards, which means they are under BPL category. So either they have fake ration cards or their farmers’ certificate and registration is fake. We are investigating this issue and action to be taken accordingly,” said Rameshwar Oraon, finance and civil supplies minister. The minister said some of these farmers have reportedly sold paddy ranging from 400 to 1000 quintals, which was unusual. The minister said as result, the state has fixed an upper limit of 200 quintals for each registered farmer for the current financial year. “At least in my knowledge, I don’t know any farmer in the state who can sell 1000 quintals of paddy. We are fixing the 200 quintal limit so that small and medium-scale farmers get benefitted from the scheme,” added Oraon. However, the state government this year has fixed the target of procuring 80 lakh tonnes of paddy. Procurement for this season is likely to begin December 15, for which payments will be done in parts. While 50% of the liable amount would be paid instantly after the procurement, the balance would be paid within the next three months..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/paddy-procurement-around-65000-farmers-under-scanner-in-jharkhand-101638632656055.html

Two days ago, agriculture minister Amarendra Pratap Singh had conceded in the state assembly that stocks of fertilizers available in several districts was less than the demand and all district agriculture officers had been asked to send the requirement of fertilizers so that supplies could be sent at the earliest. He said against the demand of 4.35 lakh metric tonnes of urea in October and November, there has been a supply of 3.43 lakh metric tonnes, which is 59% of the total requirement. DAP supplies is 35% of the total demand as of November, he said. “Several fertilizer companies have started dispatching supplies and the rakes are going to reach the destinations by December 5,” he said. Agriculture department secretary N Saravana Kumar could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, Rashtriya Janata Dal national vice president Shivanand Tiwary on Saturday slammed the state government for the shortage of fertilizers, alleging that these were being sold at a premium.“There is no preparedness in sight from the government side to tackle the shortage of fertilizers. The state government should immediately talk to the Centre to tide over this crisis,” Tiwary said.

The irrigation department then also sealed the PMC water pump for almost a month. Now, Fadnavis is blaming Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for water cuts.”Patil blamed the PMC and ruling BJP for water cuts in the city. He said, “It was expected that PMC would execute river rejuvenation project which is funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). If BJP had executed the project in time, more treated water would be released in the river and the irrigation department would not have issued such a letter. The BJP should answer why the JICA project got delayed. Funds are there, the project was approved seven years ago and tenders have been floated but work has not started yet.”On December 1, the irrigation department issued a letter to PMC and warned to cut the city’s water supply with the help of police bandobast. It invited criticism and Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, including other leaders, condemned the action of the irrigation department.On Friday, while inaugurating the BJP office, Fadnavis highlighted the water issue and appealed to the citizens to defeat the opposition who planned water cuts in the city.Earlier, Prashant Jagtap, president, NCP city unit; MLA Chetan Tupe and Sunil Tingre meet the irrigation department officials regarding the issue. Patil held a meeting in Pune and later addressed the media.Patil said, “I am ensuring that there would be no water cut for Pune city. We would consider the additional population due to the merging of new villages. There isn’t enough water in dams. But at the same time, PMC must need to execute the JICA project on priority and treat the sewage.”Mohol said he welcomes the decision taken by the minister. “I don’t not want to bring in party politics here. I attended today’s meeting called by minister and welcome the decision taken by him,” Mohol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-water-cuts-in-pune-says-jayant-patil-blames-bjp-for-delay-in-river-rejuvenation-project-101638632355867.html
04-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC issues SOP for passengers from at risk countries||The civic body on Saturday issued standard operating procedures (SOP) to monitor passengers arriving from “at risk” countries as they undergo a seven-day home quarantine mandated by the state. The war rooms of each of the city’s 24 wards will call passengers five times a day, and notify their housing societies to ensure that they do not meet anyone during their quarantine, the SOP stated. This comes in the wake of the new variant of concern (VOC) Omicron which was first detected from southern African countries two weeks ago and has now been detected in India too, including in Kalyan-Dombivli, near Mumbai. “BMC has introduced a unique and strict home quarantine monitoring mechanism for passengers arriving in Mumbai from at-risk countries. It will be as effective as institutional quarantine. Our objective is to prevent the possible spread of the Omicron variant in Mumbai,” Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Saturday. The “at-risk” list issued by the Union health ministry includes countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China and Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, and Hong Kong among others. According to state guidelines issued on December 2, all passengers arriving from these countries will need to undergo RT-PCR tests on arrival in Mumbai; if found positive, the passenger will be put into institutional quarantine or moved to a Covid-19 hospital. Saturday’s SOP has been issued to monitor those passengers who test negative on arrival. As a further precautionary measure, the state also designated three of these countries — Zimbabwe, Bostwana and South Africa — as “high risk” and passengers arriving from here (or with a travel history of a fortnight to these countries) will have to undergo a week-long institutional quarantine even if they test negative on arrival. Accordingly, passengers from these countries will not be given the option of home quarantine. The SOP issued on Saturday directed the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to send a daily list of international passengers arriving in Mumbai in the preceding 24 hours from high risk and at-risk countries and those who have visited these countries in the last 15 days to the Disaster Management Cell. The civic body has sought the names of only those passengers who reside in the geographical area of Mumbai.The disaster management cell would send the list to all 24 ward war rooms at 10 am. Following this, the civic health department staff will make calls to monitor and track the passengers and conduct contact tracing.“Ward war room shall call all the passengers under home quarantine and politely inform them that they are in 7 days home quarantine. They shall provide the passengers with proper information on Covid-19 and counsel them for concerns. Ward war room shall ensure that all passengers follow the home quarantine protocols by strictly calling them up 5 times a day and monitor their health status,” the SOP read.“The ward war room shall notify to housing society bearers of all such passengers who are under home quarantine. They shall ensure that these passengers strictly follow home quarantine and no visitors shall be allowed to these households. The housing society office bearers should notify any violations to the BMC,” it stated. The SOP further mandated that the passenger’s housing society would be notified, and following the home quarantine, the passenger would need to undergo Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests. “Any passenger violating the home quarantine protocol shall be liable for legal action under the relevant sections of the Epidemic Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2007. Such passengers shall be shifted to mandatory institutional quarantine,” the SOP further stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-issues-sop-for-passengers-from-at-risk-countries-101638632295773.html
04-12-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case: Charge sheet filed against Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze||The Crime Branch (CB) on Saturday filed a charge sheet against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze and two others in an extortion case filed by an hotelier. This is the first charge sheet filed against Singh, who has five First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against him in Mumbai and Thane police stations between April 28 and August 20, 2021.“We have collected evidence and recorded statements of many witnesses to establish how Singh and Vaze were running an extortion racket,” said special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap. Singh had recorded his statement in the case last week.The crime branch collected 69 audio clips of conversations between Vaze, complainant Bimal Agarwal and the witness, from whom Vaze allegedly extorted ₹35 lakh. The transcript of the audio clips forms part of the charge-sheet.According to the charge sheet, the witness stated that Vaze threatened to arrest him in a case registered by the Property Cell of the Mumbai police against cricket bookies though he claimed to have nothing to do with it. The witness said that Vaze reportedly sent him a message asking him to pay ₹2 crore if he wanted to avoid being arrested. The witness said that he was forced to pay the amount which he handed over to Kalpesh Patel, one of the accused in the case.During the course of its investigation, the Mumbai CB has also recorded statements of several bar owners, many of whom disclosed that Vaze collected monthly “protection amounts” from them at the behest of Param Bir Singh, whom Vaze referred to as “Number one.”This assumes importance in view of the fact that in his statements to the Enforcement Directorate, Vaze had claimed that he collected money from bar owners in Mumbai, based on the instructions of former home minister Anil Deshmukh.CB officials said the 1,895 pages long charge sheet against Singh and others contained statements of dozens of witnesses and was filed before the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13, in connection with his alleged role in planting explosives (gelatine sticks without a timer or detonator) in an SUV outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani in February, and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran to whom the car belonged.On August 25, the Goregaon police registered an extortion case against Singh, Vaze and others based on a complaint by hotelier Bimal Agarwal, who alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two bars he owned in partnership with others. The offence had reportedly taken place between January 2020 and March 2021, the police had said. The case was later transferred to CB Unit 11 for investigation.Besides Singh and Vaze, others charge-sheeted in the case include Alpesh Patel and Sumit Singh alias Chintu. While Vaze is in judicial custody, Patel and Sumit Singh are out on bail. The police are yet to file a charge sheet against two others accused in the case, namely Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati.Singh, who was recently suspended by the state from his post as the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard. He showed up before CB investigators last week after the Supreme Court granted him protection from arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-charge-sheet-filed-against-param-bir-singh-and-sachin-vaze-101638631755758.html

Bhonsle had quit NCP before the last assembly elections.Bhonsle’s visit was related to the Satara District Central Cooperative Bank (SDCCB) election and retaining his position as its chairman. He has sought Pawar’s help for the same. Bhonsle confirmed his meeting with the NCP chief, however, he said it has nothing to do with politics, except the chairman election of the cooperative bank.Bhonsle was among the eight sitting MLAs who left the NCP ahead of the state Assembly elections in 2019. He comes from the family of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji and is a cousin of former BJP member of Parliament (MP) Udayanraje Bhonsle, who is a direct descendant of Shivaji. His return to the party would be beneficial for the NCP and is in line with the party’s plan to recover lost ground in its bastion of the western Maharashtra region, said party insiders.There have been speculations that the MLAs and other leaders who left the party in 2019 wanted to return to NCP. However, Bhonsle has denied the allegations.“Yes, I met him. We (NCP leaders and him) fought the recently held elections for members of the board of directors together. We don’t contest cooperative elections on party lines and also not as a party candidate. The majority of the members elected in the body come from NCP. I met Pawar saheb just to request him to get one more chance as a chairman of SDCCB, as I have been on the post for over the past six years. It had nothing to do with party politics or anything else. The objective of the meeting was limited only to the chairman election,” Bhonsle told HT.The election for the chairman position of the director board is scheduled for December 6.According to Bhonsle, there won’t be any voting because the directors of the board will unanimously elect a chairman election. The board of directors has 21 members, of them, 12 are from NCP.“Since he comes from the family of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, his re-entry will be beneficial for the party in the western Maharashtra region, considering the strained ties between Udayanraje Bhonsle and Pawar,” said a senior NCP functionary.Udayanraje Bhonsle too had left the party ahead of the state Assembly election back in 2019 when he was an NCP MP from Satara Lok Sabha constituency. But could not retain the seat as BJP candidate in the bypolls and lost to Shriniwas Patil, a Pawar loyalist.Meanwhile, Satara district central cooperative bank (SDCCB) is considered the topmost district cooperative bank in Maharashtra as well as in the country. Bhonsle said the NPA (non-performing asset) of the bank has been zero for more than 18 years. Its gross profit for this year was ₹102 crore.

04-12-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena backs off from Mamata Banerjee’s ‘no UPA’ remark, says opposition needs UPA||The Shiv Sena has taken strong exception to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s declaration of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) being over in the country. Sena, the Congress’ ally in Maharashtra, said in its Saamana editorial that opposition parties need the UPA, and forming a parallel front of the opposition parties would be like strengthening Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Sena also asked Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to come forward and clarify what they intend to do with the UPA.“Although it is true that in West Bengal, she (Mamata) finished the Congress, the left and the BJP, doing politics by keeping Congress away from national politics is like strengthening today’s state with a fascist tendency,” said Sena and expressed their concern, “One can understand that (PM) Modi and the BJP want the Congress to be over. It is part of their agenda. But, if those fighting the Modi government and the BJP also feel the same, then it is a concern.”Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Banerjee’s statement in Mumbai earlier this week about no UPA was valid but a coalition or a front without the Congress party is politically not viable. “Mamata ji’s question on UPA’s existence is valid. Even Uddhav ji [Thackeray] has said in the past that the UPA should be strengthened and it should become more aggressive. We have to weigh the pros and cons of forming a new front in 2024. In the past, we have seen the third front but it has benefitted BJP in the end. So we think that the UPA must be strengthened... Keeping Congress out of the front is politically not appropriate,” Raut said.He added that Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is a prime example where parties who were at ideological loggerheads came together, which should be replicated. “There can be differences; like we are running a government successfully in Maharashtra. We have had differences with Congress and NCP, but we all came together to keep BJP out. Maharashtra is a prime example. Maha Vikas Aghadi is an example of UPA, everybody must sit together and deliberate over it.”He also assured, “We will all meet Mamata ji again along with all the leaders. If she thinks that Congress should not lead the UPA, a solution can be found through discussions. UPA is led by Sonia Gandhi ji and nobody has objected to it so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-backs-off-from-mamata-banerjee-s-no-upa-remark-says-opposition-needs-upa-101638629475716.html

Those who do not have any urgent work at the station should avoid taking the stretch and use alternate routes in the city,” said a traffic police officer of Kalyan west traffic unit.As per the SKDCL the SATIS work shall be completed in 36 months since it began. However, the work on revamping the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus depot, which is also part of this project, would take time as the consent from the MSRTC is yet to be received.“The work in the depot premises has not begun as we are yet to receive the consent from the state transport body. So far, the MSRTC has given conceptual approval. However, the final consent is remaining as the decision on cost and profit sharing is pending,” said Tarun Juneja, executive engineer for the project, KDMC.“A committee has been finalised to discuss the cost and profit sharing of the commercials to be set up at the depot premises. Once this decision is taken, the work at the depot premises will also begin. As of now, we are carrying out the work of flyover, skywalk, covering of nullah and building a parking lot,” added Juneja.

We had traced all his contacts, screened them and they tested negative,” Dr Chatterjee said.He added, “we will test all his contacts once again” after the reports that he carried the Omicron variant of the virus.Gujarat’s additional chief secretary (health) Manoj Aggarwal said, “A micro containment zone has been made where he is living. In the area, we will do the tracing, testing of people.”He landed in Jamnagar on November 28. Soon after he was running a fever and his doctor asked him to go for an RT-PCR test and he was found Covid-19 infected.People familiar with the matter said at least 10 people who came in contact with him have been quarantined and their test reports are awaited. The officials are also tracing 87 people who could have come in touch with him in the Jamnagar district.The man was visiting his in-laws at his native Morakda village near Jamnagar city and had been living in Zimbabwe, which has been classified as an ‘at-risk’ country, for many years.Meanwhile, 30 other passengers coming from Dubai to Ahmedabad and a woman who reached Vadodara from London have tested positive for Covid-19. Their genome sequencing is being done to ascertain if they have been infected with the Omicron mutant.On Friday, Aggrawal maintained that the Gujarat government would go ahead with its Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit scheduled for January and there was no change in it.Chief minister Bhupendra Patel on Saturday convened a high-level meeting with the health department to review the state’s preparedness to tackle the situation after the first Omicron-infected case was reported from Gujarat.An official statement from the CMO stated that while the chief minister stressed the need to step up three-Ts (tracing, testing and treatment), he appealed to the people to maintain social distancing norms and wear masks as well as sanitisation.

The accused, Sukanta Das (38) of the 5th TSR battalion killed Marka Singh Jamatia (subedar) and Kiran Kumar Jamatia (Naik Subedar) during their duty inside the camp. “We arrested him after he surrendered to us and took charge under voluntarily causing injury, murder and the Arms Act. He is supposed to be forwarded to court on Sunday after completing preliminary interrogation and other official formalities,” said a police official.According to the primary investigation of the police, Sukanta was likely to have been denied leave from his duty which he had applied for to see his ailing parents, and perhaps, out of frustration, he committed the act. Sukanta joined TSR service in 2002.Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb condoled their demise and announced ₹5 lakh compensation to the bereaved families along with benefits of the die-in-harness scheme. “My homage to our brave personnel of Tripura State Rifles, Subedar Marka Singh Jamatia & Nb Subedar Kiran Jamatia who died while on duty today. My condolences to bereaved family. #Tripura govt has decided to give ₹ 5 Lakh each to bereaved families.

04-12-2021||Mumbai||State govt sanctions revised proposal for multi-speciality hospital in Thane with helipad facility||The Maharashtra State Government has sanctioned a revised proposal of ₹213Cr to set up a multi-specialty hospital in Thane equipped with a helipad to airlift patients. This will be built in the space of the current civil hospital in the heart of Thane city.The State had earlier sanctioned ₹314Cr. Overall, a budget of ₹527Cr has been sanctioned for the project.As per the plan, the civil hospital will be replaced by a 900-bed multi-specialty hospital with 200 maternity and 200 super-specialty beds, while the remaining 500 beds will be general beds. In addition, two separate ICUs will be set up in each department. The capacity of the hospital will be tripled and it will have health facilities like urology, oncology, oncosurgery section, cardiology, cardiovascular section, nephrology and dialysis.Such specialty wards will help treat cancer, brain-related ailments, respiratory and heart diseases. It will also have a dedicated theatre and training hall for medical examination and will also include a helipad for airlift.“Currently, the civil hospital has a capacity of 300 beds. Patients from Thane and Palghar districts, especially from rural areas, depend on the civil hospital for treatment. Keeping in mind the growing population of these two districts, the old hospital is falling short. Hence, we are setting up this multi-specialty hospital keeping in mind the needs of the growing population,” said Kailas Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane District.Meanwhile, a two-storied structure near the Mental Hospital in Thane has been set up where the maternity and paediatric ward would be shifted from the Civil Hospital while it is under renovation.“We will start shifting the women and paediatric ward to the additional facility near the Mental Hospital. The Covid and emergency wards will continue to be at the existing Civil Hospital. Once the renovation of the hospital begins, based on the pandemic situation, we shall take a call regarding the Covid facility,” added Pawar. The Civil Hospital is a stone structure built during the British era in 1835. The British used it as a medical facility and it has continued to serve patients in Thane and nearby areas all these years. In 2017, the plan of a multi-specialty hospital was sanctioned but as the funds were not sufficient, the project was not taken further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-govt-sanctions-revised-proposal-for-multi-speciality-hospital-in-thane-with-helipad-facility-101638624556028.html
04-12-2021||Mumbai||Colleges, students yet to pick up MU’s off-beat programmes||Mumbai Recently, the academic council (AC) of the University of Mumbai introduced 14 new UG and PG courses, most focusing on research and industry trends with the inclusion of sports management and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Data Science. While the courses go far beyond the regular sectors by tapping into the latest industry trends, many colleges feel that students might not opt for them right away.“Many courses recently approved by the AC can’t be degree programmes because they are application-based and for a student to pick such a course for a bachelors degree, they need some background or understanding of the course in advance. Instead of implementing UG and PG programmes in these subjects, most colleges are opting for certificate courses so as to give students a general idea of the topic at hand and then prepare them to practically apply what they learnt,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of K C College, Churchgate.After repeated reminders, MU did not release data on the number of affiliated colleges implementing the existing self-financed courses offered through various departments.The last few programmes introduced by the university in the past decade include a BSc in Hospitality Studies and a BA in Culinary Arts, self-financed courses including BCom in Accounting Finance (BAF) and Banking Insurance (BBI) or BA in Mass Media Communication and Journalism (BAMMCJ). As of now, only a handful of MU-affiliated colleges have opted for the courses. Many pointed out that since there already are hospitality institutes with ready set up of a kitchen and culinary stalwarts offering degrees within the city, not many colleges would opt to offer BA in Culinary Arts. “The BSc Hospitality Studies course has slowly picked up demand, thanks to the demand for tourism management across the world and over the last few years, more colleges have applied for the same and the existing ones have applied for additional divisions,” said a spokesperson for the university.“These courses were introduced at a time when the industry was calling for fresh graduates with more than just accounts skills but with management skills as well. The media industry was booming too and BMM gave wings to many hopefuls who were dreaming of a future in the media and public relations industry. At present, most new courses seem to be forced with very little thought. Plus, very niche programmes automatically means colleges struggle to find appropriate faculty for the same,” said a former AC member of the university. He added that instead of adding new programmes in research fields, the AC should focus on introducing more courses in finance, management and accounts for undergraduate students.In 2019, the university made news for introducing a host of diploma/certificate courses in new-age topics including Hip Hop Studies, Data Science as well as Urban and Regional Planning among others. However, till date, only a handful of colleges have applied to offer such courses to their students.“One of the biggest problems in the academic council at present is that meetings are being held online still, so discussions are not welcome. The recent approval of the new courses was also done despite objection by many members but because the meeting was held on a virtual platform, our voices were not given heed,” said a senior member from the MU academic council.Experts have also pointed out the high attrition rate among faculty in self-financed. “Many colleges have consistently paid their teachers very poorly which has led to vacancies in faculty positions. This has also led to colleges applying for closure of certain self-financed courses in rural Maharashtra,” said Madhu Paranjape, General Secretary, Bombay University and College Teachers Union (BUCTU).

Secondly, it will be visible to everyone online on a regular basis. This is the first time we are doing it in the KDMC vicinity,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.KDMC has currently chosen two plants. Simultaneously, all the five sewage treatment plants in KDMC will have this system set up in the coming days. The Adharwadi plant has a capacity of treating 25MLD of sewage. At present, 22MLD is treated here and the capacity of Barave plant is 15MLD, while 10MLD is treated at present.The water obtained from the sewage treatment plant is used for gardening purposes by the civic body across the KDMC limits.“I think there is a need to have regular monitoring of air, water and noise across the city and all the information about the same should be visible online for the knowledge of citizens and stakeholders,” said Sanjeev Shinde, 38, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan.
04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal needs stricter safety rules for paragliders||The recent fatal mishaps while paragliding in Himachal Pradesh’s Bir-Billing and Dharamshala have put the spotlight back on the safety of pilots and tourists and raised questions about the role of government agencies in checking them. Also read: Samyukt Kisan Morcha threatens agitation in Himachal over demandsDespite the government hype over promotion of aerosports in the state, the reality remains that flawed regulation has led to illegal operations, endangering the lives of adventure seekers. On October 16, a 35-year-old man, who was assisting a pilot while taking off, fell to his death after being stuck in the paraglider at Dharamshala. In another mishap on November 21, a 30-year-old man from Kangra died after he fell from a paraglider during a tandem flight at Bir village of Baijnath. It was alleged that safety harnesses were not properly fastened by the pilot. After the accident, the administration imposed a temporary ban on tandem flights. 24 paraglider crashes in five years In the past five years, more than two dozen paraglider crashes have been reported in Bir-Billing and Dharamshala, adjoining Mandi district and Manali. At least 10 people, including tourists and foreign nationals, have been killed in these crashes, most of which have occurred at Bir-Billing, the world’s second best and Asia’s best paragliding site. However, people involved in conducting paragliding activities say the ban is not the solution and real problem is lack of proper regulation. Sources say that the HP Aero Sports Rules don’t conform to guidelines of international bodies, such as the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) or World Air Sports Federation. Also, the state authorities lack experts with technical knowhow of paragliding. According to international regulation, one who flies a paraglider is a pilot and levels have been defined from P1 to P5 based on experience, after which come trainee instructors, instructors, senior instructor, sports tandem pilots and commercial pilots. The experience of flying hours is fixed for each level. Same rules for sport and tourism activities In Himachal, the licence for tandem flight is granted without the pilot having passed these levels or sometimes even without the licence for solo flight. Billing Paragliding Association (BPA) chairman and former minister Sudhir Sharma says paragliding is an adventure sport that is “very weather dependent. Tandem flight that is conducted for joy rides for tourists is a commercial activity. The problem is that sport and tourism activities are being governed by the same set of rules.” “The state does not have even an Act in this regard. The Himachal Pradesh Aero Sports Rules were framed in 2004 and amended in 2015 when Billing hosted a Paragliding World Cup. However, these rules don’t differentiate between sport and tourism activities,” he said. The need of the hour is to enact a law and separate the two activities. Untrained pilots have got licences He said licensing was also an issue. The licences for tandem flights are granted by the tourism department but the experience of the pilot is rarely considered. A person trained at Dharamshala is allowed to operate at Billing, while the weather condition and flight-time is way different and needs different skill sets. He said the BPA has constituted a technical committee to frame draft of new safety rules that will be submitted to the government. Due to commercialisation of paragliding, many untrained pilots have managed to get licences as there is no proper mechanism to check their credentials, leading to fatal mishaps. DC asks tourism dept to issue licence after scrutiny Gurpreet Singh Dhindsa, a pilot, says emphasis should be on training and adherence to pilot levels to curb such incidents. “The licence for tandem flights must be granted only after the pilot has attained the required level and experience,” he said, adding there should also be technical analyses of eventualities so that the shortcomings can be removed. Kangra deputy commissioner Nipun Jindal said he has directed the tourism department to issue licence for tandem flights only after scrutiny. District Tourism Development Officer (DTDO) Prithi Pal Singh said a panel has been constituted to probe the recent crash. “The operators have also been urged to come forward with their suggestions to curb such incidents. They can suggest changes in the rules,” he said, adding that to enact a law or frame policy is the prerogative of the government. Recent mishaps November 21, 2021: Thirty-year-old man dies after falling from paraglider at Bir. October 16: Man assisting pilot in tandem flight falls to death after being stuck in the paraglider. January 8: Delhi man, who took off from Billing, goes missing in the Dhauladhar ranges. His body was found after five months. November 30, 2020: Canadian pilot killed after his paraglider crashlanded near Bir. February 10: Trainee pilot killed after paraglider crashlanded in forest near Bir. 
04-12-2021||Mumbai||Man accused of cheating Mumbai woman, 31, after hacking her phone arrested: Cops||MUMBAI: A 41-year-old man in Pune was arrested on the complaint of a Mumbai woman who alleged that the suspect hacked her phone, transferred ₹30 lakh from her bank account and accessed her private photos that he used to blackmail her, police said.The woman, a 31-year-old animator, told the police that she put up with the blackmail for more than a year, giving in to his demands for money over and above the ₹30 lakh he transferred from her account, an officer at the central region cyber police station said.Like when earlier this year, Yuvraj Bhosale, the man arrested from Pune’s Talegaon, spotted her with a new sports utility vehicle on her social media photos and asked her to give him the vehicle. When she refused, he sent three associates who snatched the SUV from her. She didn’t complain to the police.It is not clear what prompted her to approach the police. She reached out to the cyber police station recently about the blackmail but was initially wary of pressing charges. On Wednesday, she finally submitted a formal complaint.Deputy commissioner of police (Cyber wing) Dr Rashmi Karandikar set up a team led by senior inspector Sanjay Govilkar to track down the accused. Govilkar’s team arrested Bhosale on Friday.The woman wasn’t Bhosale’s first victim, and so far, they know of his three aliases; Satish, Raje Veer and Virendra Sinha. He already has eight criminal cases registered against him since 2013, the year Bhosale started targeting women, a senior police officer said.In his initial interrogation, Bhosale told the police that he graduated with a degree in psychology graduate and had also studied a bit of criminology.Police said he mostly selected his potential victims from profiles uploaded on matrimonial websites. “If he wanted to target a doctor, then he would pose as a doctor and after gaining the woman’s trust, blackmail her and extort money,” the senior officer said.When he approached the 31-year-old animator from Mumbai’s Dadar via a matrimonial website, Bhosale posed as an animatorIn her complaint to the police, the woman, a divorcee, said she was living with her parents and finally gave in to family pressure to get remarried in 2019 and put up her profile on matrimonial sites.A few weeks later, the woman said in her complaint, she received WhatsApp messages from an unidentified person, and a bunch of photographs, the second police officer. These were her private photographs that she had put away in her phone’s password-protected folder.“She says that someone hacked her mobile phone,” the officer said.“She thought if the hacker could get access to her private files kept in a password-protected folder, then he may also get access to her banking details linked to her email and the mobile number. According to her complaint, she found someone had fraudulently transferred ₹30 lakh from her bank account after disabling the SMS alert service of her bank account, to prevent the bank’s message from reaching her,” the officer added, citing the First Information Report registered by the police. The man also called her up on phone, threatening to leak the photographs if she complained to the police.Police said the woman did not spell out how much money she paid to Bhosale. “These aspects will be revealed during the investigation when officers analyse her bank statements as well,” another police officer said.Two mobile phones have been seized from Bhosale and sent for forensic analysis. The SUV that his associates took away from the woman has also been recovered from him, the officer said.Bhosale has been booked on charges of cheating by personation, cheating, criminal intimidation, provoking someone to breach peace, insulting the modesty of any woman, stalking, extortion, and several provisions of the Information Technology Act relating to illegally accessing a computer resource and dishonestly using someone’s password.During its preliminary investigation after Bhosale’s arrest, the officer said, the cyber police has come across instances of the man cheating five other women including one who said she lost around ₹20 lakh. “I think some of them will come forward to file FIRs,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-accused-of-cheating-mumbai-woman-31-after-hacking-her-phone-arrested-cops-101638618194542.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Samyukt Kisan Morcha threatens agitation in Himachal over demands||The Himachal Pradesh unit of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has threatened an agitation against the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government’s “anti-farmer policies” if it does not meet the 15 demands put forward in August and call members for talks. Also read: Covid relief: Punjab hikes aid for construction workersAfter a meeting of the SKM in Shimla on Friday, its state convener Harish Chauhan said: “A pamphlet listing out the 15 demands of the farmers will be distributed to strengthen the movement in the state. Meetings at the block, tehsil and sub-divisional levels will be held from December 20 to chalk out SKM’s strategy.” The SKM wants the minimum support price to be made a legal right besides implementation of the market intervention scheme on the lines of the apple procurement in neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir. It seeks open bidding in markets and the stopping of arbitrary recoveries from farmers, such as labour and demand draft charges. “The farmers should be allowed to keep 25% of their apple crop in the compressed atmospheric (CA) stores built by corporates as had been agreed upon while granting permission for the construction of such stores,” Chauhan said, adding the government should provide 90% grant to farmers’ cooperative societies to build CA stores at the local level. The SKM also wants the hike in price of packaging material rolled back besides compensation to farmers for loss caused by natural calamities. It sought the restoration of the subsidy on fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, and fungicides. Those affected by land acquisition will protest in front of the state assembly at Dharamshala during the winter session against the BJP government’s delay in implementing the Land Acquisition Act, 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/samyukt-kisan-morcha-threatens-agitation-in-himachal-over-demands-101638615554366.html
04-12-2021||Other||Mongolian delegation member found Covid-19 positive, isolated at Bodh Gaya||A member of the 23-member delegation from Mongolia, which visited Bodh Gaya in Bihar a couple of days ago, has been found Covid-19 positive. While the Mongolian delegation member has been isolated at Bodh Gaya, the 20 other locals with whom he is believed to have come into contact during the two-day stay in the holy city, have also got been tested for RTPCR by the local administration. An RT-PCR test of the delegation was done when it arrived. While 22 members of the delegation were found negative, one person is reported to be positive. “He was found asymptomatic in the test. But we are trying again to get done another test. His sample has been collected for this purpose. At present, he is in isolation and will be there for another 10 days,” Abhishek Kumar Singh, DM, Gaya and the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) chairman, said. A Parliamentary delegation from Mongolia led by the State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia, Gombojav Zandanshatar was on a four-day visit to the country since December 1 and on Thursday (December 2) the delegation arrived in Bodh Gaya in a special aircraft to visit the sites related to Lord Buddha. During the two-day stay, the delegation visited the Mongolian temple and the famous Dungeshwari hills where Lord Buddha had meditated for seven years before attaining enlightenment. And before leaving Bodh Gaya on Friday (December 3), the Mongolian delegation visited Mahabodhi temple, the UNESCO World Heritage Site at the holy city and prayed at the Garbha Griha at the temple and also under the Bodhi tree where Lord Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. BTMC secretary N Dorje could not be contacted to comment. Meanwhile, some tour planners, hoteliers and guides at Bodh Gaya have expressed concern over the current situation. “We are worried whether the Mongolian delegation member has been carrying Omicron. Being in the security, he must have accompanied the delegation everywhere and must have interacted with many at Mongolian temple, Dungeshwari hill and Mahabodhi,” a tour planner at Bodh Gaya who did not want to get quoted, said. 
04-12-2021||Pune||Pune Startup Mantra: Adding the tech-know gear to every mile of the delivery chain||Truck drivers bid to pick-up, and/or, drop off of a consignment; this is already a reality TV show, at least one based out of the US. Forza Logistics Techlabs is a technology-led logistics company that has bought that reality to India. TruckBhejo is the app that gives drivers and customers access to the platform that, to drop the founders’ elevator pitch line, “reliable, efficient, and capacity-agnostic trucking solutions to companies across every mile of delivery”. The company serves some major players in the grocery, manufacturing, retail, telecom, and FMCG sectors and is expanding its footprint in the small and medium segment. All that is currently part of the “define the scale” and monetise it endeavour and this tech-driven logistic service provider. What fascinates is the idea of truckers bidding for a consignment. Bid to drive… Registered vendors are provided access for ‘live’ orders on the platform. For each order, they are able to view the key order details like material, loading location, unloading location, vehicle type required. Vendors then bid for that order by sharing their quote through the app. Similar bids are collected through a pool of vendors who have access to live ranking against their bids.Vendors have the option to revise their bids and increase their chances of winning the order. Post completion of bidding time, order is allocated to the lowest bidder. Vendor performance is also regularly monitored to ensure qualified vendors operate through the platform and irrelevant vendors are deregistered/blacklistedThrough the mobile app, vendors have access to live bids to win any orders through the platform. These future orders which are under bidding will be visible under the bidding section till closure. Once bids are received then the lowest bidder is allotted the order and these orders are visible under assigned jobs for vehicle deployment. In the beginning… Nilesh Ghule comes from a family of truck drivers. Originally from Nashik, he came to Pune in 2005 and completed his engineering education from the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) and after a short stint at Infosys, went on later to get an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bengaluru, where he met Supreet Kumar, his co-founder. The duo worked together at Reliance Jio before starting this venture. Says Ghule, “Logistics was not new to me, but never looked at it as business per say, as I have witnessed this sector from the driver’s viewpoint. After my higher education, I mostly worked with tech and telecom companies. During our tenure at Reliance Jio, while managing the mobility products, we realised for the first time that logistics is a bigger problem for the big companies. They could not get consistent and timely placement of vehicles. The way logistics industry was structured was people had their own way of doing it. Some people were doing only last mile, or middle mile or first mile. Even types of vehicles were different. So, interaction with multiple vendors was necessary to get your requirement fulfilled.” “Even in 2015-16 most of the business used to happen on calls. We thought that this is the right time when we can actually look at segment like logistics. Secondly, the market itself is extremely huge and fragmented. So, this was the best playground for technology to bring in drastic changes in the logistics’ sector,” he added. Technology-driven logistics Ghule and Kumar decided in July 2016 to form their own company which would be tech-driven and address customers’ end-to-end supply chain needs – starting from the first mile to the last mile. Says Ghule: “It took us six months to go market with a finished product. It has been five years we are operational. The simple mission of our company is to create a technology-led FTL (full trucking logistics) network which would provide end-to-end supply chain coverage to customers. Our services and solutions bring tangible positive transformations as it works to deliver an immaculate customer experience through its three differentiators that are Smart, Scalable and Sustainable. All major functions of business starting from driver management to vehicle deployment, enroute tracking of vehicles, billing, everything happens through an in-house technology platform which we have built.” Recipe for success When asked about how they manage the drivers, Ghule said, “We mostly work with owner-drivers, i.e., people who own their vehicle and drive it themselves. That’s how middlemen get removed. We also get reliability from this particular arrangement. The owner-driver would not damage goods, nor steal material. Another benefit is lower costs as middlemen are removed. That is the recipe for our success. We have very close control on the supply side and we optimally deploy this supply – drivers - to the large B2B corporates. We have FTL contracts with all the major players. It has been a fantastic journey and that’s how the business has grown over the years.” Hearing ‘NO’! Ghule and Kumar were not accustomed to taking ‘no’ as an answer. That was the first thing which hit them when they started to go the market. Says Ghule, “Convincing truck drivers was not a problem. In 2016-17 technology was extremely miniscule when it came to truck drivers. They were using old Nokia phones. Penetrating the application into the driver’s hands, making them aware of the features was also a challenge. We believed that soon complete digitisation will happen in India. That belief of having technology at the core of our operations has actually helped us in the last five years.” “Second challenge was when we started approaching customers in the market, there was reluctance to new changes. Convincing a customer about the benefits of a technology platform which can bring efficiency to their operations and help their business grow faster was a challenge. The first important lesson we learnt was till the time you don’t provide a service which actually fits the customer’s needs you would find it very difficult to get that first customer. Once you have the minimum viable product (MVP) which is actually addressing the problem of a customer, slowly, steadily you start building your own capability and start building network of customers,” he added. Operation hubs and customers TruckBhejo operates across industries starting from e-commerce, e-grocery, telecom and retail and caters to two sets of customers– large corporates and small and medium enterprise (SME). Most of the business for the startup comes from locations like Bhiwandi, Ahmedabad, Vapi, and Pune. Ghule says, “We onboarded Paper Boat as our first customer in 2016. Today we have 42 customers including some big names like HUL, Nestle, Colgate in FMCG segment; Amazon, Flipkart in e-commerce and Reliance and DMart in e-Grocery and Retail; Larsen & Toubro in infrastructure. We also have a contract with the Central government for Indian Security Press Nashik where we manage very high value cargo. We have a total team of 62 members with offices across Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Kolhapur, Vapi, Surat, Ahmedabad and Delhi.” RevenuesSays Ghule, “In B2B contract business, on historical basis, we have done gross margins of about 13 to 15 per cent per transaction. We are in process of audits and hence, we can’t reveal revenue figures for last five years. However, last financial year we have done a revenue of about ₹32 crore. The company has been growing at CAGR 110 per cent.” “In B2B, our business model is that we provide x rate to the customer based on the type of vehicle and the lane in which the particular vehicle is running. The price which we get from the customer vs price which we pay to the driver is our profit margin. As such there are no platform charges for the B2B enterprises,” he stated. FundingAmount of total equity/debt capital raised and capitalisation plan of planned capital raised and its allocation TruckBhejo is currently funded by the Angel investors. Amount raised by the company as part of seed round with participation from marquee angel investors like Kunal Bajaj, Anshuman Ghosh is Rs1.6 crore in equity + Rs3.75 crore in debt Initial capital put in by Nilesh Ghule and Supreet Kumar - ₹1 lakh “Our company has been profit after tax (PAT) positive since inception. We have been on a sustainable growth track and grown in terms of number of vehicles, geographies served, sectors which we cater and the supply chain legs,” says Nilesh Ghule, co-founder, TruckBhejo Insurance coverWhat is the insurance cover for TruckBhejo if a driver dies in an accident or goods are destroyed enroute? “Our clients ensure that there is insurance cover available at all times for the material transported (transit insurance), vehicle insurance and driver insurance (life, medical). Transit insurance is typically covered by the customer as they have large volume of material movement of high value while life/medical insurance is covered by the drivers/vendors where we encourage them to get themselves covered and help them get best rates through our partner network of insurance providers,” sayd Ghule.Future plans Road infrastructure is improving which will remove inefficiencies and reduce the logistics cost in the country. “Considering rising fuel prices, I feel electric vehicles (EV) are the future. However, till the time we get such technology wherein the EV vehicles can run across the difficult terrain and also have the infrastructure around it to charge the vehicles, maintenance. it will take some time for EV, especially in heavy commercial vehicles’ segment, to have good penetration. But in last mile distribution like within cities we are already seeing the uptick. We have also started working on EV project and are in discussion with few of customers to deploy EVs with them,” says Ghule, adding, “In next 3 years, will have presence in around 200 to 250 cities. In terms of fleet strength, would have 20,000 vehicles on the platform.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-adding-the-tech-know-gear-to-every-mile-of-the-delivery-chain-101638615434353.html
04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Covid relief: Punjab hikes aid for construction workers||In the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections early next year, the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government has increased the financial assistance under the Balri Scheme for registered construction workers and labourers from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000. The financial assistance under the scheme is given to workers when a girl child is born at their house. Also read: ‘Former Punjab CM only worked for 2 hours; I just rest for 2’: Channi at HTLSThe state government has also hiked the monthly and family pension of construction workers and got the nod of the Punjab Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board to give a Diwali gift of ₹3,100 to each registered worker. These decisions were approved during the welfare board’s meeting on Friday evening. Officials said the decisions were taken as the construction workers were facing financial hardship due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The minimum wages have not been revised since 2019 and construction workers are facing financial hardship due to restrictions imposed by the central and state governments,” the agenda of the labour department read. The board approved the proposal of giving ₹3,100 to registered workers as announced by Channi. An official said there are 3,78,647 registered workers with the board. Therefore, ₹117.38 crore will be spent on this Diwali gift. The government has hiked the monthly pension from ₹2,000 to ₹3,000 and family pension from ₹1,000 to ₹1,500 a month. The board provides monthly pension for registered construction workers once they attain the age of 60 years and family pension is given to the spouse of the deceased registered workers. Besides, the state government had proposed to hike the amount under the Shagun Scheme from ₹51,000 to ₹61,000 and purchase 27,000 mobile phones at a cost of ₹13.57 crore for children of construction workers. However, these proposals have not been approved by the board so far. Sangat Singh Gilzian, the minister of labour, said, “We have increased the amount of Balri Scheme, monthly pension and family pension. But the proposals of hike in the Shagun Scheme and purchase of mobile phones are still under discussion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-relief-punjab-hikes-aid-for-construction-workers-101638614354113.html
04-12-2021||HTLS||Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi speaks on his surprise elevation and what it means||NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday said his elevation to the state’s top executive position has given the poor confidence and is a win for the country’s democratic system, and that his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh was dropped as he did not have time for people and development works.Channi, Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister, who replaced Captain Singh on September 19, said he will ensure that nobody goes through the pain of poverty that he had to undergo in his life. “I understand the pain of poor people, farmers and the middle class as I have gone through that pain. And, that is why all programmes of Punjab government are towards providing relief to poor and middle-class people,” the chief minister said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.Also Read: This is a new era, Congress also adapting: Charanjit Singh Channi at HTLSOn a Dalit being nominated as the chief minister of the state having 32% Dalit population, the chief minister described it as a change where the power is being transferred from the “elite” to the poor. “Earlier, the power was getting transferred from one elite to another. These elite were even above upper castes. Now, the power is in the hands of people,” he said in a conversation with HT’s national political editor Sunetra Choudhury.Channi who has been extensively touring the state, occasionally even taking children on a joyride in his official helicopter, said he has opened his home for people around the clock. “One day someone came to me at 12.30am. with a problem. I called the district collector and the problem was sorted out. This is our job and we have to do it,” he said.On the Congress’s decision to name him chief minister, Channi said he was, like everyone else, surprised too. Channi said he cried when Rahul Gandhi conveyed the decision to him.“I cried on the phone when Rahul Gandhi told me that I would be CM. I told him please select someone else. But, he told me the decision has been made,” Channi said. In the lighter vein, he said, “I was municipal councillor (MC) and now I am CM. So, now MC has become CM. This is magic of democratic system,” he said, explaining that he counted his appointment as a win for democratic system because it established that someone born in poverty could rise to become a chief minister.Channi said Captain Amarinder was replaced as he was not accessible to people and lived in a highly-guarded farmhouse and the party was just implementing his promise before the 2016 assembly elections that he will not contest again.“Captain worked for two hours, I sleep for two hours. That is the difference,” he said. To emphasise his point that the former chief minister did not have a mass base, Channi underlined that not a single Congress MLA went with Captain “and that shows how wrong he was in his self-assessment”.Channi also said that Amarinder Singh’s plans to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for Punjab elections didn’t really come as a surprise to him. “When he was in Congress and CM we knew, he was half with the BJP,” he said.On his other political rival in Punjab, Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Channi repeated that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was a “kala angrez” (dark-complexioned Englishman) as Kejriwal does not belong to Punjab and does not know anything about the issues in the northern state.Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition party in the Punjab assembly and is hoping to better its performance in the February-March assembly elections in the state. “People in Punjab don’t believe in Kejriwal,” Channi said.The 58-year-old chief minister also stressed that he was working together with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu who is often seen as the party’s in-house critic. “I am open to criticism. If I make a mistake, Sidhu ji tells me and I rectify. We are working together,” he said.Channi, who recalled that he was denied a ticket to fight the assembly elections by the Congress till he won as an independent from Chamkaur Sahib assembly seat in 2007, said winnability should be the only criteria for ticket selection for Punjab elections for Congress. “The party should do a survey and give tickets to those who have highest winnability score. Tickets should not be allocated to different groups,” he said.The chief minister said his model of development was one preached by the Sikh gurus and was aimed at empowering the poor so that they can compete with the upper strata of society.“People are overburdened by taxes imposed by the government. We are trying to provide them relief by making electricity free, waiving water tariffs, reducing prices of fuel and helping them in living better life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/htls/at-htls-2021-punjab-cm-channi-speaks-on-his-surprise-elevation-and-what-it-means-101638612014263.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||#DilliwaliShaadi: Denizens game for wedding hopping||New DelhiIt’s raining weddings in Delhi-NCR, and even outstations! The shaadi season is in full swing, and to juggle between multiple weddings, especially on heavy saaya dates, Delhiites are taking all that it takes to face the wedding rush. Hopping from one wedding to another in quite a marathon mode, here’s how they are balancing the act between work and weddings.Weekend plans entail multi-taskingNaman Gautam, an IT professional who has his weekends booked for some wedding or the other since the onset of the wedding season, says, “Work often spills over to Saturdays, and if not, some last-minute meeting almost always crops up. When attending back to back wedding functions, it becomes quite challenging to work, but I’ve now started scooting over to noise-free nooks whenever I get quick calls from work. Who’s to say that the caller isn’t in some wedding, too!” And Kanika Agarwal, an analyst with a tech firm shares how she’s relying on collaborative work to sail smoothly through this wedding season. “I attend some meetings in the first half and my colleague attends some others in the second half and the remaining ones we reschedule. My work requires me to be available on mails at all times, so working from anywhere is easy, especially now that we have been thrown into the WFH model,” says Agarwal.Attending calls amid weddingJaishree Gaur, an HR manager, says, “One of our employees, the groom’s brother, was to attend clients’ call and since it’s the peak wedding season, he did so in the middle of the wedding functions! Many have started asking for half day leaves of late, but when it’s a wedding in your house, half day isn’t sufficient.” And Udit Mittal, from an HR consulting organisation chips in: “Employees are happy taking breaks amid weddings for a video call. Since the video calls have a blur or change backdrop feature, they are not worried about their bosses knowing their place of work. And for seniors at work, as long as the work is completed in time, it doesn’t really matter if the employee is attending a wedding or is on a holiday outstation!”Half day work, rest half shopping Rashmi Priyam, a Delhi-based human resource manager chuckles sharing a recent case. “An employee asked to work from Goa for a week, and then Madhya Pradesh for another 10 days because she has so many friends getting married this year. Emails for location change for work keep coming in, wherein people request for a destination change for some time. Other employees, too, have been juggling. Some are taking half day’s off to be able to shop in the second half. I feel WFH has also given leverage to people, and it’s easier to accommodate remote work requests now.”Wardrobe management on pointFor Radhika Jajoo, a development professional who recently attended three weddings on three consecutive days, access to multiple wardrobes has been a saviour. “I’m mixing and matching as much possible.

This includes 5 calls a day from the Brihanmumbai Coropration’s war room to monitor their health and the involvement of their housing societies to ensure their complete isolation.

It will be as effective as institutional quarantine. Our objective is to prevent the possible spread of the Omicron variant in Mumbai.”The chief executive officer (CEO) of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) will daily submit to the Disaster Management Cell, a list of international passengers arriving in Mumbai in the preceding 24 hours from high risk and at-risk countries and those who have visited these countries in the last 15 days.

04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Our mystical Lodhi||Catch a glimpse of red lava smouldering atop a distant volcano. Well, it’s just a reflection of the evening sky on a pond. This breathtaking view, as seen from a Mughal-era stone bridge, is on exhibit throughout the year at Lodhi Garden. So are the park’s centuries-old monuments, flower hedges, trees, birds, dogs and VIPs.But there is one incredibly beautiful aspect of Lodhi Garden experienced only at a certain time of the day - and only in winters - when the air becomes partly hazy with smog or mist.The scenes appear to have been processed with Instagram filters! Visit after sundown, when the place starts getting shrouded in darkness, and you’ll see that only a few spots here and there are lit up by strategically placed lamps. The uneven spread of these lights turns the surroundings into a mystical vista of shadows.Take this 7pm setting, for instance. The trees look like giant joggers frozen in mid-movement, their innards splintered into a geometry of light and nothingness. Some of the grassy patches along the ground, nearer to the lamp posts, are lit up in faint orange. The wetness of the mist is making the grass glisten. Strolling by the pond is an even more disconcerting sight - the water appears to be on fire.Further along, a white-haired woman in pants and a shawl is walking slowly down a darkened pathway. She is wearing a silk scarf in French style. Suddenly, she steps into a small pool of light cast by one of the lamps. The woman walks on unconcernedly and re-enters the darkness. It is like watching a painting in which the figure briefly moved.On the other side of the garden, a ram laddu seller, Rajpal, is silently standing by his makeshift wooden stand. He is as still as the gigantic monument behind him.Some steps away, a lush tree is spreading its wide shadow across the ground. A shaft of golden lamplight boldly enters the black space and disappears some steps later, as if swallowed by a void.Believe it or not, this cold smoggy evening, Lodhi Garden isn’t at all feeling like the Lodhi Garden we know.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-our-mystical-lodhi-101638576426093.html

Police said it was not clear who was driving the vehicle when the accident occurred.The victims were returning to the hospital they worked at after attending the wedding of a colleague in Sadhrana village in Gurugram Sector 88.Noting that the Maruti Dzire car was speeding, Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the driver was taking a turn when he lost control and rammed into bricks piled on the roadside for construction work.“The car flipped several times, and all the passengers were severely injured. Passersby dragged them out of the vehicle with much difficulty. They were bleeding profusely and were unconscious when the police team reached the spot. They were taken to a nearby private hospital, where doctors declared five of them dead. The sixth passenger is undergoing treatment and is still unfit to record a statement... Preliminary investigation revealed that none of the passengers wore seat belts,” Sangwan said.Dr Deepak Mathur, a forensic expert who conducted the autopsy, said that the five victims died due to excessive bleeding and severe head injuries.Police said they registered a case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 279 (rash driving) and 304 (causing death by negligence) against an unidentified person at the Sector 10 police station on Friday.We were awaiting the post mortem reports to know if the driver was under the influence of alcohol, Sangwan said, adding that the five bodies were handed over to their respective family members on Friday.
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi's air marginally cleaner day after drizzle, strong winds||Delhi’s air quality improved on Friday after isolated rain and stronger winds cleared up pollutants on Thursday night, said officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on Friday, Delhi had a 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 346, in the “very poor” zone. This was an improvement from Thursday’s reading of 429, which was in the “severe” category.An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.IMD scientists said that the improvement was due to the light, isolated showers in many parts of the Capital on Thursday evening.The rain, along with improved wind speeds, facilitated the dispersion of the accumulated pollutants in Delhi’s air. However, winds are likely to become calm again on Saturday before another western disturbance on December 5 brings a bout of light rain and winds.“The rain and the wind were the primary reason behind the improvement of pollution levels. From December 5 to 7, another western disturbance will impact the Capital, which will result in a marginal improvement in the city’s air. Light rains are forecast for December 6. However, the AQI will still remain in the lower end of ‘very poor’,” VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre, said.Since November this year, Delhi has been reeling under some of the worst pollution spells it has experienced since air quality monitoring began.In November, Delhi’s average air quality was the worst on record since 2015 — when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started maintaining pollution records. The average AQI last month was 376, surpassing 374 in November 2016.Delhi also recorded 11 “severe” air quality days in November, also the highest number of such days since 2015.Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday wrote to the union environment minister requesting a meeting with environment ministers and experts of states across the National Capital Region (NCR) to prepare a joint action plan for the future to combat pollution.He also alleged, quoting reports and studies, that most of Delhi’s pollution is caused by external sources on which the city government does not have any control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-marginally-cleaner-day-after-drizzle-strong-winds-101638573871171.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Anti-terror operations: Avoid collateral damage, Azad advises security forces||Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday advised security forces to avoid collateral damage during anti-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir. “During counter insurgency operations, if a militant runs into a village and enters a house to hide himself, the security forces blow away the house. Then people think that forces have committed excesses. During my tenure as chief minister, I had asked the security forces to cordon off the house and wait for two days,” Azad told reporters after his rally in Rajouri. “He (militant) will eventually come out. Once out, kill him. No doctor has said that you have to kill him the same day. So, my point is, forces should avoid collateral damage,” he added. To another query, he said, since the central government has agreed upon elections and statehood for Jammu and Kashmir, he wanted exclusive rights of locals to jobs and land. “Till the Supreme Court decides on Article 370, we want the government to guarantee exclusive right to jobs and land to the locals in the statehood bill, which it intends to bring in the Parliament,” he said. “We don’t have to do anything with Article 35-A, but only include these two key issues in the statehood bill,” he said. “The case (on Article 370) is sub-judice in court and if the decision comes after five years then we may lose all jobs and our land to the outsiders. Therefore, incorporate these two issues in the statehood bill so that outsiders don’t get jobs and purchase our land,” he added. Earlier at the rally, Azad again urged people to raze the walls of hatred before the next assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, and elect secular leaders. “When you take ill and need blood, do you ask if the blood being administered to you belongs to a Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Gujjar or a Pahari. Humanity should be the religion of all. Therefore, elect secular leaders on the basis of their humanity and not those who do communal politics,” he said. The political parties in Jammu and Kashmir anticipate assembly polls in June next year, following the completion of the delimitation exercise in March.

All the 178 terminated healthcare workers had submitted written apologies and assurance to rejoin duties on their previous salaries on November 22, after which the department had said that the screening committee will scrutinise their applications, check employees’ demands and explanations, and then will allow them to come back to work. The NHM employees have filed a case — ‘Niranjan Kumar and others versus Union of India and others’ — in the Punjab and Haryana high court, hearing of which is due on January 12, 2022. Director health services Dr Suman Singh said, “The health department was ready to take back the termination of the employees, but the staff preferred to move high court. Now, the department can’t do anything and we will obey the orders which will be given by the court in January. Till then, the staff will not be allowed to rejoin their duties.”At least 500 NHM employees, working under the UT health department as doctors, paramedical staff and managerial staff, including nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 workers, have been working for salaries lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013. In August, over 300 NHM workers had gone on an indefinite leave to press their demand for equal wages for equal work. Following the continuous protest, the UT administration had given a written assurance of a salary hike. The department had then offered revised working conditions for them against the salary hike. However, the services of the NHM workers were terminated on October 28, after they went on a strike without giving prior intimation to press for salaries at DC rates.Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, general secretary of the NHM union, said, “The health department asked us to withdraw the court case before rejoining the duties. We asked the department to give us a written assurance that they will cancel our termination after dropping the court case, but the authorities refused to do so. We are ready to withdraw the case after rejoining the duties or if department will give us written assurance on rolling back the termination once the case is dropped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-health-department-puts-on-hold-plan-to-reinstate-178-nhm-employees-101638564835077.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal Police issue gag order for cops seeking pay parity||A day after the chief minister warned of action against the agitating cops running a campaign on social media for pay parity, the Himachal Pradesh police on Friday advised its constabulary against airing their grievances online.The advisory issued by director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu states: “In the light of the recent developments within the police constabulary, all unit heads are directed to advise the constables under their command to maintain discipline.”They have been directed to communicate their demands regarding pay scale in the form of a written memorandum to the government of Himachal Pradesh through the Police Headquarters.Besides, it has been advised that the constables refrain from making any comments on social media, and that they should go about their routine in the normal manner and take meals in the mess. “Ensure strict compliance,” the order stated in the end.The Twitter handle of the Himachal Pradesh Police also tweeted an advisory, stating that cops must maintain discipline and perform their duties with dedication.There has been growing anger among the constables of the Himachal Pradesh police over the disparity in their salaries.Irked over their demands not being heard in the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) meeting, policemen in large numbers had marched to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s official residence for a peaceful protest on November 28. The cops have also stopped taking meals in the messes since.The chief minister had hurriedly convened a meeting with the finance secretary and assured the protesting cops that their demands will be looked into in a meeting with all officials concerned. The meeting has yet to be held.In the JCC meeting, the chief minister had announced new pay scales for the employees and reduced their contract period from three to two years. The government’s decision to increase the pay scales of employees had led to resentment among policemen. On Thursday, Thakur, who also holds the home portfolio, had warned to take tough action against cops running a social media campaign regarding their grievances.Talking to the media on Friday, the chief minister said the police were a disciplined force and had the right to raise their grievances. “Government is looking into their demands. However, to make it a campaign on social media and some people provoking them is not right,” he said. “So, the DGP has advised them to take meals in the mess and refrain from making comments on social media,” he said, adding that the gathering of policemen at his residence was not a protest. “It was just that a delegation had to meet me but the number of people who arrived there was quite large. It was just an incident and not a protest,” he said.Around 5,700 constables are feeling aggrieved by the decision of the government to extend the period of the constables for the grant of ₹10,300+ ₹3,200 pay scale from two to eight years. Their repeated pleas to grant the pay scales as per the 2013 policy have gone unheeded.
04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal CM directs speedy redress of working class’ issues||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday said regular meetings of the service committees of various boards and corporations will be held for redressing issues of the working class.He was presiding over a meeting with the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS).He said the current government had increased the minimum wage of daily wagers from ₹210 to ₹300 per day and will also ensure that industrial units also provide adequate wages to their workers.He said weekly offs were also being provided to daily wagers.Applauding the work by ASHA and anganwari workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the chief minister said it was due to their dedication that Himachal Pradesh emerged as the first state in the country to achieve 100% first dose vaccination and was also on the verge of completing full coverage of second dose.He said the state government had enhanced the honorarium for ASHA workers by ₹1,750 during the last four years, adding that steps will be taken to stop exploitation of workers by the cement companies in the state. Thakur said two years were lost due to the pandemic, but the state government ensured that workers did not suffer. “The BMS played a constructive role in providing help to the needy during the pandemic. All genuine demands of the BMS will be considered sympathetically and steps will be taken for their early redress,” he added.He assured that the state government will organise a meeting with the BMS before the Budget session next year, and directed the officers to immediately implement the announcements made by him in respect of various categories of employees.Earlier, BMS president Madan Rana urged the chief minister to be considerate towards the demands of the labourers and working class. He also sought a permanent policy for ASHA workers, tailoring teachers and anganwari workers, and minimum wages for the mid-day meal workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-cm-directs-speedy-redress-of-working-class-issues-101638563514633.html
04-12-2021||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ take: Chandigarh needs a clean-up act||Shabby waste management systemChandigarh, which is known as City Beautiful, performed poorly in the Swachh Survekshan due to its shabby waste management system. While residents must do their bit by not littering and following the waste segregation norms, the MC needs to focus on getting rid of the legacy waste of the city. Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhSustainable living Residents can take small steps, which can help affect big changes in the long run. The basic rule of reduce, reuse and recycle must be followed diligently. Secondly, garbage must be segregated at source so that the authorities can dispose it in an efficient manner. Thirdly, residents must be educated about sustainable living. Gaurav Jain, ChandigarhNew C&D policy can helpIt is shameful that a city like Chandigarh, which has a highly-educated population, has done so poorly in Swachh Survekshan. Residents of a planned city like Chandigarh should lead the way in implementing good waste management practices. The new construction and demolition (C&D) policy, which will let generators of malba take processed material costing 50% of the processing charges for free, and penalise those dumping malba at non-designated spots, will help a great deal. The MC needs to bring in more upgrades in its waste management plants. Residents must also do their bit by taking small steps, such as converting kitchen waste into compost. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhMountain of shameChandigarh’s great fall in Swachh Survekshan 2021 is disappointing for its residents. The city’s dysfunctional waste management plant and the huge mountain of legacy waste have spoiled city’s rank in the survey. Authorities need to act fast and make the waste management plant functional, so that waste can be processed. Besides, initiatives such as rewarding good waste management practices by residents can also prove helpful. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhInvolve citizens in the mission The planned cities of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula can easily attain the top ranks in Swachh Survekshan if these have dedicated teams working towards the goal. The reason Indore has been doing well in the survey is that it has managed to get its residents on board. The municipal corporation alone cannot achieve this target; active citizens’ participation is a must. Simarjit Bhogal, via emailTricity lagging behind on all countsAs per the ministry of urban development and housing, there are five parameters to determine the cleanliness of the city: Collection and transportation, processing and disposal of waste, sanitation levels, behavioural changes and capacity building. Tricity is lagging behind on all five counts. The reason behind this is lack of willingness and involvement of citizens. KNS Sodhi, MohaliFix responsibility The Swachh ranking dip is matter of concern for City Beautiful and responsibility must be fixed at the earliest. The city has the right infrastructure but its implementation is shoddy. Had the authorities not delayed the tenders for hiring a waste processing firm, the city may have been in a better position. Citizens’ participation is also crucial. Political parties must also make cleanliness their poll plank. Sukhpal Singh, ChandigarhPolitical will is neededThe slump in the rank of City Beautiful is not shocking as mismanagement was pretty evident. Chandigarh is a planned city but on the civic front, there is little planning. Instead of passing the buck, authorities must address the problem areas. For that, political willingness is crucial. That would come only if residents hold their elected representatives accountable. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliHealth hazard Debris and malba on vacant plots and roads are not only an eyesore, but also an obstruction in the cleaning process. Owners of such plots must be penalized for not ensuring cleanliness of their plot. Such spots can also become a health hazard by becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Anju Juneja, via emailMC needs to pull up its socksFrom rank 2 in 2014, City Beautiful has slipped to shameful 66 this year in Swachh Survekshan. The position is likely to deteriorate further if the municipal corporation and administration don’t pull up their socks. Instead of assigning the work to contractors, the MC must take matters into its own hands and set right the waste management system of the city. It’s not just about the rankings, it is residents’ health that is at risk due to the slipping cleanliness levels. SK Khosla, ChandigarhNo improvement till waste plant is in place The city’s cleanliness index will keep slipping till the waste management plant’s capacity is not increased. Authorities must direct all their resources to this end. Besides, it is also upon us s residents to keep our city clean and green. Awareness drives can help a great deal in achieving citizens’ participation.Aarti Verma, PanchkulaSensitise the publicThe clean city initiative cannot make much progress until there is active citizens’ participation. To achieve this, authorities must hold regular sensitization workshops to get citizens involved. We must all learn from Indore dogged pursuit of cleanliness and see how we can do the same for our city. The authorities must also provide sufficient funds to achieve this target. P Mehta, via emailRankings a wake-up callThe poor show in Swachh rankings has come as a wake-up call not only for Chandigarh but also for Mohali and Panchkula. It is time for the authorities of the three cities to draw a clear roadmap and fix responsibility on erring officials. The defaulters must be made to pay for the losses from the own pockets. Residents must also do their bit to help city improve.Subhash Chugh, via emailMC in slumberDue to the MC’s carelessness, the city is going to the dogs. Garbage can be seen lying all over the place, storm water drains are choked by waste and pedestrian paths and green belts are not maintained well. The regular meetings of the MC officials and councillors are of no use if they cannot solve the most basic problems of the city. Huge amounts have been spent on devices such as smart watches for sanitation works, but with little result. Sateesh Dadwal, ChandigarhWaste segregation at sourceUnless waste is segregated at the source, it will be very difficult to manage it. But habits don’t change overnight. Penalising citizens will only antagonise them. So a consistent, focused campaign to sensitise and reinforce waste segregation is need to get the residents on board. Many are not even aware about the classification of the garbage into various categories. We should learn lessons from other cities across India, which have bagged the top rank. All of us a required to do our bit to improve our city’s rankings. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhLet’s do our bitIt is sad that City Beautiful’s ranking has gone down in Swachh Survekshan 2021. It is high time we improve our waste disposal system, starting from our homes to the disposal point. At the outset, we must follow basic principal of 3 R’s: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste. A drive must be launched to educate people on waste segregation. Also, people must not throw waste in open places like parks, streets, road berms etc which paint a very poor picture of our city. Col TBS Bedi, MohaliClear legacy waste on war footingThe legacy waste accumulating at Dadumajra is a blot on City Beautiful. The administration must start an initiative to clear the legacy waste on war footing. Also, to improve the Swachh Rankings, citizens’ participation plays a major role. The civic body must take up initiatives to train people in waste segregation at source. Also, sanitation workers should also carry out their work properly. Those found negligent at their work must be punished while those doing well must be rewarded. Regular feedback must be taken from residents’ welfare associations to ensure all is well on the ground. Kidar Nath Sharma, via emailBan plastic bagsThe government must ban plastic all across the country as plastic, being non-biodegradable, leaves a major impact on the environment. We must all consciously resolve to limit plastic use as much as possible and switch alternatives, such as bamboo, jute etc. SK Thakur, via emailSpare a thought for sanitation workersTricity’s isn’t doing well in waste segregation and processing. To top that municipal officials and sanitation workers are always on warpath. The ‘safai karamcharis’ work is the most difficult and if they refuse to work, our city will stink. The administration must be benevolent towards their needs and encourage them by rewarding them for the work from time-to-time. Also, the tricity must seriously consider setting up biogas plants to gainfully treat solid waste. Capt Amar Jeet, KhararBetter governance, residents’ participationPoor governance and litter are two of the biggest threats to Chandigarh’s ‘City Beautiful’ tag. Citizens need to abstain from littering, open urination etc. Apart from these, ensure cleaner markets (rope in market associations for it) and also ensure better cleanliness and garbage management in villages under Chandigarh MC.Kampreet Gill, Chandigarh Lead by exampleWe humans have herd mentality. If we see others engaging in bad practices, we follow them, if we see them doing the right things, we do the same. In airports, where there is cleanliness, residents barely litter, but at roadsides, where garbage is lying, passersby will add carelessly discard their waste. So to set things right, we need community leaders leading by example, so other can learn and follow. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhShun blame gameThe city has slipped on the Swachh Survekshan rankings primarily due to poor solid waste management system and ineffective implementation of waste segregation at source. Due to the non-functional waste plant, garbage is accumulating near the waste plant, making lives of residents nearby a nightmare. Amid this, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress are engaged in a political slugfest over who is to be blamed. While the BJP accuses the Congress of preparing a faulty tender and poor selection of site, the Congress blames the BJP for not being able to resolve the issue despite holding power in the MC and the Centre. SC Luthra, ChandigarhDust, debris due to constructionEfficient solid waste management mechanism is a far cry in the city due to lack of political will. Though poor waste management is one of the main reasons for the dip in Swachh Survekshan Rankings, the unchecked construction work in and around the city is also leading to dust and debris accumulation. Deepak Kumar, PanchkulaDwindling cleanliness Chandigarh was once renowned for its beauty and spick and span roads but over the years, it has lost its sheen. The defunct waste treatment plant has had a major role to play in the city’s dipping cleanliness standards. But the spurt in population and ensuing construction work has also been a contributor. Over increased plastic usage over the years has also degraded the environment. The administration must act before it’s too late. Competitions between sectors, residential societies etc can be explored to help city get back its clean tag. Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhSingle-use plastic must be bannedThe city needs to re-work its waste management practices. While residents must clean up their act and stop littering, and start segregation of work, authorities must impose penalty on all those erring on these fronts. More dustbins must be made available at public places to discourage littering. And residents must also take a conscious decision to reduce use of single-use plastic items. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurAuthorities’ complacency to be blamedChandigarh has slipped on Swachh Survekshan rankings due to the complacency of authorities. Community participation is also lacking. Charity begins at home, so residents must start from their own homes for better waste management. Once that is achieved, we can think about improving the city’s rankings and country’s image.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaTurn the gaze inwardsHow can we expect any change, when our bureaucrats and politicians can themselves be seen holding Swachh Survekshan meetings with plastic water bottles placed next to them. Before they check other, they must turn the gaze inwards. Anju Mohan, PanchkulaCloth bags instead of plastic onesThe MC must work on upgrading the waste plant. Residents must minimise use of plastic bags. Little steps like using jute or cloth bags for shopping, not throwing trash at public places can go a long way. It is a sad sight to see polythene bags scattered in mandis along with discarded vegetables and fruits, which are consumed by cattle and stray dogs. It should be the responsibility of market officials to check this. Vijay Malia, ChandigarhMC must take action against defaultersSolid waste is a challenge for the tricity. The MC started garbage collection in twin-bin carriages to separate wet and dry waste, but due to lack of initiative on residents’ part, it is yet to be fully implemented. Since the next Swachh Survekshan is round the corner, the civic body has become strict and decided to take action against the defaulters. It must show the same urgency round the year. Usha Verma, ChandigarhWrong notion of clean cityResidents of Chandigarh were of the notion that they live in a clean and green city. The latest Swachh Survey has broken that myth. The local administration and residents are to be equally blamed for this. We must now ponder on corrective steps.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhREADER OF THE WEEKResidents, authorities need to work together For the city to improve its Swachh rankings, we need community participation as well as official willingness. At the outset, we need to focus on implementing waste segregation and then work towards enhancing the capacity of recycling and processing of solid waste. Also, authorities must ensure compliance to the ban on use of single-use plastic. Residents need to be sensitised about their role in keeping their cities clean, and the long-term environmental impact of our actions. Akancsha Sood, ChandigarhEXPERT TAKEEye on star-ratingThough our ranking has improved, our aim is to get star rating for which, we will’ve to focus on waste segregation, plastic ban and reuse of construction waste. I urge residents to cooperate with us.Kamal Kumar Garg, Mohali municipal commissionerGet public involvedUntil unless public doesn’t get involved actively, the rankings won’t improve. So, we are going to hold meetings seeking public opinion on what all measures can be taken to bring an improvement.Dharamvir, Panchkula MC commissioner RWAs’ roleMC must involve RWAs in garbage collection process or the ranking will fall further. Residents know the problem areas that MC can’t seem to find. There are so many issues with regards to new van-based garbage collection yet the MC chooses to ignore it. Major DP Singh (retd), CRAWFED patronNeed to inculcate ‘green culture’Waste segregation at source is critical for efficient processing. RWAs can play an effective role in this. We also need to adopt a green culture, which focus on reduce, reuse and recycle.

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Passengers a harried lot as contractual Punbus, PRTC workers disrupt service for two hours||Passengers at the inter-state bus terminal were in for a harrowing experience on Friday, with agitating contractual staff of the Punbus and PRTC shutting down services for two hours as part of the statewide protest seeking regularisation. With buses not being allowed to enter the terminal, chaos ensued at the entrance. Looking to board pivate busses, people began queuing up in the midst of heavy traffic, adding to the woes. As per the bus terminal authorities, movement of over 100 buses was affected due to the agitation. Multiple cancelations also adversely affected the overall schedule, leaving passengers in limbo.Passengers at the short end of the stickSeveral passengers rued the harassment that they had to face because of the ongoing disagreement between agitating parties and the state government.Surjit Singh, a passenger who was seen waiting for a bus to Amritsar, said the employees should ensure that the public does not become a collateral in their protest. “I have been waiting for around 20 minutes for a bus amid the traffic chaos outside the stand and no information is available even with the bus stand officials regarding the arrival and departure of buses,” he said.Another passenger, Vishal, said even as private operators are running the services, it is very difficult to locate the right bus amid the chaos. “The buses are easily available and accessible inside the stand. Traffic jams also irked the commuters. The employees should pay heed to the problems faced by residents due to their protest,” he complained. Meanwhile, station supervisor, Kuljit Sodhi said movement of over 100 buses was disrupted, estimating a loss of around ₹6 lakh. The state government is working to resolve the issue with the Union. Indefinite strike from December 7 Shamsher Singh, district president of the Punbus/PRTC Contractual Employees Union, said the agitation was a result of the state government’s continued indifference to their demand of regularisation. He further stated the employees will up the ante and go on an indefinite strike across the state from December 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/passengers-a-harried-lot-as-contractual-punbus-prtc-workers-disrupt-service-for-two-hours-101638562919049.html
04-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Right-wing leader held for disrupting namaz||Eleven people associated with different right-wing groups were detained on Friday by the Gurugram police for trying to disrupt namaz in the open in Sector 37, for the third consecutive week. Their efforts were thwarted by the police who formed a security cordon around the Muslims, allowing the namaz to progress without hindrance and preventing a further escalation in law and order.The Sector 37 ground is one of 20 sites designated by the administration for holding Friday prayers in the open, given the paucity of mosques in the city. Even so, protests have been taking place there for the past three weeks, with Hindu groups remaining adamant about not allowing Muslims to pray in the open.While 10 of those detained were later let go, Dinesh Bharti, leader of Hindu outfit Bharat Mata Vahini, was arrested for allegedly threatening Muslims who came to pray, police said.Rajender Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, said more than 400 police personnel were deployed at the sector 37 site as Hindu groups on Thursday had informed the administration of their intention to disrupt Friday prayers. “We called in personnel from four police stations to control the situation and detained protesters before the situation could turn ugly. We created a protective layer around the Muslims offering prayers to ensure their safety and security,” he said.More than 700 personnel were deployed on Friday, mostly at six designated namaz sites that have seen protests in the past. No violence was reported in the city but there was a disruption at a smaller site in Sector 34, where protesters turned away Muslims and did not let them offer prayers, said police.At Sector 37, protesters parked more than 50 trucks on the ground in an effort to stop the namaz. Police had to push back protesters and make space for Muslims, but right-wing groups and residents who gathered there in protest started shouting religious slogans. Only a small portion of ground was finally used for prayers, the police later said .Sushil Kumar, duty magistrate deployed at the Sector 37 site, said hundreds of people had assembled on the ground in protest and were requested by the police to not cause any disruption but they did not pay heed. They started shouting slogans. “They were taken into preventive custody and the site was cleared for prayers,” he said.Among those detained was Bharti, a man at the forefront of these protests since September, who has been arrested twice. Police said Bharti allegedly stood in front of the Muslims who congregated for prayers and started threatening them even as others shouted slogans.Avaneesh Raghav, a resident of Khandsa, said they parked trucks on the ground as they didn’t have space in the village.“We have requested companies in the area to provide space to their Muslim employees — on rooftops, basements or premises — to offer prayers. We will not let them use our ground even if we get arrested for stopping them. Muslims offering namaz here are not locals; they come from far off places to encroach our land,” he said.Praveen Yadav, another protester, said they will park more trucks and vehicles next Friday to leave no space for Muslims. “This is the only ground locals have to organise functions, havan (ritualistic prayers) and other activities, including weddings. No outsider is allowed to perform anything without our consent. It is very strange that people are coming here from Nuh, just to offer namaz,” said the man who himself travelled around 15-18km from his home in Sirhaul village to Sector 37 on Friday, just to protest.Yadav said next Friday they will also target Udyog Vihar, where more than 800 Muslims offer namaz in the open.Haji Shehzad Khan, chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said the situation is getting more tense as weeks pass, but with the support of police and the administration, they were able to pray on Friday. “The way the Hindu groups are trying to attack us is not fair. They were prepared to take the law into their hands but timely intervention saved us. People offered prayers even as sloganeering continued all around them,” he said.Altaf Ahmed, a representative of the Muslim community, said, “It is a deliberate attempt to disturb the peaceful juma namaz and the communal harmony of this cosmopolitan city,” he said.Over the past three months, right-wing groups have disrupted namaz being offered in open spaces in sectors 47, 12, 37 and Sirhaul village.Members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of Hindu right-wing groups, which has been leading the protests, said they have been waiting for a month for the administration to stop the practise of namaz in public places.“From next Friday, we will not let anyone offer prayers at any of the 20 sites and we will continue to protest and occupy the sites,” said Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor of the samiti.

Calling it possibly the biggest recruitment scam of the country, Deepender gave the government a 15-day ultimatum for ordering a court-monitored CBI probe in the scam. He said, “If the government does not announce a CBI inquiry and if it fails to reveal names of the culprits, then a big Yuva Aakrosh Rally would be organised in Sonepat on December 19.”He said the youth of Haryana was facing the highest unemployment rate in the country today. “In the report of CMIE every month and NITI Aayog of the Government of India every year, it is clear that Haryana has the highest unemployment in India. The government, which claims to be honest, has been exposed by bundles of notes and blank answer sheets. In the matter of employment, both the Haryana Public Service Commission and the Haryana Staff Selection Commission have the same formula, give a sack of notes to get a job, leave the form completely blank,” he added. Deepender alleged that the rates for each paper were fixed. “It was ₹35 to ₹40 lakh for dental surgeons, ₹20 lakh for staff nurses, and ₹10 lakh for ANMs,” he added. Deepender said till 2014, Haryana was at the forefront of per capita income and per capita investment. “But today, our unemployment rate is four times the average unemployment of the country.

Harinder Singh said Karandeep Singh of Bholath had approached the high court alleging that Gill had constructed his house in violation of the PUDA Act within a 30-metre distance from the scheduled road. Karandeep had filed multiple complaints against Gill with the public works department (PWD) seeking action against the illegal construction, claiming that even the police didn’t take action against Gill as he is a close associate of Rana Gurjit Singh.The petitioner urged the court for directing the Punjab government to take action against Gill and the state government may be restrained from regularisng the illegal construction within a 30 metres area on the Kartarpur-Bholath scheduled road during the pendency of the petition. Meanwhile, a press release was issued by the office of former Punjab MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira on the matter in the high court. Khaira is in judicial custody in a money laundering case registered against him by the enforcement directorate.When contacted, Gill claimed that he had purchased the land on the Kartarpur-Bholath road by completing all legal formalities and constructed his office by following all norms, adding that he was not aware of the notice of the court and would reply once he gets it. He said Khaira was his “political arch-rival and playing poor gimmicks for his political survival”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-construction-hc-seeks-status-report-from-state-over-puda-act-violations-by-congress-leader-101638562436253.html

Their protest took the shape of a full-fledged movement earlier this week as they came together to voice their displeasure at the zila parishad decision to build a boundary wall to keep them out of the said site. The vendors have demanded that the authorities declare the site as a vending zone. President of the Rehri Fadi Union, Bal Krishan Pappi, said, “The vendors have also been paying a monthly fee to MC to install the vends in the past. If the authorities have to lease out the land, it should be given to the vendors and they will pay the rent to the authorities.”“The vendors have no other place to install vends in that area as they have been working at the site for over two decades now,” he added.When contacted, the superintendent of the zila parishad, Sikander Singh, refused to comment on the issue.Satnam Singh, assistant police sub inspector from Division number 1 station, said that a complaint has been received regarding encroachments by the zila parishad, but no FIR has yet been registered in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/clock-tower-protests-vendors-lock-horns-with-zila-parishad-officials-again-in-ludhiana-101638562434933.html

Addressing rallies in support of party candidates Gurpartap Singh Wadala and Bachittar Singh Kohar at Nakodar and Shahkot constituencies in Jalandhar district, Sukhbir said that conspiracies were being hatched to weaken the SAD as it is the true representative of the people of Punjab. Also, he announced to revive all blue cards within one month of the formation of the SAD-BSP alliance government in the state. “The farmers who do not have a tubewell connection would be given one on priority. Our government will undertake the construction of a bundh on the Sutlej,” the SAD leader said. Terming as shocking what he called “theatrics” of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, he said the CM’s ‘sangat darshan’ in front of his residence was a farce. “Had Channi been sincere, a woman of Cheema Kalan village in Nakodar would not have committed suicide at his doorsteps in sheer frustration after he refused to listen to her persistent pleas for help in resolving a property dispute.” Sukhbir also asked Channi to tell what his government or even the one headed by Capt Amarinder Singh had done in the last nearly five years. “Show me one school or a hospital which you have set up by your government or the one headed by Amarinder Singh. You are only making announcements that are yet to see the light of day,” he dared the CM.Later in Moga, Sukhbir said that the party will win 85 to 90 seats in the upcoming polls. He was at Killi Chahal village to review the preparation of a rally and meet party leaders and workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-won-t-succeed-in-its-attempts-to-weaken-akali-dal-sukhbir-badal-101638562014831.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder Singh carries ‘myopic mindset’, Arvind Kejriwal an outsider: Charanjit Channi||Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday accused former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of carrying a myopic mindset towards the poor.Addressing a public gathering in the Bhoa assembly segment, the chief minister said as he comes from a humble background, he always impressed upon the former chief minister to safeguard the interests of the common man. However, he alleged that instead of resolving the issues to give reprieve to the poor and downtrodden, Capt started victimising him. The chief minister said only Congress can take a revolutionary decision to oust a “Maharaja” and bestow the responsibility of the CM to a common man. However, he said this revolution could sustain only if all the common and needy people stand united to support the Congress. Lashing out at the Akalis, the BJP and Amarinder, the chief minister alleged that the trio of Modi, Badal and Captain had connived to pass anti-farm laws for jeopardising the interests of the state.He said, “The members of this elite group like Badals and Captain have a common bond in form of their own vested interests and plundered the state. They have been doing this by enjoying the fruits of power in the game of musical chairs where the ruler changes after every five years but power remains in their hands. However, now this nexus has been broken and the power is with the common man”.Slamming Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister said, “Besides being an outsider, Kejriwal is a rumour monger who knows nothing about the state but pokes his nose in everything. Such type of cheap politics will never be successful in the state”.He termed Kejriwal “a power greedy outsider”, who desires to rule Punjab due to which he is trying to “mislead” Punjabis. Channi claimed that the Kejriwal government had failed in Delhi whereas the Congress was delivering its best to the people.Striking an emotional chord with residents of border areas, the chief minister said though bravehearts reside in this area, the successive state governments had ignored them. He said this area would be developed holistically by pumping in resources.Meanwhile, the chief minister announced a medical college at Pathankot, declaring Bhoa as an administrative block, upgrading Narot Jaimal Singh hospital and providing the suitable land for the building of Sant Baba Nabha Dass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-singh-carries-myopic-mindset-arvind-kejriwal-an-outsider-charanjit-channi-101638561475372.html

I have not left the party but resigned from all party posts,” he said.Congress faces rebellion tooIn addition to a string of resignations by its office-bearers, the Congress on Friday saw many leaders leaving the party in protest against the ticket distribution.

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali teen dies as ESI delays payment for heart surgery||In a case of sheer negligence and red-tapism on the part of Employees’ State Insurance (ESI), Punjab, a 13-year-old boy died as the corporation delayed advance payment of ₹2 lakh to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, for his heart surgery by more than one month. The authorities have ordered a probe into the case on Friday. The matter came to light after the deceased boy’s father submitted a complaint with the director, health services, ESI. In his complaint, Ram Kumar, who works at a private firm in Mohali, stated that on September 23 this year, his son Sachin was diagnosed with a health problem at the PGIMER, for which an urgent surgery was recommended. The very next day, the father reportedly submitted an estimate of ₹2 lakh given by the PGIMER to ESI Hospital, Phase 7, Mohali. His application was forwarded to the director, health services, ESI, on September 28 for approval. However, due to the delay in disbursal, surgery could take place and the child passed away on October 16. According to Ram Kumar, it was only on November 11 that he received a phone call from ESI, asking him to collect the letter sanctioning the advance payment of ₹2 lakh. “I have been paying ESI contribution for the past one decade with the hope that my family and I will get the required medical treatment when needed. But now I lost my son, and urge you to register a criminal case against the officials concerned for the delay,” he said in his complaint. Inquiry orderedJasbir Singh, chairman of the labour laws committee, Mohali Industries Association, said: “Why did the ESI take one month to sanction the advance payment to the PGIMER? Now, who is responsible for the death of the child due to the negligence of ESI officials? Who will compensate the poor worker?”Dr GB Singh, director, health services, ESI, said: “I have already ordered an inquiry into the case and will fix the responsibility of officials concerned. Action will be taken accordingly. We will not tolerate this.” Catering to over 4 lakh insured workers of Mohali, the ESI Hospital in Phase 7, Industrial Area, continues to remain in a shambles. Though the ESI Corporation is also running two dispensaries, these are ill-equipped, leaving ailing workers and their families in the lurch. 
04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali records 14 new Covid cases, highest since July 5||As many as 14 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Mohali on Friday, the highest single-day tally in the district since July 5, when an equal number of cases had surfaced.While Dera Bassi recorded six cases, three cases each surfaced in Kharar and Dhakoli, and one case each was reported from Boothgarh and Gharuan. Deputy commissioner Isha Kalia attributed the uptick to overcrowding in markets and violations of Covid-19 norms. “We have already ordered closure of schools below Class 4 in Dhakoli, Gharuan and Dera Bassi, where the positivity rate is 0.2%. Our staff on Friday carried out an awareness drive regarding wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. We will start challaning the violators soon,” she said. Meanwhile, Chandigarh recorded three cases and one person tested positive in Panchkula, taking the tricity’s tally to 18 on Friday. On Thursday, only eight cases had surfaced. Meanwhile, no death was reported due to the virus. Since November 1, only four deaths have been reported, all from Mohali.The tricity’s active caseload has gone up to 141, with 64 patients in Chandigarh, 54 in Mohali, and 23 in Panchkula.Woman breaks quarantine after return from South Africa, bookedThe Chandigarh Police on Friday booked a woman, who had recently returned from South Africa, for flouting the mandatory quarantine order. According to the director, health services, Chandigarh the woman had returned to the city from South Africa on December 1. Upon her arrival at the airport, she tested negative for Covid-19. However, as per central guidelines for returnees from “high risk” countries, she was asked to quarantine herself at her house in Sector 48 for seven days. She was to undergo another test on December 8, as per the standard protocol.However on December 2, the woman broke the quarantine protocol and checked into a hotel in the afternoon. Thereafter, she again left the hotel and returned to her house in the late evening hours.A case has been lodged against her under the Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread the infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act at the Sector-49 police station. “The UT administration is very vigilant and is adopting every measure to control the Covid-19 spread. However, people must help the administration by following all the rules and guidelines, which are ultimately for their own benefit, said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. Garg said police and other authorities concerned have been asked to take special caution about foreign returnees from specified countries at risk. “Also, hotels and guest houses within Chandigarh have been instructed to ascertain travel history of the guests for the last 15 days at time of their check-in,” he said.Health authorities across the country are on alert in view of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, which was first reported in South Africa. One vaccine dose mandatory for staff to enter Chandigarh schools Amid an uptick in Covid-19 cases and the threat of its new Omicron variant, the Chandigarh education department has made it mandatory for both teaching and non-teaching staff to have taken at least one vaccine dose to enter the school premises. Those who fail to do so can still be allowed entry, but only if they carry a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours. Action will be taken against the school head if any non-complying employee is found on the premises.According to the order issued by district education officer (DEO) Prabhjot Kaur, schools will have to prepare a list of employees who have not been vaccinated. Those who have received the shot will have to show their certificate.The move is unlikely to have any major impact on work as, according to the DEO, almost all employees have been vaccinated. “These orders were issued as per instructions of the department of personnel, UT administration, which are also being followed by other government offices. Over 99% of the department employees have been vaccinated. We will look into any special cases, wherein exemption can be given on medical grounds,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-records-14-new-covid-cases-highest-since-july-5-101638560755545.html

In fact, they are still awaiting the forensic report, according to the investigating officials.Prof BB Goyal, who teaches at University Business School, had told police that he found the body of his wife, Seema Goyal, 60, on waking up in the morning. While she had slept in a room on the ground floor, he had reportedly slept in another room upstairs. By the time police reached the spot, the body had been moved to hospital. Prof Goyal had claimed that Seema’s hands and legs were tied with a cloth and the house’s main door was bolted from outside. According to the preliminary postmortem report, she had strangulation marks on the neck and some injuries on the head.“The crime scene was already contaminated when police reached the spot, as the body had been removed. Preserving the crime scene is very important, as it can give vital clues,” said a senior police official privy to the investigations. The official, who did not wish to be named, added that the forensic report will help shed more light on the crime, “but we have not received it yet, as it takes time”. Meanwhile, Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (SP, City), Chandigarh, refused to share any details, stating that the investigations were still underway. Police are yet to ascertain whether the parts of two mesh doors in the house – one in the bedroom and the other in the kitchen – were removed from inside or outside. Even though police have so far ruled out forced entry, a senior official said the condition of the mesh doors suggests attempt to enter by opening the door bolts. This would become clear only once forensic report becomes available. The victim’s mobile phone is also untraceable, and as per the mobile tower locations, it did not leave the campus. Clueless in shooting case too Not just the PU murder case, police have failed to get any clue about the robbery suspect who had fired at a home guard chasing him in the Industrial Area on November 23. The suspect had committed a robbery at the mango orchards in Sector 28 on November 17.The injured home guard, Prakash Singh Negi, 40, had sustained a bullet injury in the stomach. He was discharged from hospital on Friday.

Sectors 39 and 40 have their share of troubles, including rising crime, pothole-riddled roads, poor sanitation, stray dogs and a shoddy garbage collection system.Amardeep Singh, who lives in Sector 39, said, “Road carpeting remains pending, while finding parking space is also a task. The sector often faces water supply snags as well.” Former president of the Residents Welfare Society, HIG Category-1 Flats, Sector 39-B, KK Kaul said, “There is no check on stray dogs, whose numbers have grown by leaps and bounds. Residents, especially senior citizens, are scared to venture out due to their fear. The garbage collection system is also troublesome due to haphazard timings.”General secretary of the MIG-1 Houses Welfare Association of Sector 40-C, SK Khosla said, “The sector needs more playgrounds for children, as arguments in parks are commonplace. CCTV cameras are required at various points in the sector to rein in the increasing street crimes.”Shopkeepers in the sector complain of the chaos due to the street vending zone. “The traders don’t stick to the space allotted to them for vending and create mess right in front of our shops,” said Pritpal Singh Sodhi, president of the local market association. SK Joyed Ali, a jeweller here, added that the tiles installed in the market needed replacement and the parking space also needed improvements.Know Your WardLocalities: Parts of Sector 38 West (excluding Rehabilitation Colony), Sector 39 and Sector 40General wardVoters: 23,500Key issuesProximity to the Dadumajra dumping groundPoor sanitation in sectors, problems with garbage collection systemDeteriorating law and order due to frequent crimes like snatchingsLocal voicesThe Dadumajra dumping ground needs a permanent solution.

Angrej Singh, meanwhile, was taken to the Ambala Cantt civil hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Angrej’s family claimed he used to earn ₹20,000 per month by polishing utensils in different factories at Jagadhari and hence, sought a compensation of ₹50 lakh.Mam Raj submitted that no accident, involving his vehicle, took place and that a false FIR was lodged by the claimants in collusion with the police. The car’s insurer, Iffco Tokio General Insurance Company Limited, Chandigarh, on the other hand, stated that the owner was not holding a valid driving license at the time of accident and hence, there was violation in the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.

A budget of ₹1.16 crore had been sanctioned for the road and the irrigation department had constructed a 700-metre portion of it.“When I got there and tried to break a coconut, the coconut did not break. Bits of the road came off,” Choudhary told media.An angry Choudhary lodged a complaint in this regard (against officials of irrigation department) with district magistrate Umesh Mishra, who formed a committee to investigate the charges of the MLA.Speaking to HT over phone, Mishra said the executive engineer of the irrigation department had given a request letter to form a committee for an investigation into the matter. “I have formed a committee for probe into the case,” he added.MLA Choudhary, in a video circulating in social media, raised questions over the quality of the road and accused the irrigation department’s executive engineer and junior engineer of connivance with the contractor who constructed the road. “While I was questioning the contractor for substandard construction, the executive engineer and junior Engineer were trying to pacify me more than the contractor,” she said demanding stern action against those responsible for “substandard construction”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/newly-constructed-road-in-bijnore-cracks-after-mla-slams-coconut-during-inauguration-101638559914077.html

During arguments on a plea filed by former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma, the SIT said the accused were filing pleas on one ground or the other only to delay the trial. The SIT urged the court against entertaining the pleas. Last month, Sharma had filed a plea seeking directions to the Punjab Police to conduct further investigation with regard to the injuries suffered by cops as well as the damage to public property during the Behbal Kalan firing incident. Another application was filed last week for deferment of framing of charges against the accused in the case, citing the Punjab and Haryana high court decision to grant exemption to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini from personal appearance till February 2022. The accused had also urged the court to ask the SIT to file a status report in the FIR registered against protesters by the cops. Replying to this, the SIT told the court that the accused cannot make any suggestions regarding the investigation method or seek information of the ongoing probe. Public prosecutor Pankaj Taneja argued in the court that the SIT was still investigating the two cases registered in connection with the Behbal Kalan firing incident, including the one against protesters. “As the matter is under investigation, the details cannot be disclosed to the accused. They are filling pleas on one ground or the other with a purpose to delay the trial, these pleas should be dismissed,” he added. Additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi adjourned the matter to December 7 for further arguments and asked the state to file a reply on the second application. All the accused, including suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Paramraj Singh Umranangal, former SSP Sharma, SP Bikramjit Singh, then SHO, Bajakhana, Amarjit Singh Kular, Pankaj Bansal and Suhail Singh Brar were present.

The plea was filed on September 1, but the notice was issued on Friday, confirmed Saini’s lawyer Sant Pal Singh Sidhu. Saini was arrested on August 18 in a September 2020 cheating case when he had gone to the vigilance office to join the probe in a corruption case as directed by the high court on August 12. A day later, the high court had termed his arrest illegal and ordered his release. Saini has made former director general, vigilance, BK Uppal, then joint director, Varinder Singh and DSP, Harwinder Singh, who was investigating officer of the case as party in the case. Saini’s allegations are that they acted in violation of high court orders and on the instructions from political leaders even as high court had given him protection against the arrest. A single-judge bench, which allowed release of Saini, had observed that the allegations against Saini were the same which were in the August 2021 FIR of alleged corruption in which interim anticipatory bail was granted by high court to him on August 12. Thus, Saini’s arrest on substantially the same allegations was “patently illegal” in a 2020 FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-notice-to-ex-vigilance-chief-2-others-on-ex-punjab-dgp-saini-s-contempt-plea-101638559616303.html

Over the last two years, the Panjab University’s Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) forwarded multiple recommendations, which were to be implemented in the university by its different organs, to the Dean University Instruction (DUI) office. These included self-deduced measures aimed at overall improvement, as well as suggestions made by the NAAC during its last visit.Last year, the IQAC communicated a need for an annual gender sensitisation action plan. The cell also pressed for detailed reports on measures taken to make the campus disabled-friendly and inducing a barrier free environment.‘University faces a challenge’Ashish Jain, the director of IQAC, said the varsity is already gearing up for the NAAC ‘s upcoming visit. “The work at hand right now is the submission of the AQAR report for 2021 and once that is done, we will start work on filling in the SSR,” he said. Also highlighting some of the challenges that they are currently facing, Jain said, “The university is facing challenges to fulfil the NAAC criteria in view of the prevalent situation due to pandemic, wherein the varsity was functioning with a very limited capacity for the last one and half year. However, we are now working the best we can to ensure that we fulfil most of the NAAC criteria.”The DUI office on Thursday also sent out a circular, asking departments to provide contact details of faculty members who have been told to look into the various parameters of NAAC evaluation. During the last NAAC visit, which was held in 2015, PU was granted an A-grade, with a comprehensive score of 3.35 out of four. The varsity, however, is yet to implement some of the NAAC’s 2015 recommendations, which may impact its rating in the upcoming evaluation.

Despite the efforts of the emergency services, he died at the scene a short time later, the Met Police said.“My thoughts and those of my team are with Rishmeet’s family and friends at this incredibly difficult time. I want to reassure them and the wider community that we are working around the clock to bring the person, or people, responsible for Rishmeet’s death, to justice,” said Detective Chief Inspector James Shirley, who is leading the investigation.Rishmeet’s friends and locals from the area have expressed fears that the British Sikh boy may have been attacked for a fake Gucci bag he always carried with him.Chief superintendent Sean Wilson, head of policing for Ealing, Hounslow and Hillingdon, said Rishmeet’s family have been devastated by his death.“Specialist detectives continue to work at pace to find out who was responsible for this attack. I would also add my appeal to the public to get in touch if they have any information that could help the investigation,” said Wilson.“I know that this tragic incident will have understandably shocked the local community and our officers throughout the west (London) area share that shock.“We remain committed to working with the local community to address any concerns they may have,” he said, adding that residents of the west London neighbourhood can expect to see an increased policing presence over the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/teen-charged-with-17-yr-old-british-sikh-s-murder-in-uk-101638559315190.html

Mishra said that the report of the question paper leak became public else the people close to the BJP government would have been declared qualified and the deserving candidates had to suffer. He also attacked the BJP for imposing National Security Act (NSA) against the political rivals out of political vendetta. Mishra said, “The projects for development of Mathura were launched during the BSP government by then chief minister Mayawati, but the BJP government is now just putting its stamp on the development done by our government.” “The BJP leaders have been indulging in politics of caste and creed. For the past five years, the leaders of the saffron brigade did not remember Lord Krishna, when the assembly elections drew near, they started raising the issue of Sri Krishna temple at Mathura,” Mishra said. Around 700 farmers died during the farmers’ stir against the three contentious farm laws but the government was not ready to give financial assistance to the family members of the deceased.“No talks are being held with farmer leaders over withdrawal of the cases and minimum support price,” he said. Under the Samajwadi Party government too, riots, communal tension, loot, murder, robbery and rape used to happen every day in various districts. Under the BSP government, not a single riot took place, the criminals fled the state, all castes and class felt safe during the tenure of Mayawati ji, he said.

Khaps and farmers had announced a social boycott of the BJP-JJP leaders and the ruling leaders faced massive protests in the last one year.Interacting with party workers in Sonepat, Dushyant said his party has fulfilled over 40% of its poll promises made during the 2019 assembly polls.“Our government is procuring 13 crops on minimum support price and compensation to farmers under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana’ for 19 crops. We have also fulfilled our promise of giving 75% reservation to Haryana youths in the private sector in state and 50% reservation to women in the Panchayati Raj system. We are enthusiastic about celebrating the third foundation day of our party in Jhajjar.

Action against engineer Sunil Kumar Gupta, who is currently attached to the Varansi discoms, comes after he failed to provide a satisfactory reply to charges farmed against him. “We have sacked Sunil Kumar Gupta after charges against him were established beyond any doubt,” UPPCL chairman M Devrak said while confirming it.

Justice Rahul Chaturvedi passed the order while hearing the bail application of Anand Giri, who is in jail since September 22, 2021, in connection with the case. According to the petitioner’s bail application, it has been stated that he (Anand Giri) has falsely been implicated in the case. The alleged suicide note is not in the hand writing of Narendra Giri and there are a lot of cuttings in the suicide note. Apart from this, there is no evidence against the petitioner who was in Haridwar, away from the city when the incident occurred, when police authorities informed the petitioner over phone regarding the incident. The matter will come up again for hearing after four weeks. Earlier on November 11, a local court had rejected the bail application of Anand Giri. Mahant Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan in Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj on September 20. A suicide note was also recovered from him, in which he had accused his disciple Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari, and Sandeep Tiwari of mental torture. On November 20, two months after the death of Mahant Narendra Giri, CBI filed a charge sheet in a local court against Anand Giri and two others booked for abetment of suicide, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was also lodged against Anand Giri and two others under IPC Section 306 at Georgetown police station in Prayagraj. The state government set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. However, the matter was later handed over to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mahant-narendra-giri-death-case-hc-seeks-reply-from-cbi-on-anand-giri-s-bail-plea-101638558479445.html

04-12-2021||Chandigarh||Rohtak land release case: INLD slams Haryana govt for seeking recall of CBI probe order by SC||The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) on Friday slammed the BJP-led Haryana government for filing an application in the Supreme Court (SC) to seek recall of a July 7 order of the apex court for a CBI probe in the release of land in Rohtak to real estate developer, Uddar Gagan Properties, during the tenure of Bhupinder Singh Hooda as chief minister.Reacting to a HT news report, INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala in a statement on Friday alleged that the move to seek recall of the SC’s orders clearly showed that there was a tacit understanding between the ruling BJP and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda.The Ellenabad MLA said CM Manohar Lal Khattar had in 2018 announced on the floor of the state assembly that a CBI probe will be ordered in the Rohtak land release matter.“But the issue was diluted when a retired judge was appointed to hold an inquiry. I had asked the CM in the assembly as to why this somersault has been made. The decision clearly meant a betrayal with the people of the state and an attempt to shield Hooda,” the INLD leader alleged.The apex court, in its July 7 order, had said that the matter shall be looked into by the CBI without in any way being influenced by the reports and conclusions as stated in this order.The SC was referring to the outcome of the multiple inquiries ordered by the state government which as per the amicus curiae, Jaideep Gupta only concluded that there was “systemic failure” rather than considering the individual actions of those who were responsible.The SC, in its order, said amicus curiae while highlighting the May 2016 directions of the court has said the drift of the apex court’s decision showed that the state power was deliberately misused for private gain and therefore, the direction required the state to “inquire into the legality and bona fides of the actions of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the application of the builder and allotting the land to it”.“The amicus curiae further submits that initially the matter was referred to a senior civil servant. After his report which suggested systemic failure and that no action be taken against any official, the matter was made over to a retired judge of the high court.”“The matter was then considered under five heads as stated in the report and with respect to the fifth head, the matter was again dealt with by another civil servant. This report also concluded that there was systemic failure rather than considering the individual actions of those who were responsible,” the SC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rohtak-land-release-case-inld-slams-haryana-govt-for-seeking-recall-of-cbi-probe-order-by-sc-101638558294084.html
04-12-2021||Pune||One-way between Baner and Pashan road being implemented||PUNE: To facilitate easy vehicular movement, the Pune traffic police department has decided to make a circular one-way between Abhimanshree society in Baner and Pashan road. Preparations for the one-way are underway and most probably it will be implemented next week onward.Sharing details of the one-way road, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “We are going to make a circular one-way route between Baner and Pashan roads for easy vehicular movement. On Pashan road, vehicles going straight will go toward Pashan while from Abhimanshree society, the road will take a right turn, then a left turn, and then go toward Baner road. While vehicles coming from Baner road will take a left turn toward Abhimanshree society and then go toward Pashan road. This will be carried out in a circular movement and currently, the work of installing signage boards for the same is underway.”“These changes will be made on an experimental basis initially but later on, they will be made permanent as barricades will be installed. Also, other infrastructural works are underway along the road stretch and so it will take time to start. Most probably from next week, these new changes of one-way traffic movement will be implemented,” said Shrirame.The area around Abhimanshree society has a mix of bungalows and housing societies. It connects to major roads of Pashan and Baner where prominent institutions such as the Pune rural police headquarters, National Institute of Chemistry (NCL), and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune are located.While most residents have welcomed the decision of a circular one-way route, Shantanu Rathi said, “It is good that a circular one-way is being made on this road as during peak hours, there is traffic congestion many times. Also there would be more space for vehicular movement but initially people will take time to understand the changes in this one-way circular movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/oneway-between-baner-and-pashan-road-being-implemented-101638558175256.html

A total of 710 sites saw vaccination of which 549 were government centres and 161 were private. Omicron variant: 30 samples sent for genomic surveillance Two more suspected Omicron samples sent for genome sequencing. On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the Covid-19 virus variant detected in South Africa and some other countries Omicron. WHO has also classified the Omicron variant as a “variant of concern”. Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics. While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause a severe disease and whether it will evade the immunity. More information is expected in the next two weeks’ time or so. Against this background, surveillance of international passengers has been started as per the Government of India guidelines. Until Friday morning, 2,821 passengers arriving from Omicron high-risk countries at Mumbai airport have been tested with RT-PCR and two samples have been positive. 224 of 11,060 passengers arrived from other countries have been tested and one out of them was tested positive. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers who have arrived since November 1 is underway. A total of 30 samples from both airport and field surveillance have been sent for genomic sequencing. Of these, 14 are sent to NIV Pune and 16 to Kasturba Hospital laboratory. Genetic changes/mutation in viruses is a natural phenomenon and people should not panic. The public health department appeals to the citizens that they should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The department authorities if they have had an international travel history in the last month and those who have not taken Covid-19 vaccine or have had only one dose should complete their vaccination at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-pune-district-sees-168-new-cases-and-2-deaths-101638557995192.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal flags off first pilgrim train to Ayodhya||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged off on Friday the first pilgrim train to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, launched under the ”Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojna”, from the Safdarjung railway station. Launched in 2019, the government scheme allows Delhi residents to undertake subsidised tours to popular pilgrim sites across the country and three new sites — Ayodhya, Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni — were added last month to the list of available tour options, said officials. The maiden train to Ayodhya set off on Friday, but not before some minor hiccups. Kejriwal said the central government did not grant permission to hold a programme at the station to see off the first set of pilgrims. “I want to tell the central government that this type of behaviour is not right,” he said. Chief public relations officer, Northern Railway, Deepak Kumar said no function can be allowed because of safety and operations at the railway stations. He said that despite the restriction, there was massive rush at the station.The train carrying 1,000 pilgrims was flagged off by Kejriwal and it finally set off for Ayodhya around 7.20pm. The chief minister met and spoke with several pilgrims before they seeing them off. “If anyone gets a chance to undertake a pilgrimage in their twilight years, then their happiness knows no bounds. I loved meeting the pilgrims and seeing them so happy,” Kejriwal said. He added that due to Covid-19 pandemic, the pilgrimage tours under the state government scheme had to be stopped, but now that Covid cases have reduced, the government has restarted the tours. “Now, the trains will go everywhere, including three new pilgrim sites, he said.The pilgrim tours scheme was launched by the government in July 2019 and a total of 1,100 residents per assembly constituency can avail of this facility a year, subject to a cap of 77,000 beneficiaries per year, officials said. Since its formal launch, a total of 35,080 beneficiaries have travelled under the scheme. Originally, the scheme had provisions to visit 12 religious sites, but three new places — Ayodhya, Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni — were added last month. The sites under the free pilgrimage scheme now are Anandpur Sahib, Ajmer-Pushkar, Rameshwaram-Madurai, Jagannath Puri-Konark, Vaishno Devi, Tirupati Balaji, Mathura-Vrindavan-Fatehpur Sikri, Haridwar-Rishikesh-Neelkanth, Dwarikadhish-Somnath, Shirdi-Shani Shingnapur-Trimbakeshwar, Ujjain-Omkareshwar, Gaya-Varanasi, Ayodhya, Velankanni and Kartarpur Sahib.A government official said passengers going from Delhi to Velankanni will be provided a seat in an AC three-tier compartment by the Delhi government, while a plan has been made to send Delhi pilgrims to Kartarpur Sahib by deluxe AC buses. The first batch of passengers on an AC bus from Delhi to Kartarpur Sahib will leave on January 5, 2022, and the first train carrying passengers from Delhi to Velankanni will leave on January 7, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-flags-off-first-pilgrim-train-to-ayodhya-101638557935122.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves marginally, thanks to overnight rain||New Delhi: Delhi’s air quality improved marginally on Friday as isolated rain and increased wind speed cleared pollutants in the Capital’s air on Thursday night, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on Friday, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of Delhi was 346, in the “very poor” zone. This was a marginal improvement from Thursday’s reading of 429, in the “severe” category on CPCB’s AQI scale. An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.IMD scientists said that this improvement in Delhi’s pollution levels was due to light, isolated showers in many parts of the Capital on Thursday evening. The rain, along with improved wind speeds, facilitated the dispersion of accumulated pollutants. However, winds are likely to become calm again on Saturday before another western disturbance on November 5 brings a bout of light rain and swift wind. “The rain and wind were the primary reasons for the improvement in pollution levels. From November 5 to November 7, another western disturbance will impact the Capital, which will result in a marginal improvement in the city’s air quality. Light rain has been forecast for November 6. However, the AQI will still remain in the lower end of ”very poor”,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre. Since November this year, Delhi has been reeling under some of the worst spells of pollution that it has ever experienced. Delhi’s average air quality in November was the worst on record since 2015—when the CPCB started maintaining pollution records. The average AQI reading last month was 376, surpassing the previous high of November 2016, when it was 374. Delhi also recorded 11 “severe” air quality days in November, the highest count since 2015. On Thursday, on the directions of the Supreme Court, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas directed the constitution of a special task force for Delhi and in each of the NCR states to ensure that steps ordered for pollution control in the region are effectively enforced. The CAQM ordered the closure of all schools and educational institutions in NCR, banned the entry of trucks into Delhi, except for those carrying essential items, and disallowed industries that use non-PNG and other unclean fuels from operating. Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday wrote to the Union environment minister requesting a meeting with all environment ministers and experts of NCR states to prepare a joint action plan for the future to combat pollution. He also alleged, quoting reports and studies, that most of Delhi’s pollution is caused by external sources on which the city government has little control. “As far as I am aware, a report released by CSE (Centre for Science and Environment) on the basis of data presented by IITM (Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology) says that Delhi’s internal pollution sources account for 31% of the total pollution in the city, while 69% is from sources outside. Despite all our efforts to curb internal sources of pollution, the overall pollution is still high. Keeping that in mind, I have once again written to the Union environment minister to take some time out to address this important issue. I have been consistently urging him to create a joint action plan with the environment departments and ministers of the various NCR states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-improves-marginally-thanks-to-overnight-rain-101638557933912.html
04-12-2021||Pune||Festival organisers on back foot due to looming Omicron threat||PUNE: With the spectre of the new, Omicron variant of coronavirus looming large, the state government is maintaining restrictions for theatres, auditoriums and open spaces and organisers of popular cultural and music shows are consequently on the back foot.While organisers were hoping for performances to full capacity auditoriums and open spaces, they are now disappointed as the threat of Omicron has made it difficult to plan programmes. Anticipating further restrictions, most organisers are now adopting a ‘wait and watch’ policy to see how the situation evolves. As a result, they could lose the entire month of December, adding to their losses.Sunil Mahajan, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad, Kothrud branch, said that minimum two months are required to arrange a programme as many artists come from other states. “I spoke to an artist from Karnataka yesterday and he said that because of Omicron positive patients, some restrictions have been imposed there. Many artists come from other states but because of the Omicron threat, we cannot schedule anything with them. Also, occupancy issues are still there. If the situation worsens and lockdown is imposed again, all preparations will go to naught. So for now, we will just wait till the confusion is cleared,” Mahajan said.In its latest order, the state government has cleared that multiplexes, auditoriums, and single-screen theatres will continue to operate at 50% capacity while open sky spaces for any event or gathering will continue to operate at 25% capacity.Shrinivas Joshi, executive secretary of Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal which organises the popular Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav said that these are inconvenient times for organisers. “We have been holding this mahotsav on open grounds and having only 25% capacity is not affordable for us or the sponsors. We had started planning the event but it has now been put on hold. Open spaces should be allowed to function with at least 50% capacity. We can hold the programmes only if that happens,” Joshi said.As the Omicron threat has increased over the last few days, many are anticipating further Covid-induced restrictions. “We definitely want to hold the music festivals. It’s a tradition and it should continue. Last year, we couldn’t do much. This year, even though the number of cases is less, there is the challenge of the new variant. As of now, we don’t know if more restrictions will be imposed. If there is no lockdown, we plan to do shows in January 2022,” said Rajas Upadhye, chief executive officer, Swar Jhankar music festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/festival-organisers-on-back-foot-due-to-looming-omicron-threat-101638557873850.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi logs 54 new Covid cases, single-day infections see consistent uptick||Delhi on Friday maintained its consistent uptick of daily cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after a total of 54 people were found to be infected with the virus, according to the health bulletin data shared by the Delhi government. Following this, the cumulative caseload of Covid-19 in the national capital climbed up to 14,41,244.Friday's single-day caseload is a rise from Thursday when 41 cases were logged. Further, 176 Covid-19 cases from earlier weeks were added to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal by ICMR-NICPR Noida on Thursday.Delhi has continuously been witnessing an upward swing in fresh Covid-19 cases for the last six days. On November 28, the city reported 32 new cases, and has since been seeing a consistent rise.Meanwhile, Delhi is yet to report a fatality due to Covid-19 in December after three days of the last month of the year have passed. However, the national capital last month logged as many as seven deaths due to coronavirus - a departure from its trend of reporting lesser fatalities due to the infection. Notably, in October, the capital recorded the least monthly death toll due to Covid-19 since March 2020 after four people succumbed to the virus. In September, the city reported five deaths due to Covid-19.A total of 29 new recoveries were recorded on Friday, which took the total number of recovered cases to 14,15,814, the bulletin data revealed. The capital's active case count now stands at 332.As far as vaccination against Covid-19 is concerned, 2,29,61,978 eligible beneficiaries have been jabbed in the capital so far, of which, 1,39,65,332 have received the first dose and the remaining 89,96,646 the second. In the last 24 hours, 107,293 people have been administered with Covid-19 vaccine, with 38,825 getting jabbed with the first shot and 68,468 with the second.This development comes at a time when the world is grappling with the discovery of Omicron Covid-19 variant, first seen in South Africa. Classified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a ‘variant of concern’, the Omicron was reported in India on Thursday after two tested positive for the same in Karnataka. One of the patients is a 66-year-old South African man, who has already returned to the his home country. A controversy has now emerged regarding the RT-PCR test report he showed while leaving India. Meanwhile, the other patient aged 46, who is a doctor, doesn't have any travel history and five of his contacts have also tested Covid-19 positive.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has constantly been vocal with his appeal to the Centre as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi over imposing travel bans from affected countries in order to stop the Omicron variant from spreading in India. On Tuesday, he mentioned during a press conference that the Delhi government has prepared a total of 30,000 oxygen beds, of which, 10,000 will be ICU in wake of Omicron. Besides, 6,800 beds are under construction and will be ready by February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-logs-54-new-covid-cases-single-day-infections-see-consistent-uptick-101638553657666.html

A total of 443 villages in Pune district with approximately 1.41 million people are now fully vaccinated. Villagers in these villages, across the district and from different talukas, have taken both shots of the Covid vaccine. Pune district is one of the districts with the highest number of first-dose and fully vaccinated beneficiaries. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad said, “We were to start schools from December 1, but we had to delay it due to various reasons like the Omicron scare and the rains that started. However, now we are resuming primary classes for Class 1 to Class 4th. Almost all the villages under Pune ZP administration have no active cases, except eight that are either within PMC limits now or on the border. We have permitted both private and public schools to start, since our staff is fully vaccinated and private schools have to ensure that their staff is following Covid-19- appropriate behaviour.” As of Thursday, the areas of Pune Zilla Parishad, including the villages, the councils and Cantonment areas have 135 hospitalised Covid-19 patients and 590 active patients isolated at homes Also, the ZP reported 68 new cases and two deaths as per the district health office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-zp-reopens-schools-for-classes-1-4-in-villages-free-of-covid19-101638557696875.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Uphaar fire: Delhi court junks Ansals’ plea to suspend jail sentence||A Delhi court on Friday dismissed pleas by real estate baron Sushil and Gopal Ansal seeking suspension of the seven-year jail term awarded to them for tampering with evidence in the main Uphaar fire case.Noting that the “crime involved in the present case is of a very grave nature”, additional sessions judge Anil Antil also dismissed pleas by Ansals’ former employees PP Batra and Anoop Singh, and a former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma, who were also booked in the tampering case.“The case at hand is one of the gravest of its kind. The offence herein appears to be the outcome of a calculated design on the part of the appellants/convicts to interfere with the course of justice. The polluters of the judicial firmament are required to be shown no leniency to maintain the sublimity of the institution, and recourse faith in general public in the administration of justice; any interference in the course of justice, any obstruction caused in the path of those seeking justice are an affront to the majesty of law and needs to be viewed seriously,” the court said in a 44-page order.The case is related to the tampering of the evidence in the main Uphaar fire tragedy case, which had claimed 59 lives, for which the Ansals were convicted and sentenced to a two-year jail term by the Supreme Court.The Ansal brothers along with former court staff Dinesh Sharma, and other individuals -- PP Batra, Har Swaroop Panwar, Anoop Singh, and Dharamvir Malhotra -- were booked in the tampering case. Panwar and Malhotra died during the course of the trial.In the main fire case, the Ansals were convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by the Supreme Court. The apex court had, however, released them on the period already undergone in the jail on the condition that they paid ₹30 crore fine each to be used for building a trauma centre in the national capital.During the trial in the main case related to the tragedy, the Ansals, along with five others, including the then court staffer, had torn and defaced crucial documents of the prosecution evidence to secure their acquittal.On October 8, the court convicted the Ansal brothers and three others for abetment, causing disappearance of evidence, criminal breach of trust by a public servant and criminal conspiracy.On November 8, the magistrate court had handed over seven-year imprisonment to all the five convicts while imposing a fine of ₹2.25 crore on the Ansal brothers. The judge had also fined Batra, Singh and Sharma ₹3 lakh each along with the jail term. The convicts had challenged the sentence and the fine imposed on them.On Friday, rejecting their challenge, the court said that suspending the sentence at this stage will be against the established principles of criminal law and would “shake the confidence of general public in the judicial system”.The court also said that a criminal justice system drives its legitimacy not only from legislation but more so from the faith that the public at large reposes in it. It said that no extraordinary circumstances exist in favour of the convicts to suspend their sentence, adding that the nature of the crime is such that it “strikes at the very edifice of functioning of the court”.“A finding of guilt has already been given by the trial court. Thus the presumption of innocence that attaches to the accused during the trial of the case does not apply at the stage of consideration of suspension of sentence, whereby the appellants/accused persons stand guilty by the court concerned,” the judge said.The court noted that besides suffering from age related ailments, no other diseases are cited which requires immediate/urgent intervention. It further said that age itself cannot be the sole criteria to grant relief to the convicts when they were themselves involved in the “procrastinated trial of the case”.“They cannot be permitted to take benefit of their own wrongs. On the other hand, inordinate delay in the trial of the case also does cause acute suffering and anguish to the victims of the offence, and the rights of the victims cannot by any yardstick be subservient to the rights of the accused/convicts,” the court said.It also said that the convicts had not undergone a long incarceration and it is not such that the appeal is not likely to be heard in near future.“In so far as the said question of hearing of the appeals in nearby future is concerned, the same can well be taken care by expediting the final arguments on merits and the convenient date can be given, in light of other pendency and scheduled workloads of the court, and the counsels can also conclude their arguments within a time frame,” the judge said.The court also said that it is “manifestly clear that the tampered documents, including one cheque which went missing at a relevant point of time, could have been used, or tampered with only with the intent to use the same for illegal design”.It also said that the Ansals and Har Swaroop Panwar, a co-accused who died during trial, were the ultimate beneficiaries of the tampering and strong motive existed for the accused to get the documents tampered as those documents reflected the culpability of Ansal brothers in managing the affairs of the companies.

The respective administrations are now tracking all the foreign returnees to test them for the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron.Sample collections will happen door to door. These 598 foreign returnees who will be subject to RTPCR testing and contact tracing include all international passengers, irrespective of country of origin.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We are tracking all passengers and calling them up for their RTPCR testing. Irrespective of their symptoms and the country of origin we are RTPCR testing them and sending their samples to government labs. We are calling up each individual and sending our teams door-to-door to collect samples and trace their contacts as well to follow up on symptoms if any. We have about 393 people who have travelled back to Pune from various countries, not necessarily just the three countries ‘at risk’. Over 90% of the people on the list are not from ‘at risk’ countries, but we are testing them as well.” Along with PMC, the rural administration as well the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has geared up to track all passengers who have returned from abroad, irrespective of the country they have travelled to. On Thursday, the state government issued guidelines stating that domestic travellers either have to be fully vaccinated or have to carry a negative RTPCr test not older than 72 hours. For international travellers coming from ‘at risk’ countries, including Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, 15 days before the date of arrival in Maharashtra an RTPCR test has to be done. Also, immediately upon arrival have these passengers have to undergo seven days of institutional quarantine and a second RTPCR test. If any of these tests are positive then the person will be admitted to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/598-foreign-returnees-in-pune-district-to-be-rtpcr-tested-393-in-city-101638557514969.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Most prefer doorstep ration delivery over fair price shops: Delhi govt tells HC||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the state government why it did not implement the doorstep ration delivery programme with the existing framework of fair price shops (FPS), even as it observed that these shops carried a “poor impression”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the Delhi government about the programme’s checks and balances, and how it will be different from the FPS scheme.“People carry a poor impression of fair price shops, probably for good reasons because there was not much regulation, checks on the practices that they were following. They were selling it in the black market and those things have been there in the past,” the court observed. “These technological advancements which have been there … the ePos [electronic point-of-sale], the geo-tagging etc… these are all measures that have been put in place to check all those malpractices, pilferage. If it can be done through the new process, by bypassing these FPS, why can’t it be done through them. That is the only point. If it can be done through all those checks in place, then that serves everybody’s purpose. We are telling you all this so that you may want to consider…,” the bench asked.The questions were posed while hearing a plea by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, a group of FPS owners, in which they have challenged the doorstep ration delivery scheme and demanded that it should be declared ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority).The state last month told the high court that it will set up exclusive stores in different parts of the city for doorstep delivery of ration to ensure that those who are not at home can collect it at their convenience.The scheme has become another flashpoint between the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government and the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, with the former saying that the plan violates the provisions of National Food Security Act (NFSA) and will deprive migrants of foodgrains, and the latter pointing out that it will root out the ration mafia and ensure that all beneficiaries get their ration.On November 15, the Supreme Court declined to entertain two separate petitions (one by the Centre and another by FPS owners) against a Delhi high court interim order on September 27 that allowed the AAP government to stop supplying foodgrain to fixed price shops for patrons who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.The high court verdict also effectively gave a go-ahead to the state government scheme.Defending its scheme, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the state government, said that there was no point in having 1,500-2,000 fair price shops when 6.9 million of the city’s 7.2 million ration beneficiaries have opted for the home delivery of ration.He also contended that the National Food Security Act (NFSA) does not prohibit the doorstep delivery of entitlements. The state had earlier told the court that doorstep deliveries had become a norm and it assured that beneficiaries could opt out at any time.“The problem cannot always be the solution. We have put on record to show the glaring nepotistic practices… They want the vested interest and architecture to continue. There is a parallel system without total abolition and with an option for them to participate,” said Singhvi.
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi crime: Customs seizes 2,800 kg of cosmetics||The Delhi Customs on Monday seized around 2,800 kg of cosmetic items from Pakistan, which were routed through Abu Dhabi and shown as household items to avoid customs duty to the tune of around ₹1 crore.The officials said that while the customs duty for goods from most countries is 10-15%, the duty fee for goods sent from Pakistan is 200% which the smugglers, who are yet to be identified, tried to avoid.Custom officials said that the intelligence officers of the Air Cargo Export Commissionerate received a tip off on Monday about a consignment at the New Courier Terminal, following which officials found at least 2,800 kg of cosmetic products of Pakistan origin.“A total of 87 consignments had arrived by flight from Abu Dabhi. Upon examination, 84 consignments were found to contain cosmetics of Pakistan origin, and three consignments were of perfumes concentrate from Bahrain... The goods were attempted to be cleared through courier mode by wrongly declaring the origin and description of goods, including their value, to evade the applicable customs duty of 200% and IGST (integrated goods and service tax). The duty that they sought to evade is more than ₹1 crore. Interestingly, the smugglers used names and addresses of 87 individual recipients which appear to be ghost recipients,” said Sanjay Bansal, Commissioner of Customs, ACC (export).Officials in charge of the investigation said that they are now trying to identify the persons who were to collect these consignments from the delivery addresses.“Since the products are the same and were part of the same consignment, we suspect that it was the work of the same gang. They have got these addresses to receive the packages separately to avoid suspicion. We are trying to identify the module,” said an officer aware of the investigation details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-crime-customs-seizes-2-800kg-of-cosmetics-101638557217693.html

The suspects were identified as Pankaj Giri, 26, Shivam Chauhan, 23, and Shivam Kumar, 22, all residents of Nandgram in Ghaziabad. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida, said Sector 58 police received information about the suspects’ movement near Minda T-Point in Sector 60. “A police team reached the spot and arrested the three suspects. The police recovered 26 debit cards, nine forged Aadhaar cards, six mobile phones and ₹4.5 lakh cash from their possession,” he said. Singh said Giri is the mastermind of the gang. “Giri had hired the other two men for ₹8,000 a month to collect money from the betting participants. Chauhan and Kumar used to visit different areas in Noida and lure people to bet on cricket matches. They claimed to offer 80 times the betting amount if they won. The suspects operated the racket through a messaging app,” he said. The officer added the suspects used to give a few winners some money while keeping the rest of the amount for themselves. “During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they bought these debit cards from two suspects six months ago. Those two suspects are presently in Dasna jail in connection with some other crime,” said Rajnish Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Noida. Police said Giri has been involved in this racket for the last five years while the two others are working with him since last year. “A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act. “The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said Singh.

The suspect, identified as Sunil Baisla, a resident of Palwal in Haryana, was posted in Maharashtra. He had joined the services in 2008. The woman is single while the suspect is married and has two children, said police. Anil Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Sector Beta 2 police station, said the woman is a native of Aligarh and was living with her family members in Greater Noida. “The woman is pursuing MSc in a private college. In 2017, the woman and the suspect connected on a social networking site and started chatting. They met quite a number of times and decided to be in a relationship. However recently, the woman decided to opt out of the relationship. This infuriated the suspect, who came from Maharashtra to Greater Noida on November 30. He stayed in a guest house for a few days and on Thursday, reached the woman’s flat and created a ruckus,” said Kumar. Police said the woman closed the door from inside and refused to speak to him. “The suspect pelted stones and bricks at the woman’s house from outside and damaged her window and door. He also threatened the victim and her family members of consequences. Based on the complaint, we registered a case against the suspect on Thursday under Section 354-D (stalking), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC,” said the SHO.The victim and her family members left for their hometown on Friday fearing for their lives. “The suspect followed the woman to her hometown in Aligarh. We sent a police team and arrested him from Aligarh,” said Kumar. The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/havildar-of-indian-army-arrested-for-harassing-woman-in-greater-noida-101638557034873.html
04-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad admin now plans to vaccinate all beneficiaries with 1st dose by Dec 15||After missing the November 30 deadline of vaccinating all eligible beneficiaries in the district with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, district officials have set a new deadline and are now targeting to complete the task by December 15. According to official data, the district has administered the first dose to 2,430,509 people till December 3 of the total 2,702,167 eligible beneficiaries identified in the district, taking the first dose coverage to 89.95%. The second dose coverage is about 52.42% with 1,416,492 beneficiaries completely vaccinated against the virus. Officials, on their part, have planned extensive door to door campaign to spread awareness about Covid vaccination, more so after cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have come to the fore. “In terms of overall first dose coverage, the district stands at the third spot after Gautam Budh Nagar and Shahjahanpur. By December 15, we plan to vaccinate all beneficiaries with the first dose. We have also planned to rope in ration dealers to increase awareness among beneficiaries in the areas which have been left out of the inoculation drive or where vaccination coverage is low,” said R K Singh, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. According to figures available on the CoWIN portal, in the last one week spanning from November 26 to December 2, the district has been administering about 7,837 first doses on an average daily. The district administration will have to administer about 22,638 doses per days in the remaining 12 days starting from November 3 to meet its target of vaccinating all beneficiaries with the first dose by December 15. With the current daily average of administering 7,837 doses, the district would need about 35 more days to meet the first dose vaccination target. “We also plan to tap the super spreader groups, such as auto drivers, who come in direct contact with the public everyday, and have directed them to get the first dose. Moreover, teams have been deployed at engineering colleges, bus stations, ration shops and other public places for creating awareness and scaling up the vaccination drive,” said Singh. The administration is now focussing on areas, such as Kaila Bhatta, Shaheed Nagar, Loni and Vijay Nagar, where vaccination coverage is low. “There is no shortage of vaccine.It has been observed that the turnout for vaccination has slowed down since the festive season and more so after Covid cases have reduced considerably. We are using different measures to meet our vaccination target,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. 
04-12-2021||Noida||500 travellers from ‘at risk’ countries arrived in Noida since Nov 15||The district administration has received a list of about 500 international travellers who have come to Noida since November 15 from high risk countries. Officials said of the 292 travellers notified till Thursday, teams from the district administration have been able to trace about 240 of them till Friday. Around 45 travellers had been traced till Thursday morning. None of the travellers have tested positive for Covid-19 yet, said officials. A new list of about 200 travellers was sent to the district administration on Friday. The administration could not get through 52 travellers identified from the previous list and has sent teams to their given addresses to take their health updates. Meanwhile, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas L Y has been appointed as the nodal officer from the state to coordinate the list of international travellers coming to Uttar Pradesh. “The Director General of Civil Aviation essentially sends information of all travellers to the states. The state surveillance officer distributes them among all the district magistrates. We just need to ensure that the lists come on time so that tracking and testing can begin accordingly,” said the DM. Suhas also held the district’s Covid task force meeting on Friday morning after nearly three months to review the Covid preparedness of the district. Nodal officers for various tasks, including surveillance, RRTS, testing and contact tracing, have been appointed. Arrangements for various medications, beds and oxygen supply were also reviewed.“Many medicines used in Covid treatment do not a long shelf life. Though we don’t have any Covid cases yet, we want to be safe than sorry. I have asked the health department to find out the requirement of medicines so that we can rationally stock up,” said Suhas. He added that since most of the oxygen plants in the district are new, they are functional and are being kept ready for supply. “There are minor snags in the operation of the oxygen plants, which will be plugged within a week. There are also sufficient oxygen cylinders,” said Suhas. Estimates suggest that about 1,200 cylinders are available at the government facilities.While testing and vaccination was hit due to the strike called by staff of the National Health Mission (NHM), the administration has asked the lab technicians and Asha workers to rejoin work. On Thursday, the district health department reserved 30 beds in two wards of Noida Covid Hospital in Sector 39 for all international travellers who test positive for Covid-19.Depending on the severity of cases, patients will be either transferred to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida or be treated in the Noida Covid hospital, said officials.“Most L-1 (non-critical) patients may be in home isolation; L-2 (complicated) patients will be taken to the Noida Covid Hospital and L-3 (critical) patients will be taken to GIMS. If cases increase further, we will scale up the number of beds at other facilities,” Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer, had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/500-travellers-from-at-risk-countries-arrived-in-noida-since-nov-15-101638556973831.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Three held for stabbings, fourth suspect killed in accident||The police on Friday arrested two suspects and apprehended a juvenile accomplice in connection with two separate stabbing incidents that took place within an hour of each other on the night of November 30. A fourth suspect, police said, was killed in a road accident nearly seven hours after the gang allegedly committed the two crimes.Explaining the sequence of events, police said the gang of four first stabbed a man for resisting a robbery in south-west Delhi’s Mohan Garden. The victim, 32-year-old AC mechanic Saroj Kumar, was stabbed multiple times in his abdomen, back and thigh before the gang robbed him of his cellphone and fled on their motorcycles, police said.The second victim, a contractual conductor with the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), was stabbed near the waist by the four following an altercation. Although the DTC conductor, Surender Singh, was not robbed, the police suspect that the four may have waylaid him with the intention of robbing him. However, despite being stabbed, Singh managed to flee and reached the nearest police booth. That probably saved his life and belongings, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said the arrested men were identified as Karan,22, and Mohammad Sohail,21. They were arrested on Thursday by the investigating team of Mohan Garden police station. Their interrogation led to the recovery of the knife that was used in the two stabbing cases. The minor boy was also apprehended the same day.The fourth suspect, identified as Arju alias Razzak, was killed in a road accident nearly seven hours after the two crimes. The accident took place in Dwarka’s Sector 4 and the motorcycle that Arju and Karan were riding on was hit by an unknown vehicle, a senior police officer associated with the probe said.The incidents, latest in a series of street crimes in which the victims suffered fatal or serious injuries besides losing their property, took place between 9pm and 10pm near Old Palam Road on November 30.In his statement, the first victim Saroj Kumar told the police that he was returning home after work when the suspects cornered him and stabbed him multiple times before fleeing with his cellphone.Second victim Surender Singh said he had stopped his motorcycle to relieve himself when he was attacked by the four persons. He ran towards the police booth after being stabbed and raised the alarm. The suspects who were chasing him fled on seeing the police, the officer said. Delhi Police statistics show that cases of robbery have increased by nearly 14% this year (till October 31) when compared with the corresponding period last year. In numbers, the city saw 1,606 cases of robbery between January 1 and October 30 last year. This year, during the same period, 1,829 robberies were reported, police data showed.The data further revealed that Delhi reported 7,504 snatching cases till October 31 this year — 1,186 more than the cases reported during the same period in 2020. In a series of reports on crime in Delhi in March, HT had reported that unemployed, illiterate, school drop-outs, arrested for the first time are a common thread that connect almost every person arrested for snatching in Delhi since 2018, highlighting how one of the most serious concerns on the streets of the national capital is also its biggest gateway crime.
04-12-2021||Delhi||505 liquor brands registered in Delhi so far as part of new excise policy: Govt||The Delhi government said Friday that the new excise policy will help promote liquor brand availability in the Capital and the customer will have a wider choice. A government official said that under the new excise policy, the excise department has, so far, registered 505 brands, including 332 Indian brands and 173 foreign ones.“Of these, 166 brands of whisky, 55 brands of vodka, 65 brands of beer, 154 brands of wine, and 65 brands of other categories such rum, gin, brandy, liqueurs, and mixed alcoholic beverages have been registered for the year 2021-22. We have processed all applications and there is no brand registration pending,” the official said.The official added that the excise department is trying to add more brands in the next few months.Delhi moved to a new excise regime from November 17, 2021, which promises to improve user experience, increase government revenue, and clean up malpractices in the Capital’s liquor business. “We have reduced registration fees for a majority of liquor brand categories. This will further give the customer a wide choice in terms of brand availability. We have rationalised the brand registration process in order to make all niche brands available to the residents of the Capital,” a government official said.In March 2021, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had announced that a new policy will be set up for the liquor trade and the government will exit the business of selling liquor.Earlier, HT had reported that there were some initial hiccups once the new excise policy came into force--many vends faced a shortage in supply while some sites had not yet opened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/505-liquor-brands-registered-in-delhi-so-far-as-part-of-new-excise-policy-govt-101638556915958.html
04-12-2021||Noida||Visitors from across country pour in Greater Noida for 4-day expo on home decor||From centuries-old art carved on wood and metalware to the latest innovations, such as sleep technology and PPE safety kits, the Home Decor-Gift-Handicraft (HGH) India 2021 show, which concluded at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida on Friday, was an amalgamation of ancient and modern ideas.The 10th edition of the four-day trade show for home products, which is held every year in Mumbai, was hosted in Greater Noida for the first time and had visitors from over 460 cities and towns across India.In a joint initiative with the ministry of textiles, the HGH India dedicated a pavilion to Indian heritage and artisans, whose artworks were the major crowd puller. There were live demonstrations by master craftsmen and national award winners.Padma Shri awardee Lajwanti (identified by first name) displayed phulkari embroidery products at the pavilion. The 64-year-old from Patiala in Punjab has been engaged in the artwork since she was six.“Phulkari was once an important part of a Punjabi bride’s trousseau and continues to be the same till date. However now, it is also being adapted to home décor items such as bed sheets, curtains, wall hangings, and cushion covers. Dresses, bags, and pouches are also embellished with phulkari,” she said.Other artworks promoted here included homeware products carved in wood, metal engraving, terracotta, among others. Talking about initiatives to promote Indian artisans, Shantmanu (identified by first name), development commissioner (handicraft), ministry of textiles, said, “In addition to the big players in the home décor industry, we also have small-scale artisans, weavers, and handloom workers whose works were showcased here. For this fair, the ministry has sponsored these artisans, apart from giving them training, upscaling and providing toolkits to promote their art and increase their income”.With an aim to promote the traditional handloom from Shillong, 23-year-old Kimberley Khyriem, a fashion designer from Meghalaya, showcased her collection of home linen, furnishings, beddings, and apparel made of Erisilk.“Erisilk is also known as ‘ahimsa silk’, as it is produced without harming insects. Instead of boiling the insects, we wait for the caterpillars to leave their shells to gather silk. This is a traditional form of producing silk used by hand weavers of northeast states of India, especially Meghalaya,” said Khyriem, who is a graduate of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), New Delhi.Khyriem is an incubatee of NIFT Foundation for Design Innovation (NFDI), a company set up by NIFT under the ministry of textiles wherein the government promotes startups in the industry.“My brand promotes sustainable form of production of fabric, as we use natural organic dyes like turmeric, lac, coffee, tea, which are locally sourced from Khweng village in Shillong. I aim to take this traditional method to the international market of home décor and furnishing through the HGH expo here,” said Khyriem.More such innovations were part of a stall dedicated to NIFT-NFDI pavilion. “NFDI promotes and supports incubatees, most of whom are final year students as well as alumni of NIFT who want to set up their own enterprise and startups. For such young innovators, the HGH expo is a great opportunity,” said Shantmanu, who is also the director-general of NIFT.According to experts, home décor industry has seen a boom since the Covid-19 outbreak.“We have observed that during the last two years of Covid-enforced lockdowns and work -from-home lifestyle, Indian consumer sentiments have turned more positive towards their homes. They are spending on all categories of home products and this trend will continue. According to the retailers in bed & bath, furnishing fabrics, wallpaper, kitchenware, furniture and home décor, the period from July to November this year have recorded 30-40% increase in retail sales compared to last year. This boom in the home retail segment is expected to be long-lasting,” said Arun Roongta, managing director, HGH India.Roongta added that Noida and Greater Noida--being a hub of new real estate investments--is a major upcoming market for interior décor. “The young generation moving to their dream homes in Gautam Budh Nagar is a major target for the home décor industry. They like to experiment in home decor with new innovations and at the same time explore traditional art forms. For such a target audience, traders have offered a varied range of products at the HGH Expo,” he added.
04-12-2021||Noida||Light rain helps improve air in Noida, Greater Noida||The light rain on Thursday helped settle the pollutants in the air in Greater Noida, with a result that the air quality improved, enough to move from the ”very poor” to the “poor” category of the air quality index (AQI) scale on Friday. There was significant improvement in the air quality of Noida too, which had a “severe” AQI a day earlier. Experts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the upcoming western disturbance, on December 5 and 6, will have a positive impact on the pollution in the region. According to the 4pm air quality index (AQI) bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board, Ghaziabad continued to experience ‘very poor’ air on Friday with an AQI of 342, five points below than AQI of 347 on Thursday. Noida recorded an AQI of 312 under the ‘very poor’ category--a sharp contrast from AQI 408 recorded a day earlier. Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 262 on Friday, under the ‘poor’ category, a considerable drop from AQI 356 recorded on Thursday. “The lowering of pollution levels is the result of light rain that the region received on Thursday. The impact of the drizzle reflected in the AQI levels recorded on Friday. The wind has almost remained calm on Friday but will pick up and range between 10kmph to 20kmph on December 5 and 6. This will further help in dispersal of pollutants,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “The drizzle on Thursday contributed around 1mm rain. The upcoming western disturbance on December 5/6 will bring upto 5mm rain. This will have a positive impact over the prevailing weather conditions,” he added. Ever since Diwali, which was observed on November 4 this year, the AQI levels have been oscillating between “severe,” “very poor” and “poor” categories in the three cities. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. “In Ghaziabad, the pollution levels did not show any improvement as there was hardly any drizzle here on Thursday, compared to Delhi and Noida. So, the air quality index continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category. A positive impact on the current weather conditions is expected when it rains during the western disturbance predicted on December 5 and 6. We are continuing with our measures against local sources of pollution,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, Ghaziabad. A forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said on Friday that air quality improved from Thursday due to isolated light rain at a few places. “For the next two days, winds are likely to be calm reducing ventilation leading to degradation of air quality but within the same category. From December 5 onwards, winds are expected to increase dispersing pollutants but AQI likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category. Partly cloudy sky and low mixing layer height are preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” said the Safar forecast. Another forecast by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said winds are likely to be relatively stronger from December 5 onwards--- favourable for dispersion of pollutants--with the possibility of rain on December 6. 
04-12-2021||Delhi||First civic hospital for birds and animals in Delhi to come up in Vasant Kunj||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) decided to set up the first municipal hospital for animals and birds hospital in Vasant Kunj, officials said Friday.Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti, while delivering his annual budget for 2022-23 said that Delhi Development Authority allocated 483 square metres of land in Vasant Kunj on which the veterinary department will set up the hospital.Currently, the three municipal corporations of Delhi do not operate any animal or bird hospitals, but the Delhi government’s animal husbandry department does operate dispensaries for animals.Dr Ravindra Sharma, director of veterinary services, SDMC, said that the project is in the nascent stage and a three-storey building complex will be set up in Vasant Kunj, where the hospital will be developed in public-private partnership (PPP) mode. “The project will be carried out in PPP mode, just like the pet crematorium that is being set up in Dwarka sector 29. The ground floor of this facility will be reserved for the treatment of birds with an equipped laboratory for blood sampling and analysis, surgery stations, and advanced diagnostic tools,” he added.Another municipal official said that DDA allotted the plot in Vasant Kunj to the civic body last year and the department has sought a no-objection certificate from the land-owning agency for developing the hospital.“There are some charitable hospitals for birds like Charity Birds Hospital near Lal Jain temple in Chandni Chowk and a few private pet hospitals in south Delhi which offer treatment at high rates. The dispensaries run by the animal husbandry and dairying departments mostly cater to cattle or horses. We hope to provide subsidised healthcare for pets in the Vasant Kunj facility,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Municipal officials said that while the three corporations currently don’t have any such facilities, the erstwhile unified MCD used to operate 23 dispensaries and animal hospitals till 1992.“The units were operating in municipal buildings with our staff while the doctors deputed in these units were from the Delhi government. A policy decision was taken to transfer all these units in 1992 to the Delhi government and we haven’t had any animal hospitals since 1992,” the official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/first-civic-hospital-for-birds-and-animals-in-delhi-to-come-up-in-vasant-kunj-101638556673514.html

The move came after a person tweeted a photo of the gathering in the park and tagged Noida police. Atul Pandey tweeted a photo on Friday afternoon with the caption, “Shall we take this as open entitlement to practice religion in public parks? This was at Block B in Hosiery Complex, Noida.” Sujeet Upadhyaya, station house officer (SHO) of Phase 2 police station, said a police team soon reached the spot on getting information about the incident. “Primary investigation indicates that workers of a factory had gathered at a local mosque to offer Friday prayers. However, since the mosque was full, a group of men visited the park in the neighbourhood to offer prayers,” he said. Upadhyaya said people have been advised not to offer prayers in the park from next week. “We have also served a notice to the Imam/maulvi Siraj Ahmad,” he said. Talking to HT, Ahmad said he works at a factory in Phase 2. “The factory workers have been offering prayers in the park for five years but due to lockdown, this practice was discontinued two years ago. The workers again gathered on Friday to offer prayers. We were not aware that offering prayers at the park is banned. We will not organise such congregation in the park from next week,” he said. In December 2018, Noida police had issued an order banning any religious activity in the parks in the city. The police had also asked the companies/factories to ensure their employees do not use a park for any religious activity, including offering namaz on Fridays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-issues-notice-to-imam-for-organizing-friday-prayers-in-park-101638556554104.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||17 flying squads will monitor pollution curbs: Centre in SC||The Union government on Friday responded to the 24-hour deadline set by the Supreme Court on Thursday for creating an “urgent” mechanism to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, and constituted an enforcement task force and 17 flying squads to implement pollution control measures through surprise checks, inspection and closure of polluting units, besides announcing criminal prosecution and imposition of fines on violators. On Thursday, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, observed that the top court could set up a task force itself since “nothing is really happening to control pollution” and “all authorities have failed”.“We expect a serious, serious action or we will pass orders. We give you 24 hours to come out with a plan of action,” the bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, told solicitor general Tushar Mehta.Hours later, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas, held an emergency meeting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s deadline. The decisions taken in the meeting were presented before the bench on Friday in the form of an affidavit. Reading out from the affidavit, S-G Mehta informed the court that a five-member enforcement task force, led by CAQM chairperson MM Kutty, has been set up under the statutory powers of the commission. Flying squads are led by the officers of the Central Pollution Control Board.Mehta added that 17 flying squads have been constituted so far to make surprise visits, periodical incognito checking and inspections. “The number of flying squads will be increased to 40 within 24 hours. These squads will report to the enforcement task force everyday at 6pm in daily meetings. Based on their reports, the task force shall pass orders of preventive, corrective and punitive actions such as financial penalty and criminal prosecution as prescribed by the law.” He further said that any dereliction in duty by any of the members of the flying squad or the implementing agency will also attract disciplinary proceedings. Another important decision, Mehta said, pertained to cutting down industrial pollution by restricting the operation of all units not running on PNG or other cleaner fuels up to eight hours a day during the week and closure on weekends. “Operation of thermal power plants within 300 kilometres radius of Delhi shall continue to be regulated in terms of Commission’s order on November 30 whereby, only 5 out of 11 thermal power plants, have been permitted to schedule their operations and rest have been directed to remain inoperative till at least December 15.” At this point, the bench asked the S-G to consider moving to alternate power sources once thermal power plants are switched off. “We are not issuing any direction or anything today. You give it a thought....In the long term, you have to think of phasing them (thermal power plants) out completely,” the bench told Mehta.The national capital has been in the grip of hazardous pollution for over a month now, compelling the Supreme Court to regularly monitor the issue. This was the worst November for Delhi in terms of the average air quality index (AQI). While pollution till mid-November was driven significantly by smoke from farm fires in upwind states, the poor air quality since, and especially in the past week has been caused by local emissions and meteorological factors. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, complained that the latest affidavit is just “eyewash” and the authorities should be questioned why the solar power plants have not come up in the national capital if they were really serious about the issue. “We mentioned that to the S-G just now... This is not an adversarial litigation. Something has been done. Whatever you asked for yesterday, they have started that too. Mr Singh, we are not closing the proceedings. We are going to monitor it...we are nudging the government,” responded the bench.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, expressed his concerns about the directive issued by CAQM to restrict the number of hours an industrial unit could work if it is not running on PNG or other clean fuels. He said that the condition is too stringent for the sugarcane industry and would create huge losses to them since this is the sugarcane crushing season. Kumar requested the bench to suspend the operation of this order for at least two weeks to enable him come back with specific details on location and number of the industrial units coming under the ambit of CAQM order.The bench, however, asked Kumar to approach the Commission with his grievances. “All NCR states are members of the Commission. You go to them with your grievances if you want an exemption or suspension of this order.”. As Kumar said that UP is a downwind state and the air quality is affected due to wind from Pakistan, the bench replied in a lighter vein: “Do you want us to ban industries in Pakistan?” The court then passed a brief order, recording its satisfaction over the steps taken by the Centre and CAQM. “For the time being, in view of the measures taken by the government of India and the notification issued by CAQM dated December 2, we direct the governments of India and Delhi to implement the measures therein,” stated the court order, fixing the next hearing on December 10. The affidavit submitted in the court further said that CAQM has ordered that all schools and colleges in NCR shall remain closed till further orders, allowing only on-line mode of education except for the purpose of conducting examinations and laboratory practicals.“Entry of trucks in Delhi shall not permitted, except for CNG and electric trucks and trucks carrying essential commodities,” it added.Entry of vehicles from other states to the national capital will also be regulated more strictly now. At 124 entry points to Delhi, the concerned state government will ensure deployment of teams from the road transport department along with police personnel at every border entry point for 24 hours, in rotation, directed the commission. These teams shall be responsible to stop entry of trucks as well as check other vehicles. On Thursday, the apex court rued lack of effective mechanism for implementing the pollution control measures. It also questioned the efficacy of CAQM, asking whether the Commission has any power to enforce its directives or if its remit is confined to only issuing directions. 
04-12-2021||Noida||Depts get directions to improve cleanliness as Noida sets sight on Swachh survey||CEO of the Noida authority Ritu Maheshwari has issued directions to the engineering department to repair all broken footpaths and roads and asked the health department to clean every nook and corner in the city so that Noida sports a new look before the Swachh survey, which will be undertaken next year and in which the authority aims to better its rank. The move comes after the ministry of housing and urban affairs adjudged Noida as the fourth cleanest city in the country with a population ranging from 100,00 to a million and 11th cleanest city in terms of overall cleanliness. Indore secured the first position across the country in the overall category. Officials said given the world class infrastructure Noida has, the authority believes that the city can easily secure the first position in the 2022 Swachh survey, the process of which is likely to begin from January next year. Officials discussed all details at a workshop in Balak Inter College in Sector 91 and issued instructions to concerned departments. “There should not be any encroachment on public land, especially within 100 metres of public toilets; toilets should be clean, civic infrastructure should be repaired and complaints on waste should be dealt with promptly,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority. On April 17,1976, the UP government established Noida--a well-planned industrial town--adjoining Delhi. Currently, it has around 12,000 industrial units and 165 residential sectors. Around 13% of the area in the city has been allocated for industrial purposes, 43% for residential purposes and the remaining land for other usages. Officials feel despite being a well planned city, it has failed to secure the top spot in the Swachh survey of the country. The chief general manager directed the staff to make sure all vending zones should be in order without chaos, only treated waste should be used for irrigation purposes and pubic spaces should be cleaned regularly. “We have appealed to all staff members to work in tandem with citizens to make the city clean and help it achieve the top sot in the survey. If the officials work together with citizens, Noida can easily secure the top spot,” said Tyagi.

This new barrage will also help to hold more water during the non-rainy season, leading to more water percolation, which will further help to increase the groundwater levels of the city,” said Jain.The minister claimed that the new barrage will further stabilise river water elevation needed to feed DJB’s water treatment plants.A senior DJB official stated that the Wazirabad barrage across Yamuna was built in 1959. “A barrage is a diversion dam which consists of a number of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing through it. This allows us to regulate and stabilise river water elevation upstream for use in irrigation and other systems. Yamuna has a total of six barrages,” official added.The DJB official explained that during monsoon, up to four-five lakh million gallons of water flows through the barrage each day. “The reconstruction of the new barrage gates will help increase the strength of the gates so that they can withstand the high-water pressure. This will help in regulating more water during the non-rainy season, and increase its percolation. Every year, the supply of drinking water is interrupted due to excess ammonia in the water. In such a case, the water held in these newly constructed barrages can be used to dilute the contaminants,” the official said.Jain said that through the overhaul, the government also aims to reduce silt deposition in the Wazirabad pond so that the holding capacity of drinking water can also be increased.There are six major barrages constructed across the Yamuna in four states -- Dakpathar in Uttarakhand; Hathnikund in Haryana; Wazirabad, Indraprastha and Okhla in Delhi; and Gokul bararge in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura. Yamuna water is severely polluted beyond the Wazirabad barrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wazirabad-barrage-to-be-upgraded-soon-says-satyendar-jain-101638556253855.html
04-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to install 140,000 more CCTV cameras across the city: Kejriwal||The Delhi government has decided to initiate the second phase of its CCTV project under which 140,000 new cameras will be installed across the Capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday.The government has already installed over 275,000 cameras, covering streets, public spaces, residential colonies and schools across the city, under the first phase of the project.The CM said that once the project is complete, Delhi will have 415,000 CCTV cameras.“We are far ahead of London, New York, Singapore and Paris, to the point that there is no comparison. Within India, Chennai comes at number two and Delhi has more than three times number of cameras in Chennai...,” said the CM. In August, a Forbes India report said Delhi is the most surveilled city of the world, with 1,826.6 CCTV cameras per square mile, followed by London with 1,138 cameras per square mile.Kejriwal said the CCTV project has helped improve security, especially for women. “These cameras will have 4-megapixel resolution and night vision. They will help in increasing security situation in the city and we hope people will feel more secure,” Kejriwal said.He added that the government faced resistance from the central government and the Lieutenant Governor before the project could be started. “We had to even carry out a dharna with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia at the Lieutenant Governor’s house. We remained resolute and steadfast,” he added.Kejriwal said the cameras will be installed by Bharat Electronics Limited, a public sector undertaking. “If a unit is not functional, an alarm is raised in the command centre and SMS is sent to the authorised people. If a camera is broken, non-operational or even if someone restricts its visibility, an immediate alarm is raised at the command centre. The footage from the cameras will be saved for 30 days and the live feed will be accessible only by three-four authorised people anywhere in the world,” he added.The CCTV project is part of the government’s larger action plan to enhance women safety in the Capital, which was one of the main aspects of the manifesto of the Aam Aadmi Party in the 2020 assembly elections.The project is being undertaken by the public works department (PWD) which is operating a central command and control centre on the 11th floor of its headquarters at ITO where a specialised team will monitor the live feed.Retired IPS officer Ashok Chand, who was deputy commissioner of police of the special cell for six years, said the CCTV cameras will help investigations.“The addition of cameras will definitely help solve cases, but it must be ensured that the picture quality is good and that they are positioned at the right place. In many cases, cameras are found to not be operational after a crime, so enough emphasis should be given to find out how many cameras are operational,” Chand added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-install-140-000-more-cctv-cameras-across-the-city-kejriwal-101638554814497.html
