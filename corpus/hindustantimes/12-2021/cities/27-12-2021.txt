Addressing media persons, Shaista said that the local MLA and BJP leaders misled the chief minister to believe that freed land belonged to Atiq Ahmad and used the issue for political stunt. “The land is disputed and the case is pending with the court. The local BJP leaders have misled the chief minister and made him perform bhumi pujan on a disputed piece of land,” she claimed. However, Shaista admitted that the property was earlier used by her husband for keeping banner posters and lodging party workers during elections. “If local MLA really wants to construct houses for poor then Atiq Ahmad will give his ancestral land for this purpose. Another property near my husband’s office was demolished by administration where dozens of poor families used to live free of cost. Houses will be constructed for the poor after Atiq Ahmad is released from jail. The local MLA (read UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh) has done nothing for development in his constituency and now he is doing political stunts for gaining popularity,” she claimed. “Now, we will transfer the land in our name from its owners and will even approach Supreme Court for getting its possession,” Shaista said. Meanwhile, BJP Prayagraj City unit president Ganesh Kesarwani dismissed the claims of Shaista and said that district administration and the police, besides the people were well aware of the ownership of the land in question. “These claims are just eyewash aimed at deriving political gains,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/freed-land-on-which-cm-performed-bhumi-pujan-is-not-ours-claims-atiq-s-wife-101640629732863.html
27-12-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow: Honeytrap gang busted woman kingpin held||Lucknow: A team from PGI police station on Sunday busted a gang involved in honey trapping people and also arrested its kingpin, a woman, identified as Saroj alias Komal, a resident of Bangla Bazar Ashiana. According to the police, the woman with her gang members duped over ₹30 lakh from a dozen men in the district. The digital evidence is being extracted from the mobile phones recovered from the arrested woman to track other members of the gang. “The gang has a couple of women members who lure men by sending them tempting messages either over phone or on popular social media platforms. Once a victim starts conversing with them, they take his bank details fraudulently or call them to meet at a secluded place where they rob the victim. In some cases, the women take objectionable pictures with the victim and use these to extort money from them,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Raghvendra Kumar. He said that the honey trap gang was active in the state capital for the last two years. Lucknow police had nabbed over a dozen people including women, this year for extorting lakhs of rupees from several people using the modes operandi, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-honeytrap-gang-busted-woman-kingpin-held-101640629312232.html

With this, the number of Covid cases at the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya has gone up to 82, which include 79 students and three teachers. According to Dr Prakash Lalge, health officer, Parner taluka, a majority of the students who tested positive are asymptomatic, while others have mild symptoms. “We have received reports of some students in the past few hours and 31 of them are positive for Covid. There are around 30-40 reports awaited. Most students are asymptomatic and others with mild symptoms are being monitored constantly,” said Lalge. The administration has already sent samples of all those tested positive for genome sequencing to ascertain if the virus they have contracted is new Covid variant known as Omicron. Earlier last week, 19 students from the residential school in Parner tehsil tested positive for the infection. Following the spread of infection, administration has declared the school premises as containment zone and has sealed the area prohibiting entry of students and staff. The school has 400 students across Classes 5 to 12. Those tested positive are students of Classes 5 to 12. On Sunday, district collector Bhosale visited the school and deputed a medical team to monitor the health of students. “As a precautionary measure, we have deployed a medical team comprising a doctor and two nurses to monitor other students in the campus (in case they develop any symptoms). Since we have declared school premises as containment zone, no outsiders are allowed there,” Bhosale said after his visit. According to the district collector, some parents wanted to take their wards home and they have been told a decision on this would be taken after students complete the quarantine period. The school, part of the Navodaya Vidyalaya network which comes under the Union education ministry, is located at Takali Dhokeshwar village in Ahmednagar district. According to officials, the first case was detected positive after a student reported mild symptoms of cough and cold. As the administration sent samples of the others, all of them tested positive for Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/31-more-students-at-navodaya-vidyalaya-test-positive-covid-tally-at-82-101640628351275.html
27-12-2021||Pune||200 vaccination centres ready for 15-18-year age group, says PMC||PUNE As teenagers in the 15-18-year age group have been given the go ahead to receive the Covid vaccine from January 3 onwards, local authorities have started to assess the necessary requirements. Officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said that there are 200 vaccination centres in the city and depending upon the guidelines, if there is a need, then vaccinations can be arranged in schools and colleges. According to the public health department, there are 0.533 million beneficiaries in Pune district, including urban and rural, between the age group of 15-18. Besides this, 0.198 million health workers will be beneficiaries of a ‘precautionary dose’ in the district. “Once the detailed guidelines come from the state and centre we will get more clarity. In Pune we have 200 vaccination centres. If need be we can arrange vaccinations in schools and colleges as well, but it all depends upon the guidelines. The procedure of vaccinating healthcare workers for precautionary doses is set and it will begin from January 10,” said Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer, PMC. As per information given by Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director (health) Pune region, “This projection is based on the 2011 census. Adolescents in this age group are not too young not to be able to go to vaccination centres. There are 0.198 million health workers eligible for the precautionary dose and 1.327 million beneficiaries above 60 years of age.” Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, has been granted approval for restricted use in an emergency situation for the age group between 12 and 18 years. Covaxin is the second vaccine after Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D that was approved for use in children aged 12 years and above. “The collective figure of the eligible beneficiaries in the new vaccination policy in the district is around 1.5 million which can be easily covered in a month. The Omicron scare may prompt people to get vaccinated. Also, parents were more anxious for children’s vaccination. So I am sure a good response will be received for this drive,” said Dr Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/200-vaccination-centres-ready-for-15-18-year-age-group-says-pmc-101640628235853.html
27-12-2021||Mumbai||Sena opens second front in war with Rane family||MUMBAI Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said on Monday that Sindhudurg police is investigating the role of Nitesh Rane, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and son of union minister Narayan Rane, in connection with an alleged attack on Shiv Sena functionary Santosh Parab. Desai, also a Shiv Sena legislator from Patan in Satara, said Rane is incommunicado since Sunday night, and must come forward if he is not involved in the alleged attack on Parab. The BJP legislator, meanwhile, said that the ruling coalition is “framing” him in the case. The latest incident could become a new chapter in the Rane-Shiv Sena tussle, after the Union minister’s arrest in August this year. Narayan Rane termed it as “vengeance,” and said his family is exploring legal options. On December 18, Parab, a Sena functionary from Kankavli in Sindhudurg was allegedly assaulted in the backdrop of a district bank’s election scheduled for December 30. Parab is a close associate of Sindhudurg District Cooperative Bank chairperson Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh Rane in the 2019 assembly polls for the Kankavali seat. Desai said that though two people are arrested in the case, Parab has named Nitesh Rane as the person behind the attack. Desai added that the attackers have also named Rane, which is a “serious matter.” Rane appeared once before the Sindhudurg police in connection with the investigation. He was summoned twice later, but he has not appeared before the local police. “If he (Rane) is not involved then he must go to the police and say so. If he is not contactable, it raises suspicion. Senior police officials are investigating this matter,” Desai said. He added, “While some accused have been arrested, the victim, Santosh Parab, told the police that the attack’s mastermind was Nitesh Rane. As per police procedure, if a victim suspects somebody, the police will investigate. Nitesh Rane was called once, but officers were not satisfied. The local police will act as per what comes out of the investigation, including arresting him, if required.” Narayan Rane, Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises, told reporters in Nagpur that the claim that his son is incommunicado is false. He said the ruling coalition in the state government is “acting with vengeance” against his son. “The ruling coalition is acting out of fear of defeat in the district bank election. This is nothing but an act of vengeance... He (Nitesh) has not gone underground; there is no need to do so. He is an MLA and is in Sindhudurg district.” He said his family is exploring legal options. Nitesh, meanwhile, posted a video on his Twitter handle, stating that he is being framed in the case. He said, “The atmosphere among the voters is of enthusiasm and trust in us. Looking at this, the Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders are trying to frame me in the Santosh Parab attack case. The way the police are investigating, it would seem attempts are being made to frame me. I wish to tell the people of this state that I am being targetted in the backdrop of the district bank election.” In Sindhudurg, Vaibhav Naik, Shiv Sena legislator from Kudal, along with local party functionaries met the Sindhudurg superintendent of police demanding action against whoever is involved in the case. “The accused have been arrested, but those behind them must also be nabbed. The police shouldn’t come under the pressure from any Union minister. We demand that the persons involved in the attack must be booked so that the voting [for the district bank election] takes place peacefully,” Naik said. Desai said, “It is a serious matter that attackers named a legislator at a time when the legislative session is underway. Strict action will be taken against whoever is involved in this matter; whoever has any direct or indirect role in this attack. No matter who the person is, everybody is equal before the law,” he said. On Monday, Shiv Sena stepped up its attack on Nitesh Rane in the legislative assembly over his alleged mocking of environment minister and Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray last week. Sena MLAs Suhas Kande, Bhaskar Jadhav and Sunil Prabhu demanded that Rane be suspended over his alleged “inappropriate behaviour towards the state environment minister,” and demanded an apology from him. Later, Prabhu also raised the Santosh Parab assault issue in the assembly. Without naming Rane, he asked for those responsible for the attack to be arrested.

27-12-2021||Mumbai||Governor refuses nod for Speaker’s election||MUMBAI: The ongoing battle between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari intensified on Monday after the latter withheld his assent for the legislative assembly speaker’s election scheduled for Tuesday. To prevent cross-voting from its ranks, the MVA government had, last week, amended the rules for the Speaker’s election by allowing open voting instead of a secret ballot. MVA leaders felt this could eliminate chances of sabotage as legislators that vote against the party whip stand to face disciplinary action and even get disqualified. Flouting the ‘whip’ issued by the party can lead to the party approaching the Speaker for the disqualification of the member from the house under the Maharashtra legislative assembly rules, which in turn have their basis in the Representation of People Act, 1951, and the tenth schedule of the Constitution (also called as the anti-defection law). On Sunday, ministers Balasaheb Thorat (Congress), Chhagan Bhujbal (Nationalist Congress Party) and Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena) met Koshyari and requested him to approve the state cabinet’s recommendation for the election and confirm the date. However, the Governor refused to sign his approval on Monday, stating he will first examine the legality of the amendment. The leading opposition party, BJP, had objected to these amendments. A senior minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the governor had replied stating that the decision to amend the system of voting was “unconstitutional” but that he would examine it legally. “This is contradictory. How can he call it unconstitutional and also say he will get the provision examined legally,” the minister said. The government had written back to Koshyari stating that the decision was legally sound and pointedly asked the governor whether he wanted them to hold the elections or not. “The legislature has its own authority and no one can encroach on them,” the minister said. “This is an unprecedented stand-off,” a senior Congress legislator said. “Whether the government wants to hold the elections depends on whether Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is willing to brazen it out, though our decision to go ahead with the polls may be challenged in court.” The MVA had planned to announce the election schedule on Monday with actual voting on Tuesday, the last day of the ongoing winter session. However, on Monday morning, Koshyari replied he will examine the constitutional validity of the amendment. The state government in turn, sought legal opinion, and wrote back to Raj Bhavan stating that these changes were legally valid. The MVA said it is determined to conduct the election on Tuesday. Former Speaker and current state Congress chief Nana Patole said, “The question is, is the governor pushing the BJP agenda.” He said he felt that the speaker would be elected through voice vote on Tuesday. He added that the changes in the type of voting reflected those in Parliament and other legislatures. Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut too derided Koshyari, and added that he was yet to decide on the state government’s recommendation on the nomination of 12 legislators to the legislative council. Former minister and senior BJP legislator Chandrakant Patil said the governor had certain privileges. “Now, you (the government) have changed the rules and have asked him to confirm the dates. But he has given the dates twice under the Constitution, but you did not conduct the elections. Actually, not conducting elections on the date given by the governor is an insult to the both the governor as well as the Constitution. President’s Rule can be imposed on this ground,” he charged. Constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said the decisions taken by the state cabinet and the chief minister were binding on the governor. “…it is clear that as per Article 163 of the Constitution, the governor cannot go against the decision of the chief minister and state cabinet,” he said. “The governor is supposed to take the decision as soon as possible.” The election has been necessitated following Patole’s resignation from the post and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, Congress legislators Amin Patel, Sangram Thopte and Suresh Warpudkar are said to be the frontrunners. There are chances that a Congress minister may be asked to quit and be fielded for this position, with Patole replacing him in the cabinet. Until late Monday evening, there was no official comment from Raj Bhavan, and the ongoing winter session ends Tuesday. If the election is not held on Tuesday, the ruling coalition will have to wait till the next session of the legislature which is expected to be held in March next year or convene a special session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/governor-refuses-nod-for-speaker-s-election-101640628052604.html
27-12-2021||Pune||Pune’s CBSE schools to start offline classes post winter break||PUNE Schools under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) may reopen for primary, as well as higher classes, post the winter vacations. Schools will be focusing on vaccination for children between the age group of 15 to 18 years while they continue hybrid mode of teaching. After the incident at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Ahmednagar district where 19 students tested positive for Covid-19, there are parents who are skeptical about reopening offline schools for students. Ahead of the increasing cases of Omicron, many parents have expressed that offline schools should not start. As of Monday, at least 42 patients have tested positive in Pune district for Omicron and 141 in Maharashtra. However, CBSE schools from the city want to reopen after winter break is over. The schools will be reopening from January 3. Jayshree Venkatraman, principal, SNBP School, Rahatani, said that parents and students are excited about reopening of school after winter break. “Yes there is a scare of the Omicron variant, but parents have repeatedly expressed that they want to send their ward to offline classes. We are taking all types of precautions to ensure that students are in a safer environment here at schools. Transport for many parents is an issue. But we are arranging that as well on the request of the parent,” said Venkatraman. She added that for primary classes as well, parents are willing to send the student to school. “The classroom capacity is anyways at 50 per cent. And so the online and offline mode of education will continue for every child. As the government has declared vaccination for 15 to 18-year age group, we will focus on that drive as well when it starts. Students precautions are of our topmost priority,” said Venkatraman. Arti Sharma, principal, Army Public school, Khadki, said that the offline classes for 8 to 12 will continue. “For the primary sections we are getting requests from parents to start offline school. But we are waiting for the final government decision about reopening in the wake of the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, we will continue the hybrid mode of education for the students,” said Sharma. She further added that vaccination of students will be given a preference. “As soon as the vaccination for children begins, we will take full effort to ensure that each student who falls in the age group is vaccinated for their safety and the safety of others. Our staff, teaching and non-teaching staff is already vaccinated and the school follows covid appropriate behaviour to ensure safety of students,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-cbse-schools-to-start-offline-classes-post-winter-break-101640627993785.html

27-12-2021||Pune||Parents reluctant to send children to school amidst rising Covid cases in Pune||PUNE In the light of the fresh threat of the Omicron variant and Covid cases in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra, parents do not want to send their wards to school yet. Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad has already clarified that the local administration will take a call to shut down schools if Covid cases continue to increase. Preeti Joshi, a resident of Kothrud and mother of a Class 2 student voiced her concern saying it may be difficult for students at her daughter’s age to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.“My daughter is in the second standard and she is too young to understand and follow the Covid protocols in school,” Joshi said. Another parent said though online learning may not be effective, the developing situation may warrant students to avoid going to school. “Online mode of learning is not adequate for school children, but with the increase in Covid cases, we certainly cannot let them go to school again, can we?” said Anuradha Kulkarni, another parent whose son studies in Bal Shikshan Mandir, Kothrud.On Sunday, Covid cases in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, a residential school in Ahmednagar, jumped from 19 to 51. The local administration in Pune had earlier delayed re-opening of schools for classes 1 to 7 till December 15. However, the schools in Pune have been open for Classes 8 to 12 since October 4. Some parents, however, are skeptical of the effectiveness of the online mode of learning. “Student’s mental and physical health deteriorates due to online classes. Physical classes and the school’s atmosphere help the children learn,” said Krutika Hosur, who has a son studying at a school in Kothrud. Some parents said with vaccination of those under age of 18-years, students can attend schools. Although children below the age of 18 are yet to be vaccinated, the Prime Minister has announced those between the age group of 15 to 18 will be eligible for vaccination from January 3, next year. However, the threat of the virus will continue to linger for the younger children. “My eight-year-old daughter is not vaccinated and there is no news on their vaccination either so it’s better if the schools remain closed for now,” said Joshi. In Maharashtra most schools that have reopened and are running in a hybrid model with three days of offline classes and two days of online classes in a week. Some parents have shown their support to this move but flouting of Covid norms amidst the Christmas and the upcoming New Year celebration may shut the schools yet again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-reluctant-to-send-children-to-school-amidst-rising-covid-cases-in-pune-101640627873789.html

The probe by Settlement Commissioner would be completed in one month, and whoever is responsible there will be punished,” the minister said.He further added, “Of the 884 maps, there was manipulation in 102 maps, where new constructions were regularised. We have filed a case at the Kherwadi police station. In Goregaon, there have been seven such instances; a police complaint has been filed in this case as well.

27-12-2021||Pune||Sharad Pawar asks for Chandrakant Patil’s comments on President’s Rule to be ignored||PUNE Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar, on Monday, said people of the state do not take note of statements made by BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil and that the MVA government has a clear mandate. Earlier in the day, Patil, an MLA, in Mumbai on the sidelines of winter session of Maharashtra legislative assembly, said that the way Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has “insulted” governor B S Koshyari over the issue of the Assembly Speaker’s election, it could invite imposition of President’ rule in the state. Pawar, reacting to Patil’s comments, said people of the state do not take note of such statements. Patil alleged the Shiv Sena-led MVA government has changed the rules for election of the new Speaker. The election of the Speaker, a post lying vacant since February this year, appears to have become the latest bone of contention between Raj Bhavan and the three-party coalition government. “The MVA government first changed the rules to elect the new Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Then it said it had sent two letters to the governor seeking his approval for election of the new Speaker. Even saying it, is an insult to the governor and the Constitution as well. It could lead to imposition of the President’s rule in the state,” said Patil. “Everybody is asking the crucial question of the election schedule for local governing bodies in the state. Exam papers are getting leaked, MSRTC employees’ strike is on (for two months now), there is no clear communication on reopening of schools. One can do a PhD over the chaotic functioning of this government,” he added.However, the NCP, a key ally in the MVA government, sought to make light of Patil’s comments. Speaking in Satara, Pawar said the Uddhav Thackeray-led government has a “clear cut” majority in the Assembly. “Today, the MVA government has a clear cut majority in the Assembly under (Chief Minister) Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership. Because of this, Thackeray and his cabinet colleagues have been successful in giving a stable government in the state.” Taking a swipe at Patil, the NCP leader said that because a stable government is in place since the last two years, some people are sulking and making such statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sharad-pawar-asks-for-chandrakant-patil-s-comments-on-president-s-rule-to-be-ignored-101640627691822.html
27-12-2021||Pune||Maharashtra Waqf Board to constitute special committee to revise rents||PUNE The Maharashtra Waqf Board will constitute a special committee to look into ways and means in increasing revenue generation from Waqf properties across the state. Maharashtra Waqf board chairman Wajahat Mirza said: “We have taken an important decision to form a committee to increase revenue generation from Waqf properties. It will look into prospects of increasing revenue through a fresh survey and evaluation of properties which are currently fetching rents as low as ₹200 per month. The Urban Development (UD) department officials, including revenue officials at the district collectorate levels, will be roped in to ensure that the process is made smooth for the Waqf board.” Mirza further added a policy will be formulated once the committee is instituted so that the amount generated can be used for the betterment of backward sections of the Muslim community.Waqf properties are generally leased out by the respective trusts at nominal rates. To change the said practice, the Central government brought in the Waqf properties’ lease rules in 2014 and later amended them in February 2020. However, the rules were never implemented in Maharashtra. The rule stipulates that the reserve price per square feet for lease of an immovable Waqf property shall — (a) for hospitals, educational institutions and social sectors, be not less than 1% per annum; (b) for commercial activities, be not less than 2.5% per annum; of the market value of the property. Earlier, Nawab Malik, minister of Minority Affairs and Waqf had said that rules had not been implemented in the state in the past six years, but the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will implement it vigorously. According to the Waqf Act, the incumbent trust will have to submit their annual audit report to the state waqf board through which the board can monitor that the money collected is being used for the intended purpose.MP Imtiaz Jaleel, a Waqf board member said, “The main purpose of Waqf endowment is to alleviate the poor financial condition of the marginalised Muslim. The properties which are getting low rent will be surveyed and the new rent will be levied as per the actual market rates as per the Waqf laws. Also, the process of reclaiming lands has also started and very strong police action is being taken against the land criminal.” According to Islam, Waqf is the property given in the name of God for religious and charitable purposes. Maharashtra accounts for 0.250 million acres of Waqf land spread around 23,566 registered properties, with the maximum Waqf land parcels in Aurangabad region — 57,802 acres, followed by 9,310 acres in Pune, 9,260 acres in Nagpur, 8,350 acres in Nashik, 5,941 acres in the Konkan and 2,755 acres in Amravati. According to Waqf activists and lawyers, the Pune properties are well over ₹20,000 crore as per the current real estate market rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-waqf-board-to-constitute-special-committee-to-revise-rents-101640627518298.html
27-12-2021||Lucknow||BJP believes in keeping its promises: UP CM Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the state government was working on a comprehensive plan to set up food processing industries in Pratapgarh district as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) believed in fulfilling its promises. He said the newly set up medical college in Pratapgarh was one such example. Yogi said rival parties in the fray against the BJP had not been not able to rise above “Vanshvad” (dynastic politics) and Parivarvad (familialism). “Ek party hai behen-bhai ki, ek hai chacha-bhatije ki aur ek hai bua-bhatije ki. Jab chacha-bhatija apne mey hi ladh rahen hain to janta ki kaun sochega.” (when uncle and nephew are fighting amongst themselves, who will care for the masses),” he said. The CM also asked the opposition parties as to why no one ever thought of development of Pratapgarh. The voters of the district should ask as to why Congress, which ruled for several years or the Samajwadi Party which had their government in state four times and were even supporting central government or even the Bahujan Samaj Party as to who had stopped them from ensuring development in Pratapgarh, he said.“BJP believes in worshipping ‘full moon’ and as such BJP does not believe in incomplete works. We do not take 20 years to complete any project like the previous regimes. BJP undertakes a project and completes the same in record time,” said the CM. Comparing the earlier government with the BJP, Yogi said, “The earlier government believed in politics of vote for which they did not hesitate to fire on ‘Hindus’ in Ayodhya whereas BJP believes in honouring the Ram Bhakt and for them a grand temple is being constructed”. He also said since 2017 the state had not witnessed any riots as those indulged in breaching peace of the state knew if they indulged in any such act, they will have to pay the compensation for generations together. Yogi said today the overall impression of the state and the people living here had changed across the country. “Earlier, because of the negative impression of the state, people from UP were not given rented accommodations in other cities but now things have changed and this is because of the ‘double engine’ government which is taking UP to new heights of development,” said the CM. During his visit, the CM launched 378 development projects worth ₹553.81 crore for Pratapgarh district.Speaking on the occasion, Union heavy industries minister Mahendra Nath Pandey also expressed hope of change in Rampur Khas assembly constituency of the district. He said Yogi Adityanath broke the myth that CMs visiting Noida lost their chair by visiting Noida as he was the CM even today. “In the same way, he is breaking a record by coming to Rampur Khas as in the past 32 years, no CM ever came here. In such a situation, ‘Kamal’ (lotus) will bloom in Rampur Khas in 2022,” Pandey added. Congress leader Pramod Tiwari’s daughter Aradhana Misra is the sitting MLA from the seat.He said people who played game of ‘tweets’ for two to three months were not seen standing anywhere during the pandemic. CM Yogi acted like a “frontline worker” during the corona crisis. With better law and order, he waved the flag in the country and by controlling the criminals, he maintained the continuity of development, Pandey said.Kaushambi MP Vinod Sonkar said the ongoing “Jan Vishwas Yatra”, which started from Ghazipur on December 19, reached Pratapgarh via Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Prayagraj. “Wherever the yatra is passing from, farmers, labourers and the common man are standing and giving blessings to the party,” said SonkarUP cabinet ministers Rajendra Pratap Singh “Moti Singh” and Mahendra Singh, UP ministers of State Suresh Pasi and Dharamvir Prajapati besides MPs Vinod Kumar Sonkar (Kaushambi) and Sangam Lal Gupta (Pratapgarh) along with MLAs Rajkumar Pal (Pratapgarh Sadar) and Abhay Kumar “Dheeraj Ojha” ((Raniganj) were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-believes-in-keeping-its-promises-up-cm-yogi-101640627391800.html
27-12-2021||Pune||Divider on ‘deadly’ Katraj-Navale bridge stretch removed to widen service road||PUNE As the ‘deadly stretch’ between the new Katraj tunnel and Navale Bridge road continues to worry commuters now some positive news is forthcoming in terms of infrastructural changes on the bypass. This year, a series of accidents happened on this 1.5 km stretch, after which the Pune traffic police department and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) did a joint survey and suggested various changes. One major change now is the removal of long road divider between the highway and service road, due to which vehicles now get a wide road to enter in, towards Ambegaon Budruk near Swaminarayan temple. While repair works of the service road near the Navale bridge chowk has also been completed. “After a series of accidents happened on this stretch, we had done a detailed survey of this specific road on the bypass highway along with the NHAI officials. We suggested various infrastructural changes and things to be done for the safety of commuters. Accordingly, a one-km long divider between the highway and service road has been removed and the entrace to the Ambegaon Budruk service road is widened. Earlier, vehicles speeding used to suddenly take a left turn for Ambegaon Budruk near Swaminarayan temple, and this would disturb vehicles coming from behind. So now as the service road entrance is widened it will not disturb the flow of other vehicles,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). The stretch between the Katraj new tunnel and Navale Bridge chowk has seen 56 fatal accidents since 2014, half of which were due to human error, the police department claims. On October 22, 2021, a tanker crashed into an SUV, and two persons died. A senior NHAI official, speaking anonymously said, “We are working on the infrastructural changes and development on this stretch and it is an ongoing process. Our motive is to reduce the number of accidents on this stretch, but at the same time people should also need to to follow traffic rules strictly while going through the highway.” As per the information given by the Pune police department, the four black spots identified are - Dari Pul bridge turn, Swami Narayan Temple chowk, Narhe selfie point and and Navale Bridge chowk itself. Recently, in the last couple of months seven accidents at different points on this stretch have happened, in which three people lost their lives and several other got injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/divider-on-deadly-katraj-navale-bridge-stretch-removed-to-widen-service-road-101640627152910.html

The presence of dairies within the city limits has been leading to frequent choking of sewers and resultant water-logging in the Royal City. In the first phase, of 257 dairies, 141 were to be shifted.In October, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had directed Patiala administration to halt the shifting, till all necessary facilities were made available at the new site. The Patiala municipal corporation has already spent nearly ₹15 crore for the development of site at Ablowal village, on the outskirts of Patiala city.Mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu, who recently joined Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok congress, said the government has intentionally stalled the project only to settle scores with him. “I have also written to chief secretary Anirudh Tiwari on the reasons behind halting the project. The project is hanging fire for 17 years; it progressed only after Captain Amarinder came to power,” he claimed.Sharma added the corporation had spent ₹15 crore on the project and it could not be wasted like this, with the government unwilling to communicate on the project. “Eighty-four dairy owners had applied for plots at project site, of which 61 owners had been provided allotment letters before it was halted by Punjab CM,” he said.After meeting dairy owners, Channi had issued verbal orders to former deputy commissioner Kumar Amit, asking him not to shift any dairy owner forcibly till all facilities, including proper road network, water supply connections, sewage treatment plant and other requirements are in place.The Patiala municipal corporation (MC) had set September 30 as the deadline to shift 141 dairy farmers operating within the city to a 21-acre site at Ablowal village on the outskirts. Presently, the site is without a biogas plant, sewage treatment plant and veterinary hospital, as proposed under the ₹13.5-crore project. The dairy owners also complain that they were offered only 150-square-yard plot, which would be not adequate to run their units.MC commissioner Vaneet Kumar said the corporation will start operations at project site only after receiving nod from the government. “The administration is holding meetings with dairy owners at its level. We are only awaiting the government’s green signal.”

According to the administration, as many as 650 posts are lying vacant. The PCB is also facing a shortage of over ₹600 crore GST funds which are pending to be released by the centre for the past four years. With no recruitment for new posts and old sanctioned posts, the situation does not seem to be improving in the new year too, claimed the administration.According to the administration, 650 posts are vacant in different departments of the cantonment board due to a freeze on recruitment. The vacancies exist in the garden, revenue, engineering department and all the departments of the board where there is a requirement of a large number of clerks, peons, teachers, safai karmachari, engineers, health inspectors and other support staff.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said “ We are facing challenges due to a freeze on recruitment and currently we are working with contractual staff to meet the needs of the citizens. We are constantly following it up with the government so that citizens get the best of civic amenities.”The Pune Cantonment is also struggling to maintain its 40 odd gardens as it has no money to spend on its maintenance. Earlier, it had 50 employees for the garden department which has now been reduced to four staffers only. CEO Amit Kumar had also stated that the financial crunch had affected the garden maintenance work of the administration.Development Projects estimated to be worth ₹200 crore have been hit due to non receipt of Goods and Service Tax (GST) funds from the state government for four years . Neither the state government nor the central government has taken up the cause of the PCB GST issue following which the financial position of the board is dwindling with each passing day. The cantonment board faced a situation in 2019 when its coffers had reserve funds to pay salary for only three months.The development projects including construction of the commercial complex at Dhobi ghat, construction of staff quarters, construction of multi-level parking facility, remodelling and Sewerage Improvement Project, replacement of water supply lines, developing parking lots and beautification of gardens and other major infrastructure works including construction of roads and drainage infrastructure have been stopped due to lack of funds.Then PCB president , Major Gen Navneet Kumar, GOC, Pune said that the PCB was going through the toughest financial crisis due to non-availaibility of the GST fund share. “If the situation persists, then it might lead to a crisis in governance due to a very tight financial position which is getting worse every day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/staff-fund-crunch-cast-shadow-on-pune-cantonment-board-functioning-101640626011059.html

Teams of the Ludhiana police and the National investigation Agency (NIA) raided a hotel in Khanna, Hotel Down Town, to find that the main accused Gagandeep Singh and his lover, a woman head constable, had spent four hours there on December 21. The woman is already in detention and is being questioned; she has not been formally arrested. The duo had even submitted their Aadhaar cards at the hotel. The CCTV footage of the hotel, currently in the possession of the police and the NIA team, shows that Gagandeep was carrying a bag, but there is no clarity yet on whether this could be the explosive or any of its parts. The entire probe is now focused on finding that how did Gagandeep commute from his house to the Ludhiana court complex. “The wife has maintained that he had a strained relationship with Gagandeep, due to his affair. We expect his lover to know the plan, as they had spent so much time together just two days before the blast. The woman cop is being questioned,” said an official privy to the investigation.Accused procured SIM on fake documents Police say Gagandeep had even procured a mobile SIM (subscription identification module) for his brother on fake documents. The phone has been confiscated and it is being probed if it was being used to make internet calls. Police suspect that the phone was case property, and was stolen from the storeroom of the police station, where he had worked as a ‘Munshi’.

Sukhbir, who had an interaction with trade and industry representatives, here at a function that the party’s Amritsar North candidate Anil Joshi had organised, said, “The previous SAD-led government had made Amritsar a tourist hub by developing the Heritage Walk, besides creating other tourist spots such as Apna Pind and the Partition Museum. Over the past five years, the holy city fell victim to the intra-party power games of the Congress. As a result, no major development project was taken up.” Outlining his plans, Sukhbir claimed, “We want to bring in requisite infrastructure to make a Convention Centre on the lines of Frankfurt.” He also announced that the SAD-BSP alliance was committed to investing ₹1,500 crore to give the entire walled city a heritage look. “This will increase commerce and tourism exponentially,” he added.On resolving issues that the industry faced, he said, “We had created the Invest Punjab department and gave it powers of 35 departments to ensure time-bound clearances within 30 days. The Congress disbanded that. The SAD-BSP alliance was committing to making government functioning paperless. We will also ensure power is made available at ₹5 per unit.”He alleged that Capt Amarinder Singh had wasted five years. “Another pretender to the throne, Navjot Sidhu, will waste another five years as he is not only corrupt and arrogant but also negative in his approach towards all public works,” he alleged, claiming that Sidhu had also masterminded the conspiracy to book Majithia. Sukhbir also addressed a large congregation of the Masih community, besides youth and panchayat rallies in favour of Anil Joshi. On AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, he claimed that the Delhi CM was just trying to befool people on the same lines as Capt Amarinder. Youth Akali Dal (YAD) president Parambans Singh Romana on Monday asked the state government to clarify on the compulsion that led it to appoint S Chattopadhyaya as the DGP. “Due to the DGP’s lack of experience, Punjab is facing law and order problems. The chief minister, home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and the state congress unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu are answerable,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-transform-amritsar-into-tourism-it-hub-sukhbir-101640624872723.html

27-12-2021||Chandigarh||Omar, Mehbooba fume over UT admn opening J&K to real estate investors||Mainstream political leaders have raised strong concern over putting the land of J&K on “sale” in the name of real estate investment summit. At the real estate summit held in Jammu, which was organised by the Union ministry for housing and urban affairs and J&K administration on Monday, LG Manoj Sinha said that similar summit will be held in Srinagar in May next year. However, the allocation of land to non-local investors has triggered resentment among mainstream politicians, who have been demanding to safeguard the rights of locals post-revocation of Article 370. “Once again the true intentions of the government are brought to the fore. While offering to secure the land, jobs, domicile laws & identity of the people of Ladakh, J&K is being put up for sale. People of Jammu should beware, “investors” will buy up land in Jammu long before Kashmir,” tweeted NC vice-president Omar Abdullah. Former J&K chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the summit “sale of the resources of J&K”. “J&Ks special status was illegally revoked to dehumanise, dispossess & disempower the only muslim majority state in India.GOIs brazen loot & sale of our resources shows that the sole motive is to annihilate our identity & change the demography (sic),” said Mehbooba Mufti in a tweet. The Apni Party, which is considered close to the BJP, also called this summit an “endeavour for undermining the domicile law”.Apni Party president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari on Monday in a statement said that efforts that aim at a holistic development and job creation in Jammu and Kashmir are welcome but not at the cost of domicile laws that safeguard land and employment rights of its permanent residents.He said, “Our party will always welcome any efforts that will foster progress and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir. But at the same time, we are pledged to resist any plans that will do away with the exclusive rights of the people on their land and jobs.”He said the way term ‘permanent resident of the state’ has been omitted from the J&K Development Act, was totally unacceptable to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/omar-mehbooba-fume-over-ut-admn-opening-j-k-to-real-estate-investors-101640624452188.html

Punjabis are capable for leading their own state and do need not an outsider like him,” Channi told a gathering in Rohno Kalan village near Khanna. He inaugurated a sports park, a panchayat ghar and a park. He added that while his government was implementing the common man’s agenda, Kejriwal was promising the moon to people in Punjab, rather than working for the betterment of the ‘Aam Aadmi’ of Delhi. Kejriwal is best at rolling out bundles of lies, he alleged, adding that before the 2017 Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections, the AAP supremo had given a “guarantee” that he would throw Bikram Singh Majithia behind bars for his involvement with the drug mafia.“When the AAP failed to form the government in Punjab, the same Kejriwal offered unconditional apology to Majithia in court, and that too on AAP letterhead,” he said, adding that raids were on to arrest Majithia.He alleged that the Uncle-nephew relationship between former CM Capt Amarinder Singh and Bikram Singh Majithia was now an open secret now, as the former has been issuing statements in favour of the Akali leader.On the pro-people initiatives of his government, he claimed that power bill arrears of ₹1,500 crore had been waived, power rates for domestic consumers have been reduced by ₹3 per unit, bills to the tune of ₹1,200 crore had been waived in rural areas, water charges brought down to ₹50 and rates for sand had been significantly reduced.“To check illegal sand mining, the state government will give a reward of ₹25,000 to those who provide proof of violation of norms,” the CM said. Cabinet minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli said due to pro-people policies of the CM, a large number of industries are being set up in the state. He added that his grandfather and former CM Beant Singh sacrificed his life for peace and communal harmony of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabis-will-not-let-outsider-kejriwal-win-claims-channi-101640624390873.html

27-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP government in HP a total failure: Congress||The Congress on Monday submitted a memorandum to Himachal governor Rajendra Arlekar, condemning chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s four-year regime. The Congress described the BJP rule in Himachal as a complete failure. Led by party’s state chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, a Congress delegation slammed the HP government over the skyrocketing prices of essential committees. It said that the government did not pay heed to the tourism, education and transport sectors. The Congress leaders said that unemployment in the state was on the rise. They also castigated the government for ignoring the interest of agrarian community. “The Congress government had brought ₹1,134 crore horticulture mission project for Himachal to give impetus to fruit growing, but the present regime did not implement it in the state,” Rathore said. “A lot of money is being wasted on government functions. Despite losing in by-polls, Jai Ram was announcing new development projects without budgetary provisions,” he added. The Congress also alleged irregularities in the purchase of medical equipment during the pandemic. The Congress leaders said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not make any announcement for Himachal in his rally. Rathore said it was expected that the PM would announce an economic package for the debt-ridden state, but he did nothing other than praising food. “Investment of ₹27,000 crore is a daydream of the state government as nothing has been finalised on the ground,” he said, adding that projects which were mentioned by the PM in his speech, be it AIIMS or Atal Tunnel, were the contribution of the Congress. He said Modi has taught the BJP and state government how to take credit and claim the projects initiated and built by others. HP government has pushed the state into a debt trap: CPIMThe Communist Party of India – Marxist (CPIM) on Monday also staged a protest in Shimla, terming the four-year rule of the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government a complete failure.Addressing the protesters, former Shimla mayor and CPIM’s state secretariat member Sanjay Chauhan said that the BJP has failed to fulfil the promises it made to the people ahead of the 2017 assembly polls.“The government had promised to curb inflation and create more employment opportunities. It had also promised the farmers to provide a fair price for their produce while labourers were assured increased wages,” said Chauhan.However, none of the promises has been fulfilled so far, he claimed.Another CPIM leader Kuldeep Singh Tanwar alleged that ever since the BJP government has come to power in the state, inflation and unemployment have only escalated while the farm sector plunged into crisis.The HP government has pushed the state into a “debt trap” of more than ₹62,000 crore while its “anti-people policies” have led to a rise in the cost of living, water, electricity, public transport, education, and health in these four years, he added. He said the government has reduced spending under the public distribution system due to which it has become difficult for the common man to make both ends meet. The CPIM leaders also said that the attacks on women, Dalits and other socially weaker sections have increased in the state during the BJP rule. They said the CPIM will continue the movement against the “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-people policies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-government-in-hp-a-total-failure-congress-101640623430589.html

When he was in Kannauj, he and others in the family used to keep to themselves,” said another neighbour. Chipatta, the locality where the family of Piyush Jain has been living for generations, saw their wealth status changing in the last 15 years, as the neighbours and locals put it. The family used to have a two-room house in which Piyush and his two siblings were raised.His grandfather was into perfumery and father Mahesh Chandra Jain was a chemist, who prepared the perfume compound and passed the formulas on to his two sons Piyush Jain and Ambrish Jain, who launched their company Odochem Chemicals sometime in 2010.With fortune favouring them, Piyush Jain and his brothers bought two houses and merged them into one. His father and some of the staff members live in the house.It has been built in a way that people from the adjoining house cannot see what is inside. At present, the family has four houses, including the one spread over 700 square yards in Kannauj, apart from the one in Kanpur’s Anandpuri locality. Over the last few days, the entire action of Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has centered on these Kannauj houses where 34 people have been working non-stop for the past 84 hours.All the walls, which have more width than the normal ones, were being scanned for cavities through an X-ray machine brought from Lucknow. In addition, a basement and 300 keys have been found with a currency counting machine, which was used regularly, said an official on condition of anonymity.When Piyush Jain was asked about his wealth and the huge cash found at his house, he chose not to answer the question while being taken out of the Kakadeo police station in Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/neighbours-in-kannauj-recall-piyush-jain-s-conspicuous-austerity-101640623070603.html

As a symbolic protest, many of them even "returned their lab coats" earlier in the day.As the agitation continued to intensify, patient care remained affected at three Centre-run facilities -- Safdarjung, RML and Lady Hardinge hospitals -- and some of the Delhi government-run hospitals, a PTI report said.The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association (FORDA) has been spearheading the protest for the last several days.Delhi | Protesting resident doctors of various hospitals march near Safdarjung Hospital, over delay in NEET-PG counselling pic.twitter.com/SnPyrbIYoCThe association’s president Manish said resident doctors of a large number of hospitals "returned their apron (lab coat) in a symbolic gesture of rejection of services"."We also tried to march from the campus of the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) to the Supreme Court, but soon after, security personnel stopped us," he said.Manish also alleged that several doctors were "detained" and taken to police state, before being released a little later.

27-12-2021||Delhi||2021 #TheYearThatWas: A sweet revenge, and how Delhiites made up for lost time||Stay home, stay safe... mask up... lockdown... Memories of March 2020 — when Delhi came to a standstill — were still fresh in the minds of people when the second wave crept up on them, earlier this year. However, as the number of cases plummetted in the latter half of the year, Delhiites decided enough was enough. For many, 2021 was all about physical shopping sprees, eating out, partying and spending their days outdoor, revelling in the city, with a vengeance, to overcome fear. Revenge Shopping“Online shopping me maza kahan hain, jab aap bahaar jaake khareed sakte ho,” says Surbhi Verma, a homemaker from Malviya Nagar. While she shopped from e-commerce websites for her newborn son during the lockdown, she shares she felt relieved to shop physically from the markets and malls once the curbs were relaxed. “We were completely indoors during the lockdown months as my son was very young and we didn’t want to take a chance. But once the cases reduced, we started stepping out and it was fun, especially during the festivities. The whole process of getting ready to step out, bargaining with sellers, talking to other people and exploring the market was an experience I had missed. However, now with the new variant, we have stopped taking our son out. It’s difficult to resist the urge to go out with the year end waali feeling but we’ve to be careful!” says Verma. Revenge Eating Out! While ordering in food is a practice no one would ever want to give up, Delhiites realised the value of getting together with friends and family to eat at restaurants during the lockdown. The result? Booked out eateries for most of the latter half of 2021! “The footfall was phenomenal. We had people calling to make reservations for dates that were weeks away. Many of them wanted to make bookings in advance to avoid rush and follow safety protocols. People are learning to live in the new normal,” says Varun Puri, who owns multiple restaurants in the city.Kriti Singhal, who owns a youth forum in Pitampura, shares, “The second wave resulted in a lot of fear but we wanted mental peace after a while. We realised that we needed to break this fear cycle. We just need to be cautious.”Revenge travelling in the city!While the malls and markets in the city saw an increase in footfall, Delhiites also made the most of heritage walks and explored iconic places in the city. “We were having to turn people back”, says Ramit Mitra from Delhi By Foot, and continues, “We are not going beyond 18-20 people per group but often people request us to take them along in a particular group. Our groups were completely booked.”Sunny Kumar Maurya, an IT professional from Mehrauli shares, “I really like going out to monuments and other iconic places in the city. I really missed those in the lockdown. I was going to these spots regularly with my family and friends. But, now I’m planning to visit alone to take no risks and stay safe.”Revenge partying!Delhi has been partying. And how! “Suddenly after the lockdown was lifted, people just went crazy planning get-togethers and socialising. Almost all my clients were calling us up, saying that for two years they couldn’t celebrate their children’s birthdays, and now that things were better, they wanted to do something. Parties started with 20 odd people and soon the guest lists, even for small parties, crossed 50. All ages became milestone celebrations for people and they wanted big parties — be it for anniversaries, birthdays. At one point, we were doing more parties than we have ever... subah bhi function and shaam ko bhi! It was crazy,” shares Swati Chirpal, a party planner, recalling how Delhiites were trying to get a feel of their long-lost normalcy, before the news of the Omicron variant started to spread.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2021-theyearthatwas-a-sweet-revenge-and-how-delhiites-made-up-for-lost-time-101640619427690.html

According to some of the experts, a peak in the viral disease is likely to come by mid-February.A PTI report quoting epidemiologist Giridhar R Babu said the number of cases were rising not because of the ongoing festive season when people gather in large numbers, but the Omicron strain of the virus that has been categorised by the World Health Organisation as a ‘variant of concern’.“The cases will see a rapid ascent and a rapid descent and the peak is likely to come between mid-January and mid-February,” he said, adding those who have not been vaccinated and have not been infected with the virus are more susceptible to the infection.Another expert said the number of coronavirus cases and the positivity rate will increase, but it will not translate into mortality. "What we can say is that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the present cases could be related to Omicron, while the rest could be due to other variants. The transmission occurs because of proximity. In winter, people are indoors and meet each other in a close-knit environment, and even the number of influenza cases rises during this period," Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of the community medicine department at the Safdarjung hospital, was quoted as saying.Also read | Delhi night curfew: What's allowed and what's notThe doctor further said the government should formulate guidelines for the proper management of Covid-19 and urged people to not ambush hospitals if they suffer from a mild infection."All kinds of disasters are the result of a system failure. The government should formulate guidelines on proper management. Those who are suffering from issues like a severe headache or fever should go to hospitals, while the rest should manage at home and should not even go for testing. After testing positive, the person will panic trying to grab hospital beds and medicines," he said.Delhi reported 331 fresh cases of coronavirus disease and one death in the last 24 hours, according to the latest state health department's bulletin. The active Covid cases currently stood at 1,289, of which 692 are in home isolation.Delhi has so far reported 142 cases of Omicron, according to Union health ministry data.

Officials requesting anonymity said they were focussing on the Maharishi Ramayan Vidyapeeth Trust, which bought land in Manjha Barhata and Shahnawazpur villages from its Dalit owners. A state government official said the trust allegedly purchased the land from a Dalit person in the name of its own Dalit employee, who was identified as Ronghai, and later showed that the land had been donated to the body. Such a transaction violated norms which state that land owned by a scheduled caste person can only be sold to another Dalit person. A non-Dalit is not allowed to purchase land from a Dalit. In rare cases, permission of the district magistrate concerned is mandatory for such transactions. A case is also pending against the trust in the revenue court (administrative), Ayodhya. “Land deals of the trust are being investigated. The probe team scanned all documents related with the land deals of the trust,” the official said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ayodhya-land-deal-maharishi-ramayan-vidyapeeth-trust-officials-under-scanner-101640615029482.html

At present, schools and colleges are shut for Christmas holidays, but we are assessing the situation at hand. Depending on how things pan out, we shall take a call sometime next week,” said Thackeray, state minister of environment and tourism, who was one of the guests of honour for the event. “The decision of shutting down schools is not easy because children are missing out on a major part of their development, especially younger children who haven’t ever stepped into a school. That apart, we are definitely thinking about their health and safety and a decision keeping this in mind will be taken,” he said, adding that vaccination for those above 15 years of age will begin soon and that too should help tackle the growing cases. The annual convocation ceremony was held physically after a one-year break this year. While state education minister Uday Samant could not be present for the event due to the ongoing assembly session. Governor and chancellor of all state universities Bhagat Singh Koshiyari was presiding over the event and the chief guest this year was Sunil Kumar Singh, director of the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. Nineteen students were awarded gold medals for exemplary performance in different fields this year, whereas, another 240 MPhil and PhDs were awarded to students. Due to Covid protocols, only gold medallists were invited for the event, and the certificates of nearly two lakh graduating students were sent to respective colleges for students to collect individually this year. “Starting this year, we will now allow colleges to hold their graduation ceremonies in this prestigious convocation hall, so everyone can experience the grandeur,” said MU vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar.

Manjhi, who underscored that mostly the poor were being arrested under the law that bars production, sale, transportation or consumption of liquor, said some people should be given permission to drink alcohol even during prohibition.At the event on Monday, the chief minister appeared to turn emotional as he heard the experience of a disabled woman from Rohtas district’s Nauhatta block, Sarojni Devi - she said her husband is also disabled - speak of how the family once sold liquor but left it after coming in touch with a women self-help group, Jeevika. In time,they opened a grocery shop and earn ₹20,000 every month, enabling their children, two daughters and a son, go to school.Ministers Sunil Kumar, Ashok Kumar Chaudhary, Mangal Pandey, chief secretary Tripurari Saran and state police chief SK Singhal also addressed the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cant-live-without-liquor-don-t-come-nitish-kumar-s-message-to-tourists-101640612869142.html
27-12-2021||Lucknow||Night curfew: Big NY bashes turn into gala dinners!||The imposing of night curfew by the state government has forced hotels, restaurants, lounges and party organisers to either cancel their events or make them a gala dinner affair.Since December 25, the night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am has come into effect. The message sent by the Excise Department reads that no special events should be organised. However, bars will remain operational.“We were calling a DJ from Mumbai to ring in the New Year, but now we will have a simple bash with a cover charge to restrict the number of guests. To abide with the night curfew protocol and the excise department instruction, we need to wind up at around 10:30 pm as our staff needs to reach home before the curfew begins,” says Gaurav Singh of Boombox.The big bash, earlier, planned at the garden area, by The Centrum has been called off, and they now plan to organise a simple dinner.At Ramada Hotel, on the city outskirt, a planned gala event has been shelved. “Instead, we will have a gala dinner at both restaurants. The outstation performers plan too has been called-off,” says hotel’s official Amitesh Singh.Clubs, too, have shelved plans for NY-eve events. “We were expecting strict measures, so we did not book outstation celebrity performers. Now, we will have a simple routine affair with the bar closing at 10 pm and club 30 minutes after,” says Ashok Kumar Agarwal, secretary of Oudh Gymkhana Club. The Golf Club is also is not holding an event for the day.Club Momentz also did not float any public event. “We prefer our disc and lounge area to be taken by a private party. With night curfew, there is no point in holding anything,” says Jugal Sachdeva.A recently opened food chain The Great Kebab Factory had booked performers to welcome 2022, but now has converted it to a gala dinner event. “We will have an elaborate six-course gala dinner along with a live performance by a city-based band. No other activity will be held as per the government protocols,” says Amit Mishra, restaurants general manager.Singer-actor Suyyash Rai will be the star attraction at Sky Glass Brewing Co, but they have curtailed their initial plan to hosting 200 couples to 100 couples and will be ending their bash at 10:30 pm, tells Neeraj Kataria.However, an event with Azadi The Band has been planned at MJ Fun City on the city outskirts. On the booking portal, they promise patrons ‘a gala night.’Now, with so many restrictions there is no point going for these gala dinners when you can’t ring in the New Year without drinks and dance, says Vishwas Yadav, a party regular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/night-curfew-big-ny-bashes-turn-into-gala-dinners-101640612209382.html
27-12-2021||Lucknow||Sahibzada Day will inspire us to fight against tyranny: Yogi||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath observed Sahibzada Day at his official residence on Monday and remembered the martyrdom of four sons (sahibzadas) of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj – the 10th guru of the Sikhs.He said Maharaja Ranjit Singh (the first ruler of the Sikh empire in the early half of 19th century) brought two tonnes of gold and transformed the Kashi Vishwanath Temple into “Golden Kashi Vishwanath Temple”. “Aurangzeb destroyed the temple, but Maharaja Ranjit Singh made the temple golden. The new India must decide whether Aurangzeb deserves being respected or the great Maharaja Ranjit Singhji. The Sikhs are a great inspiration for the new India,” said the CM.“Who does not know that Aurangzeb wanted the Sahibzade of Guru Gobind Singh to renounce their faith and abandon the teachings of their guru. But they chose getting buried alive to protect the country,” said the CM. He said it was the divine tradition of Sikh gurus that never allowed anti-Sanatan Dharma intentions of foreign terrorists to succeed. “From Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind Singh, Sikhism is a wonderful amalgamation of power with devotion. This divine tradition had come to save India. Sahibzada Day will always inspire us to fight against tyranny and unrighteousness,” said Adityanath, adding that the existence of those who came with the intention of converting India to Islam had been erased. “Sikh tradition should be adopted in every Hindu household, and should not be limited to Gurudwaras,” he added.Wearing a saffron turban, the CM followed the rituals to commemorate the day. Accompanied by other ministers and officials, he also performed a ‘parikrama’ carrying the Granth Sahib.On the occasion, the CM cited many historical events – from Babur to Aurangzeb’s reign. “Terrorists tried to convert the whole country to Islam and enslave India when Babur attacked India, but his intention was not allowed to be fulfilled by the Sikh gurus,” he said.He further said that the Sikh community was known for its dedication towards the nation. “It is well known who drove the Kashmiri Hindus and Pandits away from the Valley. But Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Maharaj was the one who protected the Kashmiri Pandits in the country,” stated Adityanath. In the presence of several dignitaries of the Sikh society, the CM also talked about efforts for the restoration of historically important gurudwaras in the state and the establishment of a museum focused on the tradition of Sikh gurus.Notably, UP is the first state to observe Sahibzada Diwas since 2020 when chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the sacrifice of the Sikh gurus should be part of the school curriculum Anupam Srivastava9044409900||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sahibzada-day-will-inspire-us-to-fight-against-tyranny-yogi-101640610768786.html

27-12-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Be prepared for possible 3rd wave; ramp up health infra, vax||PUNE Around a year ago when India started its Covid-19 vaccination programme, not many had anticipated such a harsh second wave. As the cases started surging massively with fatalities reaching a new peak in the middle of April-May, the demand for shots too went up substantially as people turned up in large numbers outside vaccination centres. This led to the vaccine constraint as the supply was fewer than demand.This time, the country is better prepared on the vaccination front with production scaled up by two manufacturers – Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech from Hyderabad - and a majority of Indians have already taken the shots. On Saturday (December 25), Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced vaccination for children and a booster (precautionary) dose for frontline workers as well as senior citizens with co-morbidities, beginning next month.In the light of cases of Omicron variant and increasing patients of Covid-19 each day, there is a looming threat of another wave. The experts too have pointed at this and Maharashtra government has once again imposed another round of restrictions.It is also time for the state government to ensure Maharashtra has adequate stock of medicines when demand is currently low and production on the higher side. During the second wave, medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were high in demand for patients hospitalised and on oxygen support. The situation for medicines when the second wave was at its peak was so bad the relatives had to wait in long queues and yet there was no guarantee they get the stock they were looking for. Eventually, the Centre took supply in its control with state government too began providing Remdesivir and Tocilizumab only through hospitals.The state was also scrambling for oxygen as demand shot up. The government promised oxygen plants within months to meet the requirement. As the wave receded, things went back to normal with urgency replaced with laxity. As reported by Hindustan Times in its Pune edition during the first week of December, of the 65 oxygen plants which the administration had planned in Pune district to start given the Covid-19 pandemic, 37 are operational while 28 are still in the making.Since March 2020, the district has set up over 37 oxygen plants which have a production capacity of about 21,550 litres per minute and 20 oxygen tanks that can store more than 300 kilolitres of oxygen. Covid-19 being a respiratory ailment primarily the supply of oxygen needs to be continuous among patients.Given that transmissibility of Omicron is very high and Pune and Mumbai have faced harsh waves in the past, the state government needs to prepare itself on medicines and oxygen front besides re-organising beds. At the same time, hoarders are likely to see an opportunity in earning extra money by stalking crucial medicines now and selling it at an additional cost when there’s demand. The government needs to watch on people indulging in the hoarding of medicines which was common and police had to take action against them.On one hand, Maharashtra has till December 25 administered over 16.4 million (1.64 crores) doses, which is a sharp rise compared to the past two months, all we know is that the vaccine will only be an additional shield from protecting ourselves from the deadly virus.While the rise in inoculation is mostly due to local administration at various districts making vaccine doses mandatory for accessing various services and people shedding hesitancy in the light of fresh threat emerging from the new variant Omicron, the government also need to ramp up its facilities when the wave still appears slightly distant if not months away.This year, Pune district has seen over 12,350 fatalities due to Covid-19, much higher than in 2020 when the number was 7,767. At the same time, 791,296 persons were infected with the virus this year as against 372,655 infections in 2020.We cannot let people die in absence of either medicines or oxygen. The same goes with vaccines too.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com

Also read: Chandigarh MC elections: Hung House as AAP wins 14 seats, BJP 12He was addressing a public meeting to mark the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government’s four years in office after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of four hydro-electric projects. “Today, the Himachal Pradesh government has completed four years. During its tenure, the government fought against Covid-19 and simultaneously made sure that development works don’t stop,” Modi said. Striking an emotional chord, he said he has an emotional relation with Himachal as the land and its mountains have played a key role in giving a direction to his life. Modi said the presence of such a large number of people despite the bone-chilling cold reflects that Himachal has excelled in every sphere in the last four years. Earlier, he inaugurated the 111MW Sawra-Kuddu Hydro Electric Project (HEP) constructed with an outlay of ₹2081.60 and laid the foundation stones of the Renukaji Dam Project ( ₹6,946 crore), 210MW Luhri Stage-I ( ₹1,811 crore) and 66MW Dhaulasidh Power Project ( ₹688 crores). He also presided over the second groundbreaking ceremony of projects worth ₹28,197 crore. Ease of living govt’s priorityAsserting that ease of living was the priority of his government, Modi said electricity has to play a key role in achieving this objective. “Our ease of living model is helping in environment conservation and the new hydropower projects, of which inauguration or foundation stones were laid today, is one step forward towards a climate-friendly new India,” said Modi. “The whole world is praising India for how our country is accelerating development, while saving the environment by making full use of every resource of renewable energy,” the PM said. He said India has achieved 40% installed electricity from non-fossil resources which was set for 2030 and reflects the rapid pace India was working in this direction. Modi said the government is alert about the damage caused to the mountains due to plastic. “Along with the nationwide campaign against single-use plastic, our government is also working on plastic waste management,” he said, urging tourists to help keep Himachal clean and plastic-free. Two models of developmentIn a dig at the opposition, Modi said there were two models of governance in the country. “One is ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas’ and the other is ‘Khud ka swarth, parivaar ka swarth and parivar ka vikas’. Working on the first model, the Himachal government not only implemented welfare schemes but also expanded Centre-sponsored schemes, he said. The Prime Minister said that working on this model, Himachal Pradesh had outperformed other states in vaccination against Covid of its adult population. He said the other model is about only self-interests and vote-bank and “This could be checked from vaccination data of the states where they are running a government.” He said the proponents of the second model made Himachal wait for decades. That is why, Atal Tunnel was delayed and completed by us. Similarly, Renuka Dam was also delayed for three decades, he said. Industrial development potentialModi said Himachal has vast potential for industrial development and the government is focusing on food processing, farming, pharma sector and tourism sectors. “The government is promoting the food sector, while lakhs of Himachal farmers have already adopted chemical-free natural farming,” he said, urging farmers from other states to emulate their Himachal brethren. He said if India is today called the Pharmacy of the World, Himachal was force behind it. Stating that tourism and pilgrimage are inter-connected, Modi said Himachal has potential in this sector which will be given a fillip by the double engine government in the state and Centre as the speed of development projects and the implementation of different schemes have got a momentum. Modi said that his government has announced Covid-19 vaccination for 15 to 18-year-olds from January 3, 2022, and “precaution dose” for healthcare workers and senior citizens with comorbidities from January 10. “I am confident that Himachal Pradesh will lead in achieving vaccination coverage,” he added. Touch of traditionIn the chilly December air, Modi wore a traditional Himachali cap with multi-coloured embroidery, along with a matching shawl, which added colour to the Prime Minister’s white-and-grey outfit, with its orange, pink and green embroidery, crafted in beautiful, ethnic designs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-fought-pandemic-kept-pace-with-progress-pm-101640604769210.html

When I turned around, the gun fell down from one of the suspects’ hands, following which another suspect stabbed me with the knife,” he said, adding that they snatched his cellphone and ₹8,000 and escaped.No one came for Raj’s rescue when he raised an alarm, said the police, adding that the victim was taken to a nearby hospital where he was given first-aid. A case was registered against the three suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 392 (robbery),394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention); and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act at the Bhondsi police station on Saturday.“The suspects have been identified with the help of CCTV footage on Saturday, and a search is underway to nab the suspects,” Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said.

The civic body has floated a tender in this regard, bids of which will be opened on January 6, they said, adding that the library will be operational by end of 2022. The total cost of the project is estimated to be around ₹92 lakh, the officials said.There are five public libraries in the city, four of which are under the MCG at DLF Phases 1, 2, 3, and Chakkarpur village. The district administration also has a library in the Civil Lines area.“We are aiming to construct a new library in Jharsa village. We are hoping to allocate the tender to a contractor by mid-January and start construction from the following month. The library is being constructed in Jharsa village so that residents living in southern parts of the city such as along Golf Course Extension Road, Vikas Marg, and Netaji Subhash Marg can avail the facility,” said Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer of MCG who is overseeing the project.Sheoran said that for establishing the library, a new building will be constructed. All the other four libraries of the MCG operate out of community centres.SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG, and in-charge of MCG’s libraries, said that the civic body currently has over 9,000 books in the four libraries, primarily in English and Hindi.Authors said that the MCG also needs to ensure residents in the vicinity are aware of the existence of a library.“Otherwise, the entire exercise will be futile. Once awareness is achieved, MCG can explore making all their functional libraries a centre for exchanging ideas and holding discussions so that it attracts more residents and has a constant footfall,” said Ravinder Singh, a city-based author.In May 2018, of the 2,000 books, nearly 1,300 books were stolen by thieves at the MCG’s Chakkarpur library. Following this, the MCG increased security at this library and its initiative towards public libraries also gained momentum with the civic body opening three more such facilities at DLF Phases 1 to 3 in June 2018.

The opinion mentioned in the FIR said that cognisable offence was made out against Deshmukh.The CBI started a probe into the leak in which it emerged that findings of the PE were influenced. The inquiry was initiated on the orders of the Bombay high court, which issued the direction while hearing a public interest litigation on allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exmaharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-s-judicial-custody-to-end-today-101640567515136.html

For AAP, rebel candidates from Congress and BJP form majority of its candidates, so it remains to be seen whether they can win or just dent the winning prospects of main candidates.Elections results will determine the future of state presidents of all three parties – BJP’s Arun Sood, Congress’ Subhash Chawla and AAP’s Prem Garg.Some political experts, even believe, Chandigarh MC results, would also indicate the mood of people in neighbouring states, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh where elections are slated for next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-elections-chandigarh-will-have-its-new-councillors-today-101640552801433.html
27-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Principals with double charge forced to travel 100km thrice a week||In an untenable arrangement, the state education department has placed a double charge with 22 principals, of which 17 are responsible for schools in different districts, forcing them to undertake long journeys thrice a week. The principals whose second charge in Bathinda, Jalandhar and Moga have to undertake a journey of 140 km, 61 km and 68 km, respectively. Of principals with a double charge, 13 are women. Charanjit Kaur, Monica, Gurmit Kaur, Sarabjit Kaur, Paramjit Kaur, Ravinder Kaur and Meenu Gupta are in charge of Government Senior Secondary Schools in Ludhiana and Moga. Meanwhile, Kulvir Kaur is in-charge of schools in Ludhiana and Bathinda, while Davinder Pal Kaur and Jyoti Sharma have to travel to Jalandhar thrice a week.According to officials, most of the principals holding a double charge are those who sought transfers from the previous school education secretary but were not relieved from their previous charges in other districts and were rather given additional charge of another school.A principal, on condition of anonymity, said the government does not pay travelling allowance to reach schools, which are around 100km away, in different districts. “We have to pay the fare thrice a week from our own pockets.” “This arrangement is ridiculous. Entrusting a single principal to run two-three schools in different districts is tantamount to harassment. It seems that the government wants to punish the principals for seeking a transfer. The arrangement also affects teachers and students,” said an aggrieved principal, who did not wish to be named. “An additional charge of a previous schools can be a temporary arrangement for two-three months till the joining of a new principal, but it has gone on for over a year. We have been shuttling between two schools, which affects the development of both the schools,” said another principal.To sort out the issue, the Punjab school education department director general has sought the list of such school principals from all district education officers in the state.A principal privy to the matter said the principals with double charges will soon hold a protest in SAS Nagar. “We deserved to be promoted for our hard work, but we are being treated poorly. Many principals are spending more than they earn on commuting,” she said. District education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra says the list of these principals has been sent to the school education secretary and necessary action will soon be taken.

27-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: Jesus Christ statue vandalised at Holy Redeemer Catholic church||Two men allegedly desecrated and vandalised a 5.5-ft tall statue of Jesus Christ at the historical Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Ambala Cantonment, during the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. The church, built in 1848 when the East India Company shifted its base from Karnal to Ambala, is one of the oldest in the region. Police said the men entered the church premises after jumping the gates and vandalised the statue, which is near the entrance. “The closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage at the spot shows the men entering the compound around 12:30am and by 1.40am, the statue was damaged,” said Naresh Kumar, in-charge of Ambala Cantt police station. Father Anthony of the church said that due to the night curfew, Christmas celebrations had ended early and the gate was locked at 10:30pm. “The miscreants damaged the decoration inside the church and also broke the glass case at the entrance to damage the holy statue of Jesus Christ (Sacred Heart Statue). This is the oldest church in Ambala and nothing of this sort has happened earlier,” he told the reporters. In his complaint, Father Patras Mundu said, “The issue is very sensitive for the Christian community and our religious sentiments are deeply hurt. In the CCTV camera footage, it is clear that this was done intentionally.”Ambala has a substantial population of Christians and at least four prominent churches that were built during the British rule still exist. On Sunday evening, Bishop Ignatius Loyola Ivan Mascarenhas of diocese of Simla-Chandigarh reached the church for a special prayer meeting, after which the remains of damaged statue were collected in the presence of a large number of community members.Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Pooja Dabla said several police teams have already inspected the crime scene to determine whether it is a miscreant activity or motivated to hurt religious sentiments.An FIR has been lodged under Sections 295 (injuring or defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code. Reacting to the incident, Haryana home minister and local MLA Anil Vij told reporters in Karnal that a separate teams of CIA-1 staff, CIA-2 and Cantt SHO are probing the case and the suspects won’t be spared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-jesus-christ-statue-vandalised-at-holy-redeemer-catholic-church-101640551780948.html
27-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU scientists develop targeted nano-formulation to stop diabetes-induced Alzheimer’s disease||Researchers at Panjab University (PU) have developed a targeted nano-formulation to stop diabetes induced Alzheimer’s disease.Nano-formulations (NFs) are novel and advanced drug-delivery systems, which enhance the properties of conventional drugs and are specific to the targeted delivery site. The study was carried out by Professor Rajat Sandhir and Smriti Gupta, a PhD student, of PU’s biochemistry department.The researchers collaborated with Nitin Singhal of National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI), Mohali, and Subramaniam Ganesh from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, for the project.The findings of the research have been recently published in an international journal “ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces”. The observational studies on a large number of diabetic patients suggests greater susceptibility to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD), that led to coining of a new term, type-3 diabetes (T3DM), which is a neuro-metabolic disorder.In this study, the scientists initiated the work to unravel the mechanisms that link diabetes with Alzheimer’s disease using culture systems and animal models. It identified that the compromised insulin signaling system contributes to the development of diabetes-induced Alzheimer’s disease.Sandhir said, “Based on the findings, we can identify GSK3 beta as a key component in an insulin signaling pathway that was found to be over-activated in the brain, which suggested it to be likely to reverse the pathological events in the brain.”They used Graphene Oxide (GO) as a vehicle to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) using nasal route of delivery to block GSK3 beta gene in the brain. GSK3 is a key molecule in the insulin signalling pathway. GO has attracted great interest in recent years as a delivery vehicle and has shown remarkable success in gene knockdown due to its unique physical, chemical, and biological properties.The researchers found that the siRNA approach was successful in preventing cognitive deficits and pathology induced by compromised insulin signalling. “It is expected that the results of pre-clinical studies may soon be translated so that the benefit can reach those suffering from diabetes-induced memory deficits,” added Sandhir.Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that accounts for more than 80% of dementia cases worldwide in elderly people

Hooda said that the BJP-JJP government has failed to carry out new development works and carry forward approved schemes of the previous Congress government too. “Once Congress returns to power, all the demands of the people, like bringing a railway line to Mewat, building a university, and developing the Mewat canal will be fulfilled,” he said. Deepender Hooda, Rajya Sabha MP and Congress leader, also alleged that the present state government derailed the process of development in the entire state, including Mewat. “Haryana was number one in per capita income and investment, respect for farmers and sportspersons, agricultural productivity, schemes for the benefit of the poor, and providing employment before 2014... Today, it ranks first in unemployment, crime, atrocities on farmers and corruption among others,” he said.When asked about allegations leveled by Congress leaders, Sudhir Singla, BJP MLA from Gurugram, said that the current state government won the 2019 elections because of the all-around development, without any discrimination. “The previous Congress government under Hooda only concentrated on a few districts, and this was the reason it lost the elections twice... The BJP government has carried out major development works across the state, especially in Gurugram, Rewari and Mewat,” said Singla, adding that Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) or Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway will be transformed in the Mewat region.

27-12-2021||Other||Gurugram faces shortage of imported foreign liquor||Ahead of the New Year, the district is facing a shortage of imported foreign liquor (IFL) due to international supply chain issues, said traders and excise officials. Shashank Sangal, owner of Aralia Beverages Pvt LTD, said that the IFL stock is almost exhausted due to import constraints in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Due to the current situation, people are trying to stock up their bars. Besides, with New Year approaching, people are running around to buy IFL for their parties but they are unable to do so,” he said. Due to the second wave of coronavirus, import was badly affected and there was no supply of liquor from abroad, said excise officials. Sandeep Parsan, liquor importer who also runs several shops in the city, said that only a limited stock is available and there is no chance that they will receive the stock before March-end. “The situation will remain the same for the next three months and this might increase the prices of IFL,” he said. Most liquor shops across the city are facing this challenge. The shopkeepers are encouraging customers to buy India made foreign liquor (IMFL) and are offering discounts ahead of the celebrations. Surinder Kumar, manager of a liquor store on Golf Course Road, said that they are turning back their regular customers of foreign liquor. “We are offering schemes so that they buy IMFL, but those keen on fixed brands do not easily get ready to try new brands,” he said. VK Beniwal, deputy commissioner of excise and taxation, Gurugram (east), said that the same containers that come in as import shipments are shipped out for exports. “There is hardly any rotation these days, leading to the shortage of foreign liquor,” he said.
27-12-2021||Other||Gurugram: ANPR cameras, a tool for recovering stolen vehicles||Gurugram police have recovered at least 50 stolen vehicles in the last two months with the help of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras installed at 24 spots across the city. At least seven vehicles are stolen from the city everyday, police say, adding that this is the main challenge they face on a daily basis. An HT team spent half a day at the integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44, where cameras linked to traffic signals detect changes on the screen via light sensors. Police teams constantly coordinate with the traffic police at checkpoints and patrol vehicles to ensure no stolen vehicle passes by. The cameras are monitored by police teams, which work in three shifts of eight hours each, and are deployed at the ICCC set up by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority to monitor feeds on CCTV cameras and share real-time data with patrol teams as soon as they receive an alert. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said an alert is sounded to the nearby traffic post as well as the ICCC as soon as any suspected vehicle enters an area where an ANPR camera is installed, and the vehicle is intercepted at the next checkpoint by a police team. “If a vehicle escapes a checkpoint, teams manually track and follow the vehicle on suspected routes. More than 15 vehicles were recovered between September 25 and December 20 from suspects who were trying to flee to Nuh and Rajasthan. The cameras are connected to software which is further connected to Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), which updated itself with the latest stolen vehicle numbers from the city as well as the state,” he said. Rao said police teams are deployed at all entry and exit points of the city (where ANPR cameras have been installed) and when any vehicle theft is reported, an alert message is sent out to police teams. “The cameras alert the police about any such vehicle entering the city, enabling them to impound the vehicle at the location itself,” he said. According to traffic police, nearly 60 more ANPR cameras will be installed at all entry points next year. Maqsood Ahmed, the deputy commissioner of police (east), said that they have also set up a stolen vehicle desk (SVD) to track stolen vehicles as well as vehicles used to commit any crime. “We set up the desk three months ago,” he said. Right now the success rate is a mere 5% as the process has just been started, he added. Ahmed said ANPR cameras record the number plates of vehicles that cross a particular stretch which police riders patrol 24x7 in three shifts. The information is stored in a database at the SVD. Police said that as soon as they receive a complaint regarding vehicle theft, they enter the information in the database and set up the surveillance system. Rao said that the SVD first receives an alert and passes the information to the team deployed at the checkpoints and the patrolling police control room vehicles. “A five member-team, led by an assistant commissioner of police and comprising a station house officer and three constables, is deployed to keep track of the stolen vehicle’s movement and pass on relevant information,” he said, adding that the desk is connected to all the 40 police stations across the city. DCP Ahmed said that the teams are connected with each other on a WhatsApp group. “The surveillance and tracking system has successfully helped solve many cases, apart from recovering the stolen vehicles,” he said. Police said they have recovered motorcycles that belonged to persons involved in committing crimes such as snatching, robbery, hit and runs and as well as those who fled after committing murders. Rao said that they did face a few challenges while using the ANPR cameras, such as accuracy, which is only 85%. “We are regularly checking the night visibility issue and trying to upgrade the hardware,” he said. Police said they are rewarding teams that recover stolen vehicles and risk their lives chasing criminals.

The western disturbance is a weather system or winds blowing from the Mediterranean which brings most of the precipitation in Kashmir.“Snow started at Tral and Jawahar Tunnel (in south Kashmir),” said director, meteorological department of J&K and Ladakh, Sonam Lotus in a social media post in the afternoon.In Srinagar, there were light showers during the day as the clouds covered the sky bringing down the day temperatures.Lotus predicted light snowfall (2-3 Inches) in plains and moderate snowfall (5-6 Inches) over higher reaches most likely from Sunday night till Monday night.“Some places of higher reaches may receive up to 1ft of snow,” he said.He said that light to moderate snowfall will be at many places of Kargil and scattered places of Leh district in Ladakh.“Moderate to heavy snow is most likely on Zojila-Minamarg axis,” he said.In Jammu, light to moderate rain was very likely from Sunday night and Monday with light to moderate snowfall over places like Doda-Kistawar, Jawahar Tunnel (Top) and Pirpanjal.The minimum temperatures in Kashmir fell below zero degrees during the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday in all the weather stations of the Valley.The meteorological department said the mercury plunged to lowest in the ski resort of Gulmarg to settle at -7.5°C down from -6.5 °C on the night earlier.The summer capital Srinagar recorded -1.8 °C down from 1.7 °C on Saturday night. Chilai Kalan, Kashmir’s harshest over 40-day winter period started on December 21 with western disturbance hitting the region and bringing light snowfall in Gulmarg, Tangmarg, Gurez and Sonamarg mountainous areas on December 23 – 24. In the mountain resort of Pahalgam in south Kashmir, the mercury plunged to -3.8 °C during the night.

27-12-2021||Chandigarh||Can contest as independents if not registered with ECI: Sanyukt Samaj Morcha||Chandigarh : A day after it came into existence, the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), a political front of 22 farmer unions, on Sunday decided to start the process for registration as a political party with Election Commission of India (ECI). “We have started preparing documents for the registration of the party,” said Prem Singh Bhangu of All India Kisan Federation, a part of 22 organisations. He accepted that registration of parties takes time and further allotment of symbol also involves a procedure, so the SSM doesn’t want to waste time. The 22 organisations that formed the SSM are part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 32 farm bodies that led agitation against now repealed farm laws. The SSM has decided to contest the upcoming Punjab polls on all 117 assembly constituencies ruling out an alliance or merger with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which was in talks with the farm leaders, particularly Babir Singh Rajewal, who has been declared as leader of the SSM. Bhangu said the SSM constituents will hold a meeting to decide a venue for opening of the party’s office. He said even if the SSM is not registered as a political party, the morcha candidates can contest as independents. BKU Dakounda to meet todayBKU (Dakounda), which has a hold in the Malwa belt, particularly Sangrur, Barnala, Mansa and Bathinda districts, is expected to come in support of the SSM but will not take part in the electoral process. Office-bearers of BKU (Dakounda) will hold a meeting in Barnala on Monday to take a final call, but it has clarified that it would not field its candidates in the upcoming polls. “We will not oppose the SSM because we have a strong association with all the farm bodies,” said organisation general secretary Jagmohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/can-contest-as-independents-if-not-registered-with-eci-sanyukt-samaj-morcha-101640547341254.html

Sandoa, who had won the seat by a hefty margin of 23,707 votes in 2017, has been replaced with party spokesperson and RTI activist Dinesh Chadha, according to the fourth list of candidates released by AAP state chief Bhagwant Mann and state convener Jarnail Singh. Sandoa had defected to the ruling Congress days before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections only to return to the AAP fold in December last year. The defection seems to have weighed against him.

The party had won these seats in the 2017 polls, but its MLAs rebelled and jumped ship to the Congress.

27-12-2021||Mumbai||New east-west link bridges threaten mangrove ecology||Mumbai: A series of proposed vehicular bridges in the north-west suburbs, meant to improve connectivity between Andheri, Madh, Borivali and Gorai region, will eat into a mangrove area just over the size of Azad Maidan, show publicly available documents. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) have sought the forest department’s nod as well as coastal regulation zone clearance from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for diverting four mangrove patches totalling 29.6 acres in size. By comparison, the Azad Maidan in south Mumbai measures 27 acres. Of the four mangrove patches, the one in Pahadi Goregaon village, Borivali Taluka measures 11.5 acres, and will be diverted for a BMC-built bridge over the Oshiwara River and Malad creek in three wards – K-West, P-South and P-North. “This missing link will connect the areas of Malad to Lokhandwala, Millat Nagar, Adarsh Nagar, Infinity Mall, Laxmi industrial Estate, Behram Baug. This link is further connected to a proposed bridge on Ramchander Nullah (in Malad); hence can be connected to Malad-Marve road easily,” the BMC said in a submission to the forest department in October this year. The BMC is seeking forest clearance (FC) for the bridge, which is expected to service around 75,000 private vehicles per day. Another patch of mangroves, 12.9 acres in size, is proposed to be diverted by the MMRDA in Gorai village, to connect Gorai area with the mainland at Borivali. The MMRDA’s FC submission says: “There is no direct vehicular connectivity from Mumbai to Gorai creek. A lengthy detour of 28.8km is required if one has to reach here.” This road, the MMRDA explained, will particularly benefit visitors to the Global Vipassana Pagoda in Gorai, which attracts more than 3000 visitors on weekdays and up to 15000 visitors on weekends. “This network will successfully reduce traffic congestion on Link Road, SV Road, and western express highway (WEH), from Andheri, Oshiwara and Malad onwards. They will cut travel time between Oshiwara and Madh by approximately one hour during peak hours,” said an official from the office of the chief engineer (bridges), BMC, who did not wish to be named. The MMRDA said, “Seventy percent of visitors come from Borivali site using the Essel World jetty to reach Pagoda. Visitors have to wait in long queue for about 2 to 3 hours sometime to get in to ferry. Another route is from Bhayandar which is around 40 km distance and time consuming and expensive... To mitigate the above difficulties... MMRDA intends to carry out the detailed study of the construction of proposed Bridge across Borivali Creek and subsequent development of road network connectivity to Global Pagoda. The total length of the proposed bridge will be around 550m approximately and will consist of approximately 5km of approach roads and development of road connectivity to Global Pagoda.” The other two projects for which smaller mangrove parcels are sought to be diverted are about two acres each, and will be used to build “missing links” between Madh and Versova and from Lagoon Road to Infiniti Mall in Malad, in P-North ward. The projects are being undertaken by the BMC as part of a network of six elevated roads in the north-western suburbs, to ease pressure on SV Road, Link Road and the Western Express Highway. Currently, commuters travelling to Madh, Marve, or Malwani from Borivali or Andheri take either the Link Road or SV Road up to Evershine Nagar, and turn onto the Malad-Marve Road. Those travelling to Manori from Borivali have to go via Mira Road-Bhayander and Uttan. The proposed roads will connect the Oshiwara Link Road to the creek in Malad (for which the BMC has sought to divert 11 acres of mangroves), Inorbit mall in Malad to Malwani, Infinity Mall in Malad to Lagoon Road near the Malad-Marve highway and Dharavali road in Madh creek. The other two elevated roads are the links between Madh and Versova, and Marve and Manori, which was first proposed by the BMC over five years ago, but did not take off. Anand Pendharkar, a city-based ecologist and nature educator, expressed concern over the manner in which the mangrove forests continue to be fragmented for development projects. “This is ironic, because mangroves are essential against protecting our buildings, roads and other existing infrastructure. For Mumbai, they are going to be essential in minimising damage from sea level rise and cyclones. Landscape fragmentation will weaken their ability to hold off storm surges. Second, small development projects like these do not ever consider their impact on biodiversity. Even non-food species like mudskippers or fiddler crabs, which are not covered under the Indian Wildlife Act, have a role to play in the environment. The mangrove swamp is an ecosystem and not just trees by themselves.” Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, and petitioner in a Bombay High Court PIL seeking better protection of mangroves across the state, said the extent of forests sought to be diverted for these bridges is worrying. “On the one hand, you have the state government publicising its efforts at bringing mangroves under legal protection, but there are several projects like these for which they are constantly being diverted. The impact of these projects has not been thought through. Take Oshiwara river which already has two bridges across it. More bridges will perforate the swamp and interfere with the flow of tidal water. Compensatory afforestation elsewhere will not make up for local damage,” Stalin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-east-west-link-bridges-threaten-mangrove-ecology-101640546860812.html

In a statement, AAP MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer slammed the state government for this blatant misuse of official power for the party. “Before coming to power in 2017, the Congress promised the moon to people, but after forming the government they brushed off each one of their promises. Instead of providing employment, free plots, etc, they cancelled lakhs of BPL cards of poor families,” he said. Accusing the state government of politicising the government schemes, Hayer said: “If a person does not support the Congress, will he be denied ration? It is like the Congress government has no regard for the poor people of the state.” He warned the Congress that people would not forget such misdeeds and hold them accountable in upcoming elections. Comparing the governance of Channi and Kejriwal, the AAP MLA said that the Delhi government was trying its best to make the lives of common people easy by providing services at their doorsteps, but the Channi government was taking advantage of welfare programmes to suit their political agendas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-slams-govt-for-making-poor-go-to-houses-of-mlas-for-stickers-101640546440445.html

While Rajoana is on death row, the others have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Dal Khalsa leader Kanwar Pal Singh said the Indian laws regarding release of indeterminate sentence prisoners are open to interpretation and prevarication of the executive. The continued detention of nine prisoners not only violates the principle of equality but is also a clear violation of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-bodies-demand-release-of-political-prisoners-101640545964306.html

27-12-2021||Other||HC seeks UP govt’s reply on PIL alleging fraud in pension benefits meant for political prisoners||Prayagraj: The Allahabad High Court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government to file a reply as to how many persons are getting pensions fraudulently by showing themselves to be detained as political prisoners during the period when national emergency was invoked in the Country (June 25, 1975, to March 21, 1977). Besides, the court also directed the government to specify in the reply as to whether these pensioners were the political prisoners and hence, entitled to get pension or were in jail on account of certain other offences committed by them. Hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by one Ashok Kumar Shamsha, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Piyush Agarwal in its order dated December 16, adjourned the hearing of the case and fixed the date for next hearing to April 18, 2022. In the PIL, the petitioner has claimed that many persons are fraudulently receiving Loktantra Senani pension on monthly basis which was actually meant for political prisoners of the emergency era. The contention raised in the petition was that the many persons, who have been made respondents in the PIL, are recorded criminals in the police records, but have been extended the benefit of political pension in spite of the fact that some of them have been convicted for heinous offences. According to the PIL, the benefit of political pension should not be extended to such persons and the same having been given, the authorities are bound to rectify the same and withdraw any such benefit. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that as per its estimate, around 1500 persons are receiving the pension fraudulently. It was contended in the PIL that in Pilibhit district alone, many people have been made entitled to the Loktantra Senani pension, even though they were not jailed as political prisoners during the emergency era and rather, they were sent to jails on allegations of chain snatching and attempt to murder against them. According to PIL, there are about 6000 such Loktantra Senani in Uttar Pradesh, and more than ₹35.35 crore of the government are being spent every month on the pension given to them. Apart from this, such pensioners are also provided with free travel service on roadways buses and free medical facilities in district hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-up-govt-s-reply-on-pil-alleging-fraud-in-pension-benefits-meant-for-political-prisoners-101640545424007.html

It had to be some ‘Ram-bhakt’ regime (referring to BJP) that could have done it,” the chief minister said at a public meeting organised during BJP’s Jan Vishvas Yatra at Manjhanpur in Kaushambi district. “Before 2017, Ram-bhakts got bullets while we (BJP) are constructing temple for them. Earlier, Kanwar yatras were stopped and now we shower flower petals on them. Earlier, due to poor management in Kumbh there used to be stampedes at Prayagraj. Now, when we organise Kumbh, people say ‘bhavya Kumbh-divya Kumbh”. BJP has fulfilled all its promises,” he said.The chief minister also accused the opposition of doing nothing when people faced problems.“Babua’ (Akhilesh Yadav) did nothing else except play on his smartphone while ‘bhai-bahen’ (Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi) were enjoying holidays in Italy and ‘bua’ (BSP chief Mayawati) was nowhere to be seen when the people were facing challenges. It was Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which helped the masses and those who had opposed vaccine at the time were actually against the very welfare of poor and masses,” Yogi said. “Were SP workers seen during pandemic? Some people are attached to the habits of their young days and that is why Akhilesh still plays kids’ game on smart phones and he did nothing for masses during corona outbreak. The BSP and Congress too didn’t do anything,” he said. During the event, the UP CM also inaugurated and laid foundation stones for 99 different development projects worth ₹87 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ayodhya-temple-could-have-come-up-only-during-a-ram-bhakt-regime-yogi-101640545420944.html
27-12-2021||Lucknow||Kanpur police restructure 100-yr-old morning parade||Kanpur: To keep pace with the changing times, the Kanpur police have reshaped the morning parade that the British rulers introduced for the khaki-clad policemen at the police lines 100 years ago. Earlier, policemen in their crisp uniforms with their weapons fell in and marched around, doing foot and weapons drill through the week. Each Friday, the district superintendent of police would oversee how well they moved in formations with their weapons. But now it has been redesigned, as the Kanpur police feel it lacks any tactical gain to meet the challenges of the 21st century policing. “The ceremonial drill the British brought in 100 years back has been restricted to one day (Friday. For the rest of the days, a new course has been designed with experts from Special Protection Group to sharpen the fitness and skills of our men,” said Asim Arun, commissioner of police, Kanpur. More than merely marching around on instructions echoing through the ground, the men and women of all ranks have much more on their hands. “They can choose the course as per their ability. We have soft physical training, hard physical training, Zoomba exercises, yoga, weapons and tactical training and much more to help them prepare better,” he said. “Another session involves 40 minutes of professional training to handle weapons, cameras, drone and other tactical issues that help in their working,” he said. In the past three months since the morning parade system was restructured, much to relief of the leadership, the men and women have started morning trainings on their own. To make the entire mechanism effective, the Kanpur police have formed a district training unit (DTU) having 11 trainers who were sent to SPG and other organization for training. The DTU has the responsibility of holding the morning training, three-day mandatory weapons training and firing sessions. Also, it imparts training with regards to investigations and effective discharge of magisterial powers delegated to the police officers with the advent of the commissionerate system. There is a fortnightly review of the training and the participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kanpur-police-restructure-100-yr-old-morning-parade-101640545060832.html

The patient tested positive for Covid-19 on December 18 when he was kept in isolation at a government facility and his samples were sent for genome sequencing. The results of which came on Sunday.” The district health officials said that the person tested positive for Covid-19 during the repeat RT-PCR testing done on the eighth day after travelling from high-risk countries, which is part of the monitoring process.Meanwhile, with 68 fresh Covid-19 cases, the tally of active cases in Gurugram crossed the 250-mark on Sunday for the first time in the past six months. According to the district health department bulletin, the district on Sunday had a total of 269 active cases.The last time when Gurugram had reported more than 250 active cases was June 19 (276 active cases). The number of new Covid-19 cases in the district has been on the rise since December 20. According to the health bulletin, the district reported 16 fresh cases on December 20, while it saw 23 cases the next day. Similarly, the new cases went up to 48 on December 24, and 59 on December 25, shows the bulletin.

Testing has been increased in the district from 4,000 samples early this week to 5,000 samples now. Over 17,000 international travellers have entered the district in the past one month, of which over 3,500 are from high-risk countries. We are continuously monitoring all suspected cases and 5% of the samples at random of these travellers are being sent for genome sequencing,” said Yadav.

The development comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccination for children in this age bracket will start from January 3.“Last month we had asked all schools in the district to prepare a database for children of different age groups. We have so far learnt that there are around 700,000 children of all age groups. Now, we need to find out how many of them belong to the 15-18 age group.

Dr Himanshu Agarwal, principal consultant for paediatrics division at Max Hospital, Gurugram, said, “Approving the Covid vaccination for children between 15-18 years of age is a welcome step by the government. It is especially important with the current surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. Many parents are not sending their children to schools as they are not vaccinated. This move will enable children to join school and restart their normal lives. Children with comorbidities should be given priority for vaccination.” Results of the third statewide serological survey that was released in October this year had shown that over 69% of children aged 6-17 years in Gurugram district were exposed to Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic.

27-12-2021||Lucknow||Night curfew in Lucknow goes for a toss amid Christmas festivities||Lucknow: Night curfew went for a toss amid Christmas festivities on Saturday, with people crowding public places and restaurants till well past midnight. Hordes of people thronged Hazratganj on Christmas day, with many spending hours in the market after visiting the Cathedral. The entire road from Cathedral to Hazratganj crossing remained crowded till past midnight. Similar scenes were witnessed in several other places across the city. Gomti Nagar and Mahanagar areas that are dotted with restaurants and clubs also entertained guests till past 11 PM. All this occurred while the state recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases and got a third confirmed case of the new variant Omicron. December 25 was also the first day for the implementation of night curbs ordered by the state government amid fear of the spread of the new variant. While business owners supported the restrictions, they expressed inability to refuse customers on Christmas day. “I know that it was the first day of the curbs but it was Christmas, so it was very difficult to refuse the guests. We will follow the curfew strictly from Sunday,” said manager of a popular eatery in Hazratganj on condition of anonymity. Other business owners questioned the effectiveness of night curfew. “We are in the hospitality business that was badly affected ever since Covid-19 broke out. It is the festival time that gives us a brief period of good earnings. Refusing customers at this time will surely affect our business. Also the decision of night curfew seems partial when large political events are being organised in the day time,” remarked the owner of another restaurant in Hazratganj on condition of anonymity. According to sources, the police was limited to maintaining law and order and did little to implement the curfew. No case for violation of curfew was lodged in Lucknow by the police. Meanwhile, police officials have said that the night curfew will be imposed strictly in coming days. “The restrictions imposed as part of the night curfew will be imposed strictly in the city. We have communicated to business owners about the guidelines and sought their support. We also hope to get support from the public to ensure night curfew to ensure safety from the pandemic,” said Lucknow commissioner of police DK Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/night-curfew-in-lucknow-goes-for-a-toss-amid-christmas-festivities-101640543860773.html
27-12-2021||Noida||Noida airport: Land acquisition process for 2nd phase of work to start in Jan||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration will start the land acquisition process for the second phase of the Noida international airport in Jewar from January next year, said officials on Sunday. The move came after the Uttar Pradesh government approved the social impact assessment (SIA) survey report on December 17.The district administration and Gautam Buddha University, which conducted the survey, sent the report to the state government for approval in July this year. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary R K Tiwari reviewed the report on the project’s impact on farmers in the region, before giving his approval for the same on December 17, said officials.Besides starting the process for land acquisition, the state government has asked the district administration to implement important outcomes and recommendations of the survey report to manage the impact of the project on the families of the farmers concerned. “We will start the land acquisition process from January. We will organise camps at six villages on January 7,8 and 10 to take the consent of the farmers, who are likely to be affected by the land acquisition process. The suggestions and objections of those opposing the project will be noted down for suitable remedial action on the same,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate (land acquisition) of Gautam Budh Nagar.Land in six villages -- Karauli Bangar, Dayanatpur, Kureb, Ranhera, Mundhera and Nagla Hukum Singh village -- falling under the project area will be used for works proposed in the second phase, such as setting up the third runway, and a commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft centre. The state government has handed over 1,334 hectares in Jewar to the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) -- a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG, which has been incorporated as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop Jewar airport -- last year. According to the concession agreement, the government has to provide 1,363 hectares to the subsidiary adjacent to the existing airport site for the third runway and further expansion.The state government has rejected the farmers’ demand of keeping Karauli Bangar village out of the project impact area. The villagers said that they will decide their next move in the future. “We will organise a meeting with the farmers, and then decide if we will file a plea in the high court or we will approach the state government for excluding our village from the project area,” said Mukesh Kumar, a farmer from Nagla Hukum Singh village. The SIA survey was conducted on the abadi settlement of the Nagla Hukum Singh village. The state government said the entire 160 hectares of the village will be needed for further expansion of the Jewar airport project.The state government has asked the district administration to identify and finalise the rehabilitation site for the families of the farmers, which will be displaced only after consultation and deliberation with the affected population. Schools, colleges, religious places like temples and mosques, burial and cremation grounds, public health centres, playgrounds, and other basic amenities like water supply, sewerage networks, and electricity connections among other facilities will have to be done in advance before the houses of the families living there are vacated.Two runway pavements are being developed in the first phase, which is to be completed soon, said the officials. The project, which will be completed in four phases, is scheduled to be done by September 29, 2024.
27-12-2021||Delhi||Night curfew in Capital kicks in at 11pm tonight||The Delhi government on Sunday clamped a night curfew beginning Monday that is unlikely to be relaxed before the end of the month, putting in place a ban on non-essential activities including eating out and shopping between 11pm and 5am as the Covid test positivity rate in the city breached 0.5% amid concerns over the Omicron variant.Delhi’s daily Covid-19 cases remained above the 200 mark for the second day on Sunday as the city recorded 290 fresh infections in the last 24 hours, the highest since June 10. A test positivity rate of 0.55% was recorded, the highest since June 4.While a graded response action plan (Grap) released earlier said a night curfew would come into effect if the positivity rate remained above 0.5% for two straight days, officials said the measure was accelerated because of an “emergency situation”.While an official order was not immediately released, people aware of the matter said that during the night curfew, all restaurants, bars, markets and shops dealing in non-essential goods will have to close at 11pm. Only essential movement of individuals will be allowed during the curfew, they said.“All essential services will be permitted. An order specifying the restrictions and exceptions will be issued well in advance,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. The restrictions are set to impact celebrations on New Year’s Eve and January 1, with officials saying that no relaxations will be allowed in the final week of the year.The city’s Covid-19 caseload (the number of patients who are currently infected) also went past the 1,000 mark on Sunday for the first time since early July. According to the state health bulletin, there are 1,103 active cases in Delhi currently.Hotels, bars and restaurants that are permitted to function at 50% capacity will have to wind up before 11pm so that employees are able to reach home before 11pm, the official quoted above said.More restrictions in Delhi are likely to follow after the test positivity rate went past 0.5%, bringing the Capital close to the minimum threshold for stricter restrictions under Grap. According to a previously released plan, the Covid-19 Grap will be activated if the positivity rate remains over 0.5% for two consecutive days.The action plan classifies outbreak severity in four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.Asked why the night curfew was imposed before Grap came into effect, a district official said “an emergency situation demands emergency measures”.“Despite awareness and extensive enforcement exercises, it has been observed that people are violating the Covid protocols, especially those out for festivities ahead of New Year’s celebrations. It is not possible to deploy police officers and enforcement teams in all the corners of the city. People must become aware and responsible,” the official said, asking not to be named.Sunday’s case spike in Delhi was the highest since June 10, when the Capital added 305 infections. The positivity rate (the percentage of test samples that return positive) breached the 0.5% mark for the first time since June 6, and is now at its highest level since June 4, according to state government data.The city’s Covid-19 graph has been inching upwards since mid-December, with cases and the test positivity both showing an increase. The state government has already imposed curbs on public gatherings during Christmas and the New Year. Delhi has added 165 Covid-19 cases every day on average over the past week, more than double the 68 infections it added in the week ending December 19.To be sure, the infections and test positivity statistics are still far lower than what they have been in Delhi during its four major Covid-19 surges (between early May and June 2020, September 2020, October-November 2020 and April-May this year). Most hospital beds reserved to treat Covid-19 patients are not occupied currently. Of the nearly 13,500 general Covid-19 beds in the city, 262 are currently occupied, showed the Delhi government’s dashboard.A host of public transport-related curbs will come into effect once “yellow alert” is declared under Grap. The capacity of the Delhi Metro will be limited to 50% of a coach’s seating capacity and standing passengers will be barred. Only two passengers will be allowed in taxis, autos, and rickshaws.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said: “This is a good step and will help to curb the spread of the infection. During the cold season, most of gatherings are indoors, where the virus is more likely to spread. The government should be also thinking about reducing seating capacity in eating places, buses, Metro, theatres, and odd and evening numbers of shops to open.”Sanjeev Nagpal, a restaurateur, said that many people with pre-booked tables for December 31 have already started cancelling the bookings.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the restaurants will have to close by 10.30pm so that the staff are home before the night curfew. “It will reduce restaurants’ operational hours by nearly 2.5 hours. Earlier, restaurants operated till 1am.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/night-curfew-in-capital-kicks-in-at-11pm-tonight-101640541819467.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||One dead, 2 others injured after car hits divider, overturns in south Delhi||A 36-year-old man died and two others were critically injured after the car they were travelling in hit a road divider and turned turtle near the Mahipalpur flyover in south Delhi on Sunday morning.Police said they are yet to ascertain the exact reason for the accident which took place at around 7.30am on the carriageway towards Delhi from Gurugram, causing a brief traffic jam on the road as many motorists stopped to examine the crash, with some of them helping the police teams rescue the three occupants who were trapped under the overturned Skoda car.“We are probing if there was low visibility on the road because of the morning fog, or if any mechanical fault in the car was the reason behind the accident,” said an officer who did not want to be named.The officer added that the damages to the car as well as the iron railing of the central verge of the road suggested that the vehicle was being driven at a high speed when the accident took place.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said that the Vasant Kunj South police station received a call at 7.40am regarding the road accident, following which a police team reached the spot. The police personnel rescued three injured men from the damaged Skoda car and rushed them to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where one of them was declared brought dead.“The deceased was identified by his first name Ankit. The injured men were identified as Rajkumar and Aditya, both aged 35. All of them were from Rohtak,” said DCP Sharma.Police said that the car belongs to Rajkumar but they were not sure who was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.Ankit worked in a private company and lived in a rented accommodation in Gurugram. He was going to his hometown with his friends when the accident took place, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-dead-2-others-injured-after-car-hits-divider-overturns-in-south-delhi-101640540502382.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt school students bag seed money for start-up ideas||Two teams of Delhi government school students bagged seed funding after pitching their ideas -- a low-cost gas leakage alarm and fabrics using ‘tie and dye’ technique -- at the Business Blasters TV programme episode that aired on Sunday. The groups won seed funds of ₹80,000 and ₹60,000 for their ideas, respectively.The Business Blasters TV programme provides a launchpad for students’ business ideas. The judges for the fifth episode were deputy CM Manish Sisodia and businesspersons Ravi Gupta and Divya Gupta.A government spokesperson said that a team of nine students came up with the gas leak alarm which they claimed can be sold for only ₹700, as against the ones in market which cost around ₹1,500-8,000 currently.“As a team, we wanted to be someone who could help the community and come up with the most cost effective alarm. We are currently lined up with 40 orders and are working on the alarm’s version 2.0,” said Aman, the team head. The team bagged a combined investment of ₹80,000 from the two investor judges on the show.Another group of five female students proposed setting up a business of high-quality fabrics using the “tie and dye” technique, and received seed funding of ₹60,000 from the judges who also promised them a space for their unit.Several other ideas were also presented at the event, including an automatic LED lamp by a group of seven students.A government official said that the programme has been designed to provide government school students an experience to work in teams, identify social challenges or business opportunities and prepare business plans to implement their ideas in their neighbourhoods. “All participating students can receive seed money of ₹2,000 per student. The teams will use this seed money with a clear objective to either earn profit or create social impact,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-school-students-bag-seed-money-for-start-up-ideas-101640540380221.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Light rain in parts of Delhi, brace for drop in mercury this week||Parts of Delhi recorded a drizzle on Sunday evening, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting similar rain activity on Monday and Tuesday due to an active western disturbance currently influencing the region.Between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm, Safdarjung recorded 1.4mm of rainfall, while Palam received 0.2mm of rain. The Capital recorded a maximum temperature of 21.4°C, one degree above normal, and the minimum was 9.8°C, two notches above normal, on Sunday.Met officials said the minimum temperature in Delhi will start dipping from December 29 and reach around 5-6°C by New Year’s.Moderate fog is also expected to occur in the region with visibility dropping below 500 metres in the early hours of the day in the last week of December, from Monday.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said light rain was forecast to occur in parts of Delhi on Sunday night and in the early hours of Monday, with a similar spell expected on Tuesday too. “Delhi will receive a little rain, and there will be snowfall in the higher reaches (of north India). Following this spell, minimum temperature will once again start dipping and touch 5-6°C by January 1,” he said.The maximum is also expected to drop below the 20-degrees mark by December 29, owing to overcast conditions during the day in this period.Jenamani said the possibility of dense fog in Delhi is low, but shallow to moderate fog is expected from December 27 onwards. “As more moisture gets introduced, visibility will again start dropping. However, we are unlikely to see it drop below 200 metres,” he said.Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) has predicted that the rain spell will improve the air quality from December 29.Parts of Delhi recorded cold wave conditions between December 19 and 21, with mercury dropping up to 3.2°C at Safdarjung. Temperatures have since risen in Delhi owing to three successive western disturbances.While the first western disturbance impacted Delhi on December 22, a second one influenced the region on December 24 and 25. The third spell is predicted to be the strongest, bringing rain in parts of northern India, and expected to bring snowfall in the mountains.IMD’s forecast for Monday shows shallow to moderate fog, with the maximum and minimum hovering between 10°C and 22°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-in-parts-of-delhi-brace-for-drop-in-mercury-this-week-101640540200214.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man pose as magistrate to escape fine for wrong side driving, held||A 35-year-old man was arrested for allegedly impersonating a judicial officer and intimidating police personnel after they stopped his car for violating traffic rules, at Rani Jhansi Road in central Delhi on Saturday, senior police officers said.Police said they recovered a pistol with six cartridges, a fake identity card of a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) prosecutor, another fake ID similar to the one issued by Bar Council of India, fake shield, medals, and a visiting card of a chief judicial magistrate (CJM), allegedly from the possession of the alleged impersonator. Police said he also used a red beacon on top of his vehicle, in contravention of a 2017 ban.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said that around 7.30pm on Saturday, personnel were checking for traffic violations at Rani Jhansi Road when they spotted a blue Renault car coming from the wrong side. “The car was stopped and the person driving it was asked to produce his driving licence. The man started arguing with the police personnel after introducing himself as Lavleesh Sharma, and claiming that he was a CJM in Gurugram,” said the DCP.“When he was asked to produce his ID card, the man began threatening the police staff, who informed the local Paharganj police station about the matter. A sub-inspector reached there and searched the car as well as Sharma. An illegal pistol with six bullets was found along with many fake IDs and documents. After verification, Sharma turned out to be an impersonator and was arrested in a case of forgery, impersonation, possessing illegal firearms, and obstructing police personnel from performing their duties,” said DCP Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-pose-as-magistrate-to-escape-fine-for-wrong-side-driving-held-101640540020445.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt postpones shows on Ambedkar’s life as Covid cases rise||In the wake of an increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city, Delhi government has decided to postpone the series of plays on the life of Dr BR Ambedkar, which were scheduled to start from January 5 next year at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium in Delhi. The state government is yet to announce fresh dates for the musicals, which were to star actor Rohit Roy in the role of Ambedkar. “Delhi government had planned a grand show on the life of Babasaheb Ambedkar from 5th January, in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. However, this show is being postponed in light of rising Covid cases. We shall announce a new date as soon as the situation improves,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s art,culture and tourism minister, earlier announced that the free show will begin on January 5, will be staged around 50 times throughout next month, and will feature renowned artistes.Delhi on Sunday recorded 290 cases of Covid-19, the city’s biggest single-day case spike since June 10. The new infections also came at a positivity rate of 0.55%, the state government’s daily health bulletin showed.AAP has maintained that the show should not be seen from a political prism. “This (the play) is not politics. It is not a political stunt. This is purely deshbhakti (patriotism). We had announced this plan during the beginning of this year itself, in my budget speech to be precise, because we are celebrating 75 years of Independence. It is part of the larger celebrations that are being held in Delhi under that itself,” Sisodia had told HT in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-postpones-shows-on-ambedkar-s-life-as-covid-cases-rise-101640539907222.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Worst December air spell holds Delhi in vice grip||Air quality in Delhi remained severe on Sunday for the sixth consecutive day, the longest spell of such bad air since 2015, when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started maintaining detailed records.Delhi recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 459 on Sunday, the worst since November 12, when the index had a reading of 471. Prolonged exposure to such air affects healthy people, and seriously impacts those with existing health conditions, according to the pollution watchdog.Delhi’s average AQI this December so far is 344, higher than December 2020 (331) and 2019 (337). It was only worse in 2018 (360) and 2016 (364), the data show.As a thick haze hung over the city, local sources of pollution, mostly open burning of biomass amid dipping temperature, and meteorological factors such as calm winds have led to higher concentration of pollutants close to the surface, experts said.“It is time to weigh in emergency measures again if there is no improvement by Monday,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, an advocacy group. “This is certainly the longest episodic smog event in December for Delhi.”Emergency restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), such as a ban on construction and demolition, and stopping the entry of trucks into Delhi, were lifted on 20 December by the Commission for Air Quality Management on an improvement in air quality. However, air quality slipped to the severe zone ever since. A meeting on Grap was held on 23 December, but emergency measures were not reimposed.There might be some relief as parts of Delhi received light rain on Sunday evening. There could be light rain on Monday and Tuesday as well, the India Meteorological Department has predicted.Delhi’s average PM 2.5 levels were in the emergency or severe plus range – 334 micrograms per cubic metre – for 18 hours, CPCB’s control room data showed at 5pm on Sunday. The safe limit is 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The concentration of PM2.5 has to stay above a threshold of 300 micrograms per cubic metre for 48 hours for restrictions such as ban on construction and entry of trucks to kick in, according to Grap guidelines.Unlike the bad air in November, burning of farm residue was not in play, and the pollution was from local sources, Roy Chowdhury said. “This shows background emissions are still high and, if meteorological conditions become adverse, we see severe air quality, particularly when wind speeds drop. This calls for stricter enforcement,” she said.The western disturbance on 22 December led to a negative pressure zone around the region, with pollutants unable to disperse, said Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory.“Air is not flowing from Delhi towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain after this western disturbance created a negative pressure,” Saha said. “Wind speeds have dropped and local pollution is accumulating in Delhi.”It was unusual to see such a long polluted spell in December, and local factors required greater scrutiny, said Gufran Beig, project director of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, a government forecasting body.“The moisture content at the moment is also not too high, and we are not recording dense fog, so such a spike in pollution is surprising,” Beig said. “Relief from rain is not expected immediately and, as per our forecast, air quality could remain in severe for the next 48 hours.”The AQI could return to the very poor category by Monday if Delhi receives enough rain, a forecast by the Early Warning System for Delhi showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/worst-december-air-spell-holds-delhi-in-vice-grip-101640539419358.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||AAP blames BJP-ruled MCDs for stray cattle on Delhi roads||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations for non-payment of dues to gaushalas and deaths of stray cattle after feeding on plastic bags and garbage in the city. Civic authorities, however, said that maintaining and opening gaushalas fall under the purview of the Delhi government.AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Sunday said that municipal corporations are responsible for catching stray cattle roaming around in the city and relocating them to gaushalas. “A nexus operates in the city under which illegal dairies milk these cows and then leave them to roam around on the streets to feed on garbage. Why are these cows not being taken care of in gaushalas?” Bharadwaj asked.Bharadwaj alleged that the BJP-led corporations are yet to pay long standing dues to the official gaushalas. “The official gaushalas are supposed to get ₹40 per cow per day for arranging fodder, out of which ₹20 is provided by the Delhi government and ₹20 is required to be submitted by MCDs, but the corporations are not making timely payments,” he claimed.The AAP spokesperson further said that the North MCD has not paid gaushalas for several years, claiming that it has an outstanding dues of ₹32 crore. “Similarly, SDMC has not made payments since February 2021 and EDMC has not made payments over the last three years,” he alleged.Bharadwaj said that it is a matter of shame that cows are dying while feeding on garbage and polythene bags “that choke their intestines”.Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that the maintenance of gaushalas is the primary responsibility of Delhi government’s animal husbandry department. “It has become AAP’s daily habit to level baseless allegations against us. Maintenance of gaushalas comes under the Delhi government. Our role is restricted to catch stray cattle, keep them in Timarpur cattle pound and shift them to respective gaushala licensed by the Delhi government,” Jain said.He added that the gaushalas in Delhi are already full and there is hardly any space to send more animals. “We had written a letter to the Delhi government last year to allocate more space to gaushalas and open more units, but no action has been taken,” he added.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that AAP functionaries are levelling baseless allegations to divert the attention of public from “real issues” like increasing air pollution, lack of healthcare facilities, depleting DTC bus service and excise policy. “When he is unable to find any new topics, Bharadwaj starts talking on the same issue two-three times in a week. They have claimed that dairies in urban villages are illegal. People of Greater Kailash area would also want to know if dozens on dairies operating in areas like Chirag Dilli, Shahpur Jat and Zamrudpur are illegal? What has Bharadwaj done to get these dairies closed in the last eight years?” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-blames-bjp-ruled-mcds-for-stray-cattle-on-delhi-roads-101640539300247.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: North MCD ropes in private consultant to improve Swachh ranking||After consistently faring among the poorest performers in the country in the annual Swachh Survekshan rankings, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to hire private consultants to improve its performance in 2022, for which the annual survey is expected to be carried out in January-February.In the 2021 Swachh Survekshan list, North MCD ranked 45 among the 48 local bodies in the country with over one million population.A senior North MCD official overseeing the preparations for the next survey said that an urban environment management company, ICUC, is helping the civic body to carry out environment assessment, identify focus areas and help in training supervisory staff to help improve the performance under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). “The initial engagement of the company will be around six months, during which the next round of Survekshan and ODF (open defecation free) plus survey is to be carried out. They are helping us to identify our weak areas... WhatsApp groups have been set up to coordinate the activities of the department of environment managementservice (DEMS) with the consultant,” the official remarked.A consultant deputed at the municipal headquarters said each coordinating team comprises of an IEC (Information Education and Communication) expert to help with activities to enable behavioural changes, a solid waste management expert, a service level progress monitor and a technical head. “Discussions on the action plan are being held at the zonal level... A 13-point action-plan has been formulated and the last meeting was held in Narela zone on Thursday,” the consultant said.The North MCD comprises of six zones -- Rohini, Civil Lines, Keshavpuram, City-Sadar Paharganj, Narela and Karol Bagh.According to the report on the action plan, the immediate focus areas identified by the corporation include bulk waste generators, GPS in waste-lifting vehicles, anti-single-use plastic drives, waste reuse initiatives and weekly reporting of works carried out at ward level.Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that north corporation will initiate focused drives to improve performance in the next edition of survey, adding that changes are being made at the zonal level with the help of concessionaires.Among Delhi’s local bodies, the North MCD was assessed to be the worst performing corporation in the last survey.The North MCD covers the highest geographical area (604.5 sq km) and has a population of over 6.25 million people, as per 2011 Census. The corporation oversees sanitation work in 25 rural villages, 114 urban villages, 524 authorised colonies, 108 unauthorised-regularised colonies, 25 resettlement colonies and 419 unauthorised colonies. The civic body ranked 43 in the 2020 national survey.The Union urban affairs ministry’s cleanliness survey was carried out in January and March last year, and the performances judged on parameters such as the segregation and collection of waste, processing and disposal of garbage, sustainable sanitation, citizen’s feedback and innovation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-north-mcd-ropes-in-private-consultant-to-improve-swachh-ranking-101640539240321.html
27-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Experts call for steps to sustain wildlife at Asola Bhatti sanctuary||With a striped hyena being caught on camera traps earlier this month at the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, on the southern Delhi Ridge, along with multiple sightings of three leopards, the natural park not only has top predators and scavengers, but a variety of herbivores, largely fulfilling a complete foodchain and ecosystem.The next step, experts say, will be to initiate measures at the 6,874-acre sanctuary, to ensure that the wildlife is protected and sustained.Senior officials of Delhi’s forest department said ever since the imposition of the first Covid-19 lockdown last year, several new species of animals and birds were spotted at the Asola sanctuary. An ongoing census at the sanctuary to count all mammals has not only revealed the presence of at least three leopards, but also captured a striped hyena roaming the sanctuary. The census has recorded a total of 17 different mammal species so far.Sohail Madan, centre manager, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) at Asola, who are conducting the census, said ever since the count began in March 2021, initial trends indicate a definite increase in the population of mongoose, golden jackal and civet cat in the sanctuary. Porcupines also showed a ‘healthy’ count. The census is expected to be completed by 2023, Madan said.“There are more than two leopards at least, with camera traps capturing different leopard images. On December 3, we captured a striped hyena, evidence of which was last seen only in 2018 inside the sanctuary. So far, we can say there is an increase in the mongoose, jackal and civet numbers,” said Madan, adding 22 camera traps were being used for the census.According to him, the next step in preserving the rich diversity and prey base for different animals is to carry out enrichment plantation and canopy plugs for herbivores, while bio-dams and check-dams at regular gaps to ensure there is an adequate water supply.“If there are enough watering holes and sufficient food, we can then expect more animals to thrive in the existing area and more breeding will also take place. For the herbivores, we are carrying out enrichment plantation, growing native trees and shrubs which will provide an adequate ecosystem to these herbivores,” he said.Among the other animals sighted as part of the census include jungle cats, hog deer, Indian hare, nilgai, black buck and spotted deer, each captured on camera traps.“The signs of increased sightings of animal, especially a top predator such as the leopard, are a promising sign for the ecology of a region. This is an indicator that the ecosystem is complete and fully functional. Once we have completed our wildlife census, we will be able to give a better picture of where we stand,” said a senior forest official.Like Madan, the official also attributed this increased number in wildlife to several of the department’s conservation programmes to improve the availability of water, improve flora in the area and also limiting trespassing by locals into the forest land.Environment and wildlife experts, however, warn that government should not be content with mere sightings of newer species in the sanctuary, and added that the real test will be to sustain these animals in an urban setup like Delhi.“There is ample proof to suggest that high movement of people and vehicles in a forest, especially during the night, impacts the movement and foraging patterns of animals. Many animals move after dark, and if they sense the presence of humans, they tend to avoid their regular routes and eventually move away from the area altogether,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of wildlife protection NGO, Wildlife SOS. He said the forest department should make concerted attempts to limit the movement of people from neighbouring localities, such as Sangam Vihar and Tughlakabad.In 2016, a male leopard was spotted in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park in north Delhi, who was said to have been staying in the park for days before the authorities decided to move it to the Rajaji National Park for the safety of the people living around the area.Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, who spotted the leopard, says proper monitoring of the sanctuary and getting skilled forest teams will help the city maintain such green spaces for wildlife without causing any safety issues for either the animals or the residents of the area.“When we spotted the leopard at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, our foremost focus was to ensure that there was round the clock monitoring of the animal. Leopards tend to exist close to human habitation and survive on whatever is available, from a rat to even chicken waste, without causing any harm. We need proper monitoring mechanisms and skilled teams in these parks,” he said.CR Babu, from the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, said the Nairobi National Park is a perfect example of how humans and wildlife can coexist peacefully if authorities take proper measures.“The Nairobi National Park is located very close to their airport. At any given time of the day, you can see vehicles passing close to the sanctuary. What works there is that they have built 12-foot tall boundary walls that keep the animals protected and also prevents humans from getting in. Such innovative measures need to be adopted,” Babu said.A senior official of the wildlife division of the union environment ministry said several aspects need to be taken into account while maintaining a wildlife sanctuary in a city. The primary consideration is the safety of humans residing around these areas, and that of the animals.“Even in states with high forest cover, where locals are fairly aware and used to encounters with wild animals, we find a great discord and instances of deaths of animals and humans. In an urban area, these challenges would multiply. There is no doubt that we can develop a successful sanctuary for animals in Delhi, but before that we need to develop safe wildlife corridors for the movement of animals, buffer zones around the sanctuary where even if the animal moves out of the main forest, they do not come into direct contact with humans. A strong anti-poaching policy is also important,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiexperts-call-for-steps-to-sustain-wildlife-at-asola-bhatti-sanctuary-101640538940943.html
