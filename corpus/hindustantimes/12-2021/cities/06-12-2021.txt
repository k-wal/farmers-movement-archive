Work of ₹10 lakh was completed and Shaikh returned ₹5 lakh through irregular payments. But Bulargi was asking for the final payment of ₹2.5 lakh which Shaikh was avoiding. Their dispute started when they both lived in Janata Vasahat,” added Kalaskar.

During the protests, they also shouted slogans against the state government saying “either supply fertilisers or else quit UP”. UP Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu had given the call for the protest, said a UPCC spokesperson in a statement.“Today (Monday), the Congress cadre protested at tehsils and blocks in all the districts (of the state). If this government can’t give fertiliser to farmers, it should quit. Today farmers have been standing in long queues to get fertiliser. Still, they are not getting it. Consequently, the farmers are forced to buy fertiliser from the black market where its price is manifold. Already, the farmers are distressed over the risen prices of diesel,” the statement quoted UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu as saying. “The Yogi government which came to power in 2017 with a promise to double farmers’ income should now tell that how the agriculture input costs increased four-fold since then. Who is responsible for this? So, the reality is that the income did not increase but the input costs certainly increased,” Lallu said as per the statement issued.The statement further said the BJP government had issued a “jumla” (rhetoric) that it will double farmers’ income. On the contrary, the farmers were facing scarcity of fertilisers, it said. As per the statement, the UP government was trying to paint a rosy picture of itself through giant advertisements but the truth was that the farmers were distressed over fertilisers—a basic requirement for farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-protests-across-up-over-fertiliser-for-farmers-101638814009186.html

We set up health camps and provided all sanitation facilities around the Bhoomi. Many marshals were also deployed to ensure that people wore masks and followed rules.”The followers who visited Chaitya Bhoomi on Monday said that a majority of them reached Dadar by Sunday evening and had to spend the night at the Shivaji Park ground. Some of them even staged a protest at Shivaji Park, condemning the BMC for the lack of amenities at the memorial. As the day progressed on Monday, more people started showing up carrying blue flags and pictures of Dr Ambedkar.Raju Sonar, who travelled to Dadar from Palghar along with five other followers said, “We thought that there will be very few people this year and that we might be sent back. However, there were thousands of people like us who came to pay respect to Babasaheb.”Later in the day on Monday, a group of volunteers from the All India Panther Sena (AIPS), created ruckus outside Chaitya Bhoomi. They raised slogans and blamed the civic authorities for mismanagement and overcrowding outside the ground. Saurav Sarode, district president of the AIPS, said, “People from different parts of the country come here to pay homage. Every year, the administration used to provide all basic facilities but since last year, everything has stopped. This is really insensitive on their part as people come from faraway places like Karnataka and are not allowed to enter the memorial while VIPs are allowed inside.” However, civic officials rubbished all such claims and said that there were enough facilities available and more mobile toilets were set up in the afternoon.Meanwhile, dalit leader and great-grandson of Dr B R Ambedkar, Prakash Ambedkar, maintained that Monday’s event was observed peacefully throughout the state. He said that he had already appealed to people not to travel in large numbers for their own safety. He slammed the AIPS protest as a political gimmick. “The BMC elections are round-the-corner and the members of the outfit created such a nuisance simply to garner attention,” he said.On Monday morning, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, along with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, MP Rahul Shewale, and state minister Sanjay Bansode visited the Chaitya Bhoomi along with municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nearly-95k-devotees-throng-chaitya-bhoomi-despite-omicron-scare-101638813649330.html

06-12-2021||Lucknow||Some parties recalling Babasaheb’s contribution for vested interests: Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday said the weaker sections of the society will be empowered and their rights in the Constitution protected with the change of power at the Centre and in the state. Addressing a press conference at her party’s state unit office after paying tribute to Dr BR Ambedkar (1891-1956) on his 65th death anniversary, she said, “Babasaheb Ambedkar had called upon the suppressed community to get united to capture political power for their emancipation and upliftment. Those against the ideals of Ambedkar are in power today. Rather than taking to the street, the BSP believes in changing power at the Centre and in the state.” “The four BSP governments (1995, 1997, 2002 and 2007) in Uttar Pradesh had launched several schemes for the welfare and empowerment of weaker sections. The BSP government launched several schemes and projects in the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar. The rival political parties are unable to digest the honour that was given to Ambedkar under the BSP regime,” she said.“Dr Ambedkar devoted his life to and struggled for the empowerment of the weaker sections. He also ensured that the legal rights of the weaker sections were protected in the Constitution. Due to the casteist government at the Centre and in the state, the weaker sections are not able to get the benefits of their legal rights,” the BSP chief added. “There are some political parties and organisations in the country that had opposed the humanitarian thoughts of Dr Ambedkar. When in power, these parties ignored Ambedkar but to serve their vested political interests these parties are recalling contribution of Babasaheb Ambedkar these days,” she alleged. “The BSP has worked according to the ideals of Dr Ambedkar to create awareness among the suppressed communities and to free them from slave mentality. The movement launched by the BSP for the self-respect and empowerment of the weaker sections is continuing across the country. This movement will neither stop nor bow down to any political power,” the former UP chief minister said. “The people have full faith in the leadership of the BSP. Some people and organisations are trying to divide the votes of Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes to serve their interests. They are trying to weaken the movement launched by the BSP for the empowerment of the weaker sections but people will reject them in the election. The BSP has full faith in its cadre. They will fight the ploy of the rivals to pave way for the formation of the BSP government. The BSP will also do well in Uttarakhand where it is contesting election on its own. It will form government in Punjab where it is contesting assembly election in alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD),” she claimed. Slamming the Samajwadi Party (SP), the BSP chief said, “The SP has not secured victory in the assembly election yet but it has launched Vijay Rath Yatra. An SP MLA beat up a police officer at Chandauli. Under the SP rule, the goonda and mafia elements ruled the roost. The people can see that leaders of SP are taking law into their hand. There was complete lawlessness under the SP rule whereas rule of law prevailed in UP under the BSP government.” “Under the BJP government, atrocities are being inflicted on the weaker sections but it is not being reported in the media,” she alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/some-parties-recalling-babasaheb-s-contribution-for-vested-interests-mayawati-101638812689496.html

Over 67% cases were reported in five districts. Fatehabad is at the top with 1,479 incidents of farm fires, followed by 1,163 in Kaithal, 956 in Karnal, 551 in Sirsa, and 538 in Kurukshetra.However, officials of the state agriculture department are of the view that the actual number of farm fires was lesser than the incidents reported in the satellite monitoring data as several incidents reported by the HARSAC could not be traced during physical verification on the ground.Karam Chand, deputy director agriculture (Kaithal) said of 1,163 incidents of farm fires traced by the HARSAC, only 636 could be verified during the physical verification.He said they have taken action against the erring farmers as eight FIRs have been registered and a fine of ₹15.90 lakh has been imposed on the erring farmers.Similarly, DDA Kurukshetra Pradeep Meel said 405 incidents of stubble burning were reported in district during this season and a fine of ₹9 lakh has been charged from 341 farmers.Officials said next year they need to increase focus on four to five districts where maximum cases were reported.Director general Haryana agriculture and farmers welfare department Hardeep Singh told HT that number of stubble burning cases had come down due to efforts of the government and subsidised machines provided to the farmers.“But the challenge for the department and the government is to bring the number of stubble burning to zero and there is need to make the crop waste useful and profitable for the farmers,” he added.S Narayanan, member secretary Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “This is an achievement and the result of the efforts of multiple departments and farmers.”He said, “The government has been trying sincerely to prevent crop residue burning and focusing on both in-situ and ex-situ methods for management of crop waste.”On how zero stubble burning can be achieved, he said, “With introduction of more projects for ex-situ use of straw, we are hopeful to achieve significant success in the coming years.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath will jointly make the grand temple at Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi a reality, but at the appropriate time,” said the minister in a statement on Monday.He said the grand temple of Ramlalla in Ayodhya was becoming a reality only after due compliance of law and procedure. “Similarly, an apt opportunity would surface for the creation of grand temple of Lord Sri Krishna at the janmabhoomi site in Mathura,” said Chaudhary.“We claim to be descendents of Lord Krishna and thus want a grand temple of Sri Krishna at the Janmabhoomi site in Mathura. Those who are against such temple should say so and get their DNA tested to prove that they are actually descendents of Sri Krishna,” Chaudhary told HT on phone.“Keshav Prasad Maurya is a senior leader of our party and his statement in favour of a temple of Lord Sri Krishna at janmabhoomi site in Mathura is totally justified,” added the cabinet minister.“I hope the temple at Sri Krishna janmabhoomi site will be more magnificent than the one coming up at Ayodhya,” he added.

06-12-2021||Lucknow||Authorities demand enhanced security at shelter homes in Prayagraj||Security at the children shelters, including girl shelter homes, in Prayagraj, will be beefed up following recent incidents of inmates escaping from its premises. Shelter home authorities have written a letter to SSP making a formal request in this regard. The shelters come under Women and Child Development and house minor girls and boys. In the last four months, at least six inmates, including girls, have escaped due to negligence in security at the premises. Among those who fled, only one has been traced, while the rest are still at large. Some of the inmates escaped from the hospital while undergoing treatment. Others managed to escape from the shelter homes. In a few cases, negligence and even involvement of the staff have surfaced, which is under investigation. In one of the incidents, a teenage girl was handed over to her father but she escaped while on her way home. Shelter home authorities, including superintendents, wrote a letter to concerned officials, following which police officials have been asked to enhance security. In between August and November, many inmates have fled from the shelter homes. Two boys escaped from child shelter at Rajruppur and have remained untraced despite efforts made by police. Negligence of the shelter staff was found in the incident. Two girls managed to escape from a woman shelter at Civil Lines and are still at large. In another incident, two teenage boys fled from a child shelter at the Baluaghat locality. Meanwhile, a young girl of the state girl shelter at Khuldabad was admitted to Dufferin Hospital after she fell ill. Two home guards were deployed for her security, but the girl managed to escape. District probationary officer Pankaj Mishra said steps have been taken in this direction, and a letter has been written to SSP for increasing security at the shelter homes. While no mobiles are allowed inside shelters, many inmates have been caught using them. In one of the incidents, Khuldabad police arrested a youth for presenting fake educational documents to secure the release of a minor girl. However, the girl, who was still at the shelter called the police and said that she was responsible for making the fake documents and demanded the police to record her statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/authorities-demand-enhanced-security-at-shelter-homes-in-prayagraj-101638811609095.html

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||OP Chautala rules out reconciliation with grandson Dushyant||Hopes of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala of a reconciliation with his estranged grandfather and former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala were dashed on Monday. Dushyant’s gesture of bowing before his grandfather at a wedding event in Gurugram on Sunday, seeking his blessings seems to have cut no ice with the patriarch.The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief on Monday responded strongly to the overtures made by Dushyant and his father Ajay Singh for reuniting the Chautala family by stating that they were “traitors” and no agreement can be reached with them.The former chief minister, in a statement, said Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which was formed on the foundation of falsehoods, is on a speedy decline. “The office bearers and workers of the party are scampering. Such overtures are being made to stem the desertions,’’ Chautala said.The JJP, which is an offshoot of the INLD, was formed by OP Chautala’s elder son Ajay Singh and grandsons, Dushyant and Digvijay, after a split in the party in 2018.The INLD chief said these people (Dushyant and family) conspired to harm the INLD. “Post-assembly elections, they joined hands with a party (the BJP) against whom they sought votes in the 2019 polls. This showed how power hungry they are,’’ Chautala said.“I have never compromised on my principles, be it in my personal or political life. Those indulging in indiscipline and anti-party activities will not be tolerated at all. People of Haryana will also not forgive them (the JJP) for their high-handed approach during the farmers’ agitation,’’ Chautala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-chautala-rules-out-reconciliation-with-grandson-dushyant-101638811136359.html

Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash was the chief guest. He honoured the widows as a mark of respect and gratitude. Brig Ravi Kapoor, group commander, NCC group headquarters, and Col Sumeet Puri, commanding officer of 63 UP NCC Battalion, were also present.The NCC cadets of 63 UP NCC Battalion gave a guard of honour to pay homage and tribute to the 1971 war heroes. Three widows of the soldiers, who died in the 1971 war and residing in Lucknow, namely — Manju Mishra, wife of craftsman Pashupati Narayan Mishra, Chandra Devi wife of Naik Raja Singh and Lila Devi wife of Sowar Jit Singh — were felicitated and presented with a shawl and gifts.The event was organised and conducted by the cadets of 63 UP NCC Battalion and who also took part in a cultural programme, which included dance, skit and a song.Brigadier Ravi Kapoor motivated the young cadets and explained the importance and the duties of being a soldier. “The 1971 war was unique as it was the first war where all three forces of the nation— army, navy and the air force— fought together for a swift and spectacular victory in a short span of 13 days,” said Col PP Kishore.He added that a total of 93,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered on December 16, 1971, and the war resulted in the birth of a powerful India, which wouldn’t have been possible without the support of the soldiers who gave supreme sacrifice and their brave family members.“The sacrifices of the families of the soldiers help in winning wars and ensure the safety of the nation. The widows of soldiers carry on with their lives with strength have my utmost respect,” said Captain (Dr) Kiran Lata Dangwal. All three war widows lighted the lamp along with other guests as a tribute to the soldiers.Widows recall their spouses’ sacrifice In an informal talk with the scribe after the event, the war widows recalled the moment when they lost their spouses. “I was informed about the demise of my husband through a letter as there was no technology in 1971,” said Lila Devi, wife of Sawar Jit Singh.“I receive a pension of ₹12,000 from the government.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s PLPA amendment: Cong MLA Kiran Choudhry asks CM to withdraw affidavit filed in SC||Former Haryana forests minister Kiran Choudhry has asked chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to withdraw the “contentious” affidavit filed in the Supreme Court whereby the state government has contended that about 39.35% of total geographical spread of the state notified under Section 3 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) will have to be reckoned as forest as per the SC order in the Kant Enclave case.Citing a letter written to the CM on December 2, the Congress MLA from Tosham, at a press briefing on Monday said, the contention taken by the state government in the affidavit is an attempt to misconstrue the SC order by a cleverly crafted misrepresentation of the order in order to obfuscate the real issues.She said the categorical stance taken by the state government in its earlier affidavits before the SC and the clear understanding of the court in this matter has been that only the land notified under Sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA are to be treated as forest area.In such areas, commercial activities such as mining, construction, cattle pasturing, felling of trees are totally prohibited and precluded. Such lands comprise only 0.72% of the total area of the state, she claimed.Choudhry said the recent affidavit filed by state government in the apex court in the Kant Enclave case has raised “disquieting concerns among activists and right-thinking citizens of Haryana”. The about turn done by the state government in the latest affidavit from its earlier stance taken in various affidavits filed before the SC is stunning.“It has been perceived as an attempt by the environmentalist in state as a subterfuge to provide license to land and mining mafia and unscrupulous colonisers to continue their commercial activities unabated,” the Congress leader said, Choudhry said, “The CM can save his government a huge embarrassment by withdrawing the contentious affidavit filed in the SC and revisiting the insidious amendments made in the PLPA.”The former minister said hilly tracks of the Aravallis in the south west and Shivaliks in northern Haryana have evolved an ecosystem over thousands of years. To preserve this ecology, the PLPA legislation of the British vintage was enacted. The amendments in the PLPA made on February 27, 2019 have been stated by the SC on March 1, 2019. The impugned amendments aimed at giving sweeping powers to the state government to amend or assign any notification or order under the PLPA and exclude all lands notified under HUDA and municipal schemes or lands in infrastructure schemes from the purview of the PLPA, she said.“It anguishes me that the state government that uses zero-tolerance for corruption as a talisman has sought to aid and abet the unbridled deforestation and obnoxious commercial activities by colonisers and mining barons in Aravallis and Shivalik ranges first by diluting the provisions of the PLPA and now by filing an affidavit in the SC which negated its earlier stand,” Choudhry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-plpa-amendment-cong-mla-kiran-choudhry-asks-cm-to-withdraw-affidavit-filed-in-sc-101638810828775.html

06-12-2021||Other||Uttarakhand passes proposal on dissolution of Char Dham Devasthanam Board||Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday evening passed the proposal on the dissolution of Char Dham Devasthanam Board. Now, the proposal of repealing the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act will be tabled in the two-day winter session of the state legislative assembly to be held on December 9 and 10, officials said. The cabinet also passed a proposal on providing ownership rights to occupants of Nazool land. The officials privy to the developments in the cabinet meeting held under the chairmanship of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that those occupants who have made 100% payment for land by 2011 will be provided ownership rights while in case of those who have made 25% payment will be given ownership rights after payment on the current market rates. The development follows the stay of the Supreme Court on Friday on Uttarakhand high court’s June 2018 order in which the HC had struck down a particular clause of the government’s 2009 Nazool policy which allowed conversion of Nazool land in illegal occupation to freehold. The SC stay and the cabinet decision has brought respite to thousands of people who had built private and commercial structures on Nazool land in the state. Other proposals passed during the cabinet meeting included providing free medicines across all government hospitals and health centres, regularisation of contractual employees in polytechnic centres, guest teachers to be posted in their native districts, providing water connections to poor families living in plain areas of the state with the land of around 100 sq metres at ₹100, among others. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced the repeal of the Act on November 30. In December 2019, during the tenure of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, the state assembly passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill. Priests were opposed to it, alleging that they were kept in the dark about the law. They alleged that the government took such a step to side-line them and ensure full government control of temple-related issues. After Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned in March, amid the growing resentment in the priest community, the new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat announced a month later that the state government will review the formation of the Char Dham Board. As nothing materialised on the ground and priests intensified their agitation, incoming chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who assumed office in July, formed a high-power committee in the same month to review the Act and submit a report to the government to take a decision on it. On November 1, ahead of the November 5 Kedarnath visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Char Dham priests warned that they will not allow PM Modi to have darshan at the Kedarnath shrine if their main demand of scrapping of the Char Dham Board is not conceded by the state government. This prompted CM Dhami to visit Kedarnath on November 2, assuring the priests that the government will decide on the matter by November 30 after receiving the report from the committee. 
06-12-2021||Mumbai||Resident doctors to resume OPD services from Tuesday||Resident doctors across several government and corporation hospitals in the state decided to reduce the intensity of their ongoing strike and have agreed to resume OPD services from Tuesday. The pan-India protest against the Supreme Court stay on PG medical admissions among other issues will now be carried on without letting it affect any work in the hospitals, said a statement released by the central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) late on Monday. While several other resident doctor associations across the country started their strike on December 1, central MARD withdrew from OPD work from Monday. A meeting of MARD representatives along with BMC officials and state cabinet minister Aditya Thackeray was organised on Monday evening following which the resident doctors decided to resume OPD services.One of the major concerns raised by these doctors has been of them being overburdened with extra work which is being shared by just two batches of resident doctors instead of three. “At a time when the country is witnessing the rise of a new Covid-19 variant, the least that needs to be done is strengthening the health care system. We need all hands on deck,” said one of the protesting doctors.NEET-PG 2021 exam which should take place in January was postponed to February first, then April this year. It was eventually delayed indefinitely due to increasing cases of Covid-19 registered across the country.The entrance test was finally conducted in the month of September this year, but admissions post the exam has been stayed by the Supreme Court which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of implementation of EWS and OBC quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats.Thackeray has assured the doctors that the state will start pre-admission registration process for PG admissions soon. He also assured help by approaching appropriate authorities in the central government to push for quashing of stay on admissions. Resident doctors in Mumbai had another reason to protest because recently, notices were issued to vacate the accommodation facilities provided by MHADA/MCGM which were given to decongest the already overcrowded hostels to avoid rise in Covid cases. Thackeray has assured help in this matter as well.“Considering the rise in the number of Omicron cases and our issues genuinely addressed by Aditya Thackeray and other BMC and GMC officials we as a team decided to reduce the intensity of agitation. We will resume our duties in OPDs considering patient care,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president, central MARD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-to-resume-opd-services-from-tuesday-101638808909034.html
06-12-2021||Lucknow||‘RLD, SP joint rally in west UP to give message of parivartan’||MEERUT Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Choudhary and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav will hold a joint rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. The event in Dabathua village of the district is likely to infuse fresh vigour among supporters of both parties in western UP ahead of the Assembly elections, said party leaders. Both leaders will join each other at the Hindon airstrip and arrive at the rally venue in a helicopter. Party leaders have worked hard for weeks to mobilise people to attend the rally in large numbers. Supporters will reach the venue in over 2,000 tractors and 1,000 buses to listen to their leaders, claimed Rajpal Singh, SP district president in Meerut. The rally venue is spread over 30 bigha where 40,000 chairs will be placed while a large area has been left for people to sit on the ground. Nine parking spots have been made to ensure convenient parking of vehicles, said Sunil Rohta, RLD’s media in-charge. “The joint rally would give a message of ‘parivartan’ in western UP and across the state.” People are excited for the rally, which has been given the name ‘Parivartan Sandesh Rally’ and the presence of two leaders on the dais will propagate political change,” emphasised Rajpal Singh. Singh accused the district administration of putting many conditions for giving approval to the rally. “Four people were deputed only to seek permission for the rally. We got the nod on Monday afternoon after efforts of eight days,” he shared. Political analysts believe that the RLD-Samajwadi Party alliance will help in changing political and social equations after the communal riots of Muzaffarnagar in September 2013 created a Muslim-Jat divide on RLD’s homeground. A change in this equation would be a challenge for the ruling BJP to retain its 51 out of 71 constituencies in 14 districts of Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions, which the party won in the 2017 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-sp-joint-rally-in-west-up-to-give-message-of-parivartan-101638808068778.html
06-12-2021||Patna||JMM unlikely to join TMC; to stick with Cong for 2024 Lok Sabha polls||The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the lead constituent in the United progressive Alliance (UPA) in Jharkhand, is unlikely to join forces with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is trying to form a national opposition alliance against the Narendra Modi-led BJP goverment without Congress being a part of it. The JMM, led by its working president and chief minister Hemant Soren, shares power with the Congress and RJD in Jharkhand, had backed Mamta Banerjee in West Bengal assembly polls and decided not to field candidates even in the tribal-dominated seats. Congress had contested the assembly polls in alliance with the Left in West Bengal polls that saw Mamata Banerjee returning to power with a huge mandate. Though Mamata has been pitching herself as the main opposition face against PM Narendra Modi, and lobbying with other regional parties for the same, JMM, however, in all likelihood would side with the Congress when it comes to 2024 general elections. “We are running a very strong and stable government in alliance with the Congress here. We have contested the last two elections, both general and assembly polls in 2019 together. I don’t see that equation changing here in 2024 as well,” said Supriyo Bhattacharya, principal general secretary and spokesperson, JMM. On the party’s stand of supporting Mamata instead of Congress in West Bengal polls, Bhattacharya said that was done with the sole aim of preventing BJP from coming to power in the neighbouring state. “Our target would be same in 2024 general elections as well. We want to unitedly dislodge BJP from the Centre. Moreover, unlike West Bengal, TMC hardly has any organisational base in Jharkhand. On the contrary, we have a stable alliance with Congress, which is the second biggest constituent in the government,” added Bhattacharya. The JMM and the Congress had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in alliance with the Congress contesting 10 of the 14 constituencies in the state, while the JMM contested in the remaining four. While the Congress lost all the 10 seats, JMM managed to win two of the four. In the assembly election six months later, the JMM contested as the lead constituent in the JMM-Congress-RJD pre-poll alliance. JMM contested in 43 assembly seats for the 81-member Jharkhand assembly, the Congress in 31 and the RJD contested from the remaining 7 seats. The pre-poll alliance together won 47 seats, well past the simple majority of 41.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jmm-unlikely-to-join-tmc-to-stick-with-cong-for-2024-lok-sabha-polls-101638807468684.html

Ranchi and East Singhbhum district (Jamshedpur) have again contributed most to the recent spike in Covid numbers. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said the numbers are increasing also because the testing numbers have increased in recent days. “There is an extra vigil at the airport, railway stations and the bus stands. We are testing aggressively, hence we are also getting more positive cases. We are now conducting around 7000 samples every day,” said the CS.

In Gorakhpur, he will inaugurate a fertiliser factory worth ₹8,600 crore and an All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that has been built at a cost of ₹1,010 crore. Modi will also open three high standard laboratories set up by the Indian Council of Medical Research at the BRD Medical College to test samples for the encephalitis virus (earlier samples were sent to Pune labs), said party leaders.The city will get another gift in the form of electric buses for the public. For this, the UP transport department has launched 15 electric buses for local commute. The PM’s visit to the region assumes political significance as UP Assembly elections are due early next year. In 2017, the BJP had managed to win 115 seats from Gorakhpur, Basti and Varanasi divisions in East UP. “The PM’s visit to Gorakhpur will infuse fresh energy in party workers who are on a mission to ensure a second term for Yogi Adityanathji,” said Satyendra Sinha, BJP spokesperson. The party has arranged several buses to ferry people from far flung areas to Manbela Ground, the venue for the PM’s programme. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who has been camping in the city since Friday to oversee the preparations for the PM’s programme, drove to the fertiliser factory and the rally ground to take stock of the security arrangements. As many as 53 battalions of paramilitary forces, including the PAC, the RAF, 4,000 policemen, 2 DIGs, 12 SSPs and 24 SPs, had been deployed to ensure tight security arrangements during the PM’s visit. Besides, the region close to the venue was identified as a ‘no flying zone’ and CCTVs cameras were installed to monitor activities, said SSP Vipin Tada.

The report has virtually, given a clean chit to doctors, who performed the operation.Nearly 65 persons were operated for cataract during the eye camp held at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital on November 22. After a hue and cry, 12 of them were shifted to IGIMS, Patna, for specialized treatment. The report, which was shared on Monday evening, said that two types of bacteria that are hazardous to human health have caused the tragedy. The report also mentions about improper sterlisation of instruments and suggested that the room used to conduct the operations was infected.According to the report, shared by Muzaffarpur ACMO Subhash Prasad Singh, instruments used in the camp were infected with Pseudomonas and Astaphylococcus Originosa. “Reports of swabs collected from the affected patients that were sent to the microbiology department have found presence of these two bacteria. Doctors who operated on the patients are nowhere at fault,” he said.When contacted, Muzaffapur’s district magistrate (DM) Pranav Kumar said, “The medical report would certainly be taken into consideration.

06-12-2021||Patna||All-party meeting on caste census soon: CM||After the decision of the Central Government not to conduct the caste census, Bihar is all set to formalise ways and means to hold its own caste-based census.Putting rest to all speculations, chief minister Nitish Kumar said that an all-party meeting for holding caste census in the state would be organised soon. “We want to do it. I have asked the deputy chief minister to hold talks in his party, the BJP. I already have talked to other parties. Once the deputy CM discusses with his party, we will hold an all-party meeting on the issue,” said Kumar while talking to media on Monday after his weekly Janata darbar where he addresses the grievances of people.Kumar’s wait for the BJP’s response holds importance as BJP seems to be a divided house on holding the caste census. However, former deputy CM and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi recently clarified that the party was not against the caste census. “The BJP is not against caste census. Had this been the case, the BJP ministers would not have been included in the all-party delegation to meet the PM. Yes, it is also true that the census process has started two years back. Hence, it cannot be possible to add any other factor to it. Due to technical problems, the Central Government is not able to do this at present,” he had said. During the winter session of the Bihar assembly, opposition parties led by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had met the chief minister to press for caste census in the state.“The meeting will discuss how and through what medium to hold it. We have to get it done in such a manner so that nobody is left out, including all castes and sub-castes. We will soon hold an all-party meeting so that opinions of all parties are taken,” said Kumar. Facing the heat after the recovery of liquor bottles from the Assembly premises during the recently concluded winter session, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar while maintaining that there won’t be any compromise in enforcing the prohibition said that investigation on recovery of bottles and the motive behind it is on.“I won’t comment on the issue right now. Wait for some time and everything will be known. First, we have to see whether someone had drunk alcohol there or just threw the bottles. The matter is being investigated. But such types of incidents will keep happening and we have to be alert,” said Kumar.He said, “Action is being taken. We have to ensure that prohibition is enforced strictly in Patna. If it is enforced strictly in the state capital, it will have its impact everywhere,” he said and added that a close eye was being kept on all those who indulge in drinking or are involved in breaking rules. Chief Minister expressed his concern over the shortage of fertilisers in Bihar. “I spoke to the Union minister, who has promised to normalise the availability of fertilisers in the next one week,” said Kumar.Kumar said that the farmers of Bihar have to face a lot of problems due to the shortage of fertilisers. “We have informed the Centre. The assurance has been given by the Centre that the supply is being provided,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/allparty-meeting-on-caste-census-soon-cm-101638806389758.html
06-12-2021||Mumbai||Petition in HC seeks cancellation of 2% reservation for SBCs||Mumbai A petition seeking cancellation of the two per cent reservation granted to the Special Backward Class (SBC) category in public employment has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) on the grounds that the reservation violates constitutional provisions, as it also takes the total reservation percentage in the state beyond 50 per cent. The petition suggests that if the communities covered under SBC are found eligible for reservation, they should be included in the other backward classes (OBCs).The petition filed by advocate Sanjeet Shukla on behalf of NGO Youth for Equality has questioned the government notification of December 8, 1994, granting two per cent reservation to certain communities and castes under the SBC category, contending that it takes the total reservation in Maharashtra to 52 per cent. The petition states that in Maharashtra, the reservations include reservation for Scheduled Caste (SC) at 13 per cent, Scheduled Tribe (ST) at 7 per cent, de-notified tribes at 11 per cent, Other Backward Class (OBC) at 19 per cent and SBC at two per cent. Shukla has contended that as the Constitution permits reservations up to 50 per cent, the additional two percent reservation given to SBC is not valid. It adds that the two per cent reservation in public services was brought in after the cabinet observed that there was a need to provide reservation to some caste, but there was no intention to create a new class of reservation. The petition has stated that as no efforts were made to verify whether the castes and tribes included in SBC category were eligible for reservation. The petition added that if the concerned authorities find these castes and tribes in need of reservation, they should be included in the OBC category. The petition was listed for hearing before a division bench of Justice Gautam Patel and Justice Madhav Jamdar on Monday, but could not be heard because of the paucity of time. The petition will be heard in due course now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petition-in-hc-seeks-cancellation-of-2-reservation-for-sbcs-101638806388525.html

A local court sent his 38-year-old mother to police custody for assisting her son in the crime. The juvenile accused reportedly displayed the severed head of his sister to the neighbours and clicked a selfie with it. The police have seized the mobile in which the photo was clicked and preliminary investigation revealed that the accused deleted the picture. “The head of the 19-year-old sister by decapitated by her younger brother in the kitchen as she prepared tea for them. After the gruesome incident, the accused brother and his mother took a selfie with the head. We have seized the mobile phone and it will be sent for forensic analysis for recovering the deleted picture which will be used as a crucial piece of evidence in the court,” superintendent of police Nimit Goyal said. After beheading the victim, the 17-year-old and his mother hacked the victim to death and then surrendered at the Viajapur police. The victim’s husband was in the house when the murder occurred and managed to escape though the juvenile also sought to attack him. The woman was reportedly pregnant. “We have arrested the mother-son duo for murder. We are verifying the claims of the neighbours and trying to establish the sequence of events. The accused’s phone has been seized to check if he had clicked any photos or selfies,” a police officer with Vaijapur station said. The police said that the victim had married her husband, whom she had met while in junior college, in June. Vaijapur sub division officer Kailash Prajapati said that the victim’s family had registered a missing complaint after she had eloped in June. “She had a registered marriage on June 21 and the couple presented themselves at Vaijapur police station. Since then, she had been staying with her husband in Ladgaon. It was a marriage of her choice and they had informed the police about their marriage.” Last week, the victim’s mother visited her in an attempt at reconciliation. The mother and her juvenile son returned to the victim’s home on Sunday while she was working in the field near her home alongside her mother-in-law. Seeing her family members, the victim rushed to greet them and went into the house to prepare tea for them. While she was pouring out the tea, her brother and mother attacked her. The brother used a sickle that he had concealed in his shirt to sever the victim’s head. The victim’s husband went running to the kitchen after hearing the noise, and saw his wife’s body. The 17-year-old tried to attack him too, but the husband managed to escape.

The complainant, a 38-year-old woman from Ulwe, received a call offering her a baby following which she felt suspicious and informed NRI Coastal Police.Senior police inspector Ravindra Patil and police inspector Prithviraj Ghorpade laid a trap and nabbed the five accused. The accused arrested have been identified as Zarina Rahim Sheikh (33) from Mhada Colony, the baby’s mother, and mediators Jyoti Shahrukh Khan (28), her husband Shahrukh Khurshid Khan (26), Anita Anand Sashte (47) and her son Shubham Anand Sashte (24).“The mother already has four children and when she got pregnant with the fifth, abortion could not be done. She decided to give the baby for adoption,” DCP (zone I), Vivek Pansare, said. Sashte, who used to work as a caretaker, was known to Zarina. Zarina contacted Sashte from Kalyan and told her of the need. Sashte contacted Khan from Seawoods and told to look for a customer. Khan knew that the complainant was childless and used to always feed children from under-privileged families. Thinking that she might be looking to adopt a child, Khan contacted the complainant to offer the child. The complainant suspected that the child being sold could be a stolen one and hence informed the police.The five accused were asked to come near Nerul railway station on Sunday evening and were nabbed while accepting the money. They have been produced before the court and sent to police custody till Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/5-arrested-for-trying-to-sell-10-day-old-baby-girl-in-navi-mumbai-101638805788437.html
06-12-2021||Kolkata||‘Want to hold 6-8 phase civic polls in May’: Bengal election commission tells Calcutta HC||The West Bengal state election commission (SEC) on Monday told a Calcutta high court division bench that it wants to hold elections in the state’s 120-odd municipal corporations and municipalities in six to eight phases till May next year. The SEC submitted the tentative plan in an affidavit before the division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj which is hearing a petition filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state vice-president Pratap Banerjee seeking simultaneous election in all civic bodies on a single day.During the last hearing on December 1, the bench directed the SEC to file a report by December 6 on how it plans to hold civic body elections in the state’s remaining 22 districts after the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls are held on December 19.The bench also took on record the affidavit filed by the SEC and the state government that opposed the BJP’s demand, citing logistical problems and the Covid pandemic. The matter will be heard again on Tuesday since the petitioner did not receive a copy of the SEC’s response on time, lawyers said. Though there was no hearing on Monday, the chief justice inquired why the SEC wants to hold the polls in May since it had indicated during an earlier hearing that the process might be completed by April.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) controls most of the civic bodies in Bengal. The terms of the elected boards ended over the last two years but elections were not held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government appointed the elected heads of the civic boards as administrators as a stop-gap measure. The state government wants to hold the polls in phases. It had planned to hold the elections in Kolkata and Howrah town on December 19 but the BJP moved the high court demanding simultaneous polls in all civic bodies.The government also recently announced that the Howrah corporation zone will be split so that a new civic body can be formed at Bally. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, however, did not sign the bill that the state assembly passed to give effect to this decision. He sent it back to the assembly speaker with 18 queries. The civic polls have once again intensified the acrimony between the Raj Bhawan and the TMC government.On December 2, Dhankhar told state election commissioner Saurav Das for the second time that he should not play any partisan role in the coming elections and wanted to know if the SEC would deploy Central armed police forces, a demand the BJP has also made. Das was scheduled to report to the governor on Monday but the SEC sought time since the matter was being heard by the high court. The governor once again summoned Das, asking him to submit a full report on Tuesday, Raj Bhawan officials said.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar alleged that the SEC is trying to postpone the civic polls till April because it suits the ruling party. “The SEC is completely controlled by the TMC government. We are not surprised by these tactics,” said Majumdar. The TMC, on the other hand, accused the governor of helping the BJP.“I beg the governor not to act at the behest of the BJP. You (Dhankhar) hold a prestigious post. Following the state BJP president and Suvendu Adhikari (leader of the opposition in the assembly) does not suit you,” said the transport minister and former Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim who is contesting the Kolkata polls. Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee accused the governor of delaying the polls in Howrah.“If the President of India can clear the three controversial farm bills overnight and also quickly give his assent to the withdrawal of these bills why cannot the governor clear a bill related to Howrah? It is because of him that the civic polls in Howrah could not be held,” said the speaker. The governor reacted to the speaker’s remark while interacting with the media on Monday.“It is most unfortunate that the speaker continues to ignore the Constitution and sense of propriety. In November, I had asked for some important documents regarding the Howrah municipal corporation bill. Why has he not produced these till now? ” said Dhankhar.On December 1, advocate Pinky Anand, who is representing BJP’s Pratap Banerjee, argued before the court that the SEC was deliberately staggering the election process at the behest of the state government. She argued that elections to the civic bodies were due before the Covid-19 pandemic started and hence these cannot be postponed citing health protocols as the situation has improved drastically. Appearing for the state government on that day, advocate general SN Mookherjee said the KMC polls were being held first because of the better vaccination status of Kolkata residents and healthcare facilities in the city. He also opposed the petition saying there is no constitutional provision that makes simultaneous polls mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/want-to-hold-6-8-phase-civic-polls-in-may-bengal-election-commission-tells-calcutta-hc-101638805610079.html

06-12-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps Raigad collector, Uran municipality over garbage dump in mangroves||The Bombay High Court on Monday strongly pulled up the Raigad district collector and Uran municipal corporation (UMC) for non-compliance with its own orders from three years ago, prohibiting the dumping of municipal waste from Uran city in mangroves at a 4ha (hectare) plot in Bori Pakhadi, about two kilometres from the heart of the city. The Court has requested the collector, along with the chief officer, Uran Municipal Council, the executive engineer (civil), CIDCO and the member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, to be present today (December 7) for the matter’s next hearing.The UMC has been dumping city-waste in the area for at least 15 years, according to a December 2018 petition filed by the Uran-based Shri Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha. In response, the HC on December 19, 2018, passed an order directing the UMC to divert its waste at an alternative site. In its order, the HC had noted, “The learned counsel appearing for the Uran Municipal Council submits that they have identified a plot where the solid-waste will be dumped. The learned counsel submits that the Municipal Council will not dump the solid waste in restricted area till the alternate arrangement is made.”In an affidavit submitted to the Court on February 19, 2019, the district collector had stated stated alternative land for solid waste dumping is yet to be identified and allotted. In a right to information (RTI) application in April this year, the Uran Municipal Council had informed Navi Mumbai-based NGO NatConnect that it has requested the Raigad collector for a five-hectare plot at Jasai. “However, there has been no move from the collector’s side to instruct CIDCO to hand over this plot so waste can be diverted away from mangroves,” said BN Kumar, founder, NatConnect.Now, responding to fresh geo-tagged photographs submitted by the petitioner showing continued dumping of waste in the region, the court noted that its previous instructions have been breached. “The statements made before the Court are not complied with since the last more than two years and the responsibility is sought to be shifted from one authority to another. Such conduct on the part of the Council and/or the Collector cannot be tolerated. It is their duty to abide by the statements made before the Court and also to comply with the directions of the Court,” Justices Milind N. Jadhav and S.J. Kathawalla said in their order.The Raigad district collector could not be reached for comment on Monday despite attempts. An official with the UMC’s solid waste management department declined to comment saying that the matter is sub-judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-raigad-collector-uran-municipality-over-garbage-dump-in-mangroves-101638804348236.html

Four close contacts of the Nigeria returnees have also tested positive. All their samples have been sent for genome sequencing.“Two of the four close contacts are in Hyderabad while other two are in Kalyan,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.KDMC has received a list of 295 travellers who returned from foreign countries. It has carried out the RT-PCR of 88 returnees, of which 34 tested negative while the reports of the others are awaited.“We have not been able to reach out 109 travellers and our health department is working round the clock to trace them. We have prepared an SOP for returnees from at risk and high-risk countries. They should strictly home quarantine themselves. Our staff will call them regularly and give surprise visits to check if they are following the home isolation norms,” said Suryavanshi.“If any of them tests positive, they will be taken to institutional quarantine. Housing societies are requested to ensure home quarantine is followed strictly. Those not abiding by the norms will face action,” added Suryavanshi.The civic chief also urged people to come forward for Covid vaccination in the coming days. “We have managed to finish 72% of the first dose and 53% of the second. We want to increase this in the coming days for which people should come forward and also put forward requests for vaccination camps,” added Suryavanshi.Meanwhile, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has 654 passengers who have travelled from high-risk countries till now. Among these, 185 have been tested on the seventh day, all of them turning negative but continue to be under quarantine.
06-12-2021||Mumbai||Forest Dept: 4,431 trees for Mumbai-Pune E-way expansion cut under “inevitable circumstances”||The forest department has concluded, last month that the 4,431 trees that were cut down by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) in 2019, for the expansion of Mumbai-Pune Expressway was done under “inevitable circumstances”, as the trees could not be transplanted due to logistical challenges.On November 26, the union environment ministry’s Regional Empowered Committee (REC) in Nagpur accepted this internal inquiry report by the forest department and sent the matter to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)’s Integrated Regional Office (IRO) for further consideration. The inquiry report, accepted by the REC, states that “there was no wilful disobedience” of the REC’s conditions by regional forest officers who allowed the tree felling to proceed. “It is found that the terrain conditions did not permit to move machinery and vehicles to translocate the trees. Thus, any attempt to that effect could have been too risky for the working staff handling such machinery,” read the formal report by the forest department to REC. MSRDC had been granted stage-1 clearance to divert 75 hectares of forest land for the development project in Raigad and Pune districts on February 6, 2019, as “subject to fulfilment of certain conditions”. The land is being diverted for the upcoming ‘missing link’ on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, from the Khopoli exit on the existing highway to Sinhgad Institutes near Lonavala, which will reduce travel time by about 20 minutes.“The maximum number of trees up to 60cm girth proposed to be felled may be translocated by the state government at the cost of the user agency,” the REC had instructed while granting in-principle, stage-1 approval. However, the minutes which is a recorded snippet of the REC meeting from June this year highlights that the trees were not translocated, but cut down after the Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF), Pune, issued a work order for the same in 2019. In its meeting on June 24, this year, the REC noted that this was done “without giving any second thoughts”, and opined that the matter should have been brought to its notice and that a cogent justification for felling the trees should have been submitted to the Central government. “The committee recorded its displeasure over such negligence and labelled it as a direct violation of stage-I approval,” the minutes noted. A formal inquiry report in the matter was sought within three weeks from the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forest-dept-4-431-trees-for-mumbai-pune-e-way-expansion-cut-under-inevitable-circumstances-101638802788495.html

Dismissed API Sachin Vaze and former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who accused Deshmukh of hafta vasooli, became the tools and we (Deshmukh family members) have become victims in this political vendetta.” The court has now posted Hrishikesh’s plea for further hearing on December 10, when ED is expected to present its side of the case.Chaudhari further asked, “If the Supreme Court can protect former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who is a declared proclaimed offender and has multiple FIRs against him, why can’t this court protect Hrishikesh?” He also assured the court that if protected from arrest, Hrishikesh will appear before the enforcement directorate in response to the summons issued by the agency. The counsel said it is a matter of record that on account of the witch-hunt campaign launched at the instance of certain vested inimical interests, some blatantly false allegations have been levelled against the applicants. The agency claimed that they want to question Hrishikesh regarding the routing of cash of ₹4.18 crore through Delhi-based hawala operators as donations to an educational trust controlled by Deshmukh family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/we-are-victims-of-a-power-game-deshmukh-s-son-claims-before-court-101638798528250.html
06-12-2021||Mumbai||Conman posed as descendent of Shivaji Maharaj to lure women||Vijay Kumar Yadav Mumbai Pune resident Yuvraj Bhosale, 41, who has been recently arrested by the Mumbai cyber police for duping a city-based 31-year-old woman of ₹30 lakh through a matrimonial site, used to pose as a descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to lure women, the police investigation has revealed. Police officials said that the serial fraudster also changed his surname to Bhosale. They added that Bhosale, booked in at least 11 criminal cases, also used to brag about himself by claiming that his mother is a doctor in London and his father, a senior IPS officer. During the investigation, the police identified 11 more of his victims and managed to convince three of them to lodge criminal cases against the purported fraudster, in order to ensure that he remains behind bars. “The three women are from Sewree, Kalyan and Airoli area in Navi Mumbai and have collectively lost over ₹1 crore to Bhosale,” said a police officer from central region cyber police station who is part of the investigation. “Bhosale is a smart guy. A graduate in psychology, he has a keen interest in criminology and has a law degree. He was well aware that he will come out on bail within a fortnight, even if he was arrested in a matrimonial fraud or cheating case, as most of the sections usually applied in such cases are bailable,” said the officer. Bhosale was arrested last week from Pune by a police team led by senior inspector Sanjay Govilkar. “He would mainly target divorcee women with a financially sound background. He would also trap those women who are looking for jobs and cheat them through job recruitment portals,” said Govilkar. Police sources said that Bhosale is suspected to have sexually assaulted some of his victims by blackmailing them. However, the police have not pressed charges of sexual assault on him as none of the victims has approached the police. Bhosale was arrested on December 3 for hacking into a Dadar woman’s phone, and later using her private photographs to blackmail her. He not only fraudulently diverted an amount of Rs. 30 lakh from her bank account, but also snatched her SUV worth ₹21 lakh away. He is in police custody till December 8. Police are likely to register more FIRs against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conman-posed-as-descendent-of-shivaji-maharaj-to-lure-women-101638796307503.html

On Saturday, Chadha made a 'surprise' visit to Jindapur village in Chamkaur Sahib, which is Channi's assembly constituency. Later, speaking to reporters, the AAP MLA said, “Illegal sand mining in CM Channi's constituency has been exposed. It is the biggest expose which will shake Punjab's politics.”“Illegal sand mining is going on openly in Jindapur, which is in the chief minister's constituency Chamkaur Sahib. Sand is being illegally ferried in trucks,” he further said.On Sunday, after the Punjab CM dismissed the AAP's allegations as a ‘bundle of lies,’ Kejriwal questioned if Channi visited a ‘different’ mining site, and not the one which Chadha paid a visit to.Also Read | Now, Arvind Kejriwal questions Charanjit Channi on visit to 'different' mining siteThe two chief ministers, as well as their respective parties, have, in recent days, engaged in a war of words, with Kejriwal even describing Channi as a ‘fake Kejriwal’ for allegedly making the same promises as the AAP for poll-bound Punjab.The Aam Aadmi Party is tipped to be the prime challenger to the ruling Congress in the border state, where assembly elections are likely to take place early next year.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||After Punjab govt crackdown, HC orders release of private buses||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday directed the Punjab government to release private buses it had impounded and permit transporters, including a firm of the Badal family, to ply its transport. Also read: Winnability sole criterion for Punjab Lok Congress ticket: Capt AmarinderThe high court bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Pankaj Jain said the transporters deserved the opportunity of hearing or at least a show-cause notice before penal action of the cancellation of their permits was taken by the transport department. The court said though there were allegations of political vendetta, it had found the state’s action to be arbitrary and illegal. In one case, state transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring was made party, with allegations of political vendetta. On November 22, representatives of firms of Shiromani Akali Dal leader Hardeep Singh Dhillon, New Deep Bus Service and New Deep Motors, had approached the high court alleging that 24 buses were impounded on different dates in October. After some payment was made instead of releasing the buses, six buses released were re-impounded and later in some cases the permits were cancelled. As of the second set of petitions, that was filed by Badals owned Orbit Aviation Private Limited, the cancellation of permits on November 12 was challenged. The government has denied political vendetta and claimed that it acted according to law. The court said all three operators had paid up the tax liability. It also took note of an advisory issued by the Centre to all states regarding extension of the validity of documents related to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and further to consider relaxation in permit-fee/taxes in view of Covid-19 induced instructions. It observed that the state failed to show any provision of the Punjab Transport Scheme, 2018, under which the cancellation of permits was ordered. In fact, provisions go on to show that no permit shall be suspended or cancelled unless an opportunity has been given to the holder of the permit to furnish his explanation. The court refused to take note of the state’s allegations that the operators are guilty of having committed fraud as they were plying more buses than the number of permits and are plying buses on expired permits. None of the impugned orders cancelling the permits has been passed on the premise of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-punjab-govt-crackdown-hc-orders-release-of-private-buses-101638793427135.html

However, it is not yet clear how many of them have been infected with the new variant.Senior health officials said 800-odd people have returned to Odisha from 11 countries – the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Israel – that were placed in the ‘at-risk’ category since November 26.“Of these, 6 have tested positive and their genome sequencing is being conducted in Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar. We are expecting that the reports will come by Friday,” said Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) Bhubaneswar director Ajay Parida He said the Odisha government has taken proactive measures for testing and tracking. In November, a total of 141 Covid-19 positive samples of foreign returnees in Odisha were genome sequenced, but none of them indicated the presence of the Omicron variant of the virus.“Any Covid-19 positive sample having CT value below 28 are undergoing genome sequencing,” he said.Director of public health Niranjan Mishra said the 40% of the 800 travellers who arrived in Odisha have entered the wrong addresses and contact numbers in the Air Suvidha portal.Odisha health minister Naba Das said there is no point in panicking over the Omicron variant as it is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Though preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, this could also be due to an increasing number of people becoming infected, rather than a result of a specific infection with Omicron.In Odisha, around 86 per cent of the population above the age of 18 years have taken the first dose while 50% of people have taken both doses. Around 74% of the adult population of 14 tribal-dominated districts have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-persons-who-arrived-in-odisha-from-omicron-at-risk-countries-test-positive-101638791747926.html
06-12-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: The many challenges facing Pune city’s Metro project||On December 24, 2016, three months before the Pune civic elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “Had the (Pune Metro) project been sanctioned earlier by the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) regime, the citizens of Pune wouldn’t have had to endure traffic snarls.” He was speaking at the Pune Metro Rail’s foundation stone laying ceremony, and was right, but only partially.Five years have passed and citizens are now asking: Why is the project still not complete, even in parts?There have already been inordinate delays in bringing the Metro project to Pune. While the major share of the blame does go to the Congress-NCP for failing to initiate the project much earlier, local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians and environmentalists are also to be blamed for the deferrals.And now, there are some groups stalling the project because they are not happy with the height of the viaduct at Chhatrapati Sambhaji bridge, also known as Lakdi Pul, which is a crucial location in the entire project.Why?These groups, mostly Ganpati mandals feel the viaduct height poses a hindrance to immersion procession, something the project executing agency Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) has denied. There have been meetings between PMC corporators, mayor, Maha-Metro officials and Ganesh mandal workers but stand-off continues.For politicians, upsetting Ganesh mandals mean inviting the wrath of people who are also political activists when civic elections are just three to four months away. More so when these mandals are power centres, enjoying the power to sway voters from old city areas, largely the bastion of BJP.A good 20 years ago when the Metro rail project proposal first came up, the then Congress MP, Suresh Kalmadi, first spoke about the Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS) in 2001. For the next few years, nothing happened till everyone woke up to the fact that Pune’s traffic situation had deteriorated abysmally.Well aware of the traffic problems, Kalmadi and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar once again revived the Metro proposal in 2007, and again in 2012 when Pune was preparing for the civic polls. In the hope that promises made by the ruling parties would turn to reality, citizens once again elected the Congress-NCP to power in the civic body. On the ground, however, not much happened for the next five years till the BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014.Just when things were looking up for the Metro in 2012, the entire issue was stalled over the question of whether it should be underground or elevated. While a section of politicians wanted it to be elevated, another section led by former MP, Anil Shirole and some environmentalists pushed for the underground route.Over the last decade, the Metro has been presented as a panacea to the acute traffic problems of Pune. Traffic experts and citizen activists are cagey about the claim. While metro rail is certainly an affordable and speedy mode of urban mass transportation, experts say it can be successful only if the network is widespread, covering the most populous parts of the city. Currently work is underway only for three lines, two of which have reached an advanced stage and third – Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar still to gather momentum.The two or three lines of the Metro may not be enough for a city like Pune where the population is over 50 lakhs. Also, the Metro and bus networks have to be well-synchronized to make them successful.Lawless, chaotic traffic in the absence of a strong public transport system has been the bane of Pune and the guardians of the city have neglected this issue over the past decades. The citizens no longer trust the promises made by the politicians and therefore ask, “Will the Metro ever see the light of the day?”As per the plan, two corridors are being developed by Maha-Metro, the state government company which will oversee Pune’s metro rail project. The rail network will cover a total distance of 31 kilometres (a 16-km stretch from Pimpri to Swargate and another from Vanaz to Ramwadi at an estimated cost of ₹11,420 crore. Recently, the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) proposed another route on the Metro map from Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar, which will be 23 kilometres in length, estimated to cost ₹7,947 crore.Originally, all three lines were projected to become operational by 2021. However, as of now, only two priority stretches on two lines (each around 3km long) may start before elections. The current delay is not just increasing the cost of the project but also prolonging current woes being faced by citizens.The conscientious citizens of Pune will now need to keep watch targets set by Maha-Metro for the completion of the various stages of the Pune Metro project. From here on, the citizenry needs to know whether the project is moving on time or will suffer more delays, as has happened in the past.Those enjoying power, be it in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), state or Centre, need to be put under the watchful eyes of Punekars.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com

Gaya senior superintendent of police (SSP) Aditya Kumar said the woman sold her ornaments to a jewellery shop owner of Sherghati and paid ₹80,000 in advance to contract killers to eliminate her husband. She did not want him to become a problem in her affair. Afsan Praveen and her lover Jisan Rehman paid ₹80,000 to Arif Khan for hiring contract killers from a gang headed by one Mohammad Armanullah Khan, said the SSP. The arrested persons include Afsan, Jisan, Mohammad Armanullah and his associate Pankaj Paswan. Police told that Arif and his associate Chhotu Yadav were still at large. The cosmetic shop owner Mohammad Tayyab was shot dead on October 23 near his rented house at Kazi Mohalla under Sherghati police station in Gaya. His wife had lodged a murder case against unknown assailants with the concerned police station. The SSP said that during the investigation, police got a video clip of a woman clicking pictures of Tayyab lying in a pool of blood.

Also read: Decision on alliance with BJP taken ‘in principle’, details on seat-sharing soon: Amarinder SinghInteracting with the media in Chandigarh after opening his party office in Sector 9, Capt Amarinder Singh, who quit the Congress a month ago, said that talks were on with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the breakaway Akali faction led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa for a poll alliance. He hinted at a meeting with BJP president JP Nadda in the near future over sharing of seats among the three stakeholders. “We are yet to decide on which party will get how many seats to field candidates and there has been no decision on the CM face so far,” the former CM said in reply to a query. He said Union home minister Amit Shah has made it clear that there will be a tie-up for the assembly elections. Capt Amarinder Singh launched the Punjab Lok Congress last month after he was removed from the post of chief minister in September following a bitter power tussle with state Congress president and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was also joined by some cabinet ministers once Amarinder supporters. Charanjit Singh Channi, a minister in Capt Amarinder’s cabinet, succeeded him as CM. Farm laws revoked, open for BJP alliance Capt Amarinder Singh had announced that he would contest the 2022 Punjab elections in alliance with the BJP if the farmers’ issues were resolved by the Centre, particularly the repeal of the three farm laws that he was opposed to, too. “I think there are no issues left now,” Capt Amarinder reiterated, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had repealed the farm laws and also constituted a committee to resolve the remaining issues such as the minimum support price on crops. “We are getting reports from urban and rural areas of the state that there is support building in our favour. We sweep the elections and form the government in Punjab,” he announced, adding that ministers, MLAs and Congress leaders were in touch with him and would open their cards only after the polls are announced. Performance will be poll plank: Capt He said the Punjab Lok Congress will contest the elections on the basis of his performance as chief minister. 92% of the promises made to the people of Punjab in the 2017 elections have been fulfilled when he was at the helm for four-and-a-half years, he claimed. Asked about action taken in the 2015 sacrilege cases, Capt Amarinder Singh said that he had done his best and formed four special investigation teams (SITs). The inquiry reports have been submitted in the court for action. “I can’t push the court to give a verdict,” he said, adding that when he was CM, he was pressured to arrest former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia. “However, his arrest is possible only on the basis of evidence,” the former CM said. Finds Kejriwal a ‘sneaky character’ Capt Amarinder Singh termed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal a “sneaky character” who was making unrealistic promises to the people of Punjab. “On the ground, the Aam Aadmi Party is very weak. In case the AAP would have been gaining strength, 10 of its MLAs would not have switched sides,” he said. He refused to accept parallel acting jathedar of Akal Takht Dhyan Singh Mand, who had pronounced the former CM as a ‘tankhaiya’ (guilty of religious misconduct) for allegedly scuttling the Bargari Morcha against sacrilege incidents. “I regard only the jathedar who has been appointed following the proper procedure,” he added.

I will tell both parties that we should pick winners and support those candidates,” news agency ANI quoted Singh as saying.The former Congress leader also expressed confidence his party, the Punjab Lok Congress, will form the government in the state after the assembly polls scheduled for early next year. “Our aim is to win the Punjab assembly elections and we will,” Singh said.Noting the membership drive for his party began 10 days ago, he said, "A committee is also being formed in the district so that people can join the party."Also read | Former CM Capt Amarinder Singh opens Punjab Lok Congress office in ChandigarhSingh’s comments came two days after Union home minister Amit Shah said an alliance with the Punjab Lok Congress and Dhindsa’s party might be formed before the state assembly polls. Shah made the remarks during his keynote address at the concluding session of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2021 on Saturday.Notably, BJP’s Punjab in-charge Dushyant Gautam has said the decision regarding an alliance with Singh’s party would be taken by the BJP’s top leadership. However, he also said the BJP was preparing to fight in all the seats in the state.“We are preparing to contest for 117 seats in the upcoming Punjab assembly elections. The final decision of alliance between the BJP and Captain's new political party will only be taken by party high command,” ANI quoted Gautam as saying.Singh has said his alliance with the BJP would depend on the Centre resolving the issue of the protesting farmers. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three laws back in November, Singh was among the first few to welcome the move.“On Prakash Parv PM Modi took the decision to repeal the three Farm Laws and apologized to the farmers. There can be nothing bigger than this. I'm thankful to Prime Minister and home minister for this, nobody can do anything more than this,” ANI quoted Singh as saying.Meanwhile, Charanjit Singh Channi, who took over as the CM after Singh, criticised the talks on alliance and said that the BJP has found new allies in Singh and Dhindsa to promote its “divisive discourse” in the state, news agency PTI reported.After a bitter, year-long tussle with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Singh stepped down from the state’s top post earlier in September this year and announced his own party in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decision-on-alliance-with-bjp-taken-in-principle-details-on-seat-sharing-soon-amarinder-singh-101638787685663.html

Let’s see how many of them turn up,” a Motihari-based government doctor said, referring to the plan to send at least 21 affected patients from the two districts of West and East Champaran to the Patna-based government hospital for further treatment on Monday. East Champaran’s civil surgeon Dr Anjani Kumar said that 13 of 15 such patients from his district had returned to their respective villages despite the referral to the Patna hospital. The remaining six such patients are from West Champaran, district’s civil surgeon Birendra Kumar Choudhary said.Close to 328 patients were operated for cataract between November 22 and 27 at the Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital and several of these surgeries were allegedly botched up, resulting in many patients losing an eye due to severe infection. Muzaffarpur’s Brahmpura police station on Thursday lodged an FIR against 14 persons including the secretary, manager and doctors attached with the hospital. Shankar Ram, a resident of Sherawa village in Narkatiaganj block of West Champaran district is one among those who have been referred to Patna, but says he will not go to IGIMS come what may.“I will prefer to go to Parvanipur (a Nepal-based eye hospital). They will take out my eye, if I go there (IGIMS),” Ram told HT over the phone.Ram is not the only one suffering from distrust and fear.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Online proctoring: PU panel for conducting mock test of software first||With Panjab University planning to use the online proctoring in the upcoming semester exams to invigilate students, a special panel of the university has suggested to conduct a mock test of the software first to check its feasibility after the tendering process is done.The tendering process is underway for inviting bids. The recommendation was given by the panel as a part of various technical specifications which have been finalised for online examination proctoring software. The theory exams of undergraduate courses will start from December 22 and for PG courses from December 27.Although the university has announced that forthcoming semester exams will be conducted in online mode, however, the use of proctoring in the exams is yet to be finalised. According to the specifications finalised by the panel, all data has to be preserved for six months at the seller’s side and after six months all data has to be handed over to the university at no extra cost.It has been outlined that students should be able to access even in low bandwidth. In case there is an interim disconnection of the internet, images captured prior to disconnection and those captured after the connection re-establishes, must be recorded and uploaded on the server for analysis along with an AI analysed report of the student activity during the duration of disconnection.The panel has suggested that an auto face recognition of the candidate should happen at the start of the examination and a dedicated technical expert must be assigned by the vendor to address students’ queries.Further, it has been outlined that on the day of examination, only scanned PDFs of question papers are to be uploaded for students to download and a provision must be made for the papers to open in the application itself.The last three semester exams of PU were held online after the epidemic broke out last year. There was no proctoring, and the university had received criticism over the sanctity of these online exams.
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: AAP’s promise of free water every month political gimmick, says Congress||In a first after the parties completed their ticket allotment and nominations for the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections, the Chandigarh Congress on Sunday ripped into the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) “guarantee” of providing free water up to 20,000 litres. In November, AAP gave its first guarantee promising it would provide a 24/7 water supply without additional tax burden on the city residents. Under it, the party assured that 20,000 litres (20 kilolitres) of clean and free water would be provided to the residents of the city per month. Terming the AAP’s first guarantee as a political gimmick, Congress state president Subhash Chawla, said, “AAP is misleading people. Chandigarh is not Delhi where there is a state legislative assembly. The MC cannot take any such decision or pass any law on these lines. In Chandigarh, the municipal corporation is governed by the Punjab Municipal Act, which does not even have a provision for the supply of free water without any charge.” Congress questioned AAP’s ability to overrule the Act. Chawla said, “Chandigarh is run by the Union government through the UT administration. It is the BJP government at the Centre. In Delhi, AAP runs the state government and manages terms with the Delhi Jal Board, but here there is nothing like that. How it will prevail over the BJP-run Central government.” Stating that Chandigarh residents cannot be fooled by freebies, Chawla, said, “They want quality service at fair charges and not free stuff. But the AAP blindly tries to follow their Delhi model without a local perspective and understanding. Even in Delhi, they have lost successive municipal elections. If the model is so successful, why the people are not supporting them in these polls.” Chawla said, “A guarantee comes with a penalty. Will they also tell people what penalty they will pay if they don’t deliver on their guarantee?” Responding to the Congress on the issue, AAP co-incharge Pardeep Chhabra said, “If the Congress doesn’t understand the economics, it is their problem. In Delhi, too, the party sat on dharnas even outside the lieutenant governor’s house and office. In the end, AAP succeeded because its intention was right.” AAP has maintained that as it would save around 45% of the water that is currently lost due to leakages and theft. “We will save water wastage. Funds are not an issue. The MC should get its due as per the Delhi finance commission recommendations. It is AAP’s policy to reduce taxes so that compliance is improved,” said Chhabra. 
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Ward 29: These footpaths no cakewalk for pedestrians||In Ward number 29, parks are crying for maintenance, footpaths are broken and roads are inundated with water and sewage, making life a nightmare for residents here. Jaspal Singh Sandhu, a property dealer from Sector 56, said: “Here sewage is the main issue of the residents. Plots are less than one marla and sewerage pipes were laid accordingly. However, now people have given houses on rent and the population has increased, but no additional pipes have been laid.”He said often sewage overflows leading to stink in the area and then they have to make several calls to officials.Talking about the councillor’s role, he alleged that BJP councillor Satish Kainth had never done anything for the area. “He just keeps on switching parties but does nothing for the ward. This time we will choose someone who is from the ward and will do something for the residents,” he added.Ashwani Kumar, a resident of Ambedkar Colony, Sector 56, said: “The residents have to face so many issues, but no one listens to us. Poor sanitation and ill-maintained parks are the main issues. The ward has many parks but none is maintained by the MC.”“The iron railings are broken, there is no greenery, garbage is strewn all over the park and swings are also in a bad shape,” he said.A few meters away, there is a green belt, which he said was occupied by Verka trucks.A resident said: “These are inner roads and trucks should not ply inside the sector, but no one stops them.”Illegal vendors have encroached upon the road leaving little space for pedestrians. Even cars are parked on the roadside.Daya Parkash Gupta, a shopkeeper from Sector 56, said there was no place to organise public events or marriage functions. “A community centre that they have constructed is located next to a school where there is no parking space.”Sardara Singh Cheema, president, RWA, Sector 55, said, “I am living here since 1995. Since then, the green belt has not been developed. Then there is no community centre. Also, there was no bus terminal and we had to collect funds to build one.”He said, “Forget about bus terminal, CTU buses have stopped coming to this Sector. For the last few years, people have to commute via private vehicles.”He alleged that councillor Satish Kainth had done nothing for their ward.Another complaint was that they do not get clean drinking water in their houses. Apart from this, parks are not maintained. “There are 11 parks and we collect money to maintain these parks.”Satish Kainth, councillor, said one community centre had been inaugurated and the work was underway for another centre. He said they were working on the problem of overflowing sewage, but the work had stopped because of the elections.Local voicesThere is no place to sit in the parks. There is no greenery, railings are broken and garbage is strewn all over.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||50 years of 1971 war: Meet Col LJS Gill who para jumped into enemy area without training||The Indian Army is known for its valour and one such act was shown by Colonel LJS Gill who para jumped into the battlefield without any training. Fifty years on, he shares the story of his first landing in East Pakistan to take over Poongli bridge near Tangail town, paving way for uninterrupted movement of Indian troops till Dhaka.Colonel (then Second Lieutenant) LJS Gill, merely 21 at the time, went on to became a part of the contingent that performed the guard of honour in Dhaka when Pakistan Army’s Lt Gen AAK Niazi signed the instrument of surrender of Pakistan forces with Lt Gen Jagjit Singh Aurora, commander of the Indian Army’s Eastern Command on December 16, 1971.Because of the Indo-Pak War, Gill’s military training at Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, was cut short by five weeks and he passed out on November 14. After a two-week break, he reported to his unit in Kolkata on November 29. He was commissioned into the 2 Para just before the war broke out.“When you opt for the parachute regiment, you are to undergo a 28-day probation to be assessed for your suitability to serve in the air-borne forces. If you qualify, you are sent to Para Training School at Agra for a four-week basic course followed by five jumps, including a night jump,” he says. “On December 3, 1971, the war broke out and two days later, my battalion got the orders for air-borne operations to capture Poongli Bridge. As I was not a qualified paratrooper then, I was told I could not be part of the airborne force for the operation. But I told my Commanding Officer (CO), Lt Col Kulwant Singh Pannu (later Major General), that I want to go to war,” reminisces the veteran. ‘Not qualified, but determined’The CO agreed to take up the matter with the Brigade Commander. “The next day, CO introduced me to Brigadier (later Lt General) Mathew Thomas, 50 Para Brigade Commander. When I told him I want to jump with the unit, Brig Thomas asked me what he would tell my father in case of a mishap. I answered: “I am not qualified, but determined. You tell my father the same thing, which you would to any other soldier’s family.” “He asked me to go,” recalls Gill.But there were many challenges ahead. No sub unit was ready to accommodate an untrained soldier. At last, the probation officer Maj J S Mahalwar, Chalie Company Commander, agreed to take him. C Company was to jump from C 47 Dakota planes; technically complex to jump from. For an untrained trooper, this was considered risky. He was then accommodated in Pathfinder 2 as the additional jumper. Pathfinders were jumping from C119 Packets, which were relatively easier to jump from. “This shift not only separated me from my sub-unit, but grouped me for a more challenging task.”Pathfinders are the first ones to be dropped for securing and marking the drop zone and receiving the main force. Finally, the D-day came on December 11, 1971. The group jumping from C119 Packet reached Dum Dum Airbase at 3 am. At the crack of dawn, he was briefed by the Airforce staff about the parachutes, emergency procedures and made to practice landings from a stool. This was followed by exit procedure in the plane. Taking off at 2.30 pm from Dum Dum, the Path Finders were dropped at the drop zone, 3 km east of the target- Poongli Bridge. “There was zero emotion, but a sense of mental commitment that I have to do it. After boarding the plane, I asked the dispatchers to not assist me in any way as I wanted to exit on my own. It was a smooth exit. I landed in a pond and managed to reach the drop zone.” “With the mainstream following in 30 minutes, the attack was carried out at 8 pm as planned and the bridge was captured. We paved the way for the 95 Infantry Brigade and 167 Infantry Brigade to move forward towards Dhaka,” he said.Gill says with pride, “It was my unit that was the first one to enter Dakha. In the picture, which you see of the historic surrender ceremony, I, along with my troops, was 10 metres in front of the table where the surrender ceremony was happening.” In February 1972, Gill was sent to PTS Agra to complete Para Basic Course as airforce did not approve the operational jump a qualification to earn his para wings. Gill took a premature retirement in 1995 and persued a corporate career retiring as managing director of a multinational company in Germany.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Shah, Kanhaiya, Kejri among star campaigners descending on city||As campaigning picks up steam for the high-stakes Chandigarh municipal corporation elections slated for December 24, the city is set to host a number of senior politicians, including union ministers, chief ministers, popular actors and singers.Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath, Charanjeet Singh Channi, Arvind Kejriwal, Kanhaiya Kumar and Bhagwant Mann are among the star campaigners set to descend upon the city over the next two weeks to woo voters. While the Bharatiya Janata Party has finalised the list, Aam Aadmi Party and Congress are still processing it. Fighting to win the Chandigarh municipal corporation polls for the second consecutive time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is bringing in top ministers of the Narendra Modi government. “Union home minister and former national party president Amit Shah, cabinet ministers Piyush Goyal and Anurag Thakur are in the list of the BJP’s star campaigners,” said the party’s state unit president Arun Sood.Considered to be a big crowd-puller, Uttar Pradesh chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath is among the three chief ministers of the neighbouring states who will be campaigning in the city. Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur are the other two. The city has a strong voter base from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (particularly from Purvanchal region of the state), and Uttarakhand. City’s peripheral areas, including rehabilitation colonies and villages, have large population of people from these states.“While traditionally these voters went with the Congress, but in the last decade, a major chunk of their support has shifted toward the BJP. They have played a key role in the party winning the last three elections in the city, including two Lok Sabha and one municipal,” said a senior BJP leader.To tap into this voter base, the BJP is putting into action the CMs from these three states. The Himachal connection of Union minister Anurag Thakur is also crucial for the party.Similarly, Union minister of state for defence Ajay Bhatt, who is also a former state president in Uttarakhand, is being roped in to campaign among the Uttarakhand-origin residents of the city. With eye on natives of UP, Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and Delhi MP Manoj Tewari and Bhojpuri singer Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua) will also be campaigning in the city.“Bengaluru MP Tejasvi Surya who is also national president of BJP Yuva Morcha and singer-turned-politician MP Hans Raj Hans will come to boost the party’s campaign,” said Sood.AAP pushing for KejriwalDelhi CM and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal is likely to campaign in the city. AAP, which is contesting its first municipal poll in the city, is pushing for Kejriwal to come to Chandigarh for bolstering its chances in the polls. Kejriwal is actively campaigning in Punjab for the forthcoming state election.“We are finalising his schedule and days for campaigning in the city. As soon as it is done, his visit to the city will be confirmed. He will do a road show in the city, rather than a public rally,” said Prem Garg, Chandigarh AAP convener.Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia is also likely to campaign. “He has already visited the city once to review the party’s election preparations. He interacted with city residents from different walks of life and took their views on formation of party manifesto,” said Garg.So far, the visit of four AAP leaders has been confirmed. This includes, party’s Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann, Delhi government minister Rajendra Pal Gautam, party’s MPs from Rajya Sabha Sanjay Singh and ND Gupta. Meanwhile, the Congress has also prepared a list of 10 star-campaigners. “Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Kanhaiya Kumar, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat, Himachal Pradesh MP Pratibha Singh, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Alka Lamba and some Punjab ministers are also in the Congress list.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||There is a need to elect a strong leadership, says Nadda||A month after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) loss in the Himachal byelections, the party’s national chief, Jagat Prakash Nadda, stressed on the need to elect a strong leadership. “Strong leadership makes a big change in the country and the society,” he said while addressing an event to facilitate health officers and workers on the occasion of Himachal becoming the first state to achieve 100% Covid vaccination feat. After inaugurating the OPD of AIIMS in Bilaspur, Nadda said had Narendra Modi not been the Prime Minister, people of Himachal would have never thought of having such a premier institute in their state. “That’s why I say people should be aware while electing leaders and consider the fact that who can provide strong leadership,” he added. “No one thought that AIIMS could also be set up outside Delhi. It was under the leadership of PM Modi that today, 22 AIIMS are coming up across the country,” Nadda said. He said the central government also gave a PGI satellite centre to Himachal besides four new medical colleges. Nadda said had there been no Covid outbreak, the work of AIIMS would have been completed by now. AIIMS will become fully functional by June 2022 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate it, he added. The BJP national chief said during the Covid pandemic, healthcare system of even the most developed countries crumbled. “America and European countries couldn’t decide if to save lives or economy. Contrary to it, India not only fought the battle efficiently, but also saved the economy,” Nadda said, adding that vaccine was made available within nine months of the outbreak. “Today, India has not only administered 127 crore doses to its population, but is also exporting vaccines to 50 countries,” he said. “This is the change a strong leadership brings,” he said, adding that there was a time when it took decades to bring vaccines to India after their launch, whether it was for TB, polio, chickenpox or hepatitis. The BJP president also congratulated the state government, doctors, healthcare staff and all frontline workers for helping Himachal achieve the feat of fully vaccinating its eligible population with both the doses. He also hailed chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for making Himachal a front-runner in education, health and social services sectors. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who was also accompanying Nadda, said India has no dearth of brainpower and manpower, and PM Modi has identified this talent. He said that Himachal Pradesh has shown a way to other states of the country by achieving this unique distinction of 100% vaccination by overcoming the tough challenges posed by the topography of the state. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said it was a big milestone for the state and a historic day as it achieved 100% vaccination target. “It was due to sheer hard work and efforts put in by health workers along with the co-operation of the people of the state,” he added. Recalling various challenges during the vaccination campaign, Jai Ram said the doses were supplied to the remote regions by helicopters while in some cases, health workers scaled mountains for hours and meandered through forests to reach far-flung areas. Union minister of information and broadcasting, youth affairs and sports Anurag Singh Thakur also congratulated Jai Ram and people of HP for achieving the 100% vaccination target. He said that India has today emerged as a role model for other countries of the world during the testing times of the pandemic. Health workers and officers who performed extraordinarily to make the vaccination campaign successful were also honoured on the occasion. Inaugurates OPD of Bilaspur AIIMSBJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Sunday launched the OPD services at AIIMS coming up at Kothipura near Bilaspur.Union ministers Mansukh Mandaviya and Anurag Singh Thakur besides Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur were also present on the occasion. The foundation stone of Bilaspur AIIMS was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2017 when Nadda was the Union health minister. It was officially approved under Phase 5 of the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana by the Union cabinet on December 4, 2019. Initially, 79 super specialists and 85 nursing officers will render services at the institute, which will cater to the HP population of about 75 lakh. The ₹1,350-crore project is coming up on 247 acres on Bilaspur-Shimla highway and will have a 750-bed hospital, a medical college and a nursing institute. To further enhance healthcare delivery, AIIMS Bilaspur is likely to widen the spectrum of services through the expansion of various super-specialty departments in subsequent phases to provide affordable and reliable tertiary-level healthcare in Himachal and adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana. The first academic session started from January 12, 2021, with a batch of 50 MBBS students. Eight percent construction work of AIIMS has been completed. The academic block would be ready by June next year. Though the OPD was inaugurated officially on Sunday, doctors have been rendering services for the last five months. 
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Karnal: Command centre for traffic monitoring goes live||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday inaugurated an integrated command and control centre (ICCC) to keep round-the-clock vigil on traffic movement in his assembly segment Karnal.Set up at a cost of around ₹153 crore under the Smart City Project, the ICCC comprises over 500 CCTV cameras, including 50 pan-tilt-zoom cameras, which cover all important points in the city. As many as 42 cameras (360° rotator) have been installed on all roundabouts in the city on the National Highway-44. A staff of 60, including 30 operators, 20 cops and some officials of the Karnal municipal corporation, will be deputed for round-the-clock monitoring. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said the ICCC will not only help the police monitor traffic movement in Karnal, but also help them check criminal activities in the city. A private company will run the project for five years. Officials said 138 cameras installed at key traffic junctions were equipped with infrared and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), 69 cameras had red light violation detection (RLVD) system and 20 will monitor violation of speed limits.Also, 125 public address systems, 31 emergency call boxes and 31 variable message display boards have also been included. The emergency call box will help people contact ICCC in case of an emergency, whereas the message display boards will provide weather and other important information to commuters. Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said these cameras, backed by digital evidence, will help enforced rules of the Motor Vehicle Act. Committee to deal with corruption On allegations of corruption in the Karnal municipal corporation (MC), the chief minister said strict steps were being taken in this direction and Karnal district vigilance committee, headed by the additional deputy commissioner, will deal with all complaints of corruption in government departments of the district. Reacting to the question over the government-farmers deadlock, Khattar said, “The negotiations with farm leaders are going on and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved peacefully, and they will return home.”Later, the chief minister inaugurated developmental projects worth ₹40 crore, including a new building of the Karnal MC, built at ₹16 crore, and visited the newly set up Punjabi Bhawan and Valmiki Bhawan.
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Legal guarantee for MSP: Six farmers begin hunger strike at Singhu||As many as six farmers – three each from Haryana and Punjab – on Sunday sat on a hunger strike at Singhu border, demanding a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP).They will continue to observe the strike till December 7, when the Samyukt Kisan Morcha will hold its meetings to decide the future course of action.The farmers – Rajender Singh (Sonepat), Kartar Singh (Kaithal), Naresh Sangwan (Ambala), Satnam Singh (Patiala), Bikram Singh (Gurdaspur) and Kuldeep Singh (Moga) – tied themselves with chains before starting their hunger strike near the protest site at Singhu.Rajender said they will continue their protest until the Union government gave a legal guarantee for the MSP, which they had been demanding for years.“The government has sought five names from SKM leaders, who will be part of a committee to discuss the MSP. This is an attempt to call-off the agitation and dump our demand for legal guarantee on the MSP,” he added.Kuldeep said farmers had been waiting for MSP since Independence and this was the right time for protesters to take their pending share. “We will continue to tie our bodies with chains until the government gives a legal guarantee,” he said.On Saturday, SKM leaders had formed a five-member committee for holding discussions with the central government.Besides the legal guarantee for MSP, their demands include compensation to kin of farmers, who died during the agitation against the farm laws; withdrawal of cases against the protesters; action against Union minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident; and memorials for the deceased farmers.Meanwhile, a group of Nihangs dismantled their tents and left with their items in trucks, tractor-trolleys and other vehicles. They said the government had accepted their demands and they were returning home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/legal-guarantee-for-msp-six-farmers-begin-hunger-strike-at-singhu-101638735160365.html

Rohtak superintendent of police Uday Singh Meena said the other accused, both minors, had already been arrested.“He, along with his aides, had fired shots at the bride, Tanishk of Sampla village, at Rohtak’s Bhali Anandpur village, just a few hours after her marriage on December 2.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||People with political motives want farmers’ stir to continue: Anil Vij||Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Sunday said people with vested political interests did not want the farmers’ agitation to end, but the farmers had made up their mind and the issue will be resolved soon.The home minister’s statement assumed significance as the first meeting between farmer leaders and the Haryana chief minister remained inconclusive, with the latter saying that the next round of talks was likely in the next couple of days.“Obviously, there are some people with political ambitions and there are some enemies of the country, who are in favour of continuing this agitation forever. But I think that the farmers and government have now come forward and both seem in favour of ending it,” Vij said. Reacting to BJP’s junior alliance partner JJP’s national president Ajay Chautala’s statement that he has asked his father and INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala to reconsider the decision of expelling him and his sons, and unite the family again, Vij said, “I don’t know in what context this statement was made.”In a reply to a question, Vij took a dig at Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, saying that he will play a big role in sinking Congress’s ship in the 2022 Punjab Assembly Elections.On the threat of a new variant of Covid-19, the health minister said the state health department was on alert and required instructions had been issued to the district health departments. Hospitals with a capacity above 100 beds had been equipped with ventilators. The health minister did not react to the question about his absence from the chief minister’s programme in Karnal despite being in the city, saying that he had to go to Delhi as per his schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/people-with-political-motives-want-farmers-stir-to-continue-anil-vij-101638735158138.html

He has given 60,000 acres to his son-in-law and Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law (Robert Vadra). Deepender’s father had crushed the voice of every section with bullets. Our government has handled the farmers’ agitation peacefully and the Union government has accepted their demands. During Hooda’s regime, farmers and teachers received bullet shots for protesting against the then government, whereas our government is listening to all grievances peacefully,” the deputy chief minister alleged.He further said if the Union government and Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s five-member panel reached a consensus over pending demands, the Haryana government will also revoke cases filed against protesters, except of rape and murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dushyant-chautala-faces-protest-at-hisar-district-courts-101638735156899.html

A pistol and live cartridges were recovered from his possession.Police had already arrested his associate Rihan, another accused in the ransom case, while the search for another is on.“The arrested criminal was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Pinky murder case in 2014. He was lodged in Hisar jail from where he came out on parole sometime back and was declared an absconder by the court in October 2021 for not returning back to jail,” police said, adding that it was during the parole period when Dabla demanded a ransom.The accused was wanted in 10 different cases, including parole norm violation, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murder-convict-who-jumped-parole-nabbed-in-haryana-101638735155864.html

Interacting with mediapersons in Bhiwani, Hooda said the government had passed Farm Laws Repeal Bill and the President had also given assent to it, so the government should revoke cases filed against agitators.“It should also provide compensation to the deceased farmers’ families and take forward talks in giving a legal guarantee on the minimum support price. In a democracy, the solution of every problem is possible only through exchange of ideas,” he said.Hooda was in Bhiwani to attend a lecture conference on “Current Challenges of Democracy”.Replying to questions on recruitment scams later, Hooda said the government was trying to come clean on these scams, but the public wanted a fair investigation, not a clarification from the government.“During the BJP-JJP government, jobs are being sold like goods at the grocery store and yet the government is trying to cover up the whole matter,” he alleged. “This is why, instead of catching the shopkeeper who sells jobs, the government is making a ruckus by only catching the salesman. The Opposition is demanding that the government should get the entire scam investigated under the supervision of a sitting judge of the high court. If the government is telling that it is clean, then why is it hesitant to investigate the matter,” Hooda questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-must-accept-farmers-pending-demands-bhupinder-singh-hooda-101638735154800.html

He said only one third of the required specialist doctors had been hired, leading to work overload and inconvenience to patients.The doctors demanded that the decision for direct recruitment of SMOs be withdrawn immediately and the posts be filled through promotions.Dr Parmar said they will intensify their agitation by suspending OPD services on December 13 and will declare a strike from December 14, which may affect emergency services too, if they did not get any response from the government.The doctors ended the protest by handing over a memorandum to the local representatives of the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-doctors-protest-in-haryana-threaten-to-suspend-opds-101638735094994.html
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Agri laws repealed, farm agitation must end now||Chandigarh The three new farm laws promulgated in June 2020 have been repealed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a true statesman and shown more grace than ever before in apologising to the nation for the agony suffered by many as a result of persistent agitation. He assured the farmers and farm workers of their well-being in every possible manner. The farmer’s agitation, however, continues. The agitators are now fighting for the remaining demands, including a statutory MSP. During the eleven rounds of negotiations, the group of nearly 40 farmers’ associations kept changing their goal post, and as a result, the talks were inconclusive. The government has now unilaterally decided to remove the cause of unrest by withdrawing the laws. The central farm laws were enacted without consulting the stakeholders. However, these were stayed by the apex court. The farmers were thus not adversely affected. The agitation, however, reflected upon their apprehensions. The foodgrains were procured by the government at the MSP during the last three crops. In other agriculture operations, the business continued as usual without any hindrances. The input supplies remained normal as ever. The agitators who remained peaceful were not unduly inconvenienced. Despite provocations and violent incidents by some miscreants, the government exercised restraint and did not interfere. Repealing of central laws a bad precedent The repealing of central laws is a bad precedent. In a complex federal polity such as ours, central legislation on a matter that is the primary concern of the states should have been carefully crafted after due consensus among the stakeholders. Surely, this takes longer, but then that is the price we all pay for adhering to democratic values and systems. Most central legislations on subjects that are part of the state and concurrent lists of our constitution have been finalised after sustained deliberations. The recent examples are the Right to Education Act 2005, and the National Food Security Act 2013. The country debated these subjects for over decades. The persistent agitation against the laws, which have been undone, and the loss of lives in violence and even at the dharnas by the farmers was an avoidable tragedy. Uncounted loss of trade, business, and industry, including the travel, and transportation sectors, have caused a long-term damage to the economies of affected areas. There have been huge unrealised job losses. Even infrastructure development and other growth initiatives of the governments and the private entrepreneurs were hampered. The farmers are demanding compensation, but the government has also to care for the losses caused to the public exchequer, private businesses, and finances.In a country vying to reach an unimpeachable position in the world economy, such a situation is incomprehensible. Both the parties involved in the dispute need to rethink and find an amicable solution. The recurring losses to the people must stop. Some people may have a vested interest to continue the agitation, but society does not appreciate it anymore. The agitation must end now. Set up a tripartitepanel For the well-being of our next generations, the reforms must happen and these should happen fast. The farmers are not against reforms, but they wish to be part of the process of reforms. The onus is, however, on the government. It should consider all possible options. Continuation of existing MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy through an enduring legal framework; and quasi-procurement of other food crops by central agencies should help assuage the farmers about their apprehensions. A tripartite committee of the central government, the states, and the farmers may look into these issues. The committee should not only address the remaining issues but also reframe mutually acceptable laws with a clear roadmap for the future. The repealed legislation were well-drafted, but the concerns of the farmers, which reflect upon their social and economic security, are not insignificant. The political economy of the laws, ignored hitherto, should be deliberated comprehensively to bring something more innovative and people-friendly to the country’s statute book. Agriculture diversification plan neededAlongside legislative reforms, the government may also consider a comprehensive agriculture diversification programme (CADP) to infuse substantial investment in making agriculture more diverse and sustainable. The CADP may cover original green revolution areas, Punjab, Haryana, and Western UP, to promote alternative crops and develop agriculture and allied sectors to increase farmers’ income. The funds should be provided to the states based on their contextual requirements borne out of data and evidence. An empowered committee of experts under the Niti Aayog may monitor the implementation of CADP. The components of the program may include: Differential input incentives for alternative crops such as maize, millets, cotton, fruits, and vegetables, etc., market linked incentives (MLIs), including price deficiency support for alternative crops, earmarking a percentage of food cash credit limit for the purchase of alternative crops to enable the states in this regard with requisite financial provisioning, and development of diversification infrastructure such as cold warehouses, ripening chambers and farm-gate aggregation, storage, and distribution centers. Regulate crop production The government may consider establishing a statutory mechanism to regulate crop production. It shall ensure that the requirements of national food security are met, fully addressing the concerns of natural resource conservation, biodiversity, and climate change. There is no reason to allow a water-starved state like Rajasthan to produce water-guzzling paddy. Farmers’ capacity building and second-generation extension reforms should also be given a big push to promote alternative crops and connect the farmers with new markets.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jallianwala Bagh trustee picks holes in its revamp||Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust member Tarlochan Singh on Sunday questioned the revamp of the national monument and pointed out flaws in its redevelopment project that was dedicated to the centenary of the 1919 massacre.Visiting the memorial along with Chief Khalsa Diwan senior members, the former Rajya Sabha member said: “First of all, the entrance should have been kept intact. It does not make the visitor feel that he is entering a historical monument. It feels as if entering a theatre. So, its original look should be restored by putting up small bricks, which were used in old times.”Pointing to another “major mistake”, the former MP said that descriptions of various spots, including Shaheedi Khuh, have been written on the ground during the revamp and are illegible. “The newly installed wooden railing has started to break. It should be replaced with a steel railing. Also, there should be a proper facility of drinking water,” he said.Singh said that earlier there were portraits of those martyred in the massacre. “Now these portraits are in the store room. This is a sentimental issue and relatives of the martyrs are demanding that these portraits be brought back. Moreover, the list of the martyrs should be finalised and displayed,” he said.However, Singh, who is also the former chairman of National Commission for Minorities, praised the galleries established during the revamp. When asked if he was not consulted while finalising the facelift, Singh said: “I attended the meetings regarding the development, but the design of the revamp was finalised by the culture ministry and was not shown to us.”Social and leftwing organisations have been opposing the revamp, citing that the memorial’s heritage character has been destroyed in the name of facelift. Tarlochan Singh raises concern over defacement in AmritsarMeanwhile, Tarlochan Singh also raised the issue of massive defacement in Amritsar, which is a holy city and is being developed under the smart city project. “Once I entered the city, I saw big hoardings and banners by political leaders and others everywhere. They did not even spare the national monument of Jallianwala Bagh and covered a sizable portion of its entrance, which is an offence. I got it removed. Why isn’t such defacement banned on the pattern of Delhi and Mumbai?” he said.Singh, who recently receiving the Padma Bhushan for his services, was also felicitated by the CKD, including senior member Rajinder Singh Marwaha, and other local organisations, including the Amritsar Trade and Industries Association.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Regional buzz: A clueless BJP leadership in Punjab||With politicians from rival parties making a beeline for the BJP after the repealing of farm laws, the entire political operation appears to be carried out by the central leadership while the Punjab unit is always caught off guard when it comes to people joining the party. As has been seen in the recent days, it is just a few minutes before the press conference that the state leadership gets the information about these new entrants. In fact, when Akali leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa joined the BJP in the national capital, no Punjab leader was present at the press conference. One wonders if the central leadership does this because of its lack of trust in the state unit or because of doubts about capabilities of the Punjab leaders!Channi mocks Sukhbir over football skillsMocking Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi compared him with a football. Addressing a rally at Kotkapura last week, the CM said that after he played hockey, even Sukhbir tried to show his football skills in an attempt to imitate him.“Jado eh khed da si edaan nai pta lag reha si football kehdi aa te Sukhbir kehda aa. Meri reese nai honi ehde toh (While he was playing, it was hard to differentiate between the football and Sukhbir. He can’t imitate me),” remarked Channi. Last month, Channi played the goalkeeper in full gear while former Indian captain and his cabinet colleague Pargat Singh wielded the stick during the half time at the final match of a hockey tournament in Jalandhar. Sukhbir, who was in Phagwara for poll campaigning, played football in kurta pyjama at a local tournament. Congress leaders’ own goal Listing out his 60 achievements since assuming the office, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi last week suffixed “Ji” to Lakha Sidhana’s name while mentioning that he had met the gangster-turned-activist and listened to issues raised by him. Seen as an attempt to woo Sidhana’s supporters, the move, however, invited a sharp reaction from within the party. “Gangsters mutate into activists, then politicians… are openly courted by political parties. But Punjab doesn’t condone sinister attempts to barter its hard-earned peace for votes. AAP learnt it the hard way in 2017. Yesterday’s utterance show that some haven’t learnt the lesson yet,” former state Congress president Sunil Jakhar wrote on Twitter, without naming anyone. Rahul: Bhai or Boss?The recent meeting of Punjab Congressmen with party leader Rahul Gandhi evoked much interest. While sharing photos with the Gandhi scion on social media, state party chief Navjot Sidhu addressed him as “bhai” while transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring called him “boss”. Perhaps, it was an attempt to do away with the old ways of addressing the party’s supreme leaders and win over the younger generation.A deputy CM’s dilemmaThe home portfolio is consuming much of the time and attention of Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, while working of the cooperation department, which he had been heading already, has been apparently left to the bureaucrats. “As Punjab is a border state, law and order issues are very crucial; so I have to be on an alert always,” he recently told a reporter. When it comes to the cooperation department, he said he managed it by being in touch with the officers over phone, “as I could rarely reach out to them physically”. Moosewala’s poll ambitionsIn his Instagram feed, controversial Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who was inducted into the Congress a few days ago, expressed his interest in contesting the Punjab assembly elections from his home district Mansa. It has caused ripples among party leaders in this Malwa district, who are wondering from which seat the 28-year-old entertainer might get the ticket. The political novice, who was taken in the party fold with much fanfare, has a huge following on virtual platforms and is expected to be a star campaigner to attract the youth.When Sidhu left cops red-faced Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu recently addressed a huge rally organised by MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa in his constituency Qadian. While praising Bajwa, Sidhu said: “Whenever he (Bajwa) warns any inspector, they wet their pants.” The comment left the police officials, who were present at the rally, red-faced.Handicrafts pull crowds at Gita festivalHandicrafts of 19 states are the centre of attraction at the International Gita festival that kicked off in Kurukshetra.

Rathore during his Janjagran Yatra at Shimla said that Jai Ram Thakur-led regime was in a deep slumber and were woken up by this defeat.“It is now that they have opened their eyes and ears and suddenly have started seeing people’s problems and listening to their grievances,” Rathore said. He, however, reminded the public that all the announcements being made by the government were a gimmick as there is no budgetary provision to fulfill them. Changing tack to bypass gag After DGP Sanjay Kundu issued a gag order to prevent constables in Himachal Pradesh Police from airing their grievances on social media, the agitating cops have found a unique way to protest. The constables, who are protesting over disparity in pay, have blacked out their profile pictures on social media accounts. Meanwhile, their families have started a separate campaign, wherein they are positing their pictures with “Justice for HP Police” placards.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda DSP Romana relieved of charge||Gurjeet Singh Romana, deputy superintendent of police, Bathinda, was relieved of his charge on Sunday. The move came a day after the Hindustan Times highlightedthat Romana was continuing on the post even after his one-year extension was cancelled by the Punjab home department last week. Bathinda range inspector general of police (IGP) Jaskaran Singh said: “As per the home department’s orders, DSP Gurjeet Singh Romana has retired; so he has been relieved from duty and the additional charge of DSP-1 has been given to another officer.” Romana was holding the DSP-1 charge in Bathinda since July 2018. Considered close to some senior leaders in the ruling Congress, he was granted extension even as the Punjab government had scrapped the service extension policy for its employees from March 31, 2020. Romana retired on November 24, 2021. A day later, principal secretary (home) Anurag Verma issued an order, stating that the extension in service granted to Romana from August 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, stands cancelled with immediate effect on directions issued by the department of personnel. The senior cop had courted controversy in 2017 after he was accused of illegally releasing an accused in a drugs case. Departmental inquiries had found him guilty.

The family apparently wanted a ticket for former CM’s grandson advocate Simar Partap Singh Barnala from Dhuri segment, but the party fielded former Sangrur MLA Parkash Chand Garg instead. Meanwhile, Winnerjit Singh Goldy, who hails from Sunam, got the party ticket from Sangrur assembly segment. The party has also announced candidates from the other three seats falling under Sangrur district, leaving out the Barnala family.“We have called a meeting of party workers, who are attached with the Barnala family, in Dhuri . My son has worked hard. We have conveyed it to the party president that Simar Partap could have won the seat,” said former Dhuri MLA Gaganjeet Singh Barnala, who is the former CM’s son. However, playing down any signs of revolt, Gaganjeet said: “We are true Akalis and have Barnala Sahib’s DNA. We are devoted to service and one can serve the people even without becoming an MP or MLA.”The former MLA said that the family will listen to the party workers during the Monday meeting and inform party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal about their feelings.On the remaining three Sangrur district seats, the SAD has fielded former SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal from Lehra, former cabinet minister Baldev Singh Mann from Sunam and kabaddi player-turned-politician Gulzar Singh Gulzari from Dirba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-snubbed-by-sad-barnala-family-to-meet-supporters-101638732941039.html
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: MP Partap Singh Bajwa hints at contesting from Qadian||Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Sunday hinted at contesting the upcoming Punjab assembly elections from Qadian segment in Gurdaspur district, three days after the Punjab Congress president projected the senior party leader’s younger brother and sitting MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa as the nominee from this seat. The senior Bajwa on Sunday shared a post written in Punjabi on Facebook, in which he can be seen sitting in his SUV. The post reads: “Apni karam bhumi Qadian lai rawana hunde hoe. Punjab di rajneeti vich vapsi, jithe mera dil vasda hai (Leaving for my land of action Qadian. Returning to politics in Punjab, where my heart lives).” The post is being interpreted as a setback to Fateh Jung who on Thursday organised a rally as a show of strength and to kick start his poll campaign at Qadian. Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was the chief guest, had backed him at the rally, stating: “Fateh will win from his constituency with a huge margin”. However, Partap Singh Bajwa, who once represented Kahnuwan assembly segment that was largely subsumed by Qadian during delimitation in 2007, stayed away from the rally. Seeing him absent, Sidhu had also said in his address: “I am waiting for Partap Bajwa” Even in a Facebook post on Saturday, Bajwa had shared a letter addressed to him by Punjab PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla, in which the minister mentioned Qadian as “your assembly segment” while apprising him of progress in a road project there.These two Facebook posts and his absence from his younger brother’s rally have raised questions whether the former Punjab Congress chief is set to stake claim to the party ticket from Qadian, from where his wife Charanjit Kaur Bajwa turned victorious in 2012. According to sources close to the Bajwa family, if the MP is willing to contest the polls, Fateh Jung will himself step back.Earlier, Bajwa had started his political activities in Batala and announced to contest the polls from there, but got a jolt after then chief minister Amarinder Singh, who he had backed in the feud with Sidhu, resigned. With a change of guard, his two loyalists were removed as chairmen of the Batala Improvement Trust and market committee, days after he got them appointed to these posts. He ended his political activities in Batala with immediate effect. Attempts made to contact Bajwa for a comment over phone proved futile.
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Procurement: Centre’s curbs force Punjab to streamline system||The central government is gradually tightening the noose around the poor procurement system in Punjab, pushing the state’s food and civil supplies department to streamline the process that annually involves ₹60,000-70,000 crores for lifting of wheat and paddy crops during the rabi and kharif seasons, respectively. Officials in the Punjab food and civil supplies department and the four procurement agencies feel that the restrictions were in the offing for the past few years because discrepancies that had cropped up in the system were hitting the state’s finances severely. The whopping ₹31,000-crore legacy amount recovery imposed on Punjab is seen as a result of this mismanagement, for which the state is now supposed to pay ₹250 crores every month for the next 20 years. From open to restricted procurementThe state government was caught off guard when a communication from the Centre’s ministry of food and public distribution, at the very onset of procurement this kharif season, restricting paddy purchase from Punjab to 168 lakh tonne. The state may have purchased 188 lakh tonne this season, but so far there is no approval for extension in the total procurement. However, the Reserve Bank of India has allowed increase in the cash credit limit for paying the minimum support price of ₹1,960 per quintal on paddy. “There are apprehensions that it would become a practice in future, and the Centre might ask the state not to go beyond a certain quantity of food grain purchase in the upcoming rabi procurement as well,” said an officer of the state’s food department. The Centre has also put curbs on labour and transport charges. Contention over rural development fundNot giving any commitment on the rural development fund (RDF) in the provisional cost sheet for the paddy procurement than ended on November 3, the Centre’s food and public distribution ministry has asked the state government to justify the accruals. Punjab charges 3% RDF on the total procurement value each season, and expects to earn ₹1,100 crore through it in the kharif procurement that has just ended. The Centre raised objection to the RDF during kharif procurement last year, insisting that the state should use it only for the intended purpose — development in rural areas — and suggested that Punjab should bring corresponding amendments in the Act the governs its use. Notably, the state keeps the revenue generated from the RDF out of the state budget, and its major portion is spent as per the will of the dispensation. “The RDF is used as an exigency fund by the state government. When it is in a crisis, the future accruals are pledged to raise money from banks and financial institutions. Also, the flagship programme of the state government — farm debt waiver scheme — was funded by raising liquidity using the RDF, and reportedly future accruals have also been pledged. Previously, the entire Sangat Darshan cost was borne from the RDF,” said an officer of the state food department on anonymity. But, the Centre has objections to this “splurging” of the fund and wants it to be used only for development works in villages. The state so far has not amended the Act, leading to a hurdle in its release. The state finance department has also sought to audit the fund so that its use could be streamlined. Meanwhile, against 2.5% dami (commission) charged by arhtiyas (commission agents) on the MSP, the Centre has fixed it at ₹45.38 per quintal. “Though the dami fixed by the Centre didn’t make much of a difference to our earnings, it has sounded alarm bells for the future,” said commission agents’ association president Vijay Kalra. Other than the RDF, the state charges 3% mandi fee to manage the grain markets and procurement system, through its agency Mandi Board. Earlier, the Centre had stopped paying 5% infrastructure development cess charged by the state on procurement, which in present terms is an annual loss of ₹3,500 crore. Limit on per acre procurement The Centre has also started a system to fix procurement per acre. The instructions were rolled out by the Centre ahead of the kharif season, wherein the state was asked to link land records to the procurement portal, in order to give the average per acre paddy production in each district. “When you link land records to the procurement portal, it is suggested to fix the yield too, the Centre has been telling us,” said the food department officer. The current season has passed smoothly, as the crop arrivals from across the state were reported to be uniform, but it is to be seen how it pans out during future procurement seasons. “Some steps are to be appreciated, and will benefit Punjab, such as direct payment to the farmer and land record integration to check bogus billing and smuggling of paddy from other states,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. However, according to him, the Centre can’t raise aspersions on funds meant for the state’s development. “The RDF has been stopped unnecessarily. It is our tax. Why do you (Centre) want to change the state’s mandate?” he said. 
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP has found new allies in Amarinder, Dhindsa to promote divisive discourse: Punjab CM||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi alleged on Sunday that the Bharatiya Janata Party has found its new allies in his predecessor Amarinder Singh and Akali breakaway faction leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa for promoting its “divisive discourse” in the state.Channi’s statement came a day after Union home minister Amit Shah said the BJP was in talks with Amarinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who is the president of the SAD (Sanyukt), for an alliance for the Punjab assembly polls that are due early next year.“Punjab is one state that rebutted the anti-people and divisive agenda of the BJP and the charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019... The BJP used Shiromani Akali Dal in its anti-farmer agenda to implement the three black laws that the secular farmers agitation has forced Modi to repeal,” Channi said in a statement.The CM said that the SAD had aggressively supported these legislations, and now Amarinder Singh would function as the “full-time tool” of the BJP to implement its “nefarious anti-people designs”.“The interests of Punjab were mortgaged to the BJP by the Akali Dal first under the leadership of Parkash Singh Badal, who had paved the way for this alliance by extending unconditional support to Atal Bihari Vajpayee to form BJP-led government in 1996 that lasted only 13 days. Badal had betrayed Punjab and the Punjabis by extending unconditional support. That was a sell out by Badal of Punjab,” Channi further alleged. The SAD led by Sukhbir Singh Badal last year broke ties with the BJP over the farm laws issue.“Now Amarinder Singh is all set to perform that malicious role which he had been all along playing as the chief minister by coming to the rescue of the Modi government on crucial issues and in promoting anti-people agenda,” Channi alleged.After his unceremonious exit as chief minister in September, Amarinder Singh quit the Congress and formed his party Punjab Lok Congress for fighting the upcoming assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-has-found-new-allies-in-amarinder-dhindsa-to-promote-divisive-discourse-punjab-cm-101638732937553.html

Pargat, who represents the Jalandhar Cantt seat, was addressing a gathering at Partappura village in the district. He alleged that Akalis had committed “numerous sins” against the state and its people, and warned that Punjabis would never forgive them. Alleging that cable, drug, sand and transport mafia had flourished under the Badal family, Pargat said that they had “ruthlessly plundered” the state.“Now, they have to pay back for their sins, as people are waiting for the 2022 polls to teach them a lesson,” he said while addressing the gathering. The minister also laid the foundation stone of a ₹32-lakh sports park in the village besides handing over a cheque for ₹11 lakh to the panchayat for development works.Frustration leading to baseless allegations: SADReacting to Pargat’s allegations, former MLA Jagbir Singh Brar, who is the SAD candidate from Jalandhar Cantt, termed them a “total bundle of lies”.“It is frustration among Congress leaders in the face of an imminent defeat in the next polls that is leading to such baseless allegations against the Badal family. In the past five years, the Congress, especially Pargat Singh, has done nothing for the Jalandhar Cantt constituency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akalis-are-real-traitors-of-punjab-says-pargat-singh-101638732936035.html

Zoo in-charge Narinder Singh says the big cat was being allowed to roam the area on an occasional basis to help him acclimatise to its new habitat. “We wanted to see how Nav reacted on seeing a bus full of visitors in the zoo. He has shown some aggressiveness, which is expected,” said Narinder Singh.A zoo official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The animals need to be quarantined for some time, so that they can comfortably adapt to their new habitat.” Nav was scheduled to be shifted from Chhatbir Zoo in February last year, but the pandemic delayed the process.Second tiger at the safari Last year, two tigresses, Chirag and Ichran, had been brought to the zoo to revive its breeding programme. “Chirag was born at the Ludhiana Tiger Safari in 2008 to the two tigers we had earlier — Paras and Chorni. Ichran was also born in captivity at Bannerghatta Zoo near Bengaluru in Karnataka, and was later shifted to Chhatbir,” said Narinder Singh. However, the 18-year-old male tiger Mani was not keeping well, and soon died. Ichran, who was nearly 16 years old also passed away soon after. With the arrival of Nav, there will be two big cats in the zoo.The Tiger Safari had been thrown open to the public on July 20 after its closure in March 2020 due to the pandemic. Now, those found without mask in the zoo will be penalised. Spread across 59 hectares near the Jalandhar Bypass on the National Highway, the safari was opened in 1992 and has been a huge attraction for visitors since. Recently, the department had launched an animal adoption scheme under which any resident can adopt an animal or bird kept in the zoo by paying an annual care-taking fee, which will allow benefactors to avail a tax benefit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-tiger-safari-zoo-awaits-a-young-royal-101638731555901.html

The woman, who was unemployed for 10 years, gave the fraudster all her jewellery and savings to offer prayers and perform an online havan in the hope of securing a job.According to the MHB colony police, the woman, who stays with her elderly parents at Borivali west, gave the godman from Ayodhya a sum of Rs38 lakh over a period of four years as fees for performing the online ritual. The incident came to light on November 27 when the woman reached Ayodhya only to find out that there was no such godman living there who solved people’s problems by performing online havans.According to the police, the woman saw an advertisement while watching television in November 2018 wherein a godman claimed to solve people’s problems by performing online havans. It was at that point that she contacted the phone number provided in the advertisement and asked the godman to perform an online havan so that all her problems would be solved and she would hopefully get a job. Not only did the woman not get a job, she lost Rs38 lakh to the godman in fees. In November this year, she decided to visit the godman in Ayodhya and meet him in person only to find out that she had been duped. Upon returning to her residence at Borivali, Mumbai, she approached the MHB colony police and registered a complaint.A police officer from MHB colony police station said, “We are now on the lookout for an unidentified man and are scanning all websites and phone numbers that he has provided in his advertisement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/unemployed-woman-45-duped-of-38-lakh-by-fake-godman-101638731435747.html

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Pandemic scare, poor quality lowers cotton rates by ₹1,500 per quintal||The sudden dip in the global demand due to the pandemic scare and poor quality of raw cotton in areas of Punjab has lowered rates of the kharif crop by up to ₹1,500 quintal in the last two weeks.But farmers continue to get much above the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹5,925 per quintal.Industry watchers say in the last one month, mode rate or the maximum average price of the kharif produce was about ₹9,500 per quintal. It means 70% of the crop was purchased at around ₹9,500 and nearly 10% of the best quality produce was sold even higher than ₹9,500. And nearly 20% was sold below the mode rate due to poor quality.However, the mode rate of cotton in the last 10 days remains static at about ₹8,000 per quintal.According to the Punjab Mandi Board data, 9.57 lakh quintal of cotton was purchased in the state till Saturday. Of that, only 5,545 quintal produce was bought by the private players below MSP.Chander Kant Garg, a Mansa-based cotton ginner said this time the leading cotton-growing districts of Bathinda and Mansa saw the worst-ever quality of cotton. Garg said he has a stock of ginned cotton worth ₹3 crore but no textile unit is ready to buy it due to the quality of the natural fibre.“Reflectance (Rd) value that determines bright or dull a cotton sample continues to much less than the acceptable value of 72-82. The produce lost its white colour due to widespread pink bollworm infestation in the twin districts. Traders bought cotton at competitive rates to meet demand but now there are no buyers in the market for the yellowish cotton,” said Garg.Industry sources say rates may pick up again after December 15 as the picture of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron may be clearer and demand regains the momentum.Mandi Board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said this time the cotton arrival in the purchase centers across the rate was nearly 54% less in comparison with the last year.Last year till December 4, Punjab had recorded more than 21 lakh quintals of raw cotton whereas in the corresponding period this year is only 9.57 lakh. It is attributed to damage to the standing crop by the deadly pest, he added.“As per the traditional trend, cotton arrival picked up for the last week as farmers are done with wheat sowing. Now the daily arrival is about 15,000 quintals,” said the official.Director of Indian Cotton Association Limited, a body dealing in export, spinning, ginning of cotton, Rakesh Rathi said the textile sector in the USA has reduced importing cotton as per its economic decisions.“Cotton rates in Punjab were high since the beginning of the season as traders had to meet export demands.

Now the BJP government was ensuring development in the entire state, he said. Yogi Adityanath also visited Baba Keenaram Math in Chandauli on Sunday. Addressing a public meeting after gifting projects worth more than ₹30 crore to Chandauli, he said that the Samajwadi Party could not rise above casteism and nepotism when it was in power in the state and corruption was rampant in its tenure. “Bua-Babua (apparently referring to BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav) didn’t do anything for development of the state,” he said. Yogi said that at present, the money meant for development was being spent on developmental work only and problems of farmers, youth and women were being addressed. He said that farmers had brought laurels to Chandauli district. Three years ago, black rice was not produced in the district. But today 2,400 farmers were cultivating black rice on 2,100 hectares of land. Earlier, Yogi Adityanath took stock of the preparations regarding the proposed visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Swarved temple in Umrah area here on December 14. PM Modi is scheduled to participate in the annual function of Vihangam Yoga Samaj at Swarved Mahamandir Dham . Amid the sound of conch shells and chanting of Vedic mantras, Yogi was welcomed by Satguru Acharya Swatantradev Maharaj, Sant Pravar Vigyan Dev Maharaj and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma. Yogi inspected the first floor of Swarved Mahamandir and inquired about the ground, helipad, sitting arrangements and traffic arrangements for the followers of Vihangam Yoga. Lakhs of followers from across the country and abroad will participate in the function. Yogi held also a meeting with the BJP office-bearers and reviewed the preparations being made regarding the visit of PM Modi. He gave necessary instructions to the office-bearers.

06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fraudulent entries: VB arrests 2 Faridkot RTA officials for graft||The Punjab vigilance bureau (VB) arrested assistant transport officer (ATO) and junior assistant, then posted at the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Faridkot, for allegedly taking lakhs of rupees as bribe to issue vehicle registration certificates (RCs) and heavy motor vehicle driving licenses by making fraudulent backlog entries in the official record in 2018. The VB probe found that the fraudulent backlog entries in the official record caused a loss to ₹17.22 lakh to the exchequer in 2018. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), vigilance bureau, Faridkot, Raj Kumar Sama said after the probe in three complaints, it has been found that former ATO of Faridkot RTA Gurnam Singh (now posted at Mohali head office) and Amritpal Singh (suspended) took lakhs of rupees as bribe to issue vehicle RCs and HMV driving licenses by fabricating official records. The probe found that both officials used to take ₹25,000 to ₹30,000 as bribe. A total of 183 heavy vehicle driving licences were issued frequently, the VB probe found. “Besides, they also took bribes for issuing registration numbers of series PB04-V-9801 to 9900 and PB04-Z-9500 to 9900 without taking no-objection certificates (NOC) to 57 vehicles, which were registered in other states. This caused a loss of ₹6.36 lakh for issuing 183 HMV driving licenses and ₹10.85 lakh for issuing registration numbers to 57 vehicles,” according to the VB probe. A case under Sections 7 and 13-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at VB police station in, Ferozepur. VB to probe records of 2019, 2020 The VB will probe records of all registration numbers issued in 2019 and 2020, including the records of driving licenses. DSP Sama said that the VB has only probed the two series mentioned in the complaints. “The initial investigation has pointed towards the possibility of embezzlement of a higher scale, so we will investigate all records of 2019 and 2020,” he added. Faridkot RTA in centre of controversy The Faridkot RTA office remained in controversies during the tenure of Hardeep Singh (RTA secretary) from 2017 to 2020. A magisterial probe was ordered in January 2020. However, the probe report is yet to see light of the day. An official, seeking anonymity said the number of fraudulent backlog entries is much higher than the VB figures. After the magisterial probe, the Faridkot RTA also conducted a departmental inquiry in February 2020, in which revealed that 4,628 backlog entries of DLs were made between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 and 260 of these were suspended for violation of rules. During the same period, 855 backlog entries of RCs were found. Of these, 96 RCs were blacklisted on account of incomplete documentation and non-payment of taxes. Later, the Sangrur police booked then RTA secretary Hardeep Singh for issuing a fake licence.
06-12-2021||Lucknow||Mathura Police beef up security ahead of December 6||The Mathura police and administration are geared up to rule out any protest march or gathering in the city on December 6. Although all the major organisations and individuals have called off their plans for the day, the police have not lowered their guard. No traffic will be allowed on roads leading to Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah till Tuesday. Because of the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, police and administration, in a routine practice, remain vigilant every year but call given by organisations including Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) for ‘jalabhishek’ at the real birthplace of Lord Krishna claimed to be within Shahi Eidgah, adjoining Sri Krishna Janambhoomi is now keeping the police on alert. Although ABHM has withdrawn the call, the police are not taking any chances. Around 2000 police personnel, besides CRPF, have been stationed at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and Shahi Eidgah for Monday. Police forces have been called from nearby districts as well, and an eye is being kept on leaders and activists associated with movements related to Krishna Janambhoomi. Recently, Mathura police conducted an anti-riot drill at Police Lines to assess its preparedness under SSP Mathura Dr Gaurav Grover and district magistrate Navneet Chahal. “Section 144 of criminal procedure code is in force, and anybody violating prohibitory orders will be dealt with strictly. Police is fully geared to maintain peace and tranquillity and to instil fear amongst those having nefarious designs,” stated SSP Mathura. “Denizens of Mathura are being asked to cooperate in security arrangements by not becoming part of any unlawful gathering or protest march and staying away from nuisance makers interested in spreading rumours. Vigil is being kept on social media, and police cyber cell is all prepared to punish those interested in damaging peace and tranquillity in the city,” stated SSP. “Organisations and individuals have withdrawn their calls for any event in the area near Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah. No permission has been granted for any event. Any call for a gathering will be dealt seriously,” added Dr Grover. Mathura police and district administration has already stepped up the vigil, and those coming for namaz on Friday at Shahi Eidgah were allowed in only after checking their Aadhar card. A detailed traffic plan has been implemented to avoid congestion in the yellow zone area around Sri Krishna Janambhoomi. “We have mobilised adequate forces, including those from nearby districts for December 6. The city police will be assisted by PAC, beside the CRPF deployed at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and adjoining Shahi Eidgah. The city has been demarcated in eight sectors, four zones and two super zones for efficient monitoring,” stated Dr Grover. Police in adjoining district Agra is also on alert. National spokesperson for ABHM Sanjay Jaat complained that police reached his house in Agra on Sunday evening and he has been placed on an undeclared house arrest. There is a dispute over the land on which the Shahi Eidgah and Sri Krishna Janambhoomi are located side-by-side in Mathura. Various litigations are on in the civil courts of Mathura by Hindu organisations and individuals who allege that the Eidgah was built after the demolition of a temple by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb at the site where Lord Krishna was born.

Now, of course, all want to be seen as Ram Bhakts. This is the power of the people and of democracy that has forced all to tread this path,” he said while addressing a meeting of traders here on Sunday. Adityanath said since coming to power in UP in 2017, his government re-started Janmaashtami celebrations in police stations, celebrated Krishna Janmaashtami in a grand manner, Holi in Barsana, Deepotsav in Ayodhya and Kanwar yatra was allowed with all its grandeur. “A grand Ram temple is coming up in Ayodhya now,” he said. He said that for the BJP, the country came first. “In BJP meetings, we raise the chant of ‘Vande Mataram’. This can never happen in the meetings of Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. No party had the courage to scrap Article 370 due to vote bank concerns. In our time, Article 370 got scrapped and now a grand temple is also coming up in Ayodhya,” Adityanath said. “The Samajwadi Party calls us as a ‘bulldozer government.’ But our actions pain them the most as mafias enjoy that party’s patronage. I wish to make it clear that if mafia captures the properties of traders, then bull dozer will move for sure,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-those-who-ignored-hindutva-for-vote-bank-concerns-now-pose-as-ram-bhakts-yogi-101638730716728.html

Among the assurances are regularising contractual teachers and revamping the education system in the state if voted to power.Punjab goes to polls in early 2022 and the AAP is not leaving any stone unturned to make a decisive presence in the border state. Hitting out at Kejriwal, Sidhu said the Delhi government was following a contractual model of education.“Delhi Education Model is Contract Model … Delhi Govt has 1031 Schools while only 196 schools have Principals … 45% teacher’s posts are vacant and schools are run by 22,000 Guest Teachers on daily wages with every 15 days renewal of contracts,” Sidhu alleged in a tweet. The Punjab Congress chief said that there were 12,515 job vacancies for teachers in Delhi in 2015, but in 2021, the number had shot up to 19,907. He said the AAP government had been filing the vacant posts by hiring guest lecturers.“The AAP promised to regularise contractual teachers give equal wages as permanent staff but made it worse by just having guest teachers.

The average temperature is expected to hover around 15 degrees Celsius. Westerly disturbances in the hill areas, accompanied by cyclonic activities in the Bay of Bengal, will lead to a fresh spell of cold wave that is likely to cover most parts of the state in the coming week, according to Met officials. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in Lucknow jumped to 14.4 degrees Celsius which is 5 degrees Celsius above normal. The maximum temperature was recorded at 28.4 degrees (2 degrees above normal) on Sunday, according to Met data. “The spike in minimum temperature across UP is temporary and will subside in the next 48 hours as the western disturbances grow stronger,” said director of state Met department JP Gupta. The state capital experienced fog during the morning but the atmosphere cleared during daytime, providing a welcome relief. In view of the expected cold weather, the district administrations across the state have been asked to ensure arrangements of night shelters for the poor at various places. The lowest temperature in UP was recorded in Etawah where the mercury dipped to 8 degrees Celsius, 1.6 degrees below normal.

06-12-2021||Mumbai||50% psychiatrist posts in Maharashtra hospitals vacant||Maharashtra’s public healthcare system is facing an acute dearth of mental health professionals with more than half of the posts of psychiatrists vacant. Of the 177 sanctioned positions of psychiatrists in 34 districts across the state, 91 are yet to be filled, data obtained by Hindustan Times from the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) has revealed. These vacancies are across the state’s four regional mental hospitals located in Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Ratnagiri, as well as in all the district hospitals, which also house the teams of the District Mental Health Programme (DHMP) funded by the Centre and Prerna Prakalp, the state’s programme to address farmer suicides.According to the DHS, of the 85 sanctioned positions of Class I psychiatrists, 69 are currently vacant. All the 33 posts of Class II psychiatrists are filled. Under the DHMP, which is a part of the Centre’s National Mental Health Programme (NMHP), there are 41 sanctioned posts, but only 30 are filled while 11 remain vacant. Seven out of the nine posts under the Prerna Prakalp programme are also currently vacant. At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health issues, a shortage of mental health professionals in Maharashtra will have an impact on patients going undiagnosed and untreated. While a few may seek help from private practitioners, many would fall in the gap and never seek medical help at all. “We have been constantly trying to fill the vacant posts, but many of the psychiatrists who come for interviews don’t eventually take up the postings,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, director of DHS. “In order to tackle the shortage of psychiatrists, we have started mental health training for MBBS doctors from the primary health centres in districts,” she said. This training began in November 2019, Tayade said. One of the possible reasons for the vacancies could be that the salary bracket of psychiatrists in Maharashtra is lower than the Centre’s. The classes indicate seniority, work experience and qualification but some of the Class I positions have been vacant for the past several years. “Class I psychiatrists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) that falls under the Union Health Ministry will have starting salaries of about ₹1.5 lakh,” said Dr Arun Marwale, president of the western region of Indian Psychiatric Society, an organisation of psychiatrists in India with over 7000 members. In Maharashtra, the salaries of Class I psychiatrists start from ₹85,000 and Class II starts from ₹65,000. “Because of the lower pay, many psychiatrists prefer getting jobs in the private sector,” he said.Marwale said that the government should also ensure that postings are given in the doctors’ home districts. “Often, a doctor from the Marathwada region gets posted all the way in Konkan or vice versa. If the government shows some consideration in giving postings closer home, more doctors will be willing to join,” he said. Many psychiatrists HT spoke to said that their duty often includes administrative work. “Instead of attending to psychiatric patients, I spend more time visiting courts for medico-legal cases, visiting jails and giving out disability certificates,” said a Class II psychiatrist in a district hospital in the Marathwada region. District hospitals have one post of Class I and Class II psychiatrist each. But since he joined in 2016, there has been no Class I appointment. “Mental health ailments have increased tremendously over the years but the government is perhaps still not seeing the issue of vacant posts of psychiatrists as priority,” said Dr Javed Attar, a psychiatrist who has a private practice in Latur’s Udgir taluka since the past 11 years. “Contrary to popular belief, more patients have started coming forward to seek medical help after recognising signs of mental distress. Having more psychiatrists will help cater to this increased burden of mental illnesses,” said Attar. “A large number of people with mental illnesses, especially in rural Maharashtra are below the poverty line. When government facilities lack specialists, the patients are forced into the private sector, which they cannot sustain, and eventually drop out of the treatment,” said psychiatrist and Ramon Magsaysay Awardee Dr Bharat Vatwani. “The pandemic has worsened the financial status of people, and in absence of strong government health services, we are at the risk of an enormous number of patients dropping out of treatments or not being diagnosed at all,” he said.In a first, DHS analyses footfall at district mental health OPDs during the pandemics the pandemic tore through the globe starting March last year, with Maharashtra facing a high daily caseload and case fatality ratio compared to the rest of the country, the state’s medical machinery deployed most of its attention to containing the spread of Sars-CoV-2. This year, the state has also launched heightened efforts to ensure vaccination of all adults. In November, officials at the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) collated the number of people accessing mental health Out Patient Departments (OPDs) during the pandemic. And, in a first, they also collected the type of conditions that people were seeking help for. This was done to understand the pattern of patient footfall and design better interventions. The data collated by the DHS revealed that persons with schizophrenia topped the footfall in OPDs in the state: they formed 22.3% of the total footfall between April 2020 and March 2021 and 26.3% of the footfall between April and September 2021. The footfall is an indication of persons with previous diagnoses as well as those who are newly diagnosed. The footfall of those with anxiety disorders in both time periods was 14.6% and 12.7%, and the data showed an uptick in the footfall of persons with major depressive disorders — 9.9% to 12.7%. State officials said that the trend was similar in regional mental health hospitals, where persons with schizophrenia account for nearly 40% of the admissions even during non-pandemic times.Need for care The World Health Organization defines schizophrenia as a chronic and severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behaviour. Common experiences include hallucinations (hearing voices or seeing things that are not there) and delusions (false beliefs). However, a high OPD turnout or admissions do not necessarily mean a higher incidence of schizophrenia in the state. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease Study published in The Lancet Psychiatry, nearly 3.5 million people had schizophrenia in India in 2017. However, compared to other mental health diseases, its prevalence was still lower. The data showed that the prevalence of depressive disorders and anxiety disorders was around 3.3% and bipolar disorder was around 0.6% while the prevalence of schizophrenia was around 0.3%. A 2018 study carried out among youth in rural and urban parts of Pune showed that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among them was 54%, 60%, and 44%, respectively. Another 2020 study conducted among the farmers in the Vidarbha region showed that anxiety, insomnia and somatic problems were highest reported by farmers. In effect, the studies carried out in communities reveal that anxiety and depressive disorders are higher. The turnout at the OPD indicates otherwise — and there’s a good reason for it.“Schizophrenia patients get identified more easily compared to those with other mental health ailments, and are therefore more likely to be brought in for medical intervention,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, DHS director. “This is a common trend we have observed, even as the overall burden of mild to severe depression, anxiety disorders are likely to be much higher in the state compared to schizophrenia. The Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the situation,” she said. Identifying the problemIn 2019, the mahila mandal (local women’s organization) at Kalambi village in Nagpur received an unusual letter. A 39-year-old farm labourer man wrote to the local body complaining about his 21-year-old wife. “She wanders off, sometimes for days altogether. When she comes back home, she refuses to recognise me. She verbally abuses me for no reason. She refuses to cook, or do any household chores. I have no choice but to leave her,” he wrote. The organization responded by calling the couple for counseling. During one of the sessions, the farm worker said, the counselor noticed that his wife was talking to herself and was oblivious of what was happening around her. “The mahila mandal member told me that I should reconsider my decision to leave her and asked me to seek psychiatric counseling for her,” he said. In July that year, the man took his wife to the OPD of the rural hospital in Kalmeshwar, 10 kilometres from their village. The psychiatrist diagnosed her as having a condition called schizophrenia, which affects people’s interpretation of reality, and started her on medication. The farm worker continued to take his wife to the OPD, open to persons with mental health conditions on the first Tuesday of every month, even after the pandemic hit in March 2020. Three months ago, the doctor reduced her dosage. “Had the member of the mahila mandal not pointed it to me, I would have never known it was a mental health issue,” the husband said. “Relatives are more likely to get schizophrenia patients to seek medical advice as compared to patients with other mental health illnesses,” said psychiatrist Dr Bharat Vatwani, who runs the Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation in Karjat. Vatwani, who won the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2018 for his treatment and rehabilitation work, specialises in schizophrenia. “In most other mental health issues, the patient’s own productivity starts getting affected. It takes some time for the impact to be felt by the family. But in schizophrenia, the patients often drift into their imaginary world and their behaviour has an immediate impact on the family, often disturbing the emotional equilibrium of the members. Therefore, these patients are more likely to be brought in for medical help and relatives often take the lead,” Vatwani said. “The classic symptoms of schizophrenia make the disorder more visible, while other mental health patients struggle to verbalise their agony,” said psychiatrist Dr Sanjay Kumawat, who practices in Thane and Mulund and has worked with the state health department for nearly three decades. “There are many more patients of depression, anxiety, phobias, and other mental health issues that have increased over the years but are falling in the gap. A large number of these patients are perhaps not getting any medical support,” he said. The importance of treatment The DHS data is eye-opening in other ways. For one, it mapped the different kinds of mental health conditions that persons were seeking help for. It also revealed that the footfall was not constant. For instance, there was an uptick in persons with bipolar disorders seeking treatment (4.6% to 5% between the two time periods), as well as those diagnosed with mental retardation and even persons with addictions. The OPD’s also saw a lot of patients with epilepsy and dementia which are not mental health illnesses. “In some cases, relatives misunderstand symptoms of epilepsy and dementia as mental health disorders and seek OPD consultations. Such cases are counselled and directed to neurologists,” said an official attached to the state’s mental health programme. “A few patients of epilepsy and dementia may have underlying mental health issues such as anxiety, depression among others. Such patients are started on treatment at the OPDs,” she said. Tayade said that the DHS is keen to spread awareness about the need for early diagnosis and treatment to reduce admissions. “If mental health issues are treated early, patients don’t reach the chronic state where they may have to be admitted. We are in the process of intensifying our awareness campaigns so that people come to OPD early and start treatment instead of waiting until their disease progresses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/50-psychiatrist-posts-in-maharashtra-hospitals-vacant-101638729875348.html
06-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 2,000 pending traffic challans forwarded to dist courts||Ludhiana As many as 2,000 pending challans of traffic violation that were issued before September 30 have been sent to district courts following the orders of Regional Transport Authority (RTA). NS Dhaliwal from the RTA said that the challans have been shifted to the court as they were pending for a long time as no one was turning up to submit the fine. “We do not have any judicial powers to impound vehicles in case the traffic violator fails to pay the challan amount after the last day of submission of fine. The court can summon the traffic violator to submit the challan. After seeking the permission, the challans were shifted to the judicial courts for further decision,” said Dhaliwal.A transport department employee, requesting anonymity, said that most traffic violators, especially auto rickshaw drivers, do not generally appear before the RTA office as due to the revision in Motor Vehicle Act, the challan amount, especially for commercial vehicles, has increased many folds.Since regional licensing authorities do not have the power to remit or revise amounts, such challans are sent to the local magistrate to decide the issue. The move is being linked with the recent development where chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had ordered to waiver of challans for auto rickshaw drivers. Channi, during his impromptu visit to the auto rickshaw union site on Gill Road, had announced that new registration certificates will be issued soon to the auto-rickshaw drivers in order to prevent harassment.CM Channi had also announced that all the challans which are pending will be waived off. He had asked the auto-rickshaw drivers to follow traffic rules, and work honestly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-2-000-pending-traffic-challans-forwarded-to-dist-courts-101638729755911.html

06-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: AQI gets better as winds pick up speed, light rain likely today||The air quality in Delhi improved on Sunday, staying in the very poor category though, by 57 points on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index with a second western disturbance passing over the city improving both wind speed and temperatures -- factors that facilitate dispersal of pollutants, weather scientists and pollution forecasting agencies said.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast “very light rain” on Monday, and added that the national capital will witness drop in temperatures from December 8-9. According to IMD, the western disturbance, which is largely impacting areas near the Himalayas, is expected to bring snowfall to the higher reaches.Also Read| Delhi to form special task force to ensure enforcement of pollution normsDelhi recorded an AQI of 305 on Sunday, compared to Saturday’s 362 (very poor), according to CPCB’s daily AQI bulletin. R.K Jenamani, a scientist at IMD, said that wind speed will remain good even on Monday, with the withdrawal of the western disturbance from Tuesday onwards expected to change the wind direction to north-westerly, bringing colder winds towards Delhi. “The minimum temperature is expected to drop to around 9 degrees Celsius by December 8-9, and the maximum may touch 20 degrees Celsius by December 10,” he said.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 25.6 degrees Celsius on Sunday – one degree above normal, while the minimum at 11.4 degrees Celsius was two degrees above normal.Jenamani added that a mix of easterly winds and a wind speed of 5-8 km/hour helped dispersal of pollutants on Sunday. “Easterly winds are warmer, and the surface wind speed was largely steady through the day. Monday will witness a similar situation,” he said.Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the government forecasting agency, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), said air quality at some stations in Delhi is expected to touch the ‘poor’ category (AQI between 200-300) on Monday, following the impact of light rain on Sunday night and Monday morning. “Good winds, along with some light rain will further help pollutants to settle down. The AQI may come close to the ‘poor’ category,” he said.Also Read| Greenpiece: Rethinking smog and smog towers in DelhiIMD’s daily forecast shows Delhi is expected to record shallow fog on Monday morning with the maximum and minimum temperature likely to be 25 and 12 degrees Celsius respectively.The Early Warning System (EWS) for air pollution in Delhi also predicted that the air quality in the city may enter the ‘poor’ zone on Monday, and is likely to stay the same on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and Adjoining Areas on Sunday said action against polluting activities in the region has been intensified with the newly formed ‘Enforcement Task Force’ (ETF) holding daily review meetings with the 40 inspection teams and flying squads formed under them. The CAQM on Sunday said 12 inspection teams each have been constituted for Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, and four allotted to Rajasthan. It said the teams inspected over 140 sites in the NCR till Saturday.“Till December 4, 2021, more than 140 sites were inspected by the flying squads and based on the reports furnished by the flying squads, serious violations by various units are being identified for strict actions, including closure. Additionally, suitable actions against other non-conforming units is also been initiated by the Commission,” the CAQM said in a press release on Sunday.The flying squads have been asked to carry out surprise inspections at construction sites, industries, and transport hubs, and submit daily reports to the ETF and the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-aqi-gets-better-as-winds-pick-up-speed-light-rain-likely-today-101638727414375.html
06-12-2021||Delhi||From oddball to fugitive boss of north India’s biggest vehicle theft ring||Sharik was once a petty burglar who worked variously as a bus conductor in Delhi’s infamous blue line buses, a truck driver, and even a security guard. The 49-year-old man, now living in Dubai, has emerged as the kingpin of north India’s biggest vehicle theft operation.The name of Sharik alias Sata, son of a former Mumbai university professor, has come up thrice in the past six months, and twice in the past 20 days, during the interrogation of car thieves. They described Sata as their boss who allegedly takes “orders of vehicles needed“ from places as far as Manipur and Assam and gets his accomplices to steal them in Delhi and its adjoining states.On November 9, police arrested a man named Akbar Ali for stealing vehicles and selling them to buyers in West Bengal, Assam and Manipur. Ali told police he works for Sata and has sent at least 200 stolen vehicles from the national capital region (NCR) to those states in the past one year.The following week, when another police unit arrested a man in Manipur and recovered 14 Toyota Fortuner and Hyundai Creta cars, also stolen from NCR, the man said he worked for Sata.It wasn’t always like this.Until four years ago, Sata was one among many car thieves in the national capital. He was last arrested in 2018, and served time for three months before being released on bail. He then he went off the radar, said a crime branch officer, an expert on vehicle theft gangs.For a man missing for almost two years since he jumped bail following his arrest in November 2018, police heard Sata’s name in August when two men were arrested with counterfeit notes worth ₹4 lakh. The men were arrested from Sarai Kale Khan and said they were working for Sharik Sata, who worked from Dubai and was aided by Pakistani agencies.Sharik worked for the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan’s spy agency, and was tasked to circulate fake currency in India, Delhi Police had said in a statement on August 21, 2021.In the backdrop of these three cases since August that linked Sata’s name with fake currency and vehicle theft, police was not amused, given Sata’s abilities and his history of working at different places.“He has an interesting crime career and did all sorts of things before becoming a top vehicle thief in Delhi,” a Delhi police officer said while reading out Sata’s confessional statement when he was arrested in 2013 for stealing a car from west Delhi.Sata told police in his statement that he was son of a retired professor who taught Islamic studies in the University of Mumbai. “They are from a small place called Geeta Sarai, Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh. For some reason, Sata could not study and fell into bad company,” said the police officer, who had questioned him in the past.Sata told police that after dropping out of school in class 8, he started working as a labourer in Sambhal and then as a helper for a truck driver. It was at that time that he had come in touch with a man named Mohammed Noor from his village and started burgling homes. Records show he was first arrested for a theft inside a house in Moradabad in 1996.His statement, a copy of which was seen by HT, showed that he had come to Delhi in 1996 and worked as a truck driver at Randhawa Transport Company in Azadpur. After a year, he started working as bus conductor for blueline bus route number 19 between Jahangirpuri and Regal cinema.“During 1997 and 2000, he also worked as a field security officer for a security company in Greater Kailash. He wanted to increase his knowledge of topography of Delhi and these jobs were perfect alibi for him to roam in these areas of Delhi. While working as a field officer, he had come in touch with some vehicle thieves, with whom he got together and started stealing the vehicles at night. He initially worked for different gangs, but later formed his own gang,” reads the police’s report based on Sata’s confession in 2013.The police report quotes Sata as someone who recruited many people from Meerut and Sambhal to steal cars. Sata has allegedly divided the gang members in different groups.“They specialise in stealing SUVs, mostly cars such as Toyota Fortuner and Creta. He has divided the gangs in different states. In Manipur, when we arrested a man last month, we found out that he was a top car dealer there, who sold the stolen vehicles. We had recovered at least 10 Fortuner vehicles. He sells the stolen cars for as low as ₹10-12 lakh. He must be making crores of rupees,” said an officer, who arrested the Manipur resident last month. All the police officers declined to be named.Sata in his confession told police that said his real name was Sharik, but nobody called him by that name. In north India’s world of vehicle thieves, for the past one decade, he is known only as Sata. He also said there was a reason why he was called by that name. His friends started calling him Sata (60 in Hindi) because he could drive stolen vehicles at over 60km per hour even in the shortest of stretches.While different Delhi Police teams are at work to identify the gangs in north Delhi who work for Sata, the man has number of gangs working in Uttar Pradesh as well.He carries a reward of ₹50,000 by Uttar Pradesh Police for his arrest in the cases registered in that state. A crime dossier on Sata maintained by Delhi Police showed he has in the past been booked by Uttar Prades Police under laws such as the Gangster Act, Goonda Act and the National Security Act (NSA) of 1980, along with at least 45 othercriminal cases.“He is a smooth talker despite being a class 8 dropout. We won’t be surprised if the Pakistan agencies got in touch with him and are using his criminal network to fund their illegal activities here. Despite being booked under the NSA and the gangster Act, he has always jumped bail and gotten bigger,” an officer from the special cell of Delhi Police said.Explaining how dreaded Sata’s crimes are in his hometown, a Delhi Police officer shared an anecdote from 2018, when he had arrested Sata and accompanied him to different states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Delhi to recover the man’s loot. Police had found 51 stolen cars, a record seizure by Delhi Police that year.“We were taking him (Sata) to Moradabad to recover a car. I remember I got a call from a friend in Uttar Pradesh Police. He was furious that we (Delhi Police) had arrested Sata. They had informally issued a shoot-at-sight order on him. He was to be killed in a police encounter,” the officer said. “Maybe this is why he left India in 2018-19.”

And it’s not rocket science. There are solutions to handle much bigger crowds then (than) airport gatherings,” Sisodia tweeted.Also Read| India's Omicron tally rises to 21: Tracking the spread of new coronavirus strainDelhi airport officials said it was an old picture, and the situation has improved since 20 new designated counters were set up on Sunday to facilitate faster Covid-19 testing for passengers arriving from “high-risk” countries. The testing has been intensified in view of the emergence of the omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Following guidelines issued by the Union heath ministry on November 26, passengers from South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel and all European countries are now required to take an RT-PCR test on arrival at the Delhi airport, even if they produce a negative test result before boarding, or are fully vaccinated.A senior Delhi airport official, who asked not to be named, said, “We were observing that a lot of passengers were facing issues in paying for the test [RT-PCR] since they did not have enough Indian currency. So, they were registering for the test as well as getting the currency exchanged too. This was leading to some crowding. To fix this, dedicated counters have now been set up and passengers are being asked to pre-book their RT-PCR tests, so they can directly proceed to get tested,” the official said.For pre-booked tests, the payment is accepted online.“A significant number of incoming international passengers at Delhi Airport are pre-booking their Rapid/RT-PCR tests. This number of pre-bookings has been going up ever since the latest testing norms have come into practice. These dedicated counters will help ease the process further for passengers,” said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the airport operator.On Sunday, Delhi reported its first confirmed omicron Covid-19 case, with a 37-year-old man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania was found to be infected with the new variant. The patient has been isolated at the Lok Nayak hospital. A 40-bed separate ward has been created at the hospital for dealing with cases of the new variant.Also Read| Delhi’s first Omicron case a 37-yr-old man with mild symptomsDelhi health minister Satyendar Jain, who announced the first case on Sunday, said that banning international flights is the most effective way to contain the spread of the omicron variant. “Delhi receives the maximum number of flights from abroad, so Delhi is at the maximum risk. The central government should accept the demand made by [Delhi] chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and ban the flights coming from all the countries affected by the omicron variant at the earliest,” Jain said.Some passengers who arrived from the at-risk countries on Sunday complained that it was taking almost two hours to get the RT-PCR test done, and there were no signages to facilitate the travellers.“People got into queues but they were later told that it was meant were for pre-booked tests. They are doing a decent job, but they need to organise it better,” the passenger said while coming out of the airport on Sunday morning.The first airport official quoted above said signages were placed on Sunday to guide passengers to the dedicated counters, and inform them about the registration process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-scare-sisodia-slams-covid-tests-rush-at-delhi-airport-101638727235629.html
06-12-2021||Delhi||Mastermind of gang involved in extortion arrested in Delhi||Delhi Police on Sunday said it has arrested the mastermind of a gang which allegedly honey trapped their targets and extorted money from them by posing as police officers.Police said that the racket had been operating for over 18 months, adding that raids are being conducted to catch the other gang members.Police said they came to know of the racket on November 29 when they received a complaint at Paschim Vihar police station by one of the victims who lost ₹3 lakh. “When this case was reported, we immediately formed a team to look into the matter. It was established during the investigation that the accused persons had taken a flat on rent in the Paschim Vihar area to run their illegal activities. The flat was identified and the landlord examined and we received some sketchy details about the tenants. Based upon initial leads, the main suspect was identified as Neeraj of Bahadurgarh in Haryana,” said additional commissioner of police (crime), Dheeraj Kumar.“A trap was laid and on December 3, Neeraj was apprehended near PVR Cinema in Prashant Vihar. Several stolen items and a handwritten script used to blackmail the targets were recovered from his possession,” he said. According to police, the gang had five members, including two women who were used to honey trap the victims. Explaining the modus operandi, an officer said the women befriended people on social media and after exchanging numbers, start video calling them. The women would later ask the targets to come to a pre-decided location where the other gang members, posing as policemen, would carry out a fake raid.“The gang members posing as ‘policemen’ then threaten the victim of exposure and extort money -- in the range of ₹5-10 lakh -- from him,” said Kumar. Police said that Neeraj and five gang members including two girls decided to honey trap victims and extort money from them. Neeraj is the leader of the gang. His gang has committed sextortion from more than a dozen victims in the past one and a half years. They have extorted Rs. 5 – 10 lakhs from each victim, based on his paying capacity.The gang began its activities just before the first lockdown, police said. The accused used to create a social media profile in the name of the girl and sent ‘friend requests’ to their targets. After confirmation of the request, they used to chat with their victims, through the messenger, pretending to be a girl. Once they obtained the mobile number of the victim, they sent obscene content to lure him, police said.The lady member of the gang made a video call to further entice the victim. The gang extracted complete details from the target to assess his paying capacity. Once they were convinced about the financial background of the target, the lady member of the gang would invite the victim to a pre-decided place.“After the first meeting, when they decided to meet again, the other members of the gang used to barge into the room posing as policemen. The victim was led to believe that the police had raided the place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mastermind-of-gang-involved-in-extortion-arrested-in-delhi-101638727234449.html
06-12-2021||Delhi||25 commercial spaces sealed in EDMC crackdown on property tax defaulters||Intensifying its action against property tax defaulters, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has sealed 25 commercial properties and issued show cause notices to another 12 commercial units over pending taxes.A senior official from the joint accessor and collector department of the civic body said they have already conducted a survey and prepared a list of habitual tax defaulters in the commercial category, adding that the drive will continue in the coming days.“It has come to notice through the survey that a large number of commercial property holders such as banquet halls, baraat ghars, hotels etc. have not paid their property tax. In view of this, a drive has been launched against the defaulter commercial property holders. The action during the first week has been taken in areas surrounding Sonia Vihar,” said the official.According to the official statement issued by the civic body, 170 warning letters have also been issued under section 123 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act against property tax defaulters.EDMC spokesperson Rakesh Gupta said that during the last one week, EDMC has received ₹8 crore as property tax. The official data from EDMC shows that during the current financial year, the corporation has received only about ₹127 crore of the ₹350 crore target it had set for itself.“We are hoping to cross the ₹200 crore mark by December end. A large number tax payers choose to file their returns in the last months of the financial year, around February-March. The current drive will focus on commercial properties which are spread over an area of more than 1500sq ft,” said Gupta.Noting that the financial situation of the civic body is not good, EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal appealed to the traders and large property owners to pay their share of taxes. “Property tax and conversion charge are the biggest internal revenue sources for the East MCD and we are not at all targeting those properties which haven’t paid their taxes for just one year. These units have tax payments pending from 5-15 years. We do not want to seal properties but people should come forward to submit their fair share,” he said.While delivering the annual budget on November 26, 2021, commissioner Vikas Anand had also stated that the EDMC is going through a financial crisis which was made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic.The extent of the financial stress in the civic body can be gauged from the fact that over 80% of EDMC’s expenditure is spent on staff salaries. Moreover, the civic body derives over 59% of its revenue from grants and allocations by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25-commercial-spaces-sealed-in-edmc-crackdown-on-property-tax-defaulters-101638727054221.html
06-12-2021||Delhi||Sangwan gang sharpshooter arrested from near Kakrola village in outer Delhi||Delhi Police has arrested an alleged sharpshooter of gangster Kapil Sangwan’s gang, who was absconding after coming out on bail in a murder case in May this year, from near Kakrola village in outer Delhi.Police said they also recovered a semi-automatic pistol and five cartridges from the possession of the suspect, identified as Deepak Dhankar (27), on Friday.During questioning, police said, Dhankar allegedly claimed that he was in the advanced stage of planning an operation to murder one of his rivals during a court hearing. Police said the alleged operation would have been similar to the September 23 murder of Delhi gangster Jitender Gogi inside the Rohini court by two gunmen who posed as lawyers to gain entry into the court building.Police said that on Thursday, they received a tip off about Dhankar’s plan to visit to Kakrola village.“The information was that he would be in a Celerio car on Thursday afternoon. A police team laid a trap and started looking for him. At around 2pm, we spotted Dhankar in the car and signalled him to stop, but instead of stopping, he took out a pistol, pointed it at the police and tried to flee. However, we managed to intercept the vehicle and arrest him,” said a police officer aware of the details.Police said Dhankar is a key member of the Kapil Sangwan gang and has been involved in the killings of rivals in the Manjeet Mahal gang.The Manjeet Mahal gang is embroiled in a decade-long feud with the Sangwan gang. The two gangs, operating in parts of western and outer Delhi and Haryana, are involved in cases of robbery, extortion, land grabbing and contract killings. While Mahal is in jail, Sangwan is suspected to be managing the gang from outside India.The special cell’s deputy commissioner of police, Jasmeet Singh, said at least eight people have died in the gang wars between the two gangs. “Dhankar was involved in the murder of Mahal’s father, Sri Krishan, who was shot dead near his house in Mitraon, Najafgarh, in January 2017. The killing was a result of Mahal killing Sangwan’s brother-in -law, Sunil alias Doctor, in December 2015,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sangwan-gang-sharpshooter-arrested-from-near-kakrola-village-in-outer-delhi-101638726634568.html
06-12-2021||Delhi||Skywalk, Minto bridge widening part of New Delhi railway station revamp||The elaborate revamp plan for the New Delhi railway station will also include widening of the Minto bridge and skywalks near Ajmeri Gate to manage the increased traffic volume in the surrounding areas, officials aware of the matter said.An official from the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) who asked not to be named said that the road owning agency has already prepared a proposal for the project.A second official who is associated with the corridor redevelopment project stated that the traffic and transport interventions are likely to be completed by 2025. “We have taken approvals from 15 agencies, including DDA, municipal corporation, PWD, etc involved in various aspects of the project [revamp of the station] and are awaiting the final approval from UTTIPEC (Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure Centre),” the official who also asked not to be named said.According to the plan, one of the carriageways under the Minto bridge -- from Connaught Place to the Civic Centre -- will be widened by three metres. “The single carriageway at the Minto bridge is currently 14 metres wide and we plan to widen it to 17 metres. This will be carried out by using box pushing technique,” said an official requesting anonymity.The Minto bridge, rechristened Shivaji bridge, was built during the British rule in 1926 as part of the realignment process of the railway line for New Delhi railway station. The waterlogged Minto bridge has become synonymous with the failure of Delhi’s drainage network during monsoons.The official stated that the expansion work will be carried out by the railways but the maintenance of the bridge, including the drainage network, will continue to remain with the public works department.The official overseeing the traffic and transport infrastructure plan finalisation stated that the traffic survey and mapping of the entire peripheral area around the railway station has been carried out to design specific interventions.For instance, the skywalk at Ajmeri Gate junction has been proposed to connect the Gate number 3 of Metro station with both sides of Desh Bandhu Gupta road and Kamala market using two foot overbridges (FOBs) meeting at right angles. The skywalk will be further connected to the three arms of the FOBs with entry-exit points provided at Garstin Baston road and Asaf Ali Marg.“Despite the increase in traffic volume, enough space has been demarcated to keep the region pedestrian friendly. The road right outside Gate 1 of the railway station will have a seven-metre-wide footpath and junctions have table top crossings,” the official added.Currently, more than 450,000 passengers visit the New Delhi Railway station daily and over 170 million passengers annually. The projected increase in peak hour passenger volume (number of passengers at the station per hour) is likely to range from 45,000 to 55,000 in the next two decades.Professor Sewa Ram, who teaches transport planning in the School of Planning and Architecture, said that they have carried out studies to ascertain accessibility and walkability near the New Delhi railway station towards Ajmeri Gate.”There are several problems in terms of accessibility in the immediate vicinity of the station. Agencies should learn from the interventions made around the IGI airport. The station redesigning should incorporate accessibility benchmarking as the influence area of the station extends up to ITO, Paharganj and Connaught Place,” he said.Prof Ram said that the Minto bridge also acts as a gate for the traffic circulation and its widening may lead to faster movement of traffic and creation of new congestion point towards the railway station. “We need an entire transportation system management plan for the influence region with separate provision for segregated pick up and drop areas,” he added.HT had reported in August that the RLDA plans to invite request for proposal (RFP) from nine firms for the redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station (NDRS), India’s largest and second busiest railway facility.The redevelopment plan, estimated to cost around ₹14,000 crore, will be implemented in two phases and will be based on the Centre’s Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy. Of the 160 acres of land where new developments have been proposed, work on around 85 acres will be taken up in the first phase at a cost of ₹6,500 crore.In the first phase, the railway development body plans to construct a 70 metres high dome-shaped building (infinity tower), 40-storey twin towers and business district, providing office and commercial space, multilevel car-parking on either side of the station (Paharganj and Ajmeri Gate) for 5,000 vehicles, retail hub, pedestrian boulevard, etc. It will also upgrade the road network around the station.The revamp of the New Delhi station, which handles approximately 450,000 passengers daily (160-170 million passengers annually), has been going on since 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/skywalk-minto-bridge-widening-part-of-new-delhi-railway-station-revamp-101638726394355.html

The owner Saddam Khan, 31, who has studied in England says the European ambience of his café is intentional.“Europe’s café culture, especially the cafes in historic districts, fascinated me a lot. So, when I returned [to Delhi], I wanted to open the first European-style café near Jama Masjid, with foreign tourists in mind. Locals have more than made up for the lack of tourists during the pandemic. Our café is a hit and we are making decent profits, ” says Khan.Jama Masjid area, known for hundreds of outlets offering Mughlai food such as kebabs and Nihari, is undergoing a quiet, invisible transformation as a food destination, thanks to many upwardly mobile youngsters who are opening new fine dining restaurants and European-style cafés. Their trendy outlets offer not traditional nihari or kebabs, but a variety of pasta, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas and waffles, coffee and shakes.Interestingly, Aarish Khan, 21, who in September started The Delhiites Café , another bistro-style café, in the crowded motor market in front of Jama Masjid, says 70% of his clients are locals, many of them elderly, who are now addicted to his Mojito and Italian sodas. “ The elderly here have never savoured these drinks before. Now, they simply relish them and have become our repeat customers. In our café, the elderly and the young can be seen enjoying a mocktail together late into the night, ” says Khan, 21, who is studying law at Jamia Millia Islamia.The outlet opens after nine in the night. “That is when the motor market shuts and the locals hang out with their friends and families,” Khan says.In fact, not just cafes, but several new fine dining restaurants with a focus on ambience, quality of services and cultural events are also coming up in the area. Shahi Mehfil, opened in October, has the look and the feel of a grand walled city haveli, its walls boasting information panels and photographs of Jama Masjid and poetry of Ghalib and Iqbal-- and the restaurant’s co-founder, Mehtab Raahi . A map of the walled city showing all its gates is built into the ceiling design.The new addition to the Jama Masjid food hub also offers small cabins with floor-sitting, Afghan style. “Visitors here often complained about a lack of comfort, hygiene and quality of services. We wanted to change that,” says Mehtab Raahi, managing partner of the restaurant, who used to run the heritage walks in the walled city before he decided to open a restaurant.Raahi, also an aspiring poet, says he wants to make his restaurant a hub of cultural sits in, starting with one on Ghalib’s on the poet’s birth anniversary on December 27. “ I believe that time has come for the Jama Masjid restaurants to reinvent themselves. Many youngsters of the walled city who are opening new eateries and cafes are well- travelled and educated, and they realize this,” says Raahi.The area is witnessing not just new restaurants, but many old restaurants are either redeveloping themselves or opening their new outlets, with focus on décor. Aslam Chicken, famed for its chicken tikka all over Delhi, for exampling, is building its new restaurant in the area with a trendy ambience.Besides, Arshad Ali Fehmi, who started the famed The Walled City, a rooftop café and restaurant is now is opening another restaurant. “We are opening a new contemporary multi-cuisine restaurant, where you can relish both the Mughlai and the Mexican dishes in great comfort and convenience,” says Fehmi. “I believe that Jama Masjid has a great potential to become a restaurant and café hub. The government should now clean up and decongest the area like they did Chandni Chowk.”Abu Sufiyan, who runs Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein, a digital platform that promotes the history, culture and cuisine of the walled city, says the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk has made local youngsters change their perception about the area. “It has promoted a sense of belonging and pride and opened up new hospitality and tourism-related business opportunities. They believe cafes have strong social and cultural connect and are a good business opportunity, too. At least about a dozen new cafés and restaurants are set to open in the coming few months,” says Sufiyan.He adds that the new cafes are marking a shift in the social life of the walled city. “People in old Delhi have always liked to hang out late in the night. But unlike in the past when they sat outside shops, they now like to come together in the cafes and restaurants, which is also fuelling the growth of such outlets in the area,” Sufiyan says.Rajeev Goyal, a chef and founder of India Food Tourism Organisation, a non-profit that works to promote food tourism in the country, says there is a need to develop a food tourism ecosystem in the area, where cleanliness and congestion continue to be big issues. “But yes, all these new ventures will help Jama Masjid area realize its huge potential as a food tourism destination,” he says.
