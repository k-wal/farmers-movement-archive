In other words, 37.2% of the BJP’s Lok Sabha MPs were OBC, 14.1% ST and 17.4% SC. This meant that 68.9% (209) of its 303 Lok Sabha MPs elected in 2019 were non-upper-caste, and from castes that were traditionally considered lower down in the caste hierarchy. This is strikingly on par with the widely accepted national share of the population of these castes: 69.2%.

In his speech, Biden warned about the impact on democracy of “autocrats [who] justify their repressive policies as a more effective way to address today’s challenges.” Those autocrats draw much of their support from their countries’ inequality. The poor resent the gap between them and the prosperous.
