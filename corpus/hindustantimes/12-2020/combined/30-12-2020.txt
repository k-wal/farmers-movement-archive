30-12-2020||News||Challenges ahead for the judiciary||The cusp of a New Year is best to look back critically on the past while dreaming for the future of our judiciary. Demant said that dreaming permits every one of us to be safely insane every night of our lives. For a country like India, it is a bigger crime not to dream than to dare to dream. Andrew Jackson spoke of the core, saying all rights “are worth nothing, and a mere bubble” unless “guaranteed by an independent and virtuous judiciary”. American federal judges, though political appointees, exhibit fierce independence mainly because of their lifetime appointment. In the absence of that, our judicial system must strain that extra sinew to alter the changing perception about that organ over the last few years. A few aberrations are enough to create that perception which, especially in judicial matters, is more important than reality. Each time a former Chief Justice defects to the political arena or a sitting judge showers fulsome praise on the PM, (whether in 1986 or in 2019), that core value and perception are a casualty.Each time the executive plays favorites qua lists of prospective judicial appointees, exercising its powers of delay—examples of Justices Kurian Joseph and Akil Kureshi  being only two out of many—judicial independence is compromised. Whenever the collegiums fail to immediately and within days reiterate its original recommendations, it allows the executive to go scot-free and emboldens future aberrations, apart from causing irreversible prejudice to the victim and sends a clear negative message to others exercising independence. The judiciary’s unassailable weapon that a reiterated recommendation has to be implemented, without executive discretion, should never be forgotten. A single contempt notice to the law secretary (alas never exercised ) for the many motivated delays in clearing a reiterated recommendation would magically change perceptions. Similarly, judicial transfers are meant not for the individuals concerned but to send a larger message to the fraternity: Keep in line or we have the power of transfer. It also underlines the failure of the collegiums in protecting their flock with speed and ferocity. Secondly, beating the backlog and winning the war against arrears has to be the legitimate wish list of that judicial organ which globally has the most penetrative powers of judicial review. It has to keep moving aggressively towards the interlinked A, B, C, D of judicial reform where A stands for Access, B for backlog, C for cost and D for delay. Nani Palkivala famously said :” While it is true that justice should be blind, in our country it is also lame. It barely manages to hobble along. The law may or may not be an ass but in India, it is a snail: it moves at a pace which would be regarded as unduly slow in a community of snails.”The tragedy of numbers is matched only by the simplicity of solutions. In September 2019, out of the approved judicial strength of all the 24 High Courts put together (1079), there were 40% vacancies (414). The district and lower judiciary similarly (in December 2018) had about 20% vacancies (5,135 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 22,677). India, with 1.3 billion plus people, has an abysmal judges-per-million-of-population-ratio: from 10.5 judges per million in 1987, it has crawled to a miserly 19.13 in 2019. Collegiums, having monopolised appointments and transfers, are duty- bound to devise a simple flow/time chart to ensure that movement of files at each level is monitored by a designated judge in each court and does not exceed the stipulated time period for each rung of the ladder. Unfortunately, having identified suitable names, we start a dangerous cocktail of local bar politics, judicial politics, personal rivalry and petty egos. We, as a people, must also change.Why we have hardly used the constitutional power to have a large additional number of ad hoc judges under article 224A of the Constitution till the backlog is cleared, defies logic. It provides a ready-made pool of known and reliable judicial talent, tried and tested. Indeed, article 224A permits even retired judges from one HC to be appointed to another HC. It is a forgotten constitutional power, rarely used in the apex court and never used in High Courts!Thirdly, there is a silent alternative dispute resolution (ADR) revolution taking place across the country, which must be accelerated exponentially. Immediate enactment of a state-of-the-art, futuristic mediation framework, languishing in Parliament, will ignite this revolution, which, despite expanding Court annexed and ad hoc mediation, is pitiably inadequate without statutorily created insignias of excellence. A report I was privileged to co-author led to Section 89 in our Civil Code in 2002, providing a menu of ADR options. We need legislative reform including respectable remunerations to expert, accredited mediators. Their step-motherly treatment compared to the swashbuckling litigator or the blue-eyed corporate lawyer, must stop. The clogged arteries of our legal system can only be declogged by an efficacious ADR bypass.My wish list is interminable but the discipline of space circumscribes even positive dreams for the New Year.Abhishek Singhvi is a sitting, three-term MP; an eminent jurist; former chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee; and a former Additional Solicitor General The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/challenges-ahead-for-the-judiciary/story-F2sSCXwqby34DPmj6CkepI.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Despite lockdown, no respite for Hindon, Yamuna from pollution this year||Noida: Yet another year comes to an end with Gautam Budh Nagar continuing to be the district of two dying rivers.While experts call it ‘an opportunity missed’, the condition of two rivers – Hindon and Yamuna — which flow through a patch of the district is back to the square one as all the good that lockdown had incurred has been reversed.According to the reports of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), while Yamuna was found to be highly polluted despite lockdown this year, the condition of Hindon worsened with more coliform content signalling higher dumping of untreated sewage into it.This year too, both the rivers continue being rated under category ‘E’ making it unfit for drinking, bathing and fisheries, despite conventional treatment and disinfection.According to the data (till October), Yamuna had a dissolved oxygen (DO) level while leaving Noida was 1.0 mg/l against 3.4 mg/l while entering (minimum requirement of 4 to 6 mg/l), against 0.3 mg/l (exit) and 2.6 mg/l (enter) last year. For the month of September and October, the DO levels in Yamuna in Noida was nil. For Hindon, however, DO has been consistently nil throughout the year.Hindon starts to lose DO from an average of 1 mg/litre at Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad to nil by the time it reaches Noida and meets Yamuna. This year, however, it managed to sustain its DO levels a little further till Chijarsi village, Ghaziabad till it became nil by the time it reached Kulsera bridge, Noida.Apart from that, Hindon also saw higher levels of total coliform content this year, against last year.“Dissolved oxygen level is basically the life of the river, which being nil means that the river is virtually dead with water unfit for any consumption. Whereas higher levels of the total coliform shows that high volume of sewage is flowing through it,” said Rashmi Verma, senior policy fellow, department of science and technology (DTE) of the central government.The average total coliform levels in the river Hindon for 2020 was 8,67,143 most probable number (mpn) /100ml against 2,56,667 last year. The permissible limit for total coliform ranges from 50 to 5,000 mpn/100ml Hindon emerges from Shivaliks and enters the district after travelling over 300 kms. Throughout its 50 kms of length across the district, with scope of revival and before it disappears in almost equally polluted Yamuna, the water quality only worsens after being fed by untreated effluents being discharged from industries and illegal colonies, experts said.“There had been no efforts either at administrative or local levels to improve the condition of river Hindon, while the pressure like sewers, etc. had been mounting. As the exploitation of Hindon and excessive load due to the population and industries would continue, there has to be a serious plan to improve it, else next year the condition of river would worsen,” said Vikrant Tongad, Noida-based environmentalist.Meanwhile, even as Yamuna enters the city at Okhla Barrage with some life in it and an average DO value of 3.4 units this year (1.7 mg/l in September), it almost dies at Tilwada in Greater Noida where it meets Hindon.According to the experts, condition of Yamuna is back to square one. “We can’t even visualise what Yamuna had been during a lockdown as it’s again highly polluted and back to square one. All the effect of lockdown has been worn out. There were two reasons that Yamuna revived during lockdown -- reduction in industrial waste and also due to western disturbances the river received fresh water due to rains,” said Manoj Mishra, environment activist who leads the campaign, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.He, however, still sees some scope of improvement in both Hindon and Yamuna.“There had been some takeaways from the lockdown which is that the rivers can revive if there is a flow of water and that the industries have to be upgraded in such a way that they have zero liquid discharge. Only this way we can revive both Yamuna and Hindon,” said Mishra.According to the officials, the river requires flow and the illegal colonies need to be regularised.“There has to be a sustainable flow in the river to improve dissolved oxygen levels. Also, the sewers have to be tapped to reduce faecal and total coliform. There are several illegal colonies along the Hindon and they are direct contributor to its pollution. For Yamuna, the Kondli drain that comes from Delhi and meets Yamuna at Tilpata that further worsens the pollution levels. There are plans being made with local agencies in loop and we hope for some improvement within next few months,” said an official at UPPCB on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-despite-lockdown-no-respite-for-hindon-yamuna-from-pollution-this-year/story-Z6outoQHiDMTX6vj0gkcWI.html
30-12-2020||City||Ludhiana: Today is last day to submit property tax without penalty||The last day for submission of property tax for the year 2020-21 without incurring penalty is December 31. From January 1, the municipal corporation (MC) will slap a 10% penalty on defaulters’ taxes. As per the information, there are around 2.7 lakh taxable properties in the city and over 1 lakh property owners are yet to file the tax return.Officials said that apart from submitting the tax at MC suvidha kendras, residents can also pay their taxes online on the MC’s website - www.mcludhiana.gov.in. An official, on condition of anonymity, said, “This year, a large number of residents are yet to submit the tax as many of them suffered a financial setback due to the pandemic. Managements of different malls have also not paid taxes. Therefore, the MC has not been able to meet the recovery targets this year. The MC has only recovered around ₹63 crore against the annual recovery target of ₹130 crore.Vivek Verma, MC superintendent, property tax wing, said, ”The civic body is sending text messages to and calling up residents to remind them to submit their pending tax to avoid a penalty. Reminder notices have also been served.”  “Residents will have to pay a 10% penalty after December 31, and if they fail to pay the tax by March 31, a 20% penalty along with 18% annual interest on the pending amount will be imposed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-today-is-last-day-to-submit-property-tax-without-penalty/story-8GUvqUuGsBEWAfew2zegbO.html
30-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana BJP unit seeks FIR against MP Bittu||Accusing Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu of making inflammatory remarks to disturb peace in the state, the district unit of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) sought an FIR against him on Wednesday. While BJP leaders led by district president Pushpinder Singal submitted a memorandum with the office of the commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal, members of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) staged a protest outside Bittu’s official residence near Rose garden. The protest rally was led by BJYM state president Bhanu Pratap and district president Kushagar Kashyap. Heavy police force was deployed to stop protesters from reaching Bittu’s house.The BJP, who blamed Bittu of trying to malign protesting farmers, also urged the police to include Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code in the FIR as Bittu allegedly took responsibility for attack on BJP state chief Ashwani Sharma. Singal said,”Bittu has been continuously been making inflammatory remarks, which will disturb peace in Punjab. Recently, he said ‘there will be uncountable corpses if farm laws are not repealed’. Such statements may result in riots.”Meanwhile, Bittu slammed the BJP for trying to ‘torpedo’ the farmers’ agitation. Bittu said, “Rather than express solidarity with farmers, BJP leaders are protesting against me in Punjab. I am merely supporting the farmers and will continue to do so. If the BJP is concerned about farmers and peace in the state, they should come to Delhi and take a stand against the Union government. They are clearly pulling a political stunt as they know my house in Ludhiana is vacant as I am protesting in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-bjp-unit-seeks-fir-against-mp-bittu/story-7dHziIZTaDGZu6IkzxlbLN.html
30-12-2020||Noida||After talks with government, farmers to continue protest at UP Gate with ‘key issues’ remaining||Ghaziabad: After the sixth round of talks between the protesting farmer unions and government representatives ended on Wednesday evening on a positive note, the farmers protesting at the UP Gate border expressed satisfaction over the development but said that the “key issues” of the rollback of the new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP) still remain to be resolved. Leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that they will continue with their protests at the UP Gate till their main demands are not met. While the talks between the union leaders and the government were underway in Delhi, Chaudhary Naresh Tikait, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), held a ‘Mahapanchayat’ at the UP Gate and said that he had spoken to the farmers’ leaders who were part of the talks with the government. “We had asked the farmers’ leaders to make way for ‘faisla’ (decision). Earlier, I had said that we are ready to take two steps backward if the government draws two steps back. Now, I say that we are ready to take two and half steps back. So, we have also told our leaders that there should be a soft approach for reaching to a decision,” Tikait said. He, however, reiterated that if there is no decision on farmers’ main demands, the protest will continue and the farmers will move afoot and on tractors as part of “Dilli Chalo” call on the Republic Day. “If talks fail, we will move to Delhi even if they fire at us. With the stern stance of the government, farmers are also getting tough. They adopted tactics but the farmers did not bow down. If the government is incurring losses due to farmers’ protest, our farmers are also incurring losses,” Naresh Tikait, added. The farmers have been protesting at UP Gate since November 28 and the their number over one month has now swelled to about ten thousand at the site with the protesters occupying the place in tractor-trolleys, temporary shelters and tents. Most of them have come from UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar after Wednesday’s meeting said that consensus has been reached on two issues out of four and the next meeting will be held on January 4. Tomar also said the union leaders kept insisting on the repeal of the three farm laws, but the government side tried to explain to them the benefits of the Acts and sought to know specific problems faced by the farmers. On farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee for procurement at MSP, the minister said the government has already said that it is ready to give a written assurance. “It is good that the talks have progressed and we have our focus on repeal of the three farm laws and a new law on MSP. Till these demands are met, farmers will stay and continue with their peaceful protest,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand. Earlier in the day, Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of BKU, before leaving for talks, said that no one at any of the protest sites at Delhi borders was ready to make amendments to the new laws. “I found no one who was ready for amendments. The farmers in villages are spearheading the protests and they are not afraid of guns. The government has two options – to repeal laws or fire at us. So far, we have only demanded repeal of laws and not asked them to vacate seat. In the world, whenever such revolutions have taken place, the governments get toppled. We have not said such things and only demanding repeal of three laws,” Rakesh Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-talks-with-government-farmers-to-continue-protest-at-up-gate-with-key-issues-remaining/story-l2sc1rk76B4EDUViaan79K.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Noida’s air quality slips towards New Year’s Eve||Noida: Noida and adjoining areas’ air quality began to slip on Wednesday. Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida had “very poor” on the day, which was “poor” for the last two days. According to the weather analysts, the drop in temperature, a slight rise in humidity and calm winds made matters worse for the three cities. Experts and pollution monitoring agencies said that the air quality is likely to worsen on New Year’s Eve. “Wind speed has dropped due to which the dispersal of the pollutants has become difficult. Also a number of places across national capital region (NCR) are experiencing cold waves with minimum temperatures around 3 degrees Celsius and maximum temperatures about four degrees below the season’s average, this makes ventilation even more difficult as the colder winds trap the pollutants. The condition will persist till January 2 and pollution levels may stay high,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting centre, Skymet. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500 on Wednesday was 302 or ‘very-poor’ against 258 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 315 against 272 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 310 against 283 a day earlier. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate further. “Due to the cold dry north-westerly winds and a fall in minimum temperature is likely in the region and a gradual decrease of surface wind speed is forecasted. Very calm surface winds along with low boundary layer height will lead to extremely low ventilation conditions on 31st and 1st January. AQI is forecasted to deteriorate to the high-end of the Very Poor category by 31st Dec. AQI may touch the Severe category for a shorter period on New Year’s Eve. Very Poor to Severe AQI is forecasted on 1st January. Calm wind low ventilated condition is likely to extend for the first few days of New Year,” said SAFAR on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-slips-towards-new-year-s-eve/story-FyDznVJuyQWHXWcS4CwvpK.html

30-12-2020||Noida||Noida sees sharp decline in street crimes this year||Noida: Street crimes such as robbery, snatching, and vehicle theft have declined by up to 60% this year in the Gautam Budh Nagar district as compared to the last year, shows the police commissionerate’s data released on Wednesday. However, cases of cyber crime went up by over 30% this year, the data showed.With regards to crimes against women are concerned, cases of rape have gone down by 61%, but the dowry deaths are up by 48%. Also, cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act went down by 30% (from 121 last year to 85 this year), the data showed.The decrease in the number of crimes can be attributed to the “aggressive” policing in the district, senior police officers said. The police commissionerate system was launched in GB Nagar on January 13. Addressing media during the maiden annual press conference on Wednesday, commissioner of police, Alok Singh, said, “Despite the challenges of the pandemic like border sealing, migrant movement, and awareness drives, among others, policing in the district has been aggressive, resulting in reduction in street crime and more action against organised crime.”According to the police data, from January 15 to December 15 this year, there were a total of 2,316 valuables-related crimes (like snatching, theft, pickpocketing) as against 4,406 last year, registering a decline of 47%. Similarly, there were 398 cases of bodily harm (like murder, kidnap, attempt to murder) this year as compared to 511 in 2019 (a reduction of 22%). The maximum reduction was seen in the number of rape cases, from 89 last year to 35 this year.The police officials said that assets worth over Rs 100 crore have been attached under the Gangster Act this year. As compared to last year’s 82 encounters in which 150 criminals were arrested, 135 encounters have taken place this year in which 244 criminals were nabbed, the officials said.When asked about the lockdown effect on the crime cases, the police commissioner said that crime during the lockdown increased manifold in many districts of the state.On the sharp decline in rape cases, deputy commissioner of police (woman and child safety), Vrinda Shukla, said, “There have been arrests in all registered rape cases. Charge sheets have been filed in all and we are working on fast tracking them. However, dowry death cases this year have gone up from 25 last year to 37. We are working on providing necessary counselling in such cases. Since May, 7,000 women have been provided assistance in domestic violence cases.” The officials said that cyber crime in the district is on the rise and efforts are being taken to handle the situation. “Cyber crime this year went up from 3,050 to 3,956. To curb it, experts are being brought in, training is being provided to personnel and awareness is being created among public,” said Luv Kumar, joint commissioner (law and order).The traffic police department is also working on improving the situation in the district. “The personnel strength has gone up from 421 in 2019 to 513 this year. We have identified 33 black spots and are working on eliminating them all while PRV personnel have also increased from 307 in 2019 to 448 this year. Also, more than 1,000 people have applied for traffic volunteers,” said Ganesh Saha, DCP (traffic).The officials said that focus has also been on the smuggling and circulation of narcotics in the district. While in 2019, 856 kg narcotics worth nearly Rs 37 lakh were seized, the figure went up to Rs 64 lakh this year with the seizure of 2,093 kg of drugs.Over 290 police personnel have contracted Covid-19 so far and three policemen on active duty died due to coronavirus, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sees-sharp-decline-in-street-crimes-this-year/story-hsvQ6cYtwXZFGMcPBq7OYO.html
30-12-2020||Chandigarh||The year of the pandemic: Panjab Agricultural University charts its own course||Confronted with a contagion, labour crisis, staff strike and contentious farm reform bills, the year 2020 was no walk in the park for Panjab Agricultural University (PAU) officials. Undeterred, the university went on to embrace the virtual medium, promote alternative techniques of sowing, win national and international recognition and support the farmers’ cause. After the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, the university reached out to students virtually. It also successfully organised the first-ever virtual Kisan Mela in September. When travel restrictions led to paucity of trained farm labour across the state, experts from the university, under the aegis of director agriculture MS Bhullar, proposed the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique for sowing, which was met by widespread scepticism. However, all detractors were silenced when the farmers reported a bumper crop. The university is on the verge of expansion with the state government deciding to set up PAU Colleges of Agriculture at Ballowal Saunkhri village in SBS Nagar and Kalanaur in Gurdaspur.Teaching and non-teaching unions staged agitations against the varsity authorities and demanded regularisation of contractual employees , implementation of the old pension scheme for employees recruited before July 9, 2012, bringing the grade pay of library and meteorological attendants at par with lab attendants, promotion of employees, and filling up of vacant positions. Though the employee union staged a 60- day strike, and Punjab Agricultural University Teachers’ Association (PAUTA) president HS Kingra went on a marathon eight-day hunger strike, no committee has been set up to consider the demands so far. With the ongoing agrarian agitation on the border, principal soil chemist Varinderpal Singh refused an award, a gold medal and citation during a function in New Delhi and PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon submitted a report compiled by the economics department to the Punjab government, highlighting flaws in the three farm laws.In June, the university’s name cropped up in a seed scam after it was found that Brar Seed Store near the university’s Gate Number 1 managed to procure and sell a large quantity of uncertified paddy variety seeds (PR-128) from the institute’s Ladhowal Seed Farm. This raised questions over the sales protocols followed by the institute. An investigation was ordered and a few were arrests made.Amid hue and cry over farm fires in Punjab contributing to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), a study carried out by department of climate change and agricultural meteorology head Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu found that stubble burning in Punjab was a localised problem that did bot add to air pollution in New Delhi or the NCR. Rather, the practice affected the health of farmers and their kin, especially children, the study found. In November, days after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in New Delhi announced it had found a solution to the paddy stubble menace in the form a bio-decomposer, PAU scientists said microbes in the form of a decomposer were not the answer. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, had developed the decomposer. “Microbe-based technologies, promoted and widely advertised, are being offered as stand-alone interventions. It is, however, clear that the application of microbes needs to be integrated with machine-based solutions,” said Shammi Kapoor, dean, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, PAU, in its study. Kapoor and additional director research GS Manes have also submitted a study to the vice-chancellor, which says a multipronged approach is the only way to manage stubble burning.The university’s first virtual Kisan Mela that was held on September 18 and 19 was carried out successfully. Punjab chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurated the fair, in which 2,65,740 men and women participated. Panel discussions (paddy straw management and direct seeded rice technology), technical sessions and field demonstrations were some of the major highlights.The ‘PAU Live Programme’, which takes place every Wednesday on Facebook and YouTub, has received an overwhelming response from farmers of Punjab and adjoining states. Over 40,000-50,000 farmers view it. The programme was started to apprise and guide farmers about improved crop varieties, their production-protection technologies, allied agriculture occupations, and weather forecast. Interestingly, the programme also became a hit in Pakistan, where several agricultural science students and farmers have become avid viewers of this programme and routinely post questions to experts. Training programmes on diverse aspects of agriculture such as integrated crop production, crop residue management, mushroom cultivation, beekeeping, jaggery making, preservation of fruit and vegetables, soybean processing, bakery and confectionery products were also held.PAU alum and United Nations World Food Programme Representative and Country Director to India Bishow Parajuli won the Nobel Peace Prize for his world food programme. Harjit Singh Sandhu, senior investigations advisor, World Food Programme, Rome, Italy, is also an alumnus of the Ludhiana-based university. Rattan Lal, a PAU alumnus and trailblazer in soil science, was conferred with the World Food Prize 2020.Baljit Singh, a PAU alumnus and incumbent dean, veterinary medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has been selected to lead USask (University of Saskatchewan) vice-president research office.Professor Zora Singh, a PAU alumnus and foundation professor post-harvest horticulture, department of agriculture and environment, Curtin University, Perth, was named the ‘2017 Innovator of the Year in Western Australia for his commendable research work.The university secured the first position among state agricultural universities and second position among agricultural universities and institutes in the 2019 ranking of agricultural universities by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi.It also ranked 192nd in the ‘6th Annual US News Best Global Universities’ rankings for the year 2020. PAU is the only university from India to have made it to the list in the area of agricultural sciences.The Mohinder Singh Randhawa Library was conferred with “J-Gate CeRA (Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture) Best Usage Award 2020” by the ICAR, New Delhi in the North Zone for the third consecutive year.ICAR conferred the maize section of the department of plant breeding and genetics with the ‘Chaudhary Devi Lal Outstanding All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) Award 2019’. The maize team of PAU is led by JS Chawla, principal maize breeder and in-charge maize section, and includes principal maize breeder Surinder K Sandhu, senior agronomist Mahesh Kumar; senior entomologist Jawala Jindal; senior pathologist Harleen Kaur, and maize breeders Tosh Garg, Gagandeep Singh Bajwa, Rumesh Ranjan and Ashutosh Kushwah.Satnam Singh, Entomologist (cotton), Regional Research Station, Faridkot, was awarded the prestigious International Future Food Beacon Fellowship, hosted jointly by Rothamsted Research and University of Nottingham, UK.Gaurav Kumar Taggar, senior entomologist (pulses), department of plant breeding and genetics, was honoured with ‘Indian Society of Pulses Research and Development (ISPRD) Recognition Award 2020’ for his endeavour to pursue excellence in education and science, and making significant contributions in the areas of host plant resistance to insects, especially, the assessment of pigeonpea resistance to pod borer complex. Besides, three scientists of the pulses section — Upasana Rani, senior plant pathologist; Asmita Sirari, plant pathologist and Harpreet Kaur, agronomist were elected as Indian Society of Pulses Research and Development fellows.Principal pulse breeder Inderjit Singh and senior plant pathologist Upasana Rani bagged the second prize for the poster presentation for their respective papers during ICPulse 2020 ‘International conference on pulses as the climate smart crops: challenges and opportunities’ organised by ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur at Bhopal from February 10-12, 2020.

The remaining 14 commercial projects have turned defaulters due to the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the realty sector, said the officials.“We issue permission for registry of commercial space in a shopping mall only if the developer deposits lease rent. Since April this year, no commercial allottee came forward to deposit the financial dues except one due to the pandemic. Only Spectrum Mall has obtained permission for lease after depositing the dues,” said Kumar Sanjay, Noida authority’s officer on special duty who looks after the commercial department.As per the rules, once a commercial project is ready, the developer has to first obtain the occupancy certificate and subsequently it has to deposit lease rent to the Noida authority to seek permission for executing registry in the name of property buyers. The authority said that the promoter of Spectrum Metro has deposited ₹17 crore lease rent.The Noida authority has been struggling to recover around ₹500 crore financial dues from commercial projects, the officials said. As a result, many property buyers are unable to get the registry done, they said.Amit Kumar, executive director of Spectrum Metro project, said, “Right after getting the permission, we started registry to buyers on Tuesday. Now, our buyers can get their registry done in the project that has around 6 lakh square feet commercial space ready.” Property buyers of Spectrum Metro project have expressed happiness. “We are so fortunate that we can get our registry done for the space in Spectrum Metro during this tough times. We are happy at getting our commercial space on time,” said Rashmi Bahl, a buyer of Spectrum Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-effect-only-one-commercial-project-manages-to-get-permission-for-registry/story-sm8zlfOpHXRlB805ERmqfO.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Property transfer charges may be uniform in three industrial bodies||The Greater Noida Authority board on Wednesday gave in-principle approval to a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme proposal allowing property allottees who had defaulted on payment to settle dues without penalty. The Authority also proposed to cut transfer of memorandum (TM) charges by up to 50%. Narendra Bhooshan, Authority’s chief executive officer (CEO), said the proposals were introduced during the 121st board meeting to provide relief to those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.OTS schemePeople who have residential plots, residential plotted house, industrial plots, commercial plots and IT-enabled plots but have defaulted on dues of all kinds, including water supply fee, lease rent, land cost dues and other non-compliance penalties, would be able to avail the scheme’s benefits. The board forwarded it to the state government for its approval before implementation.TM ChargesThe authority levies 10% of total property cost as TM charges while selling a property in Greater Noida. With 70,000 individual plot owners and 600,000 flats in Greater Noida, TM charges form a significant revenue stream.While the authority proposed to cut it, a final decision was kept in abeyance. This is because the board decided to ensure uniformity in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway regions. They recommended a committee be formed with members from the three authorities to decide on the matter.The Authority board also approved a proposal to make it mandatory for all defaulting builders to open an escrow account for each realty project so that the authority could monitor their finances and recover dues. It also approved a decision to acquire land for industrial development and to expedite the allotment of plots to farmers who gave land for it.The board meeting was chaired by Alok Tandon UP infrastructure and industrial development commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/property-transfer-charges-may-be-uniform-in-three-industrial-bodies/story-qLFc41jN2xJ6Oti0uDAUwN.html

30-12-2020||Noida||After Meerut, second case of new Covid-19 strain found in Noida||A 33-year-old woman on Tuesday became the first person in Noida to be found infected with the new strain of the Covid-19 virus.She had returned from the UK, where the strain was first detected, on December 18 and is a resident of sector 50. After she was detected with the new strain, she was quickly transferred to an isolation centre where she reported a fever, but her condition was stable. She is the second person in the state to be found with the new strain. A day earlier, a two-year-old girl was found to be infected with it.Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY said that she is among the two UK returnees who tested Covid-19 positive. “In the district, 189 people who had returned after December 8 had been tested with the RT-PCR method. The other one to test positive was a 28-year woman from Greater Noida and she also has been admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Institute of Medical sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. However, she doesn’t have the new strain,” he said.The DM said that health officials had traced three primary contacts of the 33-year-old woman and their samples tested negative for the virus. “We’ve also traced 28 other people, identified as secondary contacts. Their test reports are awaited. Till then, all of them have been asked to be on home quarantine,” Suhas said.He also said that there is no need to panic. “We should must adhere to all the Covid-19 safety protocols like facemasking in public, maintain social distancing and use sanitizers,” he said.The Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that altogether 260 persons have returned from UK after December 8. “While 43 of them have gone on holidays, the other 28 are living in other states despite having addresses of Gautam Budh Nagar district in their passports. We have cross-notified to all the districts concerned, where they are living presently,” he said.The new variant, referred to as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01), was detected in that country earlier this month and was reported to be more transmissible. The Indian government suspended flights from the UK from December 23. Several people who had travelled from that country over the last few days too had tested positive although it was not immediately known whether they had the new variant of the virus.The state government had issued guidelines that said that all such persons who arrived from the UK since November 28 to December 8 will be kept under surveillance for 28 days and tested with the more accurate RT-PCR method if they develop symptoms. Those who arrived after December 8 will have to mandatorily undergo the test. Both groups of people will have the option to be isolated at home till they receive their test report.The SOP requires those who have returned from UK on or after December 9 to be mandatorily tested. If found positive, their isolation will be continued and the sample will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to sequence the viral genome to figure out whether it is the new variant. If confirmed to be the new variant, the patient will be shifted to a separate ward at the districts’ Covid centre. Those found positive with the older variant will have the option of following home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-meerut-second-case-of-new-covid-19-strain-found-in-noida/story-l4A6sgM6VhU7HQx7epx5zH.html

He cited his visits to rural areas of Shimla where many houses were gutted. He said that houses in villages; especially in hilly areas, are made up of woods and more susceptible to fire.“Every panchayat should have a rainwater reservoir. It will help fire tenders in refilling their tanks. And fire tenders do not get a water source for refilling,” he said.The distance of between fire spots from fire station is also a cause of concern. “If all panchayats are provided with fire extinguishers, villagers can start fire fighting operations in time. Containing fire, in the beginning, will help reduce the losses,” the minister said.In many cases, people could not start fire fighting as neither there was adequate water nor any other equipment and they had to wait for fire tenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/construct-rain-water-reservoir-provide-fire-extinguishers-to-avoid-fire-incidents/story-wAmQI1gyNQWCcYfyPwKDzO.html
30-12-2020||Gurugram||War on Covid must go on in New Year: Experts||Over the past 10 months, Gurugram has witnessed nearly three Covid-19 waves since it reported the first case on March 16. The total tally has now reached 56,634 cases. From the first Covid-19 case reported in March — a 26-year-old woman who came back from Malaysia — to series of lockdown lasting for nearly 75 days, the city has witnessed several ups and downs while tackling the pandemic. At present, although the average daily cases have come down to nearly 243, health department officials believe that there may be another wave with the drop in temperature and the winter season setting in. In March, the Covid-19 cases were mostly linked with travel history. They were reported from the condominiums and residential societies. A couple of new infections were confirmed every day. On March 24, a complete national lockdown was announced for 21 days. During that time, Delhi’s Nizamuddin emerged as one of the Covid-19 hot spots due to a religious congregation, which allegedly acted as a superspreader event. Some of the people who attended the event were traced back to Gurugram through active police surveillance. By April, the infection began spreading in crowded areas of the city. Covid-19 clusters started emerging,including Jharsa, Sirhaul, Dundahera, Jyoti Park, Khandsa and Sector 12, among others. In May alone, at least 713 new infections were recorded. It was the first wave of infection despite the lockdown getting extended, first till May 3 and then till May 17. But Gurugram, despite having the highest number of cases in Haryana, gained relaxations in lockdown, for being in the relatively safer “orange zone” category. Until the third phase of lockdown till May 31, Gurugram reported almost 24 new cases every day. By then, hospitalisation started increasing, as a result of which, three big private hospitals of the city came together to run the Medeor Hospital in Manesar as a designated Covid-19 facility.Rapid uptick in casesThe Covid-19 death count which was at least 15 in May drastically surged to 91 in June.The city was hard hit by a Covid-19 wave that month, with the total tally breaching the 1,000-mark on June 2. Within a month, more than 4,000 cases were confirmed, escalating the tally to almost 5,347. Cases were doubling every four days, indicating that the infection was spreading at a faster rate. Considering the surge, Delhi-Gurugram borders were sealed with only those having a movement pass issued by the district administration being allowed to commute between cities and states. In June alone, 86 deaths were confirmed, which is the highest till now in a month.Likewise, the hospitalisation reached 567 — the highest so far. The bed capacity in private hospitals was raised from 600 to almost 1,428. At least 25% beds was reserved in 35 private hospitals. To tackle Covid-19 crisis in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) region was treated as a single unit by the union ministry of home affairs to maximise the bed capacity for Covid-19 in the region. Unlock and rapid antigen testingThe downward trend in the test positivity rate started in July and August at a time when nearly 20-50% of the overall tests started being administered through rapid antigen kits. Although the test delivers test results in 30 minutes, it fails to give accurate results every time. Data shows that in July, out of the 71,167 tests administered, nearly 20% were through rapid antigen testing. It increased to almost 50% in August when the total tests declined to 63,132 cases. Overall, by July-end, almost one lakh people were tested for Covid-19. During this time, the Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) emerged as a point of contact for all Covid-19 tests to increase the testing numbers. Camps were being organised in all 19 UPHCs. Cases in August crossed the 10,000-mark and at least 10 deaths were confirmed that month. As the rate of hospitalisation fluctuated between 77 to 378, the health department opened the first plasma bank at Rotary Blood Bank, Sector 10, to support seriously ill patients of Covid-19. Third Covid-19 waveFollowing the various phases of unlock, the festive season and poor mask discipline, Gurugram witnessed a third wave of infection from the end of September. At least 293 cases were confirmed every day that increased to 300 by October and 653 by November — the highest number of average positive cases in a day since the outbreak of pandemic. Testing was subsequently increased with more than one lakh tests being administered in a month. The antigen testing, however, came down to 20% with the more reliable RT-PCR or Rapid Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests taking precedence. In December, the positivity rate plunged from 12% to 5%. Meanwhile, the state government decided to administer maximum number of tests every Saturday. Increased testing, stricter enforcement of mask discipline and the end of the festivities led to the gradual decline in the number of cases, starting early December. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said, “Another surge in Covid-19 cases can be expected. In order to bring it under control, it the department is continuing with increased testing in different areas of the city. Apart from routine testing, the number of testing camps has also increased.” Even though Covid-19 is currently on the wane in Gurugram, with active cases coming down to almost 900, health department officials believe that the district can be hit once again by another wave, following a dip in temperature next month. The union ministry of health and family welfare has directed the state to keep a strict vigil on superspreader events, which might lead to an escalation in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/war-on-covid-must-go-on-in-new-year-experts/story-gSlP9GCWTkNPwqcnWDs4tM.html

Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said that department has also identified the key accident-prone zones in the city and teams are already working on remedial measures. “Initially, we have put up 20 hoardings at major locations, which are used by the maximum number of commuters. It is important to rush an accident victim to the nearest hospital for timely first aid, which can save his or life. The commuters should have all the helpline numbers saved and it is important to highlight them on hoardings so that the ambulance can reach on time,” she said. The hoardings also list common traffic violations, such as speeding, jumping traffic signals, drink driving, unnecessary honking, violations of designated traffic zones, not wearing seat belts, riding without helmets, modification of two-wheelers and the use of mobile phones while driving, among others. As per the official data, 675 road accidents took place in city between January 1 to December 24 this year. The police have also issued 318,332 challans for various traffic offences during the same period. This is the first time that a comprehensive analysis of accident trends at the “black spots” in the city has been undertaken. While the number of deaths was 433 in 2019, it came down to 307 in 2020, the police said. There are around 20 black spots in the city that report a high number of road accidents. The RTA has flagged off a programme to identify black spots on roads for the first time in December this year. Yadav said the authority wants to reduce the taken by an ambulance to reach an accident spot.In many cases, victims die due to excessive bleeding and not receiving any timely medical help. As per the data, it takes 18 minutes on an average for a road accident victim to get medical aid. RTA officials say that this time should be reduced to at least 12 minutes. The campaign also aims to raise awareness against drink driving.Challans for drink driving constituted 23% of the total number of fines issued, said the police. The number of challans have increased 10 times in the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rta-starts-public-awareness-campaign-to-promote-road-safety/story-QQsh7LtmTCnZmOGq4ru4mO.html

30-12-2020||Gurugram||21 MCG officials given responsibilities of Manesar civic body||At least 21 senior officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have been assigned additional duties in the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM). The Directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) issued an order in this regard on Wednesday evening after approval from the Haryana government.Apart from these 21 officials, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, was given the additional charge of the commissioner of MCM on Monday. This is the first time that the state government has appointed any staff members for a newly formed civic body, said officials privy to the matter.The 21 officials include the additional municipal commissioner, deputy municipal commissioner, chief town planner, senior medical officer, and officials from the engineering, electrical, taxation, and sanitary wings. ULB’s letter to the MCG, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, states that the matter regarding the assignment of additional duties or charges to officials working in the MCG was “referred to the government for consideration and approval.”The required approval has now been granted and the concerned officials presently working in the MCG have been deputed to look after various responsibilities at MCM. However, they would continue to draw their salaries from their existing place of posting, the letter further stated.Singh has also been authorised to assign additional charges to the officials working in the MCG for the newly formed MCM.“This is purely a time gap arrangement till the regular postings are made by the government and this arrangement will ensure smooth functioning of the newly created MCM. No extra remuneration or seniority will be given on the account of this arrangement (sic),” read the ULB letter.On December 24, the Haryana cabinet approved the proposal for the formation of MCM.Spread across 125 square kilometres, the MCM has 28 villages under its jurisdiction, apart from residential and industrial areas falling within the sectors 77 and 93 and a few areas located near the Kundli Manesar Palwal (KMP) Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/21-mcg-officials-given-responsibilities-of-manesar-civic-body/story-EsL0TyOb9yI5mo08XjAqKI.html
30-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG’s executive engineer under probe for discrepancies in release of funds||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has initiated an investigation against one of its executive engineers for allegedly sanctioning the release of funds for a project in Ward 34, even before work had started at the site. His charge as an executive engineer (XEN) has been withdrawn with immediate effect, said officials.According to the MCG joint commissioner, Hariom Attri, the civic body had last month floated tenders to re-carpet roads in wards 34 and 35, a project that primarily involved fixing of potholes. The cost of the project was estimated to be around Rs 47.50 lakh and Rs 24 lakh in wards 34 and 35, respectively.Attri said that the concerned XEN, in collusion with the contractor, had paid Rs 47.50 lakh, the entire cost of the project for fixing potholes in Ward 34 to the contractor.“For both wards 34 and 35, I had received a letter from the area councillors concerned that they had not issued any work satisfactory certificates to the MCG. Funds were sanctioned to the contractor for work in Ward 34 and were under process for Ward 35. Both the councillors alleged that their certificates had been forged by the XEN, and the matter has been investigated and a report in the matter submitted to the MCG commissioner for perusal and further action. In both wards, no work on the ground had been started,” said Attri.In July 2019, the MCG introduced a policy that for ward-specific projects, payment to a contractor can only be made after the councillor of the area checks the work on-ground and subsequently, issues a work satisfactory certificate. This way, there was greater scrutiny on the quality of work executed.The issuance of forged work satisfactory certificates has been a major problem in the MCG recently. In November, the civic body found at least 12 forged fake satisfactory certificates, bearing either fake signatures of the councillors or missing key details, such as the type of project or the date, based on which contractors were paid the entire project amount.The MCG has already withdrawn the charge of two XENs, an assistant engineer, a junior engineer over the allegations and further written to the directorate of the Urban Local Bodies (ULB) to take legal action against the four officials and three contractors.One of the XENs who is already under probe is also the XEN who is under probe for the alleged wrongdoings in wards 34 and 35.The withdrawal of charge of the XEN comes at a point when the MCG is struggling with a shortage of senior officials. The charges of four of 10 MCG’s XENs have been withdrawn over the last two months for negligence or corruption, leading to a major delay in developmental projects. Several MCG XENs are currently holding dual charges.The MCG is considering reshuffling the entire engineering wing to overcome the shortage of manpower. The transfers are expected to take place early next month, said officials.Besides the issuance of fake certificates, over the last 12 months, the MCG has also had several cases where the contractor has been paid the entire or partial amount even when the project is either yet to start or is at a nascent stage. As per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, the MCG can only pay the contractor for running costs of a project, while the final sum is only paid after the work is completed.The XEN concerned did not respond to phone calls and messages for comment.Instances of payments to contractors before the work have been cropping up regularly. In one instance, the MCG’s engineering wing had paid Rs 35 lakh to a contractor in December 2019 for constructing a 1.7-kilometre track between Khushboo Chowk and Bristol Chowk, along the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road. Only 600 metres of work, worth Rs 11 lakh, had been completed.In February 2020, the MCG’s engineering wing had paid Rs 1.67 crore, the total project cost, to a contractor for building a two-kilometre road in Ward 1 even before the construction had started.In September 2020, a contractor was paid Rs 50 lakh, nearly a quarter of the total project cost of Rs 2 crore, for laying pavement tiles in ward 25, by the MCG’s engineering wing, despite only 10% work being completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-s-executive-engineer-under-probe-for-discrepancies-in-release-of-funds/story-qFu8BJIMPgcGxRAgb7X3dI.html
30-12-2020||Gurugram||Jams at Kherki Daula toll due to digital experiment||The Kherki Daula toll plaza on Wednesday witnessed frequent jams, as the toll operator closed the cash lanes and experimented with totally digital modes of payment, as directed by the National Highways Authority of India. Toll plazas across the country are to accept fees only through FASTags.Officials of the Millennium City Expressway Private Limited, the concessionaire, said that jams were caused as 20% of the vehicles had problems with FASTags while 10% did not have the tags at all.An MCEPL official said that the first experiment started around 9.30am on Monday but it had to be stopped due to traffic build-up. “Several vehicles don’t have functional tags because of which jams happened,” he said, adding that jams were inevitable if the toll plaza is turned fully digital.Around 65,000 to 70,000 toll-paying vehicles pass through the toll plaza at Kherki Daula every day, said an official.Suraj Bhardwaj, CEO, MCEPL, did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking a response on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/jams-at-kherki-daula-toll-due-to-digital-experiment/story-GFrGL0H1cZUMaA7IfpmhoI.html
30-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers to stay put, hold off tractor rally until next round of talks||Farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Jaisinghpur Khera in protest of the new farm laws on Wednesday said that they will continue with their agitation and not leave until their demands are met even as cold wave conditions intensified over the last two days. Farmer leaders also said that a tractor rally that was scheduled to take place on Wednesday had been postponed in view of the sixth round of talks between farmers and the government. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for the past 18 days. They seek to join the farmers’ agitation in Delhi but have been restricted at the Haryana border by the Rewari Police. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September this year. They fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of corporations and put an end to the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. “Despite the dipping temperatures, farmers are continuing their agitation. We will not withdraw from here till our demands are met. Farmers will be spending New Year’s Eve at the border. A tractor rally had been planned for December 30 but it has been deferred in view of the talks with the government. We have been getting support from hordes of people who are joining us and our agitation will continue till the laws are not repealed,” said Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan. Amra Ram, the national vice-president of All India Kisan Sabha and former CPI (M) MLA, said that the movement would continue under the leadership of the farmers and will intensify in the coming days if the government doesn’t accept their demands. “The three black laws are akin to a death warrant for farmers. Farmers are clear about this and will not back down despite attempts by the government and media to divide the agitation. The union of farm leaders will continue to guide the agitation. We will abide by the instructions of the farmers’ union,” said Ram. On Wednesday, Swaraj Abhiyan president Yogendra Yadav also spoke to farmers about the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Yadav said that the Act would benefit corporations and big industrialists, whereas smaller farmers would suffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-to-stay-put-hold-off-tractor-rally-until-next-round-of-talks/story-kcRv3Y6ZaHbZJh9wX2ZV7J.html

On Tuesday, the AQI stood at 214, in the poor zone, of the daily bulletin. Experts attributed the improvement over the last two days to high-speed winds and change in the wind direction, but said that air quality might worsen in the next two days.“The air quality is likely to deteriorate around New Year’s Day. However, we are expecting rain this week, which would help in cleaning up the air. Once the temperature starts dipping again, the air quality is likely to decline,” said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality scientist.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category on Thursday and reach the upper-end of the very poor category on Friday. Extremely poor ventilation conditions, unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, are likely to prevail on Thursday and Friday. Subsequently, air quality is likely to improve from January 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cold-continues-minimum-temperature-at-5-2-c/story-kuwGbBZnOyBO5Gw9ZHMSnK.html

In a statement issued by Rathore, he said that the present state government has proved to be a total failure in controlling the virus and now this new strain of Coronavirus will prove to be more dangerous for the people of the state.He has also demanded the state government to strengthen the healthcare services in Covid care centres due to the rising number of deaths being reported in the state and said that the state government has not taken any measures to improve the healthcare services in these centres and have left people on their own to deal with the pandemic.Expressing grief over the death of Santosh Sailja, the wife of former chief minister and senior BJP leader Shanta Kumar, Rathore said that when he is not getting enough health services in these Covid centers, then we can only imagine what difficulties common people have to face during the treatment in these centres.Rathore said that Shanta Kumar’s departure to Chandigarh from Tanda Medical College for treatment indicates that there was some lapse in the treatment being provided to his wife. “Those who have recently returned from the United Kingdom should come forward for health checkup in the public interest so that we can prevent any community spread of this new strain,” said Rathore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-congress-seeks-plan-to-tackle-new-covid-strain/story-CJA3b2PiX9Fzv7wSVgzYSJ.html

30-12-2020||City||IC-814 hijack: 21 years after release, Zargar remains elusive||In June last year, five CRPF were killed and as many injured in a terrorist attack on a busy road in Anantnag district of South Kashmir whose responsibility was claimed by the Al Umar militant group which was dormant for many years. The attack brought in focus the leader of Al Umar Mujahideen, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, one of the three terrorists, who, along with JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Omar Sheikh of Harkat-ul-Ansar, was released in Kandhar of Afghanistan, in exchange for over 150 hostages of the Indian Airlines Flight 814 on December 24, 1999. Zargar was lodged in Kote Balwal jail in Jammu at that time. The Indian Airlines IC-814 Kathmandu-Delhi flight, carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members, was hijacked by Pakistan-based Islamic terrorists belonging to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen with the active support and assistance of the Pakistan army. The flight, which made stops at Amritsar and Lahore, ultimately stationed itself in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Nobody knows the whereabouts of Zargar since he was released in 1999. Police officials, however, said that he was in Pakistan at a “safe house” and could revive the group which is otherwise inactive for the last two decades. Police had started pursuing leads on Zargar-led Al Umar after it gave a strike call in Kashmir. “Zargar is currently in Pakistan. In old city, there is no presence of Al Umar. We have seen no activity of theirs. I don’t know about their claims in other districts,” said SP North Srinagar Sandeep Gupta. “He hasn’t come out openly after his release but he is on the police radar, especially after his group claimed responsibility for the attack on CRPF personnel in Srinagar. Like other militant groups, Zargar’s group is also under constant watch, though it has no presence in the Valley, not even in Srinagar,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. Another officer, who didn’t want to be identified, said the attack in Anantnag, though the responsibility was taken by Al Umar, was actually carried out by Jaish. “We reported that Al Umar only claimed the responsibility for the attack, but it was carried out by Jaish,” he said. No contact with him: Family Mushtaq’s elder brother Fayaz Ahmad Zargar, 48, said he was not in contact with Mushtaq and have no information about him since he left home 30 years ago. “He was 16 when he left home amid a wave of militancy and since then we have not been in touch,” he said, adding that the family came to know about his release in 1999. He said the family, including Mushtaq’s three brothers and three sisters, suffered immensely since he left home. “We have witnessed a life of torment all these years. Each day we have seen tribulations. Our two children are in jail for the past four years. I was jailed for 10 months for no reason for the second time in August 2019 when the Article 370 was revoked,” he said. Mushtaq’s two nephews Adil Siraz Nazir (sister’s son) and Dawood Fayaz Zargar (Fayaz’s son) were arrested in 2017 in connection with the killing of DSP Muhammad Ayub Pandith, who was lynched on June 22, 2017, at Nawhatta. “These kids are innocent and they were arrested because of their lineage. Now, their careers are finished,” he said. Zargar’s father Ghulam Rasool Zargar was a photographer who died in 1983 and Fayaz is also into photography, while his two brothers own garment and cosmetics shop in the old city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ic-814-hijack-21-years-after-release-zargar-remains-elusive/story-KdEtpXFlH9NUFQyzuqjF0J.html

30-12-2020||City||Delhi: Man arrested for killing friend, dumping his body in gunny bag||New Delhi: Unable to return Rs 77,000 that he had borrowed from his friend during the lockdown cost a 35-year-old his life in outer Delhi’s Prem Nagar, police said on Wednesday after arresting the 24-year-old alleged killer. After killing Ravi Kumar,35, the alleged killer, Ankit alias Bitto(identified by his single name in police records), had stuffed the body in a gunny bag, carried it on his scooter and dumped it in a pond. The suspect carrying the body in the bag was captured in at least six CCTV cameras installed on the 2-kilometre route that he took for dumping the body in the pond. The CCTV footage helped investigators identify and nab the suspect, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra said that on Tuesday morning, the Prem Nagar police received a call regarding a body stuffed in a gunny bag. A police team reached the spot and preserved the body in a nearby government hospital’s mortuary, since local enquiry could not help them ascertain the dead man’s identity. A murder case was registered and teams were formed to probe it, said the DCP.During the probe, investigators scanned CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity of the pond where the body was found. In at least six CCTVs, a masked man was seen carrying the gunny bag with body inside it on a blue scooter. All the police personnel was tasked to locate and verify all blue scooters in the radius of five kilometeres in Prem Nagar.“Our effort led us to a similar scooter and its owner, Ankit aka Bitto, a tailor by profession. We confronted Ankit with the footage and he confessed to the crime. He was arrested and the scooter was seized,” said a senior investigator, who did not want to be identified.Ankit’s interrogation, the investigator said, revealed that he knew Kumar for the past five-six years, when they worked together in a shoe manufacturing factory. During the lockdown, Kumar had borrowed Rs 77,000 from Ankit, as he had lost his job and had no other source of income. Kumar had promised to return the money soon but was unable to keep it.“Recently, Ankit planned to buy a bike and needed money for it. He began demanding his money back from Kumar, who had been seeking more time. A few days ago, Kumar showed his helplessness in returning the money,” said the officer.On Monday, Ankit called Kumar to see his new rented room. Kumar reached there around noon. The two had an altercation over the money issue and during that Kumar allegedly slapped Ankit.“Ankit pushed Kumar against a wall in a fit of rage. An iron nail pierced his forehead and he became unconscious because of the bleeding. Ankit panicked and feared that he will be arrested if Kumar filed a police complaint. He brought a rope, strangled Kumar, and stuffed his body in a gunny bag,” the officer said.The officer added the Ankit kept the body in the first-floor room for nearly 11 hours. Around midnight, he took the body in the bag, kept in on the scooter and transported it to the pond, where he threw it and returned home, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-arrested-for-killing-friend-dumping-his-body-in-gunny-bag/story-8E3hUnFxW8MGAxPhjRLt7M.html

We had just picked up business, because in October we were permitted to reopen our restaurants with 50 per cent occupancy. But in reality, it isn’t 50 per cent it is just 35 per cent because, on a table of four or six, we have to accommodate only two, then we can’t make anyone sit near them and we lose that business. We had finally started breaking even after seven months and the government imposed the curfew.” said Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune restaurants and hoteliers association (PRAHA) and the owner of Kalinga restaurant. The restaurants are struggling even with deliveries increasing marginally. As it seems, there are some limitations on deliveries by restaurants and other delivery apps too. “The number of deliveries has increased compared to the lockdown and especially in the last week of the curfew. It is slowly coming back to normal,” said Ismail Ansaari who works as a Zomato delivery executive. “Because of the curfew, not many people have organised big parties as they used to and many are cooking their own food for the small gatherings they have. So, we don’t get much there either,” added Shetty.“We don’t have a lot of big deliveries coming in. The restaurants are open but not a lot of people are placing orders the way they used to. Last year, I delivered orders for many parties and it used to be all big orders at this time of the year, but now not many,” said Paresh Kale, a 30-year-old a Swiggy delivery agent. “A lot of our deliveries have been cut short. As there are restrictions on Zomato and Swiggy deliveries and even we cannot send our boys out due to the curfew. We used to get a lot of orders late at night, but now we don’t,” said Aman Aurora, owner of Lovely restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/delivery-apps-report-curfew-impact-on-orders-an-end-of-year-downer/story-Q8UgqVZ6zT0pprzi0IeJUP.html

He was supposed to join PCCoE in April itself, but it was delayed due to the lockdown. He joined in June and he has not taken a day off since then. My husband sat next to me that evening and watched the TV serial that we watch every day from 7pm to 7.30pm. He then went for a walk, as he usually does, while I started cooking. He had prepared for himself, and his sub-ordinates, a plan for the next entire week. Why would he opt for suicide?” said his distraught wife. “It is a case of suicide. There is no suicide note,” said senior police inspector Anil Shewale of Chaturshrungi police station. “While I have not checked the details of the case, it appears to be suicide, prima facie.

Out of these, we could trace about 613 which means that their samples have been sent for RT-PCR testing for Covid-19. We have got the reports of 560 of these out of which four have tested positive.”“We have now sent their samples for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology to detect if they have been infected with the existing strain of or the new (UK) strain of the virus,” she said.As per the PMC circular, these four patients have now been admitted at Naidu hospital for treatment and quarantine.The administration is having a tough time to trace the returnees who are unwilling to come forward to get themselves tested. It has now also sought help from the local police to trace those who have not been able to be traced or have not reported to the local administration yet after returning from the United Kingdom.To ease the contact tracing process of those who have returned from the United Kingdom in the month of December, the PMC has now issued a letter to the citizens to come forward and report themselves to the local administration.In its letter, the civic body stated that currently 109 such returnees have not been traced as they have given a wrong address or a wrong mobile number.

They ask too many questions and to explain to each person the rules which have already been made public by the government is a huge task.”“We have to further contact those who came in contact with these people if they turn positive,” he said.Those who came before the December 22 notification, from the UK or the Middle East have been advised home isolation if they test negative while those who came after that will be directed to the nearby hotel for mandatory isolation for 14 days and will be released only after two consecutive negative reports.If any foreign traveller is symptomatic then that passengers would be directed to PMC’s Naidu hospital for quarantine.Contact detailsThose who have returned to the country before December 22 have to submit a negative report to the administration or could contact the PMC at 020-25506800/01/02/03||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-uk-returnees-test-positive-for-covid-19-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing/story-6DbX0Qf9D2UKrpWkLWUp5M.html

Meanwhile, the BJP has reacted sharply to the development. Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal said, “The TMC-ruled government has not been able to answer any of the questions raised by the Governor and is hence attacking him. Shah has not spread any canards. He has given statistics.

30-12-2020||Chandigarh||Amid gang violence, Chandigarh sees 150% spike in Arms Act cases in 2020||With gangster violence rampant throughout the year despite the lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Chandigarh Police registered 33 cases under the Arms Act in 2020, highest in a decade, following increased recovery of weapons. Only 13 cases were registered in 2019 and eight in 2018. Gangsters from the neighbouring states, including the jailed ones such as Lawrence Bishnoi, Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, Sukhpreet Singh Budha, Sampat Nehra and Dipu Banur, tried to dominate the crime scene in the city, leading to targeted shootings and extortion bids. This not only led to illegal weapons making their way into the city, but it also came to the fore that many gangsters had already hidden away their weapons in Chandigarh.“The crackdown against gangsters and their sympathisers led to an increase in recovery of weapons. Over a dozen people were arrested for providing support to criminals as well as supplying weapons,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal. “There has been increased involvement of gangsters of Punjab and Haryana in crime in the city, but we have been able to arrest most of them.” A few weapons recovered this year had the name of Ankit Bhadu, a sharpshooter of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang who was killed in an encounter in Zirakpur in February 2019, engraved on it, said a senior police official, not wishing to be named.“It read RIP Ankit Bhadu. The gang was using these weapons, including countrymade, semi-automatic and automatic ones, with the same engraving to sort of pay homage to Bhadu,” he said.Most weapons being brought to the city are purchased from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh or from Madhya Pradesh, said another cop privy with investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-gang-violence-chandigarh-sees-150-spike-in-arms-act-cases-in-2020/story-bV0Bq5azpskrfvy64VJiKL.html
30-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC writes to President seeking recall of Bengal governor Dhankhar||West Bengal’s ruling TMC Wednesday intensified its war of attrition with Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, demanding his recall for “transgressing constitutional limits”.An angry Dhankhar shot back, claiming free and fair elections are not held in the state and that it is his duty to ensure people exercise their franchise without fear.A team of TMC MPs has sent a letter to the President on Tuesday listing “all such transgressions” by Dhankhar in recent times and urged him to take action as per Article 156, Clause 1 of the Constitution, the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy told reporters here.“The governor holds office during the pleasure of the President as per Article 156, Clause 1. We have urged the President to withdraw the pleasure, which translates into removing this governor,” Roy said.The relevant article of the Constitution relates to a state governor holding office as long as the President does not withdraw the “pleasure”.“We have noticed that since he arrived in the state in July last year, he has been regularly tweeting, holding press meets and participating in TV discussions, where he is regularly passing comments on the functioning of the state government, our officers, ministers, the chief minister, even once on the conduct of the speaker of the assembly. Every such action is violative of his constitutional rights,” Roy said.Alleging that Dhankhar has been making such statements in the public at the behest of the BJP-led government at the Centre to embarrass the TMC government in the state, Roy said, “This had never happened earlier in the 75-year-long history of West Bengal. If he has to say anything, he can communicate that in the way as provided to him by the Constitution, not by tweeting or holding press meets.” Dhankhar, who has been locked in a seemingly interminable battle with the Mamata Banerjee government, shot back, asserting his duty is to ensure that people get the opportunity to exercise their franchise without fear.“Free and fair elections without fear are not held (in the state),” Dhankhar told reporters during a visit to a temple in the western part of the city.The governor said it does not concern him for whom the people vote, but it is his duty to make sure that they get to exercise their franchise without any intimidation.He also urged the government machinery to be neutral during the West Bengal Assembly elections likely in April- May next year.Dhankhar has often accused the state’s civil and police administration of succumbing to the pressure exerted by the Mamata Banerjee government.Roy cited Dhankhar’s statement seeking expenditure details of the Bengal Business Summit, his demand for an apology from the chief minister over some of her recent comments and his “threat to 25 IPS officers” as instances of the governor “violating his rights and limitations”.“He has also said it is his duty to ensure free and fair polls. Who is he? It is the domain of the Election Commission. Similarly, only the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) has the authority to seek details of the expenses of state-organised events like the Bengal Business Summit,” Roy said.“A constitutional head chosen by the Centre cannot interfere in the functioning of the state in this way. It is akin to interference in the parliamentary system. He is intentionally doing these things. He is not fit to occupy the seat of the governor which he has been occupying,” Roy said.Reacting to the development, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said the governor is performing his constitutional duty as he finds that the state government is not performing its functions properly on certain parameters.“I don’t think the TMC’s action of moving the President for the removal of the governor will have any impact. The President will go by his own understanding of the governor’s role,” he told reporters.“The governor is acting within the constitutional parameters as the head of the state. The TMC is doing this as it is scared,” the senior BJP leader added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-seeks-recall-of-bengal-governor-dhankhar-hits-back/story-VErelBygwqXFBqDERGQSQK.html

30-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand police on hunt for wanted criminals, those hiding in UP top the list||The Uttarakhand police have launched a manhunt to nab 189 wanted criminals with reward money on their heads. The department is focusing especially on the gangsters based in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP), who enter Uttarakhand to commit crime and then vanish without a trace. Among the 189, the maximum, 72, are wanted in Haridwar district, followed by 36 in US Nagar and 35 in Dehradun districts, which all share a border with UP.The other districts including Pithoragarh, Champawat and Almora have five wanted criminals each, while Nainital has 19. Similarly, Bageshwar and Rudrapur have two wanted criminals each while Tehri Garhwal and Chamoli have one each. Uttarkashi and Pauri Garhwal districts have none. The drive to nab the wanted and absconding criminals was launched on the directions of newly appointed director general of police, Ashok Kumar. He had directed all the 13 district police departments and the special task force (STF) to nab the wanted criminals. AP Anshuman, inspector general (law & order) and chief spokesperson of police headquarters in Dehradun said, “The drive is very significant because it would help putting the wanted criminals behind bars which is their actual place so as to prevent them from committing more crime.” He informed that under the drive, police are hunting two types of criminals-- one involved in organised crime and other wanted at police station level for less serious crimes. “The ones involved in organised crime or gangsters committing an inter-state crime are being nabbed by the state STF while the remaining by the respective district police departments,” said Anshuman. Also Read: Uttarakhand to learn from Prayagraj’s Magh Mela template for hosting KumbhTo make the drive “successful”, police teams involved in other tasks, such as law and order maintenance, have been roped in. “To know the whereabouts of the criminals, we have activated our informers’ network and increased electronic surveillance. This has yielded us results also with the arrests of some notorious wanted criminals in the past few days, including the one based out of UP, who was wanted in US Nagar district for nine years for allegedly abducting and looting a general manager of a five-star hotel,” said Anshuman. The UP-based gangsters involved in serious crimes like contract killing, extortion, murder and others in Uttarakhand are being chased by the STF on the instructions from the police headquarters. “We have a list of about 20-22 such gangsters who have inter-state operations including Uttarakhand,” said Ajay Singh, superintendent of police, STF.“We have already held a meeting with the Western UP STF for coordination on the matter, which is much needed as UP based criminals come here to commit a crime, while the UP police is looking for those who come here (Uttarakhand) to hide after committing a crime in their area,” said Singh. “We hope to get much better results in the next two months,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-police-on-hunt-for-wanted-criminals-those-hiding-in-up-top-the-list/story-nbGUZAb8sqx4UE9ncmDLGN.html

30-12-2020||Pune||2020, Pune’s year in Covid: Specialised tertiary care hosp must in every district, says Mhaisekar||Deepak Mhaisekar is currently appointed as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s advisor on the Covid-19 pandemic. He retired as Pune divisional commissioner on July 31. Mhaisekar has been at the forefront of the Covid-19 battle ever since the first case was detected in Pune. In conversation with Steffy Thevar Mhaisekar draws on lessons learnt from the pandemic and how Pune fought to bring it under relative controlBeing one of the first officials to handle the Covid-19 pandemic head on, during the initial months, how did you tackle the situation? I had the experience of more than 30 years in various administrative fields. In Chandrapur or Nanded, I had handled natural disasters and even in Pune, when I was divisional commissioner, we had floods in Sangli. However, Covid-19 is something unique and unknown. The clinical expression and the treatment protocol was not known to the world at the time. In fact, the WHO was also not clear about the treatment protocol. The only thing that we knew is that in the initial phases it was more about giving IEC (Information, Education and Communication); training or letting people know how it spreads and the precautions we need to take. In the initial months, even WHO was not keen on using masks and there was no insistence in using masks, but at the same time the proper etiquettes, like sneezing in public, maintaining social distance and washing of hands was very clear. Initially we had very few cases.Pune, in September, had the highest number of active cases in the country. What went wrong? I do not think that there is anything wrong in controlling the situation in Pune. This was because Pune did maximum testing and maximum tracing, as this was the only way to control the spread. Identifying the positives and isolating them was the only way out. We had only five hotspots initially in Pune, which were the crowded places where social distancing was not possible; like Bhavani peth, Kasba peth, Dhole Patil road or likewise. Initially, people feared this disease and so they did not report themselves in. This could probably be one of the reasons for the spread of the infection to such an extent. One must also understand that places like Pune, Mumbai or even Delhi are metropolitan areas where the movement of people cannot be stopped. Ultimately everything depends on how much people follow social distancing norms, washing of hands or wearing masks; if not, then there could be a rise in number of cases. Are you satisfied with the way the administration performed, especially in Pune? The administration tried their best. One has to understand the type of disease that we were facing. Right now, at this juncture, one of the best facilities is in the USA and UK and you can see the situation over there. So it is not a question of administrative failure, USA is reporting more than two lakh cases a day and in UK, 40,000 cases a day. So even the most developed countries are now battling their second or third wave and they are even worse than what we faced in our first wave. I do not want to blame people, as well as it was totally new virus and a totally new way of the virus spreading. Pune’s overall public health infrastructure needs a revamp as the pandemic exposed it. What needs to be done? In one of our recommendations we have mentioned that not only Pune, but public health facilities in nearby cities like Solapur, Satara or Ahmednagar, also need to be ramped up. We have recommended that every district headquarters must have a specialised tertiary care hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2020-pune-s-year-in-covid-specialised-tertiary-care-hosp-must-in-every-district-says-mhaisekar/story-0CWUmvbLkKT6ihuYUuoOJI.html
30-12-2020||Pune||2020, Pune’s year in Covid: Doctors go extra mile to help patients||Back in August, when I received an order to serve in Covid-19 war room, my initial reaction was coupled with confusion and a gasp – the opportunity was big, but I had no idea how these war rooms function. I was barely settling into my job, when, on a rainy evening, I had to call a family of four – all had turned positive – to crosscheck about recovery from Covid. The man in 30s picked up my call and said, rather angrily, “This is the third call I have received from your war room. I have lost my mother today.” Stunned, I disconnected the call as the enthusiasm of my new job was taken away through this incident. But, this wasn’t the first such call and not going to be last in the near future; I have been shuttling between the psychiatry department of the LTMG Hospital and the BMC-established war room for the past five months in Mumbai, the city I shifted to more than a year ago from Pune. The staff working here comes from a diverse background, ranging from teachers from MCGM schools, volunteering medical students, interns from MCGM hospitals, war-room coordinator doctors - all contributing to the service of people in difficult times. Our health teams work on the ground. They visit and check-up all the positive cases and facilitate their quarantine or admission procedures. They also arrange for sanitisation of the area, putting up banners on the quarantined patients’ houses or buildings as necessary. During August and September, when the city was reporting a higher number of cases and fatalities, the war room was flooded with calls from patients with requests for beds in hospitals. On one occasion, a single mother with a six-year-old daughter tested positive. Coming from lower income group, the woman did not have the separate infrastructure for her quarantine while protocols dictated that she be shifted to isolation facility nearby, leaving her small child alone at home. This unprecedented challenge was eventually resolved as we coordinated with her neighbor, who took care of daughter, while her mother completed the quarantine period at government created facility. These days we also get calls from patients who express gratitude. One day a gentleman walked right into the war room and we all got little scared as we have had some bad experiences. But, this one, had come to thank us for the coordination we did. Both his parents were cured of Covid-19 and he was grateful for all the help. Covid-19 demanded we not just to be good doctors, but go beyond our regular duties and be all that a patient needs, sometimes their teacher, counselor, friend and sometimes their family. This pandemic made me realise that it is not just the illness or virus we are fighting, but we are growing together as humanity. Dr Tejaswini Kulkarni works in the psychiatry department, LTMG Hospital Sion, Mumbai, and is currently posted as supervisor at the Covid-19 war room in Bandra West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2020-pune-s-year-in-covid-doctors-go-extra-mile-to-help-patients/story-W3adWTzRNzDYkhpMcIdZGO.html

The Court observed that the slum dwellers have been waiting for rehabilitation since over two decades and such schemes are implemented to mitigate the hardship of the slum dwellers and they should not be casually set aside by the writ courts only on technical grounds unless a case of gross illegalities or failure of justice is made out. A division bench of justice Nitin Jadhav and justice Milind Jadhav heard the petition challenging the decision of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) to assign the redevelopment project to Precaution Properties Pvt Ltd. The petition was filed by Dyna Estate Pvt Ltd and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Nagar Sahakari Griha Nirman Sanstha, both represented by senior advocate Birendra Saraf.Saraf further told the court that the petition also challenged the February, 2020 order of the Apex Grievance Redressal Committee, which rejected the challenge to the grant of the project. The petitioners also challenged clause 6 of the 2017 circular which allowed the project to be given to Precaution after considering the net worth of its holding company. Precaution, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, objected to the petition, stating that the petitioners claim was only over 6% of the land and the petitioners did not present any credible alternative to Precaution’s scheme.Advocate Aspi Chinoy, representing Precaution, further argued to limit the judicial scrutiny of the legality of the Letter of Intent (LOI) and opposed a free-ranging enquiry of issues no longer relevant. The court observed that the petitioners’ proposal was only for 7252 sq. meters, approximately 6.4% of land earmarked by Precaution for the redevelopment project. “No alternative is presented before us by the petitioners for the entire land,” the court said. The court further held that there was no merit in the objections with regards to the financial capacity of Precaution.“Because the circular has only clarified the position which was never prohibited, it cannot be said that the stipulation was brought into force on the date of the circular, i.e. January 2, 2017 and that there was earlier an embargo on considering the financial capacity of the holding company. Therefore no challenge can be raised on the ground that it cannot be made applicable to the pending applications,” the court said. Also Read: Kangana Ranaut back in Mumbai, Congress tweets reminder for anti-drugs agencyThe bench concluded that piecemeal implementation of the scheme is not viable and that the firm’s project had the backing of close to 85% of the affected slum dwellers.“84% of eligible slum dwellers of 23 co-operative housing societies are supporting Precaution’s proposal. The financial position of Precaution and its holding company has been found sufficiently robust to ensure that the project is completed and the slum dwellers are housed,” the court said. The court also had a word of advice for the writ courts as it called for keeping the hardships of the slum dwellers in mind before casting such projects aside.“Ultimately such schemes are implemented to mitigate the hardship of the slum dwellers and they should not casually be set aside by the writ courts only on technical grounds, unless a case of gross illegalities or failure of justice is made out,” it concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-slum-development-project-gets-hc-nod-relief-to-shapoorji-group/story-HpbJInTm1Zz1wSwT9Nu3WK.html
30-12-2020||Pune||2020, Pune’s year in Covid: Gave the dead their last touch of humanity||For crematory operator Arun Jangam (49), the lines between his work responsibilities and social service have largely blurred since the outbreak of the pandemic. Jangam has been instrumental in the cremation of 3,000 deceased Covid-19 patients. Neither the crematorium staff, nor the family members of these patients were ready to touch the corpses, given the apprehension surrounding the virus, especially at the outset of the pandemic. “The corpses of Covid victims used to be sent to the crematorium by the hospitals. The families of these patients used to be absent most of the time, and even if they did show up, they would be standing away from the corpses. Right from transporting the bodies from the ambulance to the crematory machine, to also performing final rites, there are a series of tasks that require manpower,” explains Jangam, adding how he shouldered all of these responsibilities single-handedly, especially in the months of March and April, when the number of those infected was heading to its peak. For the last nine months, Jangam has been working round-the-clock, to the point that he had shifted base to Yerawada’s Amardham crematorium from April to June. These months had seen a particularly sharp rise in Covid-19 deaths in the city. “I had a very humanitarian perspective while cremating the bodies of abandoned Covid patients. While doing the work, I wasn’t thinking of contracting the virus or about the monetary returns. I did what I thought was right, and somebody had to do it,” says Jangam, in the most nonchalant manner. The man has spent nearly two decades working in PMC-run crematoriums, and at present, he has joined hands with PMC to supervise the cremation of Covid-19 fatalities. This undertaking, on-paper, came through very recently, but during the most crucial months of the pandemic, Jangam was doing the work all by himself, sans any direction, team or remuneration. Gradually, he built his own team of 26, and now they have formed groups of four, working in shifts. “From May till July, work was overwhelming. Every day, there would be about 15-20 bodies, and I used to be exhausted and sleepless. There came a point that I reached the fag end of my endurance, and I was taken ill. Thankfully, I recovered, and got back to work,” he says, underlining how post his recovery, his family, too helped share the burden. He says: “In the initial days of the pandemic, I used to come back after a long day at the crematorium, only to realise that the neighbours had begun to ostracise me and my family. The stigma about the virus was staggering. Later on, I stopped coming home and started staying at the crematorium as the workload had increased.” PMC’s assistant health officer, Dr Kalpana Baliwant, who is handling the management of Covid mortalities, lauds Jangam’s dedicated work, “Jangam did his work in the most crucial times. Managing more than 3,000 cremations without any mistakes and confusions is only the work of a humane and meticulous individual. He is a Covid hero.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2020-pune-s-year-in-covid-gave-the-dead-their-last-touch-of-humanity/story-EY3nFjxptiuiEJxrAYKoOL.html

30-12-2020||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Geography begets history, and a river runs through it||So, what does commuting in Pune look like to you? Stressful? Frustrating? But, beyond that have you ever noticed how many times one has crossed bridges?; how many times the vehicle suddenly ascends or descends a slope? How you are taken aback by sharp bends on roads, roads meeting at odd angles, round-about ways at arriving at a destination, or a sudden joyride on an occasional meander? Why is there no grid pattern of horizontal and vertical roads to help us navigate easily? No, it is not faulty city planning that we see in all this, it is the function of things that existed before the city, the geography and the landscape. Pune is not a settlement planned in 20th century, like the city of Chandigarh, but has grown organically over atleast two millennia and has responded to the natural settings for most part of its life. Folks, today we take a tour of Pune’s environs through the school geography text books. Pune is part of what we call western Maharashtra. It is settled on western slopes of the mighty Sahyadris - the Western Ghats running along a north-south parallel to India’s western coast. Various west flowing rivers, originating in the Sahyadris have excavated the volcanic Deccan trap layers to form broad river valleys and leave behind moderate reliefs of secondary hill ranges, such as the Shambhu Mahadev range. With Sahyadri in the backdrop, Pune is nestled in cosy valleys of the Shambhu Mahadev ranges sinking in the plains to the east. In doing so, Pune forms a strategic connection and central space. The continuous Katraj hills form the western southern boundaries where the Parvati-Taljai-Waghjai ranges enter the city centre from the south west. The hills travelling from Sahyadri in the west form the connection via NDA, Mhatoba, Vetal, Chaturshringi and end with the Fergusson hills across the river Mutha. The Range hills, Baner-Pashan hills occupy the north eastern corners. The east is relatively open with lone Yerawada and Dighi hills where the grasslands dominate. Pune is located amicably at a height of 560 metres above sea level, blessed with ambient climate and three moderate seasons. Climate is on hot arid side, but the physical settings make it more conducive and comfortable, the quintessential Pensioner’s Paradise! The original source of water for Pune region, west flowing rivers and the streams is the Southwest Monsoon and it receives the decent annual rainfall of 722 mm. The rainfall last for four months and further the seasonal rivers carry water for the next four months thus providing water for an average of eight to 10 months in a year (this was before dams, canals and wells!). This is a decent average for seasonal rivers to support a settlement in harsh Deccan region. So, how many rivers do you think flow through Pune? Mula and Mutha are principal rivers which are known to average Punekar (some ignorant folks still confuse the Mutha and Mula.) Like major river-based civilisations, Pune enjoys its settlement on the banks of river Mutha and Mula which are tributaries of the river Bhima meeting the larger river Krishna. Even today, the epicentre of growth of Pune is located on banks of river Mutha from which the city grew to the present size. The sacred confluence of important rivers, Mula and Mutha in Pune is marked at Sangam, near the present College of Engineering, not by any large pilgrim site, but the settlement of Pune itself. It is roughly situated in a saucer shaped basin with two main rivers and hills on all sides. But, as we take stock of greater Pune, we can count six rivers, namely Mula Mutha, Pavana, Indrayani, Ram and the youngest and shortest Dev (originating near NDA hills), which flow through this city. Till recently, the Ram and Dev were not acknowledged as rivers by the town planning authorities, but now thanks to historical evidence and vigilant citizens’ movements their status as rivers have been duly reclaimed. Various rivulets and streams which originate in the hills of Pune further divide the river basin to form distinct landforms. Nagjhari stream, Ambil Odha, Bhairoba nala and such freshwater streams (once!) were revered as sacred water sources. They formed the physical boundary dividing cultural landscape of Pune in later days. River Mutha enters Pune it as it rolls down from the steeper Sahaydri slopes and hits the wider valleys which allow it to meander through. The meander invariably causes the excavation of and deposition on the alternate river banks. These eventual deposition processes create the safe grounds which stay above the seasonal flood lines of the river. It also creates fertile agricultural lands ready for cultivation. Early settlers have favoured this arrangement and have taken refuge on the same as we shall see in our further conversations. Politically, Pune is part of Western Maharashtra located in state of Maharashtra, but it is the physical features such as mountains, rivers, ridges and hill ranges that have determined its expanse in the past. These physical environmental features have allowed expansion or limit the spread in of the Human settlement of Pune and hence, have been acting as boundaries. These physical landscapes and waterscapes continue to provide the amicable, life giving foundation to the life-scape and people-scape of Pune. So while we take great pride in calling ourselves most liveable city in India, we should not forget respecting the blessed land and definitely strive to protect, conserve the “Punya-Bhumi” of Pune.Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

This is causing the government loss of crores of rupees in Value Added Tax (VAT), they added.The problem is compounded by smuggling of diesel from the neighbouring state for illegal retail sale to farmers and vehicle owners in remote areas.What is even worse, unlicensed tankers being used for the smuggling are hazardous and can cause dangerous accidents. The tankers licensed by Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization (PESO) are the only ones allowed to transport diesel.A delegation of the Petroleum Dealers’ Association led by the association’s divisional president, Piyush Shukla, met the Bhabua district magistrate and superintendent of police on Tuesday, requesting for immediate and firm action to check the menace.Association’s district organization in-charge Chandra Prakash Arya said that three petrol pumps near the UP border had already been closed and several others were running in huge losses due to the diesel smuggling. There are 38 petrol pumps in the district, 15 of those are on NH 2. They claim that from 80 lakh liters of diesel per month, the sale had come down to 32 lakh liters a month. Same was the situation in other districts bordering UP.Also Read: 7 IAS officers promoted in Bihar, Patna DM gets secretary rankThe body informed the administration that National Highway 2, Dharuli-Chand, Hata-Mahadaich, Adhaura-Khaliari, Sarki-UP, Ramgarh-Baraura and Devhalia-Kakrait roads were being used for smuggling.Shukla said the situation worsened after 2016, when the Bihar government imposed excessive VAT and surcharge on fuel to compensate for the losses suffered due to the liquor ban. Presently, the price of diesel and petrol is cheaper by Rs 7/litre in UP.District magistrate, Nawal Kishor Chaudhary said that a team of district supply officers and sub divisional officers has been formed for taking strict action against the smugglers and also for regular surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/smuggling-of-diesel-from-up-causing-huge-loss-to-bihar-coffers-dealers/story-LhS1bboJpBWmDQoQZ4kHNJ.html

30-12-2020||Chandigarh||PAU scientist objects to varsity wanting profs to listen to Modi||At a time when the farmers and the Centre are locked in an impasse over the three laws, intellectuals are also lending support to farmers, in their own way. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) principal soil chemist Varinderpal Singh has objected to the varsity, sending an email to teachers to attend a programme, online, of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25. Modi was to address farmers and transfer money into their accounts. The varsity, incidentally, has been opposing the laws. After refusing to receive a national award in Delhi earlier this month to express solidarity with the protesting farmers, he has now written an open letter to university vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon.“Maximum registrations should also be organised at campuses of all universities/institutes/KVKs inviting farmers, scientists, students and other stakeholders. Viewing of the program telecast/webcast should be arranged. This should be considered as top priority and a report should be compiled,” the email that Trilochan Mohapatra, director general, Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), sent reads. Each individual had to click to the link with the mail, Varinderpal said, “It is perhaps for the first time that attendance of students was made mandatory and even a report was compiled on this. The entire exercise has made my head hang in shame. Instead of listening to the lecture, as mute spectators authorities are duty-bound to highlight the flaws in the new laws.”Varinderpal had refused an award that comprised Rs 2 lakh, a gold medal, and a citation. The video of his refusing to accept the award had gone viral. A few days later, the PAU V-C had submitted a report compiled by the economics department to the Punjab government, highlighting flaws in three farm laws. PAU additional director, communication, TS Riar said forwarding such communications on email was a routine matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pau-scientist-objects-to-varsity-wanting-profs-to-listen-to-modi/story-vbl1mnqwo54tHD6EstFAzL.html

30-12-2020||Lifestyle||2020 Life in Mask: One for the market, one for the Metro, and one for the wedding down the lane||Adjusting to the new normal has certainly been difficult for every one in the year that was spent fighting Covid-19 pandemic. But one accessory that not just helped many survive, but has now acquired a character of its own in our day-to-day lives, ie mask, is something that a few are yet to adapting to wearing whereas other consider as a boon to remain guarded from unwanted pollution and social exchanges of smiles. From a daily necessity to a fashion statement, a mask has been all this in 2020, and after having many transitions, is ready to step along with us into 2021. But, before that, here’s a glimpse of the life that most of us lived while being masked! Safety first or fashion?“I personally chose to use the same kind of mask throughout. Many people had different masks for different purposes — one for work, one for the markets, one for low key formal events. In this time, there was also sort of an evolution of masks, where we learnt about the pros and cons of surgical masks, cloth masks, and even the fact that we shouldn’t use masks with respirators etcetera. For me, I chose to go with the safer option rather than the fashionable one to suit the occasion,” says Abhir Bhalla, an 18-year-old student of political science and international relations at a Sonipat-based university. Missing the smiles: warm or cheeky“One of the most visible impact of 2020, the face masks are something that initially I also took time to get used to. But now, they are part of my attire like I’ve a simple cloth mask for my running and cycling while N95 masks are for going out to the market and other places. The great thing about masks is that they give a sense of safety, which is very important in these difficult times of Covid-19. The only flip side is missing people’s smile,” says Amit Bhatt, a Delhi-based expert on urban transport planning. Mask must match with outfit“Initially I was really put off with the fact that I’d have to wear a mask as it makes it difficult for me to breathe, but obviously I didn’t have choice and had to wear one. So, I bought masks that would go with my outfits, and started switching gradually from the boring old masks to custom-made masks. These made it easier for me to deal with the concept of wearing one all the time, when out of home. The incentive? It does a good job of hiding my acne,” chuckles Vanshika Rana, a Gurugram-based student.Three must picks - Spectacles, phone and mask“Before 2020, my spectacles and my phone were the only two things that used to go with me everywhere. And now in 2020 it’s spectacles, phone and mask. Like most of us, I too made it a part of my daily life. At first, it was irritating because we were not used to wearing it or even the fact that one has to remember to carry it like other essentials! But now it’s normal. Be it a festival or any event, I wear a mask everywhere,” says Mahak Bhalla, a Delhi-based freelance photographer.Eat, drink or click pics, mask is must “We have got used to living with a mask. When we get together with friends and colleagues, the mask is on for a long time. It only comes off when we sit to eat or drink. And when the time comes to take pictures, we look like members of a rock band with our faces visible, but standing in a zigzag formation to maximise the number of people who can get into the frame while maintaining social distancing,” says Manas Fuloria, head of an IT firm.Mask for corona today, oxygen tom? “It’s a way of life now. I’m quite comfortable wearing a mask for three hours at a stretch now,” says Nitima Arora, Gurugram- based teacher, adding, “We can’t keep our eyes shut to the demand of these times, to stay safe. The pace at which we are eating away our planet’s resources, we might even have to wear oxygen cylinders one day. The question is: Are we ready to make amendments? If no, then I don’t think many of us would really leave any legacy for our future generations.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/2020-life-in-mask-one-for-the-market-one-for-the-metro-and-one-for-the-wedding-down-the-lane/story-tE9gUn6HBLozefcDcqYqeK.html

30-12-2020||Delhi||Lower legal drinking age to 21, reduce number of dry days: Delhi panel||A committee set up by the Delhi government to suggest ways to augment excise revenue has suggested that the legal age for drinking be reduced from 25 years to 21 years in Delhi, the number of dry days in a year be reduced to three, issuing of licenses to departmental stores to sell beer and wine be convenient, and there be more equitable distribution of government-run liquor stores across the city, said a senior government official.The senior official said that the legal drinking age of 21 years will be at par with several other states and so will be the policy of lesser dry days. If approved, the three dry days are supposed to be on Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti.Also Read: Government doubles penalty for missing ITR due date this yearDelhi has 864 liquor stores that are operated by government agencies such as Delhi tourism corporation, Delhi state civil supplies corporation limited, and Delhi state industrial and infrastructure development corporation. The committee has recommended an equitable distribution of such stores across all 272 municipal wards, NDMC areas and the indira Gandhi International Airport, said the official citing a report prepared by the committee.There are also 125 department stores in Delhi which sell beer and wine under the L12 and L12-F excise licenses. Under these categories of licenses, the stores are required to ensure that not more than 10% of their total floor area is utilised to store wine and beer. Last year, after 41 departmental stores were found violating such norms, the government had refused to invite renewal applications for all stores under the L12 and L12-F categories. The committee has recommended ease of license norms for such stores from the financial year 2021-22, said the official.The committee was set up in September by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance and excise portfolios, to suggest measures to augment state excise revenue, including measures to check malpractices and evasion of duty in liquor trade and supporting the driving mechanism. The recommendations of the committee are yet to be put up in public domain for feedback from stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lower-legal-drinking-age-to-21-reduce-number-of-dry-days-delhi-panel/story-VALbdqcLHiZQO02L2S73UL.html

All of the four have been isolated in separate rooms in a special ward at Lok Nayak Hospital. None of them have shown any symptom of Covid-19 and continue to be stable, authorities said. “The viral sequencing of eight persons admitted to the hospital has been done; four were found to have the UK variant,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. So far, the hospital has admitted 35 people to the special ward designated for isolating patients infected with the new variant of the virus. Of these, 20 have returned from the UK and the other 15 are people who have come in contact with them. Also Read: UK virus strain in India: 14 more test positive, 20 cases so farThe 2,000-bed Lok Nayak Hospital was designated as the nodal centre for isolation of persons who are suspected to have the new variant of the viral infection – those who have either returned from the UK between November 25 and December 21 or those who have tested positive after coming in contact with UK returnees. The Indian government suspended flights from the United Kingdom December 23 onwards and tested those landing in India from the country two days prior to it. The measure was initiated in light of London and other parts of the United Kingdom going into a lockdown because of a fast-spreading mutated variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The UK variant has 23 mutations, one of which is on the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that the virus uses to enter the human body. The new variant is thought to be 70% more transmissible that the previous one. Doctors and scientists have, however, not seen a high number of people with severe disease or deaths due to the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-people-in-delhi-test-positive-for-uk-covid-strain/story-dof8Tz5KpaUE69iAZoirKM.html

30-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Man slips into coma due to blood clots in brain after Covid-19, recovers||After weaning a man recovering from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) off a ventilator, doctors from a city hospital were left perplexed when he did not wake up and instead slipped into coma. The doctors discovered he had multiple swellings in his brain and nearly 400 micro-clots. The condition has come to be known as Covid encephalitis worldwide. The condition, which before Covid-19 was known as acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, is a rare disorder that follows a viral or bacterial infection and causes sudden swelling in the brain and the spinal cord, damaging the myelin layer of the nerves or the white matter in the brain. This, doctors from Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi say, might be the first reported case of Covid encephalitis from India. Also Read: UK virus strain in India: 14 more test positive, 20 cases so farThe man, 55-year-old Mithilesh Labru from Jammu, was advised home isolation after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 as he was thought to have a mild course of the disease. However, after four or five days of home isolation in early November, his condition started deteriorating rapidly. He was admitted to a local hospital in Jammu with shortness of breath. The doctors there found that he had developed pneumonia – inflammation in the lungs because of an infection – and put him on a ventilator to help him breathe. They then consulted a team of doctors from Apollo, Delhi, as the patient’s condition was critical and he also had comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. A team of doctors from Apollo, including senior cardiac surgeon Dr Mukesh Goel, senior interventionist Dr Devjeevan and head of emergency department Dr Priyadarshini Pal were flown to Jammu to stabilise the patient. Even with the support of a heart-lung machine the patient was unstable and could not be flown to Delhi. The team of doctors stabilised his condition for two or three days there before flying him to Delhi in an air ambulance. At Indraprastha Apollo hospital, he was admitted to the Covid ICU under respiratory disease specialist Dr Rajesh Chawla. “He was admitted to the Covid ICU on a ventilator at the hospital and his condition was monitored closely. When he started showing signs of recovery, he was removed from the ventilator. But he had slipped into a deep coma,” said Dr Chawla. Usually, when patients are weaned off a ventilator, they wake up after a few hours. “When patients recovering from Covid pneumonia are removed from sedation and muscle relaxants after being on a ventilator, they come back to consciousness within hours. But that did not happen with the patient. His MRI revealed that there were multiple swellings in the brain along with over 400 micro blood clots,” said Dr Vinit Suri, senior consultant of Neurosciences, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. With immune therapy and steroids, the doctors were able to gradually revive the patient to complete consciousness within seven days. He still had slight weakness of the limbs. “However, his post treatment MRI shows more than 50% recovery and the patient has been discharged on December 26,” said Dr Suri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-who-slipped-into-coma-due-to-blood-clots-in-brain-after-covid-19-recovers/story-xeXXWAeDs3saCiq2biJW3N.html

30-12-2020||Bhopal||‘Playing with lives’: MP CM backs life term for adulteration||Madhya Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved the draft of an Ordinance that provides for life term in jail to those found guilty of food or drugs adulteration in the state, as was announced by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan after the cabinet meeting. The draft was sent to Madhya Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel for promulgation of the Ordinance, along with drafts on certain other ordinances. The cabinet also approved MP Freedom of Religion Ordinance for stringent punishment to those found guilty of forcing religious conversion by way of allurement, misrepresentation, threat, force, undue influence, coercion-marriage and any fraudulent means. The cabinet approved the drafts on Ordinances for its promulgation as the state government couldn’t table the bills to the effect in the state assembly during its scheduled three-day winter session from Monday, which was cancelled on Sunday evening due to prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state in general and in state capital Bhopal in particular. In a video message released to media, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “The state government received information about food and drug adulteration. There were reports about adulteration even in plasma... fake plasma. What can be a bigger crime than this? Whether it’s adulteration of food or medicines, it’s nothing but playing with the lives of people. This can’t be allowed in Madhya Pradesh at any rate.” The Ordinance draft will amend sections 272 (Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (Sale of noxious food or drink), 274 (Adulteration of drugs), 275 (Sale of adulterated drugs) and 276 (Sale of drug as a different drug or preparation) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) to enhance quantum of punishment from 6 months to life imprisonment in jail.“But our focus through the ordinance is on those who manufacture these items and the factory where such items are manufactured, not the traders who sell,” said Chouhan. “A sub-section (273-A) will be added to section 273 of IPC to ensure punishment up to 5 years in jail and Rs 1 lakh fine to those who sell food items after its expiry date. I think this law will play a major role in checking adulteration in our campaign against the same in the state,” he added. On MP Freedom of Religion Ordinance, the CM said, “We have made a provision for stringent punishment for religious conversion of women, daughters, especially minor daughters and scheduled castes and tribes, in violation of the law. The punishment is a minimum of two years to a maximum of 10 years in jail and also a fine of Rs 50000.” He said marrying a girl after conversion done by way of allurement, threat, coercion, impersonation or with bad intention will be unlawful. “Such a crime is going on a large scale in Madhya Pradesh. This can’t be tolerated”, he said. Also Read: Retired IAF officer’s body found in semi-burnt state, police suspect murder He said the government had also made a provision that mass religious conversion of two or more people will be held in violation of the law and will attract a minimum jail term of 5 years and a maximum of 10 years apart from a minimum fine of Rs one lakh. On another Ordinance draft aimed to amend public service guarantee, he said, “As per the existing provision, the government officer/personnel who is supposed to ensure delivery of the service faces a fine on delay and the amount of the fine is given to the complainant. We are adding one more provision to it that if the service is not delivered in the stipulated period of time, the person who seeks the service will get it as deemed one, generated through the computer. And the government officer and personnel concerned will have no role in it.” State Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said there was no need for MP Freedom of Religion Ordinance and Public Service Guarantee Ordinance, claiming existing laws in the state served a similar purpose.“For an instance, in case of marriage with a minor girl whether with consent or lure or intimidation, it is considered as a rape under the IPC. Forced conversion is already a crime. The ordinance on adulteration was brought as the then Kamal Nath government had launched a massive state-wide campaign against adulteration instead of a lip service and action was taken against several adulteration mafia under the National Security Act across the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/playing-with-lives-mp-cm-backs-life-term-for-adulteration/story-BaJVtbRGuyM2R1Wjh9sYUK.html

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants bail to man booked for raping woman at her husband’s behest||The Bombay high court (HC) has granted bail to a man booked for allegedly having sexual relations with a woman at the behest of her husband. Though the woman had identified the accused, he was granted bail on the grounds that it was not clear if he had sexual relations with the woman and as the act was done on the prompting of the husband, it did not attract section 376 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with punishment for rape. A bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the bail application of the man accused for raping the complainant between 2015 and 2018, was informed that the applicant had been arrested in the course of investigation after the woman complained that she was forced by her husband to have sexual relations with other men in his presence. As per the complaint, the woman was married in 2009 to a person who was working in the merchant navy. She alleged that after his return from the ship in 2015, the husband invited a couple to their home. After consuming liquor, the husband’s friend had sexually assaulted the complainant. The next day, the husband informed her that he had recorded the act and had himself asked the friend to have sex with her. Similar incidents took happened in 2016 and 2018 also, allegedly at the behest of the husband. The woman claimed that she was forced to comply as the husband had threatened to make the objectionable video viral. The complaint further stated that the woman was sexually abused by the husband too and was also forced to have unnatural sex. She finally lodged the complaint in February 2019 against the husband and other persons who had sexually assaulted her. The advocate for the applicant submitted that though the incidents had occurred between 2015 and 2018, the complaint was lodged in 2019 and hence, there was inordinate delay in lodging the first information report (FIR). She further submitted that though her client was identified by the woman in an identification parade, a vague role was attributed to him. In light of this offence, section 376 (rape) cannot be applied to the applicant. The additional public prosecutor submitted that the woman was forced to indulge into sexual relationship by her husband with other persons and was threatened and a video recording of the sexual assault was also done. The applicant was identified and his role in the act has also been defined and hence the application should be rejected. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “Prima facie it appears that section 376 may not be attracted against applicant. Since the trial is pending, giving such finding is not warranted. The applicant is in custody for a period of about one and half year.” In light of this the court granted him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-booked-for-raping-woman-at-her-husband-s-behest/story-f51vnCKNlFjKastbSjDBsJ.html
30-12-2020||Chandigarh||Adult couple can live together even if man is not yet of marriageable age: HC||The right of an adult couple to live together can’t be denied just because the man has not yet attained the marriageable age, the Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled. The bench of Justice Alka Sarin observed that the couple being adult has every right to live their lives as they desire within the boundaries of the law. “The society cannot determine how an individual should live her or his life. The Constitution guarantees every individual the right to life. The freedom to choose one’s partner is an important facet of the right to life. In the present case, the girl’s parents cannot dictate how and with whom she should spend her life since she is adult. Parents cannot compel a child to live life on their terms,” the bench said. The court directed the Fatehgarh Sahib senior superintendent of police (SSP) to decide on the protection petition submitted by the couple and take necessary action as per law. The two had approached the court after seeking protection of life and liberty, claiming that the SSP did not act on their plea as they were threatened with dire consequences by the girl’s parents. The court was told that the girl is 19 and the boy 20 and they wanted to marry. But when the girl’s parents became aware of their relationship, fights took place between the families and she was even given severe beatings, it was informed. The girl who was allegedly confined in a room left her home on December 20 and the two started living together. The court observed the girl is well within her right to decide for herself what is good for her and what is not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/adult-couple-can-live-together-even-if-man-is-not-yet-of-marriageable-age-hc/story-eZBtC8NnzH7n1QOLCOOZ0O.html

The mother of two had been in critical condition for 15 days after she suffered 55% burns when her husband poured petrol on her and set her on fire. Musibal and two others have been arrested for murder by the Tulinj police while one more accused is yet to be arrested.Musibal worked as a helper at a catering company while Ayesha worked at a Vasai factory, said Shashikant Awaghade, assistant inspector, Tulinj police station. They resided at Ekta Nagar,Behari Mohalla,Tulinj, Nallasopara. “Musibal would often demand money from Ayesha, and there would be regular arguments on this issue. On Friday, a similar argument ensued, and Ayesha refused to give him money as she had to buy groceries for the family,” said the officer.“Musibal got angry and left the house. He returned after a few hours with his brothers Shakeel, Akhil and Sohail, and again an argument ensued. Musibal had carried along a bottle of petrol, and he poured the fuel on Ayesha and set her on fire. Hearing her screams, the neighbours admitted her to a local hospital, and she was later shifted to Nair Hospital where she died on Monday,” said Awaghade.“We had arrested Musibal earlier under section 307 (attempt to murder), and now he is booked under sections 302 (murder) and 498(a) (harassing a married woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Irregularities in admissions: Bombay HC orders state board to cancel affiliation of Nagpur junior college||Taking a stern view of irregularities in college admissions, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently directed the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) to initiate the process for cancellation of affiliation and recognition of a junior college in Nagpur for admitting two ineligible students to its science stream.The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote was hearing a petition filed by students Aditya Bhoyar and Abhishek Gayki of Saraswat Junior College of Science and Commerce at Saoner in Nagpur district.The petitioners had moved HC after the results of their higher secondary certificate (HSC) examination were withheld by the board as they were not eligible for admission to the science stream.The petitioners had sought a direction to the board to declare their HSC results, claiming that they were being punished for no fault of their own. They pointed out that they were earlier denied admissions to the science stream, for having secured only 33℅ marks in science in the SSC exam, and had to take admission in the commerce stream instead. Later, they applied for a change to the science stream, and the college granted their request. They went on to appear for the HSC examination this year.The board responded to the petition, pointing out that their admission to the science stream had already been cancelled on July 24, 2020, and therefore, there was no question of declaration of their HSC results.HC accepted the board’s contention that from the very beginning, admission of the petitioners to the science stream was in clear violation of the eligibility criteria, and on this ground, refused to interfere with the cancellation of their admission.The bench opined that the petitioners were also expected to read the instructions carefully before seeking admission and since they have not done this exercise, “at least part of the fault would also be lying at their doorsteps”.HC, however, held the junior college responsible for the loss of two precious academic years of the petitioners. The judges said the junior college is presumed to be aware of the eligibility criteria and therefore, ought not to have entertained the application for change of stream when the petitioners did not qualify for it.“In such a case, the larger share of fault would have to be owned by respondent No 4 (college) and respondent No 4 would also be required to be made accountable for the same,” said HC. “If this is not done, such activities, undesirable and unethical as they are, would continue,” the court added and directed the board to initiate action for cancellation of affiliation and recognition of the junior college. HC has also granted liberty to the petitioner students to sue the college for compensation on account of the loss of their two academic years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/irregularities-in-admissions-bombay-hc-orders-state-board-to-cancel-affiliation-of-nagpur-junior-college/story-X7BA2T9qB8tdtR8yXt0JsL.html

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s medical tourism drops by 80% amid Covid-19 pandemic||With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, the city has seen a sharp dip in the number of international patients. Until the lockdown curtailed international travel, Mumbai was one of the major hubs for medical tourism in India. According to the ministry of tourism, around 7 lakh foreigners applied for medical visas in 2019. However, medical tourism was halted this year when Covid-19 spread globally. International commute systems have since been severely restricted. For South African national Wazir Khan, 32, the process of bringing his son Nayum to Mumbai for a liver transplant was beset with challenges. “My son was born in October 2019. Within a few days, he was diagnosed with rare biliary atresia,” said Khan. Biliary atresia is a rare disease of the liver and bile ducts that occurs in infants. “My baby also underwent surgery in South Africa but it didn’t provide him with any relief. The only way to save him was a liver transplant,” he said. Khan decided to bring Nayum to Mumbai for the medical transplant, but he had to struggle for three months to get the passport and medical visa. “I kept knocking at the doors of the immigration offices but I wasn’t getting the help. Then finally, a senior politician came to our rescue and helped me get the passport and visa,” he said.Unfortunately for Khan, before he could bring Nayum to Mumbai, the lockdown was announced and international flights were cancelled. This led to delays and he was finally able to bring Nayum to the city in November. The one-year-old was then admitted to Global Hospital and underwent a liver transplant on November 25. Fortunately, Khan was a perfect match for his son and so donated a part of his liver for the transplant. Nayum is still in hospital and the Khans hope to return to South Africa on January 22, 2021.India is one of Asia’s fastest-growing medical tourism destinations and Mumbai is a major hub for relatively affordable healthcare. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, city hospitals say they saw a regular stream of foreign patients who came for investigations, diagnoses and treatments like chemotherapy. Nigerian Onyeka Pascal, 36, has been suffering from a heart valve disease since 2007 but was not able to afford the necessary surgery. By 2015, his condition had worsened significantly. Ultimately, Pascal decided to come to India to get a high-risk complex heart valve replacement procedure. Around the same time, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic and Pascal had to wait for months to get his medical visa. When he was finally able to travel, he needed special permission from Nigeria to avoid the 14 days of compulsory quarantine after landing in Mumbai on November 6. On November 7, Pascal underwent the heart valve replacement procedure at Fortis Hospital, in Mulund under Dr Manish Hinduja, Consultant,Cardio Thoracic and Vascular Surgery. He was admitted on November 7. After stabilizing him, the surgery was performed only on November 20. He was discharged on December 8 and returned to Nigeria on December 14.The pandemic and lockdown have meant few patients like Pascal and Nayum. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer of Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, in Powai, said the super speciality hospital hadn’t seen any international patients since March. “We are yet to receive any patient from aboard. But we are hopeful that soon, the situation will improve,” said Dr Chatterjee.Some city doctors say the number of international patients has gone down by around 80%. Dr Aparna Govil Bhasker, bariatric and laparoscopic surgeon, at Saifee Hospital, said, “International medical tourism has taken a big hit during the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. In the last month or so, the number of patients travelling to Mumbai has increased, but even now it is just about 20% of what it used to be prior to the lockdown.”Dr Ramakant Deshpande, chairman of ACI Cumballa Hill Hospital, said, “The travelling percentage has come down to 20-25%. Earlier, five to 10 international patients would come every month to the hospital. Now we see only one patient per month and patients from the United Kingdom aren’t allowed to come.”Last week, in a virtual seminar, minister of state for tourism and culture Prahlad Singh Patel had predicted growth for medical tourism to India. “The post-pandemic situation is one where our system of medicine, local cure and wellness methods are what could be best suited to deal with it. After Corona [Covid-19], medical tourism is expected to rise and we must be prepared for this opportunity,” Patel had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-medical-tourism-drops-by-80-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-XJo4SZ6SPnQsZo66bpRLXL.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Car designer’s firm took loans to buy their own vehicles by posing as customers: Mumbai crime branch||The Mumbai crime branch, which is probing the cheating case against famous car designer Dilip Chhabria, has found that his firm had availed loans from some non-banking financial companies (NBFC) by posing as customers wanting to buy sports cars manufactured by the group itself.Preliminary probe has revealed that loans averaging ₹42 lakh per car had been availed by the firm, Dilip Chhabria (DC) Designs Pvt Ltd, on about 90 of the total 120 cars sold by it. In some cases, loans had even been availed after selling the vehicles to their buyers.Chhabria was arrested on Monday and has been remanded to police custody till January 2. Assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze of the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) had received a tip-off about a two-seater sports car – DC Avanti – plying towards south Mumbai on a bogus registration number. A trap was laid and the car was spotted in Colaba on December 18. The vehicle was taken into custody. The police learnt that the car was registered in Chennai and the owner had submitted the original documents, which were later found to be genuine, said a crime branch officer. Further probe, however, revealed that another car with the same engine and chassis number had been registered in Haryana.According to police, Chhabria had manufactured 127 DC-Avanti cars in the past four years, of which the firm had sold 120 in India. The crime branch suspects that 90 such cars were found to be registered with the same engine, chassis number in different states, under different registration numbers, said joint commissioner of police (crime branch) Milind Bharambe. “We will probe why NBFCs didn’t complain when the loans were not repaid. We’ll also have to see how the regional transport departments didn’t notice that the same engine and chassis numbers were used to register different vehicles across cities with different registration numbers,” said the crime branch officer. “We are also verifying if there is any quantum of loss caused by the accused by not paying the applicable taxes such as custom duties and GST (goods and services tax) etc,” said Bharambe. DC Designs Pvt Ltd was incorporated on June 14, 1993, and the sports car, DC -Avanti, was launched in 2016 after a formal certification by Automotive Research Association of India in March 2015. The sports car was manufactured at a plant in Pune district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/car-designer-s-firm-took-loans-to-buy-their-own-vehicles-by-posing-as-customers-mumbai-crime-branch/story-xU2ho1NVUMDvPm3v6CCgzI.html
30-12-2020||City||Land acquisition for road: PWD files recovery suit against Punjab minister Rana Sodhi, kin||The public works department (PWD) on Tuesday filed a recovery suit against Punjab cabinet minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi alias Guru Gurmeet Singh and his family members --- brother Guru Hardeep Singh and nephews, Prabhjot Singh and Jasdeep Singh --- in the Guruharsahai court for allegedly pocketing double compensation against a piece of land acquired by the state government for a road project. One Joginder Singh has also been named in the petition. The department has also made Gurharsahai SDM, a respondent in the matter. The court has fixed the next hearing on January 4. The said land at Mohanki Attar village had been acquired for the Ferozepur-Fazilka-Gurharsahai road. The family received ₹1.83 crore compensation in 2013 for the land after re-acquisition in 2012, which, as per records, was also acquired in 1962 and a sum of ₹7,384 paid. The land — 55 kanal and 6 marla of Rana Sodhi and 38 kanal of his nephew Jasdeep Sodhi (son of Hardeep Singh) — was re-acquired by the Punjab government and compensation was paid after the owners approached the court. In the petition, a copy in possession of Hindustan Times, the PWD has pleaded that land awards should be set aside by the court as Sodhi family had obtained these by “playing fraud on the court and state by concealing facts”. The petition also urged criminal action against Rana Sodhi and others. In the suit, the department also urged the court to set aside the 2005 decree passed by the civil judge, Ferozepur, in this matter. The petition further said that the factum of the acquisition of the land and the compensation already paid, was not brought to the notice of the court of the civil judge in 2005. “The state has also sought restitution of compensation worth Rs 1.83 crore paid to Rana Sodhi and his family members in the year 2014 against the illegal re-acquisition of the land in 2012,” reads the petition. The state also urged the court for permanent injunction restraining them from claiming the enhancement of the compensation under new land acquisition law, which was ordered 2015. In March 2020, a government sub-committee found that Rana Sodhi’s family has got double compensation for the land. Rana Sodhi said the matter was sub-judice. A contempt petition was pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court, he added. “Whatever the Punjab government officials are saying is totally immaterial and false as they have their own motives. They are just resorting to witch-hunting. I don’t want to comment on them”, Sodhi told HT/ As per December 17 order of high court in this matter, the government has been directed to deposit re-determined amount of land compensation of 2015, in the court concerned within one week. The re-determination of compensation has been upheld even by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/land-acquisition-for-road-pwd-files-recovery-suit-against-punjab-minister-rana-sodhi-kin/story-L5BfmxARlonxzB2peCIiSN.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena leader Nitin Nandgaonkar seeks withdrawal of 55 cases against him under Maharashtra government’s new policy||Shiv Sena leader Nitin Nandgaonkar, who is known for his violent agitations on various issues, now wants the 55 criminal cases lodged against him to be withdrawn under the government’s new policy which allows withdrawal of cases lodged for social and political agitations. Nandgaonkar said he has asked his lawyer to initiate the process for the withdrawal of these cases. Nandgaonkar, the firebrand Sena leader, was recently in the news for threatening the owner of Karachi Sweets in Bandra, demanding that he change the name of his shop. The incident drew extensive criticism, and even the Sena had to distance itself from the action. In the past, Nandgaonkar had beaten up a few auto drivers for rigging their meters and had attacked a molester from Matunga. He is facing cases in various police stations in the city. “I have no regrets for having criminal cases registered against me. Most of the sections under which cases are lodged against me are non-bailable, but every time, I have been given bail by honourable courts as they believed my intention. In none of the cases was I imprisoned. All my agitations are for social causes and against injustices to the common man. In most of the cases – be it overcharging by autos or inflated bills by hospitals during the pandemic – the results were seen,” said Nandgaonkar. He added that cases against him were fit for withdrawal under the state government’s policy. “I have asked my lawyer to begin the process to seek the withdrawal of the cases,” he said. The state cabinet on December 2 had cleared the proposal to allow withdrawing of cases registered for social/political agitations in the past five years till December 31, 2019. Most of the cases registered against Nandgaonkar at are under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt). Nandgaonkar holds Janata Darbar and addresses public grievances at the party headquarters Sena Bhavan in Dadar every Wednesday and Thursday. He recently courted controversy after he demanded the Karachi Sweets shop change its name. His party, however, distanced itself from the action, saying it was not the Sena’s official stand. “It was my spontaneous reaction, and I have no regrets. I was never rebutted or pulled up by the leadership for it, nor was any action taken against me,” he said. Opining on Nandgaonkar’s demand for withdrawal of cases against him, noted government prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said, “I would not talk about the individual cases, but the cases for social/political protests are withdrawn under section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code only after the approval of public prosecutors and the trial courts.” According to an official from the state home department, the cases are individual in nature, and the decision on them will be taken by the home minister, who is the authority for the recommendation. He also added that the cases can be withdrawn only after trial courts approve the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-leader-nitin-nandgaonkar-seeks-withdrawal-of-55-cases-against-him-under-maharashtra-government-s-new-policy/story-xMhrYD5aVWsibddOccSsuO.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s infra dream takes a drastic hit in 2020||2020 started with a bang for the financial capital’s infrastructure: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) announced to open two Metro lines between Dahisar and Andheri; work on the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension, the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC)-Vakola Junction elevated road and the Kalanagar junction revamp was scheduled to be completed this year. But, like every other sector that got hit starting March 24, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown owing to increasing cases of Covid-19 in the country and days before the Maharashtra government began its phase-wise clampdown, infrastructure was also hit badly. In the following months, manufacturing and supply of parts were hit, migrant labourers working on sites started moving to their villages owing to the uncertainty in cities and work came to a standstill.These reasons have resulted in a delay in infrastructure projects in the city with a population of 12.5 million.At the beginning of 2020, Mumbai was promised an infrastructure overhaul with two new metros and three new road projects that would ease daily commute. Six years after Mumbai got its first Metro connecting Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar, the MMRDA was going to open Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), expected to reduce congestion on SV Road, western express highway (WEH) and the crowded suburban railway. Also, the SCLR extension, the BKC-Vakola Junction elevated road and the Kalanagar junction improvement work were expected to be completed this year.RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “It was indeed a very difficult year for infrastructure as a variety of factors was affected owing to the lockdown. However, we have great satisfaction that we constructed the Covid-19 facility in BKC when it was needed the most and could contribute to the fight against the pandemic.” The authority had built a 1,008-bed facility in BKC in less than a fortnight and handed it over to the municipal body. Here’s how the labour force was hit. The MMRDA had deployed more than 5,000 labourers at the Mumbai Trans- Harbour Link (MTHL) site before the lockdown. However, only close to 2,000 workers were at the site by the end of July. The 22-km sea link will connect Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. Similarly, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), executing the 33.5-km underground corridor from Colaba to Seepz, had 15,000 labourers before the lockdown, which went down to 8,000 in July. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had to ask state agencies to recruit and train “sons of the soil” for these jobs. Now, a status checkIn September, when things started picking up pace with the Maharashtra government’s Mission Begin Again programme, which majorly looked at reviving economic activities in a controlled manner, MMRDA announced that trial runs for the two corridors will start from Jan 14, 2021 and operations from May 2021. However, the trial runs have now been postponed to March 2021 and the operations are also expected to be hit by two-three months. A senior official from MMRDA said, “The uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 still remains. There is a delay in the design and manufacture of crucial parts, which is affecting civil works.”Last month, MMRDA also approved the delay in executing the SCLR extension, which is now going to be completed only by 2022 with a cost escalation of ₹109 crore. MMRC has also revised its timeline for completing phase one of the project (from Aarey to BKC) from December 2021 to September 2022. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is implementing the 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur expressway, was also hoping to complete 60% of the works by December 2020, however, it’s now looking at completing phase one — between Nagpur and Shirdi — by May 1,2021.Like several infrastructure projects in Mumbai, the ₹55,000-crore project was also affected owing to the pandemic-enforced lockdown. “We had almost 18,000 workers before the lockdown, which went down to 10,000 in the months during the lockdown. Most of the workers started coming in by July-August,” said Radheyshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director of MSRDC, in a press conference in October. The complete corridor, which will connect Mumbai and Nagpur in eight hours, will be operational by 2022.In Mumbai, Rajeev said that MMRDA is hoping to start works on Metro-10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Chowk), Metro-11 (Wadala-General Post Office) and Metro-12 (Kalyan-Taloja) in 2021. “The Kalanagar Junction will be ready in January 2021. We will also start work on the WEH decongestion plan the coming year,” he said.Biggest setbackIn October 2020, Thackeray, in his address to the state announced the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) decision to shift the Metro-3 car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. The state expressed its intention of constructing a common car shed for Metro-3, 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) on the 102-acre plot in Kanjurmarg, which would also serve as an intersection for the proposed line-14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). However, the plans went kaput after the Bombay high court (HC) ordered an interim stay on the transfer of the land to MMRDA after the Central government claimed ownership of it. A senior official from MMRDA said that even if it gets land today, a car shed will be built by June 2023, post which operations for line 3 will begin from December 2023.“It is a project that is going to change the face of travel in Mumbai and now it’s stuck,” said Paresh Rawal, a transport expert based in Mumbai. “The project is in an advanced stage. It is not the time to change its alignment or demarcate another car shed for it.” However, the state government is set to appoint a third committee to look for alternative sites. It is also eyeing a plot in BKC, meant for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, for the car shed. AV Shenoy, from the Mumbai Mobility Forum, said, “All three Metros — 2A, 3 and 7 — have suffered a major setback. We only hope that 2A and 7 are at least operational by mid-2021.” New modes of transportIn 2020, Mumbai’s lifeline stopped, metros got delayed and buses were overcrowded. The only ray of hope was the city’s acceptance of new commutes.Like several cities around the globe that started making way for walking and cycling as it proved to be the safest mode of transport during a pandemic, Mumbai also started slowly adopting it.On August 31, MMRDA launched the public electric bike-sharing facility in BKC. Currently, there are around 18 zones of docks in and around BKC from where commuters can get the bikes. While the chief minister had inaugurated the bikes in January 2020, the launch got postponed owing to the lockdown. Public bike-sharing facility is also available at the Jagruti Nagar Metro station. The service was inaugurated on February 23 this year. Till March 15, 1,821 rides were completed with a majority of rides recorded on weekends and holidays. However, it was then shut owing to the lockdown.The Smart Commute Foundation, founded by the city’s first bicycle mayor, Firoza Suresh, also appointed 24 new bicycle councillors this year with a vision to make Mumbai the bicycle capital of the world by 2030. The foundation’s campaign “Cycle Chala, City Bacha” is now routing for setting up 600 bicycle stands in Mumbai. Suresh said, “Covid has been a blessing in disguise for cyclists this year. People have willingly adapted to the new mode of transport this year. The biggest challenge of 2021 will now be to sustain this momentum.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-infra-dream-takes-a-drastic-hit-in-2020/story-LLGtASue7dteDQnWjfxsHK.html

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records lowest temperature of the season at 15 degree Celsius||The city woke up to a chilly Tuesday morning as temperatures dipped to their lowest this season.The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius, 2.4 degrees below normal, and Colaba recorded 17 degree Celsius, 2.8 degrees below normal. The minimum temperature at Powai dropped to 12.82 degree Celsius while in Goregaon it was 13.8 degree Celsius.Maximum temperatures also remained low on Tuesday. Santacruz recorded a maximum temperature of 29.9 degree Celsius, 1.4 degrees below normal. Colaba recorded 28.5 degree Celsius, 2.2 degrees below normal.“The fall in temperature is mostly due to the cold northerly to north-westerly winds from the northern plains in association with the passage of western disturbance. Cold conditions are likely to continue through Wednesday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD.IMD had predicted a fall in temperatures for two to three days from Sunday.Earlier, the lowest temperature recorded this season was 15.8 degree Celsius on December 23. Last year, the lowest recorded temperature was 16.4 degree Celsius, and in 2018 it was 14.4 degrees.Meanwhile, the air quality in Mumbai and around deteriorated on Tuesday to poor from moderate on Monday. The city’s overall air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator – was 239 (poor) according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) experienced very poor quality of air with an AQI of 341. Air quality was also very poor in Navi Mumbai, which recorded an AQI of 322. A spokesperson from SAFAR said that the air quality dipped on expected lines as lower temperatures lead to higher levels of pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-at-15-degree-celsius/story-znoISAG8VhIV62eMmRu11I.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra law aspirants aiming for SEBC quota cry foul over lack of time to produce EWS quota eligibility certificates||A week after the Bombay high court (HC) clarified that Maratha quota students could avail admissions under the economically weaker sections (EWS) category, admissions to most professional courses have been delayed to accommodate changes that students need to make to their application forms.However, law aspirants have objected to the lack of time given to them to acquire such documents. Many have shared their concerns on social media platforms, and are also seeking clarity from the state common entrance test (CET) cell on the issue.Last week, HC clarified that students from the Maratha community who were aiming for seats under the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) quota may avail reservation under the EWS quota if they provide an undertaking, stating that they will not claim reservations under any other category for their education.It further stated that such candidates would have to prove before the tehsildar that they belong to economically weaker section and only then would they be entitled to the EWS certificate.“This process of securing certificates for any quota is not simple, and in order to get a hold of the EWS certificate, a student will have to submit lots of documents to prove the family income. This move might not help many students,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the Student Law Council, a state-based student support group.Last month, the state government, through a government resolution (GR), clarified that admissions to all courses that were stalled due to lack of clarity on the status of SEBC quota will continue without the said quota. The idea was to avoid any further delay as the Supreme Court is yet to clarify its stand on the same. “This decision of the state government has caused problems for many students who were eligible for seats under the Maratha quota. Giving them the concession of applying under the EWS category is not solving the issue,” added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-law-aspirants-aiming-for-sebc-quota-cry-foul-over-lack-of-time-to-produce-ews-quota-eligibility-certificates/story-7dtWCSwtywsUnjnfn29b7M.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Special dinners, early events at hotels across Mumbai on December 31||With stricter restrictions amid the second strain of the virus causing Covid-19, the New Year celebrations are expected to remain low-key, causing a loss of approximately ₹150 crore in revenue, according to estimates. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has imposed a night curfew till January 5, which bars gathering of more than five people between 11pm and 6am. Consequently, hotels and restaurants will have to close at 11pm, unlike the extension for the New Year’s Eve every year. “People have cancelled their hotel bookings and have headed outside the state. In addition, restaurants will not be able to organise celebrations as they have to wind up by 11pm. We have lost at least ₹150 crore,” said Dilip Datwani, spokesperson, Hotels and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRWAI). Sun-N-Sand Hotel in Juhu plans to just set up tables along the poolside with soothing music in the background. “As our hotel is facing the beach, we will not have loud music. We will serve food, but the entire place will close down at 11pm,” said Kunal Krori, deputy general manager, Sun-N-Sand Hotel. JW Marriott at Sahar will not hold huge celebrations, while St Regis Hotel at Lower Parel will hold a special dinner. Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport hotel is focussing on staycations. “The guests will be able to enjoy specially curated food menu in our coffee shop and can spend time in adjacent courtyard,” said Pankaj Saxena, general manager, Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport hotel. Fountain Hospitality Private Limited (FHPL), which runs four restaurants, including Flamboyante and Fountain Sizzlers, has started taking bookings from their patrons. “We will ring in the new year at 10:30pm,” said Amrish Arora, managing director, FHPL. “Usually, New Year’s eve means three times the regular business, but this year it has been reduced to one-fourth.” Mirah Hospitality, which runs 10 hotels under the brand name Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Mumbai, said they will take their last order at 10pm. “We acknowledge the loss of business, but then there is no choice,” said Aji Nair, COO, food and beverages division, Mirah Hospitality. Savio D’sa, a consultant in the hospitality sector, said such response was expected in view of the curfew. “Many have already gone to Goa, the rest will head to places like Lonavla and Alibag or opt for a house party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-special-dinners-early-events-at-hotels-across-mumbai-on-december-31/story-o4UcIIYd6xa3N1xgXRrsWN.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A sense of poignancy||Encountering a collection of decorations after the event they were meant to celebrate is over presents a poignant sight. Like, the morning after the wedding. Or the day after Christmas, here at the Free Church in south Delhi’s Green Park.The Christmas decorations in the prayer hall are looking fresh, untouched. The gaze first goes to the church’s many ceiling fans. These humble, everyday instruments have been turned into works of art. One fan has paper bells hanging from it. Another has red circular orbs. And then there’s a fan that seems to have a shiny tarantula clinging to it, as if they were two friends frozen into a tight embrace. The walls are studded with Christmas wreaths, too.Actually, the only spot in the church devoid of decoration might be the wall at the back of the altar. With nothing but a simple metal cross fixed on it, it draws attention because of its bareness. The communion table, though, has three flower bouquets arranged upon it.Christmas ended days ago, but the souvenir of it remains, for now. This afternoon the church is empty. The red velvety seats of the pews look creaseless, as if nobody had sat on them for a long time. The silence is absolute but this silence appears extremely fragile, as if at any moment the great congregation was expected to storm through the doors and fill up the place.The only visitor at this time is the sunlight, streaming through glass windows. Bands of light are falling on a smattering of benches. Parts of the wall are streaked with light too, and where it falls the wall seems to lose its solidity, seemingly melting into a porous substance.While the side doors in the church are open to visitors (the fliers warn not to enter without the mask), its giant glass entrance is locked. Beyond it is the church’s main gate, which is locked too. But through the gaps you can glimpse the traffic on Aurobindo Road. The busy blur of the cars heightens the stillness inside the church.In this quietude enters a young man. He walks to the aisle, stands in front of the cross for a moment, and then settles down on one of the benches, motionless.Tracing its origin to 1955, the church remains open throughout the day from 7 am to 7 pm. Services are not being held in the premises due to the coronavirus pandemic “but sometimes people come alone or in a group of two, stay briefly and go away,” says the guard outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-sense-of-poignancy/story-5yCd7S1zapxb8pbpXgAO6I.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||₹1-crore drugs brought for New Year parties in Mumbai seized, 1 arrested||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday arrested the owner of an event management company and seized 4kg of charas and 11kg of marijuana worth around ₹1 crore. NCB officers said the drugs were brought from Jammu and Kashmir to supply at parties on December 31 (New Year’s Eve).Mumbai zonal unit of NCB got a tip-off that a person was going near the Mulund check naka with narcotics substances, so they laid a trap on Monday and intercepted Ashraf Mustafa Shah, a resident of Wagle Estate in Thane (West).“Shah was headed to Mumbai from his residence when he was nabbed near the check naka. He tried to escape, but we chased and nabbed him,” said zonal director Sameer Wankhede of the NCB.During the search, 4kg of charas was recovered from Shah’s possession. He was taken to his residence where NCB officers found 11kg of marijuana. During the inquiry, Shah revealed that the charas was brought from Jammu and Kashmir a few days ago and was to be used at events and parties on December 31, said the NCB officer.According to NCB, Shah has been in the drug business for several years and is connected with suppliers and peddlers in Mumbai. “We are questioning him to find out the venue of the parties and whom he was supposed to deliver the drugs in Mumbai,” added another NCB officer. NCB is also checking his call data records and messages to get further links to his main suppliers from Jammu and Kashmir. Shah has been remanded in the bureau’s custody for further inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-crore-drugs-brought-for-new-year-parties-in-mumbai-seized-1-arrested/story-HHR1xu8WEtMqSErsMLuegK.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai to remain shut until Jan 15, says BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) education department issued a circular announcing that schools across boards and mediums in Mumbai shall remain closed until January 15, 2021. “Even as the number of Covid-19 in the city are under control, considering the second wave of the virus in other countries and the high number of cases in other states, it has been decided to keep schools in the city closed, until January 15, 2021. Schools and colleges of all mediums and managements in the city shall remain shut until then,” states the circular. The schools that fall under the different consulates are allowed to start from January 18, 2021. “These schools would have to follow all the norms with respect to sanitation and safety of children and staff, as stated by the government from time to time,” it further reads. Teachers said that it was a good move to not allow reopening of schools in the coming week. “Due to festivals and holidays, there is a lot of rush outside and there is a huge risk of contracting the virus. In such a situation it is better not to rush the reopening, as students can continue online learning for the next few days,” said the teacher of a south Mumbai-based school. In November, the BMC announced that schools under its jurisdiction shall remain shut until December 31, 2020. Even as several schools in the state reopened from November 23 for Classes 9 to 12, those in the city still remain shut owing to the civic body’s decision. As per the data shared by the state education department, as on December 14, nearly eight lakh students were attending schools on a daily basis in the state, while over 15,000 schools were reopened over the last three weeks.Thane zilla parishad schools prepare to reopenThe Thane zilla parishad on Tuesday released a circular asking schools to make preparations to reopen. “We have asked all schools and junior colleges within Thane zilla parishad to ensure that basic preparations are made by the institutes for students and teachers. As per earlier circular, schools for Classes 9 to 12 were asked to remain shut till 31 December,” said Sheshrao Bade, education officer, Thane zilla parishad.

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Soon, travellers in Maharashtra can visit shooting locations, meet actors, scan QR code to learnt about tourist places||Tourists visiting Mumbai always look forward to find opportunities to meet Bollywood actors and visiting shooting locations. Now, the Maharashtra tourism department has chalked out a plan to make this a reality. The department has decided to allow tourists visit film-shooting locations and also interact with actors, if possible. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday launched a service that will also provide a detour of residences of popular Bollywood actors in the city. In a bid to boost tourism in the state, the department on Tuesday launched a slew of initiatives with private firms. “In all, we have signed four MoUs in which private firms will be launching the initiatives and the state government will play the role of the facilitator. This is like creating a network of partners by lending them non-financial support,” said Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department. The department has also planned to bring QR (quick response) code-enabled display boards at all major tourist destinations. “Maharashtra and Mumbai are the epicentre of film making. To attract cinema and film-making tourism, we are launching the Mumbai film city tour bus and curating tours to witness live shooting. Tourism has got to be tech-enabled and through our MoU (memorandum of understanding) with Guide Code [the firm] we plan to bring QR code-enabled display boards at all major tourist destinations across Maharashtra,” said the tourism minister in a series of tweets. The firm will put up display boards at the tourist destinations with QR codes. A tourist will be able to get all the information of the site by scanning the code even if there is no internet connectivity. The information will also be made available in audio in English and Marathi, said an official from the tourism department. The department has also announced to hold a digital shopping festival in Mumbai between January 25 and February 15 in collaboration with a private firm. It has also decided to encourage home chefs who will provide local cuisines near famous tourist destinations across the state. The private firm will tie up with residents near a popular tourist destination, who will offer local cuisines to a tourist at their homes. For this, locals will be trained to match the standard of international travellers. All these facilities will be promoted on the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) website and its tourism-related events, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/soon-travellers-in-maharashtra-can-visit-shooting-locations-meet-actors-scan-qr-code-to-learnt-about-tourist-places/story-52xpRdjRO6wAlWLxCrtuiO.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||Opposition in BMC objects to Rs 9-crore waiver to Mumbai’s Hotel Taj Mahal Palace||The Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) – all opposition parties in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – on Tuesday objected to the proposal by the civic administration to waive money owed from Hotel Taj Mahal Palace. The opposition also objected to BMC’s demand to make available additional Rs 400 crore to continue its fight against Covid-19.BMC’s standing committee, in its meeting scheduled on Wednesday, is set to discuss the issue of waiving off over Rs 9 crore payable by Hotel Taj Mahal Palace to the civic body for use of the public road outside the hotel and barricading parts of the footpath, citing security requirements. Along with this, the BMC’s administration has also proposed to make available additional Rs 400 crore for the fight against Covid-19 after spending over Rs 1,600 crore in the last nine months.Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of the opposition in BMC, said, “We are going to oppose both the proposals. Lokayukta has clearly stated that a policy on waivers is to be made. So why give any waiver to Taj Hotel?” Rais Shaikh, SP corporator, said, “We are going to oppose both the proposals. The common man is not being given any relief for property tax; why should private corporates be given relief?”Meanwhile, the spokesperson for Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, said, “Since the unfortunate events of 26/11 [2008 terror attack], the security team at the Taj Mahal Palace regularly receives directives, and is audited for security drills. The hotel has always followed the advice of the agencies and, should we be directed to do so, will be willing to remove the barricades and comply with such instructions. Since there are multiple authorities and regulatory bodies involved, we continue to stay in constant dialogue with all of them, and will ensure compliance, and implementation of appropriate measures suggested by them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/opposition-in-bmc-objects-to-9-crore-waiver-to-mumbai-s-hotel-taj-mahal-palace/story-rNvxyYWR4zhumq8LkhGG0J.html

The girl had returned to Ulhasnagar from the UK with her parents on December 8. The UMC had conducted Covid tests for the family. The girl tested positive this week, while the parents tested negative. “We tried to convince the parents to send the girl to institutional quarantine. We also agreed to take her mother along. However, the family was reluctant to send her,” said Raja Rijhwani, medical officer, UMC.He added, “We visited their house and managed to convince them. The family then agreed to isolate the girl at a private quarantine facility.

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 3,018 new cases; 43 UK returnees test positive for Covid-19 till Tuesday||Though the number of cases in Maharashtra is steadily dipping, state authorities are on alert owing to the fear of the new strain of coronavirus found in the United Kingdom (UK) and other countriesOn Tuesday, the state recorded 3,018 new cases taking the total number of cases to 19,25,066. It also recorded 68 deaths taking the tally to 49,373. According to a special surveillance report of the state health department, 43 people travelling from the United Kingdom (UK) from across the state were tested positive till December 29. This included 15 from Mumbai, seven from Thane, six each from Nagpur and Pune, two each from Nashik, Buldhana and Aurangabad, and one each from Nanded, Raigad and Washim. The local authorities have sent 32 samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing or to detect the presence of the mutant virus in these samples. The state has also tested 135 contacts of the travellers, of which seven have been found positive, the report states. Of the 12 UK returnees that had tested positive for Covid, six have tested negative in the second round of testing. While all are quarantined, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said that none of them are being discharged since a final report from National Institute of Virology in Pune, is yet to be received. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The rest of the six patients who are still positive are asymptomatic. We will wait for the NIV report to rule out any possibilities of the new strain of the virus.” Out of the 1,765 returnees from the UK, who have arrived in Mumbai between November 25 and December 22, more than 1,200 have been tested.The big question now surrounding state authorities and health experts is if the new variant, that has led to a surge in infections in some countries, would also increase the number of cases in the state, which has been reporting less than 5,000 cases for more than 20 days now. State health minister Rajesh Tope said in the wake of the third lockdown imposed in the UK, United States of America and the European countries, people here need to follow self-discipline. “There are limitations to the state health machinery. In the wake of the spike in the cases and the new strain of virus being found, people should follow Covid appropriate behaviour. The self-discipline is the only mantra to avert any such spike in Maharashtra,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state said that there is no reason to panic as though the strain has been discovered now, it might have been circulating earlier too. “We have to be cautious and thoroughly prepared, however, the situation in Maharashtra is very stable now. The mutant virus does transmit faster, however, its virulence is not worrisome,” Dr Salunkhe said. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant said that while the state might not see a surge in cases, it is still better prepared today to handle any eventuality. “While we don’t expect a surge in cases, people need to be very cautious. Even those who were infected by Covid-19 should not let their guards down as they can be re-infected.” He further said, “As New Year celebrations could be a cause of concern. It is good that the state has restricted movement.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 537 cases and six fatalities, taking the total case-load to 2,92,008 cases and 11,094 total fatalities respectively. Pune, Nagpur and Nashik cities, which are among the highest contributors in the state, recorded 251, 225 and 241 respectively. The union ministry of health and family welfare, on Tuesday, stated that six persons who returned from the United Kingdom (UK) to India were found positive for the new coronavirus strain, which is reported to be 70% more contagious than the current one. Amidst the fear of the new strain, the state government on Monday issued an advisory urging citizens to stay at home on December 31 and January 1. Prohibiting cultural and religious programmes, the government has asked people to refrain from bursting firecrackers and avoid crowding at public places like the Gateway of India and Chowpatty. The government has already imposed a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 till January 5 in the jurisdiction of 27 municipal corporations and empowered the district collectors to impose similar restrictions if they deem fit to contain the Covid-19 spread. This has effectively imposed restrictions on New Year parties and celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-3-018-new-cases-43-uk-returnees-test-positive-for-covid-19-till-tuesday/story-n5koMbY2QSi0UvFxegTKvK.html

Fifteen of the soldiers died along the LoC in the Jammu region.“Pakistani forces have violated the ceasefire 5,100 times in 2020 with an average of 14 cases daily,” said a senior army official, adding that last year, a total of 3,233 ceasefire violations were made by the Pakistan Army along the Indo-Pak border.Security forces eliminated 203 terrorists this year with six of them neutralised in December. This figure was 152 in 2019.“While the security forces apprehended 41 terrorists this year, 49 were captured alive. In 2019, only three terrorists had surrendered, but this year nine did so,” said the officer adding that continued pressure on the terror outfits paid rich dividends to the forces.It may be stated here that since 2017, Indian Army has launched “operation all out” in Jammu and Kashmir to cleanse the region of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.The officer also informed that in 2019 a total of 120 local terrorists were neutralised compared to 166 so far this year.In 2019, there were 351 terrorists north of Pir Panjal range that included 254 active and 97 dormant. In the south of Pir Panjal, presence of 70 terrorists was recorded — 17 active and 53 dormant. “However, this year their number has come down to 205 in north of Pir Panjal and 69 in the south, which includes 16 active and 53 dormant terrorists,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/record-5-100-truce-violations-by-pak-in-j-k-this-year/story-KXxTu2heNaYRX4UtO2xXvL.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Loni lynching: Victim’s family alleges police laxity||On Tuesday, Sanjay Kumar set out on a 1,220-km journey to Supaul district in Bihar, with the body of his brother Ajay who was brutally beaten to death on a road in Loni on Monday by two people over alleged business rivalry. The body of Ajay was handed over to his family after a postmortem examination on Tuesday. Sanjay said neither his mother nor Ajay’s wife, who live in Supaul, had yet been informed about the incident. Ajay, 36, was allegedly pulled out of an auto in the Ankur Vihar area of Loni and beaten mercilessly with iron rods as passersby recorded videos on their mobile phones which were later shared on social media.The police said prime suspect Govind Sharma allegedly nursed a grudge against Ajay ever since the latter opened a flower shop opposite his near a temple in Loni. “I don’t know what I am going to tell the family. My brother is survived by three daughters, the eldest one being six-years-old. The incident took place due to laxity by police,” Sanjay said. He was referring to a police complaint filed on April 9, after Govind allegedly stabbed and injured him. “I also gave a reminder letter. In July, my bike got stolen and I suspected foul play by Govind. He would often threaten us and try to pick up a fight. But the police, instead of taking action, forced us to compromise in July. Now, the suspects has killed my brother. Neither the police nor passersby came for help. Had someone intervened, he would have been alive,” he said.The family stays in a small house adjacent to the Mahakal Mandir in Loni while Govind and his accomplice, Amit Kumar, live in Sonia Vihar, Delhi. The two were arrested on Monday and allegedly claimed they had come armed with an old countrymade weapon but opted to lynch the victim with iron rods instead, which were later recovered, officers said. “In April, we decided to open a flower shop inside the temple where Govind also had a shop. Within days, he assaulted me and damaged the signboard of our shop,” he alleged. At 11am on Monday, Ajay, after closing the shop, was proceeding to Chandni Chowk in Delhi where he worked at a cloth merchant’s shop. “They are poor. Sanjay and his wife ran the shop. Ajay also used to look after the shop and later, he would go to Delhi. After closing the shop on Monday, he was headed to Delhi when he was attacked. Govind had attacked Sanjay in April. Ajay was innocent and had no involvement in previous fights. Ajay was assaulted barely 200-300 metres away from the temple and no one came for his help. Instead, passersby started making videos,” alleged Arun Pathak, a priest known to the family.Iraj Raja, the SP (rural), said they have also arrested Govind’s brother, Karan Sharma. “Karan was arrested for criminal conspiracy as he was at his brother’s shop and informed them that the victim had closed down his shop and was headed to Delhi. The video of the incident will be made part of the case file and we have strong evidence against the suspects. We will fast track the case after getting legal opinion,” the SP said.SP also said, “We have also suspended two sub-inspectors and one head-constable, the beat in-charge, of the area. They were posted in the area between April to July when the initial fights took place. I am undertaking an inquiry which will also highlight under what circumstances did the three personnel make the two parties reach a compromise and why no action was initiated on previous complaints. The serving sub-inspector of the police-post has been sent to police lines after Monday’s incident,” the SP said. Sanjay on Tuesday evening said that the family received no help from officials and had to hire a private ambulance to travel to their hometown with Ajay’s body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/loni-lynching-victim-s-family-alleges-police-laxity/story-eXi2KEamIUZETB4Tq2giLK.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Consumer commission directs builders to refund money to complainants||The Gautam Budh Nagar district consumer disputes redressal commission has directed a builder to refund ₹8.94 lakh to a complainant for failing to deliver on a project. In 2013, complainant Kamal Kant Dwivedi had booked a 3 BHK apartment of 1,550 square feet area with a Gurugram-based builder in one of its project for ₹40 lakh. He paid the required 10% of the total amount at the time of booking. The balance amount was to be paid as per construction. However, on the builder’s demand, he paid another ₹4.94 lakh. When he sought update on the project update, the builder told him that it will take time to start construction. Unhappy with the delay, Dwivedi requested a refund. When the builder refused, he approached the court in 2017.When the builder did not respond to the commission’s notices, it decided the case ex-parte (in the absence of a party).“District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission comprising president Anil Kumar Pundir and member Daya Shankar Pandey delivered ex-parte order and directed the builder to refund deposited amount of Rs 8.94 lakh alongwith interest of 9 percent within 60 days. Order was delivered around ten days ago,” Jagdeep Singh representative Consumer Forum Advocates Association said on Monday.“The builder has been directed to pay ₹1,000 towards legal expenses and ₹1000 towards compensation to complainant for his suffering.” “In another complaint the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed another Noida-based builder to refund ₹9.54 lakh to complainant Navin Kumar Gupta. In 2011, he had booked a shop in builder’s project located in Greater Noida but the builder failed to give possession,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/consumer-commission-directs-builders-to-refund-money-to-complainants/story-C7pLj1cGQDadUVwZZnXa4H.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Two shop owners fined ₹25,000 each over food safety violations||GREATER NOIDA: In two separate cases, owners of two shops were fined ₹25,000 each by the Gautam Budh Nagar additional district magistrate (ADM) over food safety violations. The first case dates back to 2018 when the food safety department had taken samples of buckwheat (kuttu) flour for inspection from a store in Gejha village, Sector 93A.Food safety officer Shweta Chakravatim on October 12, 2018, had collected the sample. It was sent to a lab in Lucknow where it was found substandard and violation of section 26(2)(ii) of the Food Safety and Standards Act was reported. This section states that no food business operator shall themselves or by any person on their behalf manufacture, store or sell or distribute any article of food which is misbranded or substandard or contains extraneous matter. Initially, the owner had claimed that the sample was not substandard. He claimed no sample was taken from his shop. Further he stated there was no public witness shown in whose presence sample was collected. He also stated that proper legal formalities were not completed.Later, however, he confessed that it was his first mistake and was not done to cause harm. The product was manufactured by a company in Ghaziabad and he was only selling it without knowledge of any violations of the act, he had said, requesting minimum punishment.“In view of the accused shopkeeper’s request, a minimum fine of ₹25,000 is levied,” Diwakar Singh, ADM said on Tuesday. The second case pertains to 2019, in which a sweetshop owner was fined for substandard cheese curd (chhaina).The ADM fined another shop owner as he too confessed and claimed it was his first mistake, and requested a minimum fine. “Milk product chhaina was found substandard. On August 13, 2019, the sample was collected from a sweet shop at the Haldoni crossing in Greater Noida. Lab test report dated September 3, 2019, had found it substandard,” said the ADM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-shop-owners-fined-25-000-each-over-food-safety-violations/story-SrvUdYRDzO7DGxyB6WNBqL.html

30-12-2020||Noida||Eight of gang involved in stealing luxury cars nabbed in Noida||Noida: Eight members of an interstate gang involved in stealing high-end vehicles in the national capital region (NCR) and selling them in different states were arrested on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday from Sector 61. Ten stolen vehicles were recovered from them, the police said.Police officials said that the group was nabbed from near Shopprix mall. “One of the suspects was an expert at breaking into luxury cars using a key scanning technology. They all had different expertise and were responsible for different sets of cars. They mostly targeted high-end cars and SUVs in various parts of Delhi-NCR,” said Luv Kumar, joint commissioner of police (law and order), Gautam Budh Nagar.According to the police, five more members of the gang in different states like Gujarat, J&K, and Uttarakhand have been identified and a search is on for them. The officials said that the gang had been active for the past at least six months and involved in dozens of thefts.The officials said that the interstate gang would often sell stolen vehicles to connections in Uttarakhand and Gujarat.“Some of their contacts would purchase old cars or vehicles involved in accidents, and then the gang would use those engine, chassis or registration numbers for the stolen vehicles and sell them further after obtaining new registration certificates,” said Kumar.The police said that Toyota Fortuners were being sold for ₹4 lakh, Innova for ₹2 lakh, Renault Duster for ₹1.5 lakh and Maruti Swift for ₹1 lakh, among others. Of the 10 cars recovered from them, three have been traced to stolen vehicle cases from Noida while the rest are being identified. Police also recovered ₹2 lakh cash, scanners, 74 key fobs, fake RCs, media stickers, fake ID cards, car accessories and tools from the suspects.All the suspects have a criminal history of theft, said the police. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/eight-of-gang-involved-in-stealing-luxury-cars-nabbed-in-noida/story-eJngCRFEOV3YlEcEGrRnDJ.html
30-12-2020||City||Crimes against women: Conviction rate is still a cause of concern||NOIDA: In 2011, a 20-year-old woman was found dead and her mother had claimed she had been murdered and police suspected her neighbour. But as the trial went on, cracks were beginning to appear in the story. The police could not establish rape as the dead body was brought for autopsy a week after the alleged incident. Later, the mother retracted her statement and had become hostile. Eight years and 54 hearings later, the Gautam Buddh Nagar sessions court acquitted the suspect. Fast forward to this year. On December 17, the court sent a man to seven years in jail for raping his 19-year-old daughter in 2015. This despite the woman’s mother, the complainant in the case, turning hostile. What changed this time was that police managed to prove rape, gave more evidence in the form of statement before the magistrate and, with support from the police, the victim stuck to her statement, that the judge was willing to disregard the mother’s change in statement. It is a rare victory for the district’s prosecution -- it won a conviction only six rape cases in 2020, which is significant when compared to last year’s solitary victory. In matters of dowry deaths and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, the numbers are worse -- just three and six cases, respectively, with the latter registering 3.5 times more cases. In comparison, cases under the Gangsters’ Act see almost a 90% conviction rate.Police effort Since the introduction of the police commissionerate system in GB Nagar this year, the force has deployed a new mechanism to investigate cases relating to violence against women. Deputy commissioner of police (women safety), Vrinda Shukla, said that earlier, one officer of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) rank had to monitor around 2,300 cases a year. “Now, at least five IPS officers are looking together into those many cases a year. Not only that, each of the 20 police stations in the district now has two sub-inspector (SI)-rank officers dedicated to crimes against women,” she said. With responsibilities fixed, it has become easier for us to track the progress in investigations. “As a result, in every rape case or crime against children under the Pocso Act, police have arrested suspects,” she said. The force is also trying to arrange for enough forensic evidence before putting the accused on trial. “It helps in increasing the chance of conviction significantly. Another aspect that we are focussing on is the protection of witnesses. If a witness in important cases are threatened, it’s obvious that the cases will fall flat in courtrooms,” she said. “In some cases, where the witnesses do not cooperate, the police have been doing their best to prove cases through medical, chemical and DNA examinations, padded with sufficient physical and digital evidence. Earlier, we had no option other than to bank on the over-burdened forensic sciences laboratory (FSL) in Lucknow. But now, an FSL in neighbouring Ghaziabad has made investigations easier,” Shukla said. The conviction rate, however, is still below the mark. In a significant chunk of cases of crimes against women, the perpetrators are often known to the victims, and are sometimes even related. “Several victims change their statements in court to help the person amid the lengthy trial process. Victims generally do not have much say in such decisions. When such matters are settled out of court in exchange for money, the will and pain of a victim are rarely taken into consideration,” said additional commissioner of police Love Kumar. Jitendra Kumar Jha, a Delhi-based advocate and counsel for the parents of the December 16, 2012 gangrape and murder victim, said that undue delays deter victims. “The time has come when we have to give proper representation to victims in the criminal justice system. In most rape cases, the victims are from low-income backgrounds and do not get proper support and representation during prosecution. We need more magistrates to provide timely justice to the victims,” he said. Prosecution pangs According to the annual National Crime Record Bureau’s “Crime in India” 2019 report released in November, crimes against women had increased 7.3%. In absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of crimes against women, accounting for 14.7% of such cases. It also had the highest number of crimes against girls with 7,444 cases. In part, the low conviction rate could also be due to delay in cases being heard. In the district, of the 1,983 cases heard in 2019, 65% were convicted in the district and sessions court. Although this may seem like a large number, district special public prosecutor, JP Bhati, said backlog cases made up most of it. “Cases drag on for years on end. The district’s judge-population ratio has gone up only marginally in the past three years, as against the sanctioned strength. At present, GB Nagar district court has 28 judges, out of which four are civil judges. Only eight are judges for fast-track courts,” he said. Senior prosecution officer Chhavi Ranjan Dwivedi, said, “I’ve no hesitation in admitting that prosecution needs to overhauled and strengthened. Otherwise, providing justice to the victims of rape and Pocso Act will remain a mirage.” “Also, out-of-court settlements in several cases have led to a significant reduction in the conviction rate. As time passes, victims reconcile with the situation. Perpetrators of the crimes get enough time to win victims over, by hook or by crook. If we leave the accused with less scope for any illegal manoeuvring, it will increase the conviction rate,” Dwivedi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crimes-against-women-conviction-rate-is-still-a-cause-of-concern/story-y9sAq18x8Fetdn3YbpegDJ.html
30-12-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Farmers’ protest continues, board to discuss their demands||The farmers’ protest outside the Greater Noida Authority over a probe recommendation to strip many of them of leased land in Bisrakh village continued for the second day on Tuesday. The authority’s board will meet on Wednesday to discuss their demands.“If the authority does not approve a proposal accepting our demand scrapping the recommendation in the board meeting, then we will continue our protest until it is met,” said Manveer Bhati a member of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti that is leading the protest.Greater Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Narendra Bhooshan said, “The SIT report is not yet final. We will consider the demands of farmers and will be dealt with as per rules.”In 2007-’08, the Greater Noida Authority had begun to acquire land, including from Bisrakh village, for development purposes, but the farmers protested as they did not want to give up their land. The Authority later offered 10% of developed residential plots to them and lease out their village houses acquired in the process, which was accepted. Later it was alleged that among the beneficiaries of the “lease back” scheme were people from other states who owned land in Bisrakh village. The scheme was meant for local farmers, many said and complained to the government. A six-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by Yamuna expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) CEO Arun Vir Singh probed the matter regarding Bisrakh village in 2017 and gave its report and recommendations to the government on December 14.“The SIT has said that farmers who got abadi land (houses) leased back, should not get the (developed) residential plots as they cannot get two benefits, as per the rules. This is against farmers who gave their land for development. Instead, no action has been taken against the outsiders,” said Ajay Kumar, another farmer at the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-farmers-protest-continues-board-to-discuss-their-demands/story-3R8S5x2q3RfVBRA8oBOR8O.html

Our national representatives are planning a march on January 26, and today we carried out a dress rehearsal for the same,” said Ramveer Singh Tomar, state general secretary, BKU (Bhanu).Every day the farmers are conducting various activities like yoga, yagnas, rallies, etc. to keep themselves motivated and to make their presence felt.In the afternoon, the group also burnt some copies of the new farm laws in a symbolic gesture showing their unhappiness with the legislations.A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday between the central government and farmer representatives, but the protestors are not too hopeful about the results.“Nothing has come off yet from the previous meetings as well. We want the government to understand our issues with the new laws. And we refuse to move from here until they acknowledge our concerns,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU (Bhanu).With the BKU (Bhanu) group sitting on the border, traffic from Noida to Delhi has been affected since then. “The law and order situation is stable. Traffic is moving smoothly across alternate routes and we are prepared to handle any issues that might arise. But for now status quo is being maintained,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.Meanwhile, another group from BKU’s Lok Shakti faction that has been camped at the Dalit Prerna Sthal continued its protest on Tuesday. The group is also carrying out rallies to protest against the new laws. “The new laws are like a noose around our neck,” said Dr SK Giri, national spokesperson, BKU (Lok Shakti).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-chilla-border-farmers-plan-to-launch-protest-march-on-jan-26/story-ytWZKnzSnRZ3LlCo0j8VfL.html

The girl realised the deception when the time came for them to meet,” said a senior police officer, requesting not to be named.Police said that the two were allegedly known to each other and had studied together in school till class 5. However, the suspect allegedly did not reveal his identity while talking to her and kept pretending to be someone else from a different religion.“A case was registered at the Dadri police station under the new anti-conversion law after the girl’s family approached us and the suspect was apprehended immediately,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3, Vishal Pandey.Police said that the girl’s family was worried that he might elope with their daughter, however, officers did not reveal too many details of the case to protect the girl’s privacy. The suspect was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.This is the second case in the district of the new state law, the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, aimed at checking unlawful religious conversions. The first in the Gautam Buddha Nagar district was reported from the jurisdiction of the Surajpur police on December 19, in which three women, including a South Korean national, were arrested for allegedly enticing locals to convert.The law came into force in the state from November 28 this year and makes conversion a non-bailable offence with up to 10 years of jail time if undertaken unlawfully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/teen-arrested-under-up-s-anti-conversion-law-in-dadri-for-talking-to-minor-girl/story-gAeGyXst1bcXMvlOosDcXP.html

But I was constantly being judged. I started looking for jobs but couldn’t find anything in the hotel industry. My feminism was not acceptable to employers,” said Hussain.She eventually started working at a BPO where she also faced discrimination from her peers. “My seniors and colleagues always felt like I didn’t fit in to their standards. So in 2014, I decided to undergo hormone replacements and surgical interventions. In 2018, my mother passed away due to a heart condition. I was in a bad place, but that is when I realised that I would have to take charge of my own life,” said Hussain.She started Street Temptation, a restaurant serving Indian, Chinese and continental food, in Noida. The restaurant is open from 2pm to 4am and offers home delivery.“Things were going quite well for a new business. We would have had our break even in February, but then the Covd-19 crisis started. We were closed till July, and staying afloat after paying staff salaries and other bills became a challenge. I had put up a deposit for a surgery which I withdrew to keep the restaurant running. In August, I eventually got into a partnership to keep things running, but we are still struggling. I don’t want to shut down at any cost,” she said.Hussain now hopes that her business will pick up soon. “We offer good quality food and the ambience is adorable. Things will be much easier once business becomes stable. I want to expand and start franchising, specially with the transgender community. I want to start drag shows as well,” she said.Hussain wants to help others struggling with the same identity issues. “I want to offer them jobs. Transgender people should start working mainstream jobs while believing in themselves,” she said.Hussain knew from a young age that she didn’t conform to stereotypical gender norms. “My family soon realized that I wasn’t simply a boy. It took them a while but they accepted me. However, the society is still reluctant. I get absolutely no support from people and everyday is a struggle,” said Hussain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/overcoming-gender-issues-this-transgender-woman-now-struggles-to-keep-her-eatery-running/story-6FEzwyoJx6m7U8usmTLCvO.html

On trial basis, 25 healthcare workers, who had registered themselves on the government portal, were called to these locations, said deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma. He said in the first phase, Ludhiana was among the two districts (the other being Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar) in the state chosen by the government for administering the Covid-19 vaccine. The activity aimed to test mechanisms laid-out for roll out of the Covid-19 vaccination, he said and to assess the operational feasibility of using the Co-WIN application and testing linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms to identify challenges and guide the way forward, prior to actual implementation.Sharma said end-to-end testing of the vaccination process was successfully conducted. In the first phase, more than 30,000 healthcare workers (both government and private) of the district, who had registered themselves on the government portal, would be administered the Covid 19 vaccine, followed by Anganwadi workers, people aged above 50 years, people below 50 years with comorbidities, and others. He clarified that this vaccine would not be available off the shelf for the time being and only people who had got themselves registered on the government portal would be covered under it. He said that upon registration, beneficiaries will receive a message on their mobile phone informing the date and place where the Covid-19 vaccine would be administered to them. Later, he also chaired a review meeting regarding the same at Bachat Bhawan, here, where he thanked all the concerned officials for successfully carrying out the dry run .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dry-run-for-covid-vaccine-completed-at-7-places-in-ludhiana-district/story-guHNpFn3R8vEv1LbXkU0BO.html
30-12-2020||Mumbai||At Mumbai airport: Not 8 hours, just 13 minutes for RT-PCR test results for international fliers||Now, international passengers arriving at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will have to wait for just 13 minutes, instead of eight hours, to get their RT-PCR test (the gold standard of Covid-19 testing) reports. This is because the airport, from December 15, introduced a unique technology, in compliance with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) standards, that is available for all international passengers at the airport. With the 24X7 testing facility that is located at Level 2 (arrivals) near exit Gate B, CSMIA has become the first airport to adopt the express test method by Abbott ‘ID Now™’. CSMIA officials said the express test is available at ₹4,500 and aims to provide passengers with quick and accurate diagnosis in 13 minutes. However, passengers can continue to opt for regular RT-PCR tests, which take around six to eight hours for the result.Creating a safer environment for travellers and airport staff, the rapid molecular testing technology by Abbott is a tool to help fight the pandemic by allowing fast, highly sensitive and accurate diagnosis, reducing the wait time for reports for passengers to take necessary measures to prevent disease transmission.“Since the commencement of this test, CSMIA has witnessed an average of 30-35 tests per day and a total of 400 passengers as of December 28; these include those who had connecting flights to destinations outside Maharashtra,” an airport spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-8-hours-just-13-minutes-for-rt-pcr-test-results-for-international-fliers-at-csmia/story-3F7M8SCBsxj86SqJV0e3TJ.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||Police bust fake job racket near Mehrauli, arrest 11||Police on Tuesday said they had arrested 11 people — seven men, four women — for allegedly operating a fake job racket through a call centre in south Delhi’s Saidulajab near Mehrauli. One of the arrested persons, police said, holds a B.Tech degree from a private university and had worked in a private bank before the lockdown. Five laptops and as many mobile phones, along with eight SIM cards were seized from the arrested suspects. The arrested persons lured job aspirants by offering jobs in reputed multinational companies, including private airlines. They used to charge Rs 2,200 as registration fee and between Rs 10,000 and Rs 40,000 from each candidate at the time of issuing the fake appointment letters in their name.“They have duped nearly 100 job aspirants from different states to the tune of around Rs 10 lakh since September,” deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.Police identified the arrested suspects as Ashish alias Aman, 32, a B.Tech graduate, Arjun Singh, 28, Vikas Yadav, 25, Krishna, 28, Najakat Ali, 30, Roop Basant,22, Avinash, 24. Police have not shared the names of the four women arrested by them in the case. Police said that except Ashish and Arjun, who were the key players in the racket, the nine other arrested suspects worked as telecallers in the fake call centre. The nine were arrested because they were aware of the illegal activities that was being done through the call centre, said DCP Thakur.On December 25, the police said, the Mehrauli police received information that a fake call centre offering jobs in multinational companies was being run from a rented space in Saidulajab. The information was probed and a raid was conducted. Nine people, including four women, were caught using laptops and cellphones and offering jobs to job aspirants. A case of cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy was registered and the nine were arrested.During interrogation, the arrested suspects revealed that they lured unemployed people by offering them jobs with lucrative salaries, in a cement manufacturing company and two private airlines.“They first tricked aspirants into paying Rs 2,200 as registration fee through e-payment gateways. After receiving the registration amount, they dispatched fake interview and appointment letters and collected additional amounts, ranging between R10,000 and R40,000, depending on the job profile and salary,” added DCP Thakur.Interrogation of the arrested persons revealed that the racket was being operated by Aashish, Arjun and Rahul, whose location was traced in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. The investigating teams raided their hideouts in Gwalior and Agra but the trio could not be located.On December 28, Ashish and Arjun were caught from Delhi, while Rahul is still absconding, the police said. Police have identified the three men only by their first names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-bust-fake-job-racket-near-mehrauli-arrest-11/story-NgkDs3cHNWAk9y5qqkQEFN.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||After several hurdles in 2020, Delhi govt hopes to launch key infra projects by March next year||The government hopes to launch several key infrastructure projects expected to decongest some of the most traffic heavy stretches such as Ashram Chowk in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic and several other reasons forced the agencies to push deadlines and face escalation in costs. As work has picked up again, officials in the Public Works Department (PWD) said the agency hopes to launch three long-awaited projects --- Ashram underpass, the tunnel road at Pragati Maidan and the Benito-Juarez Road underpass --- by March 2021.PWD officials said the pace of construction remained very poor throughout the year due to various reasons ranging from the nationwide lockdown and exodus of migrants leading to a lack of labour, the ban on construction imposed because of the air pollution levels to riots in north-east Delhi. The agency had to push deadlines of at least five important ongoing infrastructure projects in the city, of which three were to be made operational this year.Some of the important projects where deadlines were pushed include the tunnel road near Pragati Maidan, Ashram Underpass, Shastri Park and Seelampur flyovers, Benito-Juarez Road underpass and Barapullah phase-3 elevated road. Two flyovers at Shastri Park and Seelampur were opened in September this year, five months after their scheduled opening date.Delhi PWD minister Satyendar Jain said, “From the very first day of the Covid pandemic, the Delhi government is fighting the situation very carefully. On one side, due to the pandemic, there has been a shortage of labourers which has affected some of the works, on the other hand the Delhi government is completely prepared to deal with the situation and trying its best to meet all the timelines.”PWD officials said that the year started with assembly elections in Delhi which also affected construction and planning of projects due to model code of conduct being in place for the polls. It was followed by riots in north-east Delhi which affected the progress of infrastructure projects in that part of the city. And, then the pandemic hit the city when in march, Delhi reported its first case. By the end of the month, entire country was placed under a 21-days lockdown to contain the virus which was further extended. The construction activities remained completely suspended for almost two months in Delhi. Though work resumed in May end but the progress remained tardy because of shortage of labourers as tens of thousands of workers returned to their hometowns. The officials said that after lockdown norms were eased and before construction could pick up, monsoon arrived. Officials say that the pace of construction activities slows down in rainy season. The slow pace of construction work continued due to restrictions due to air pollution after Diwali in the city.S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, “This year has not been good for infrastructure projects in the national capital as projects got delayed and missed deadlines due to coronavirus pandemic, nationwide lockdown, labour shortage. The authorities should have made additional arrangements such as additional man power at least towards the end of the year to make up for the time loss.”He also said that such delays are would not only translate in escalation of construction cost but also lead to traffic snarls for longer periods and ultimately giving rise to pollution.He added that important projects such as construction of 1.2km long tunnel near Pragati Maidan and Ashram underpass should have been treated more seriously as they aim to decongest traffic bottlenecks at Ashram, Ring Road, ITO and Matura Road. The traffic mess at Ashram, ITO and parts of Mathura road is a perennial problem for the traffic police. Some important infrastructure projects that the city couldn’t see this year are: Ashram underpass project:This most awaited project envisages construction of a 750-metre-long underpass along Mathura Road at busy Ashram crossing, an important link between central and south Delhi with the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. The intersection connects Mathura Road and the Ring Road (linking Lajpat Nagar-Sarai Kale Khan and DND Flyover). During peak hours, massive jams are common on Mathura Road and Ashram flyover. It is one of the busiest intersection in Delhi. The estimated cost of underpass is Rs 78 crore. The foundation stone of the project was laid by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on December 24, 2019 and it was to be completed in a year’s time.According to PWD officials, initially the deadline to complete work was December 2020 but that it is likely to be extended by around three to four months as work couldn’t be carried out at desired pace. “The construction moved at snail’s pace initially due to protests at Shaheen Bagh and later it was stopped due to lockdown. Even after the work was resumed in May end, the progress was slow because of labour shortage and then due to monsoon and pollution restrictions. We hope to complete the construction work by March 2021,” the PWD official said.Tunnel road at Pragati MaidanUnder this project, the PWD is constructing a 1.2-km-long tunnel and six underpasses to ease travel to India Gate and parts of central Delhi from different corners of the city especially from east Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad. The project cost is around Rs 777 crore. The work on the project was started in March 2018 and it was to be completed by September 2019. This deadline was extended to June 2020 due to the complexities involved in the construction work. The June deadline was also pushed to December 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdown. Officials said that this deadline has again been extended by three months.“This year hardly any construction activity could be carried out at the desired pace due to lockdown and pollution restrictions. We are in the last leg of the construction work. We had to reschedule our deadlines due to coronavirus pandemic. We are hoping to complete the remaining work by March 2021,” another PWD official said.The tunnel will start near National Sports Complex of India (NSCI) on Purana Qila Road and culminate on the Ring Road near Pragati Power station passing underneath the Pragati Maidan.Once the tunnel is functional, motorists travelling from Noida, Ghaziabad and south and east Delhi will have a signal-free access to India Gate, Mathura Road and vice-versa.Benito-Juarez Road underpassThe project includes construction of a three-lane underpass, near Venkateswara College, in south Delhi connecting Benito Juarez Road with San Martin Road. The dual access one-way underpass will start near Springdales School on Benito Juarez Road and will pass under the South Campus Metro station on the Ring Road. One arm of the underpass will go to San Martin Road while the other will open on Ring Road towards Moti Bagh. The work on the project had started in April 2015 and was to be completed in October 2017. It missed several deadlines and its latest deadline was October 2020 which was missed again due to slow pace of work this year. “The project was initially delayed due to shifting of utilities, and the complex nature of construction work. Later it was delayed by the construction bans imposed due to Covid-19 lockdown, labour shortage and pollution restrictions,” an official said associated with the project said. The official said that the latest deadline is March 2021.The facility aims to reduce travel time from the airport to central Delhi and AIIMS by 20 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively.Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridorThe 3km elevated corridor aims to provide seamless connectivity between Mayur Vihar-I and Sarai Kale Khan, where it will meet the existing Barapullah-I elevated corridor, making the nearly 9.5km journey to AIIMS signal free. According to PWD officials, construction of the corridor had begun in 2015, and was scheduled to be completed in October 2017, but the project progressed tardily because of the 8.5 acre (750 m) land and issues related to its acquisition. Officials said that the progress of land acquisition was affected due to model code of conduct in the beginning of the year and later due to coronavirus pandemic as the district administration was busy on managing different jobs related to Covid-19 pandemic.“Shortage of labour immediately after lockdown also impacted progress of the work. It was later slowed down due to monsoon and high water level in Yamuna during rainy season. It would take at least a year-and-a-half to finish work after the land is acquired and handed over to them for construction. We are hoping to complete it by March 2022,” the official said.The corridor will also decongest key stretches of nearby areas such as Ring Road, Delhi-Noida-Direct flyway, NH-24, Noida Link Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-several-hurdles-in-2020-delhi-govt-hopes-to-launch-key-infra-projects-by-march-next-year/story-vLVLNMszyoUY05YuJ7ko7H.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||BJP misleading people on MCD funds crunch: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of misleading people on the issue of financial crunch.The BJP denied the allegation as “baseless”.“The BJP is misleading people on the fund crunch issue. The top brass of the BJP has lost all hope on the MCDs. Despite a request by the north MCD mayor, the Centre has not provided any help to the MCDs. It had asked for Rs 2,000 crore from the Centre but they have not provided any money. The BJP has no moral right to stay in power in the MCDs because not only the people of Delhi but also their own party leaders do not believe them,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor rejected Pathak’s claims as baseless. “These are baseless allegations. It seems like Durgesh Pathak derives pleasure in raising every day the issue of non-payment of salaries to municipal employees in Delhi because had they been even a little serious towards employees’ hardship, they would have urged their chief minister to at least release current financial year’s funds to the MCDs.”On Monday, the AAP and BJP councillors had scuffled during a meeting of the EDMC House when the former raised the issue of an alleged Rs 2500 crore scam in north MCD. The BJP had been claiming that the Delhi government owes Rs13,000 crore to the MCDs but the government has maintained that it has no pending payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-misleading-people-on-mcd-funds-crunch-aap/story-vJ0FKepzaqgaHzydZAVUVN.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt starts distribution of dry ration as part of mid-day meals in schools||Delhi government on Tuesday started distributing dry-ration as part of the Centre’s mid-day meal programme among students of classes Nursery to class 8 enrolled in all government and government-aided schools in the Capital. The mid-day meal scheme, under which students are served cooked meals during school hours, had been disrupted due to the closure of educational institutions since March because of the Covid-19 pandemic. There are around 800,000 students who will receive such ration kits. On Tuesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal kicked off the initiative and distributed dry ration kits at a school in Mandawali. Each kit handed out by the chief minister contained a six-month provision — that included wheat, rice, pulses and oil.“The last nine months have been extremely difficult, and our troubles might not end soon. But till the time the a vaccine comes, we have to find solutions... During the lockdown, we tried to provide an allowance in place of the mid-day meals in the bank accounts of students. But now we are starting redistribution of dry-ration among students. Each student will be provided adequate ration for a period of 6 months, July 2020 to December 2020, in order to provide proper nutrition,” Kejriwal said, adding that the scheme will continue till the schools reopen.The dry ration will be provided every month from January 2021.Central government’s mid-day meal scheme, which aims to provide food security to children from economically weaker families and increase enrolment in public schools, is channelised through state governments.According to a senior official at the Directorate of Education (DoE), the amount of dry ration being provided per day for primary students (up to class 5th) will be 145 gram. It will be 217 gms for upper primary students (classes 6 to 8). “Thus, the total weight of dry ration kit being provided for 6 months period is 20.175 kg for primary students and 30.383 kg for upper primary students. The calculation of dry ration has been done as per days of the school calendar. Students will be provided ration on a monthly basis from January onwards,” the official said.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who was also present during the launch of the initiative, said, “The non-availability of mid-day meals due to the closure of schools has been a challenge. There were many families who were finding it hard to put enough food on their plates. Massive unemployment due to Covid-19 has aggravated the issue. On the directions of CM Kejriwal, we experimented by transferring money directly to the students’ accounts. It was the CM’s idea that it’s better to distribute ration rather than transferring money. Hence, we are now providing dry ration to more than 8 lakh students in government and government-aided schools in Delhi.”Parents of several students enrolled in government schools, lauded the initiative. Kulsum Khatun, who works as a labourer and is a resident of Jagdamba camp in Sheikh Sarai, , said, “We are happy that the government decided to give ration in place of allowance. I have received a call from the school of my two daughters. I will go on Wednesday and collect their kits. We had struggled to provide nutritious food to them in the last nine months. We can still get wheat and rice, but pulses are expensive to include in our daily diet.”Head of school at Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya, Rohini, Awadesh Kar Jha said, “We had received kits for primary students two days back following which we informed their parents. At least 450 parents collected dry-ration kits for their children on Tuesday from our school.”Amrita Johri of social organisation Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, said, “We welcome the government’s decision of distributing dry ration in place of the mid-day meal allowance. Many people are struggling to afford daily meals and something as essential as milk for their families amid the pandemic. The government must give grains in adequate amounts to the students. They should also include eggs in these kits to provide proper nutrition to the students. We have been demanding the addition of eggs, milk, and fruits in the mid-day meals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-starts-distribution-of-dry-ration-as-part-of-mid-day-meals-in-schools/story-RMLQKrNVCIOtc8vjtmm0EN.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||AAP promises free Wi-Fi at Singhu protest site||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said free Wi-Fi hotspots will be set up at Singhu border for the farmers who have been camping there for over a month protesting the three farm laws enacted by Parliament in September. “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has decided to install as many Wi-Fi hotspots as required by our farmer brothers. They’ve been sitting at Delhi’s borders for more than a month now. In order for them to make video calls with their loved ones, access information, proper internet connectivity is necessary,” said Chadha, AAP’s national spokesperson. Each such hotspot will be capable of covering a 100-metre radius and it will be a free service, the AAP leader said.The AAP has supported the farmers who are demanding the repeal of the new laws and had voted against the Bills in both Houses.On Saturday, Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP, visited the Singhu border where he also challenged the central government and its ministers for an open debate on the contentious laws. The party has also been helping the protesting farmers with tents, blankets, toilets, food and access to water.“To lead a respectable life, an individual needs ‘roti, kapda, makaan’. But today, we can add another necessity, and that is the internet. To fulfil this necessity, the Arvind Kejriwal government has decided to install Wi-Fi hotspots across Singhu so that farmers can make video calls to stay in touch with their families,” said Chadha.He further said, “We request farmer unions to tell us about the spots at Singhu border where they’re facing network issues. Our farmer brothers have been unable to speak with their families due to poor mobile reception. We hope that with the installation of Wi-Fi hotspots, they will be able to hear the voices of their loved ones, and will make video calls every day.”“Farmers also need better internet to keep themselves updated about news, about fact checks, debates on the agriculture laws. We will give them all facilities,” said Chadha.The Delhi BJP lashed out at AAP move. Party spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The AAP is misleading farmers on the issue related to new laws and now they have taken it to new heights. What happened to Arvind Kejriwal’s flagship project of providing free Wi-Fi across Delhi? The project has made no progress and now the party is talking about free Wi-Fi in the Singhu border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-promises-free-wi-fi-at-singhu-protest-site/story-BS6ivKdJbtD9JglbY0aNpI.html
30-12-2020||Delhi||DCW ‘rescue’ former Delhi minister’s daughter, place her in shelter home||The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Tuesday said that they rescued the daughter of a former Delhi minister from her father’s house in Paschim Vihar on Monday night where she was allegedly held “captive and beaten”. The commission said the woman, daughter of former Delhi minister Raj Kumar Chauhan, has been shifted to a shelter home for women. Chauhan, a four-term MLA from Mangolpuri assembly constituency, however, denied the allegations and said his daughter was undergoing treatment for “depression”. In a statement on Tuesday, the commission said that the woman was held “captive” at her parental home was being “beaten” by her father. The DCW has also asked the Delhi Police to register an FIR against the politician. Police said they are looking into the case. The DCW said the woman had written to the commission, seeking help. A commission team reached Chauhan’s house and was told by the victim that she got married in 1999, but for the last 10 years she has been living separately at her parent’s house in Delhi due to some differences with her husband. She also has two daughters from the marriage. A divorce case is pending before a court in Chandigarh since many years, the DCW said. “The woman alleged that her father (Chauhan) doesn’t want the case to be settled and that her husband had married another woman. The woman also wants to start a new life but is unable to do so because his family has made it a matter of prestige. She has alleged that her father illegally confined her in his house, does not allow her to go out, and often beat her up,” the DCW said in a statement. It added that a joint team of DCW and Delhi Police rescued the woman and took her to Paschim Vihar West police station. Statements of the woman and her daughter were recorded and they were then taken for a medical examination before being placed in a shelter home. When contacted, the former minister denied the allegations and called the charges “baseless”. “Allegations of keeping my daughter in captivity and beating her are baseless and false. My two granddaughters are still living with us. If there was any truth in those allegations then why would they stay with us. My daughter is undergoing treatment for depression,” Chauhan said, adding that he would not divulge more details as it was a “personal family matter”. Delhi police confirmed that cops accompanied DCW officials to rescue the woman. Deputy commissioner of police (Outer) A Koan said on Monday, the DCW had called the police control room informing that there was a case of domestic violence. “Our enquiry revealed that she was living with her two daughters aged 20 years and 13 years on a separate floor in the house of her father. Allegations levelled by the complainant were denied by her daughters. We are looking into the case,” the DCP said. Chauhan, held important portfolios in the Sheila Dikshit cabinet. Ahead of Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Chauhan had joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after he was denied a ticket from Northwest Delhi parliamentary (reserved) constituency. However, Chauhan re-joined the Congress ahead of Delhi assembly polls in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dcw-rescue-former-delhi-minister-s-daughter-place-her-in-shelter-home/story-TNrEKm2FCc5Z4ljV0tGXvI.html

30-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Missing UK travellers give health dept officials a headache||As many as 90 travellers from the United Kingdom, who flew into the city after November 25, have remained untraceable by authorities in one district of Delhi, officials said. These missing travellers have either provided either incomplete or old addresses on passports and non-working international cell phone numbers that has hindered their search by district officials. “At least five to 10 persons remain completely untraceable in every district in Delhi. The highest number of people remain untraceable in the New Delhi and Central districts. The names of these people have been shared with different authorities; everyone is looking for them. The rest were tracked in other districts,” said an official from health department. In New Delhi district at least 90 people have not been traced.Also Read | Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune: Where India found samples of UK returnees positive for new coronavirus strainThe Indian government had suspended flights from the United Kingdom from December 23, with all passengers who flew into the country on December 21 and December 22 being made to undergo mandatory RT-PCR tests . This was done after London and other regions of UK went into lockdown due to a new variant of coronavirus disease that was found to be spreading there. The new variant has 23 mutations, one of which is on the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus and is thought to be 70% more transmissible than the other strains. So far, six of the UK passengers who tested positive for the viral infection were found to be carrying the new variant. A senior official in the revenue department said around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport since November 25 – of which at least 1,500 are Delhi residents. So far, 20 such individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 in general in Delhi. Eleven of them were identified after being tested on arrival over December 22 and 23. And nine – who had arrived in Delhi between November 25 and December 21 – were identified through the government’s on-going outreach drive that started last Wednesday. At least 13 of their contacts, who have also tested positive for the viral infection, have been admitted to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital in the special isolation ward. While all arrivals on or after December 7 are mandatorily being tested, those who arrived between November 25 and December 6 are being put under surveillance as of now, said a senior official in the government’s revenue department. The government, however, did not share data on how many individuals out of the total 1,500 could be traced by them so far. HT contacted officials from all eleven districts but was able to get responses of officials from only five districts. “Several individuals who arrived in Delhi from UK have filed wrong numbers in the forms submitted to the government on arrival. The problem came to light only after the tracing process began last Wednesday. Some had filled nine digits, instead of 10. In such cases, surveillance officers are calling up all 10 possible combinations for the last number,” said a senior official in south-east district, which is learnt to have 308 UK-arrivals – of which 17 are yet to be traced. “In several cases, fliers have submitted their UK numbers. The district officials have tried making both normal calls and WhatsApp calls in such numbers. Most they have elicited no response. It is quite likely that the same person is using a different number when in India,” said a senior official in west district, which has had 270 UK-arrivals – of which around 60 are yet to be traced. “In most cases, people have filled up incomplete addresses. As in, they have mentioned localities but not blocks, lanes, apartment numbers, or house numbers. Several had mentioned hotel details. In most such cases, it emerged that the individuals had already left for the UK in a return flight by the time officials could reach them. There are many cases of incorrect addresses too,” said an official in New Delhi district – which has recorded 190 UK arrivals of which around 90 are yet to be traced. An official from Shahadara district said, “Of the 60 people that were to be traced by us, only 22 were in the district. None have gone to other cities. And, three have returned back to UK.” An official from Central district said, “Most of the addresses on the passports of the travellers are from years ago when the passport must have been issued. They no longer live on these addresses and hence could not be traced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-missing-uk-travellers-give-health-dept-officials-a-headache/story-n94b3GSXU7cBkDNVbxnGTI.html
30-12-2020||City||Ludhiana: Waste management firm issues public notice for leaving work||A week after serving self-termination notice to the civic body, the A2Z company on Tuesday issued a public notice apprising the residents that the company will not be providing services including lifting and processing waste after February 4. While it will be a herculean task for the civic body to manage the solid waste in the city due to lack of infrastructure, it is yet to take a final call regarding its further action plan. Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal conducted a meeting on Tuesday seeking legal advice over the matter and it is said that a report will be sent to the local bodies department in the coming days for further action. After the notice period, it will be the responsibility of the MC to lift over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage generated in the city on a daily basis from around 45 secondary dumping points (where household waste is dumped by waste collectors) and shift it to the main dumpsite at Tajpur road, run the static compactors and the RDF plant installed at the main dumpsite of MC. The MC will also have to make alternate arrangements for the door-to-door lifting of garbage from 30 of the city’s 95 wards, from where the garbage is being collected by the company.The company officials said that among the main reasons behind serving the self-termination notice, is a delay on the part of MC in making a monthly payment of around Rs 1 crore to the company as a tipping fee for transportation of garbage to the main dumpsite. Despite attempts, Pardeep Sabharwal could not be reached for comment. Manager of A2Z company, Vishant Chaudhary said that the public notice has been issued and the company will not be providing services after February 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-based-waste-management-firm-issues-public-notice-for-leaving-work/story-ImfYpvQzt5Fgijdho3r9bK.html
30-12-2020||Gurugram||One UK returnee tests positive, genome sequencing results awaited||A 22-year-old man, who returned from the United Kingdom on December 19, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. To further confirm whether the positive case has been infected with the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Gurugram health department has sent his sample to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi for genome sequencing.Complying with the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s guidelines, the district health department has been testing all UK returnees who arrived in Gurugram between December 9 and December 23. The central government, on December 21, had banned all flights to and from the UK in light of the mutant strain of Covid-19. Till now, 367 UK returnees have been tested, of which at least 349 have tested negative and the test results of 17 are awaited.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Continuing with the surveillance and testing, a 22-year-old man was found positive for Covid-19. Samples of his three immediate contacts have also been taken for testing. And while the positive patient is currently admitted to the designated isolation centre for UK returnees, his close contacts ar under quarantine at home. The state health department has been informed about the positive case as results of the genome sequencing will be shared with the state.”As per the guidelines, those testing positive have to be isolated at the institutional facility until their genome sequence results are declared. In case the genome sequence remains consistent with the current SARS-CoV-2 genome circulating, then the patient can isolate at home. However, if a mutated strain of the coronavirus is found, the patient will continue to remain in the designated isolation room, until two consecutive samples are negative on the 14th day of isolation.Till now, at least 713 UK returnees arrived in Gurugram since December 9. Of these, 517 have been traced by the health department. At least 164 moved to other countries and states, while 32 continue to remain untraceable due to incorrect contact details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/one-uk-returnee-tests-positive-genome-sequencing-results-awaited/story-J6Mge25QLoz31wEQQhGDMP.html
30-12-2020||Pune||Two-wheeler scam busted, seven arrested||The Sahakarnagar police arrested seven persons and busted a major two-wheeler loan scam in the city on Tuesday. The accused prepared bogus documents and availed loans in the name of unsuspecting persons and forced the victims to pay the Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs). The police have recovered 28 two-wheelers from their possession including other seizures totally estimated to be worth Rs 29.93 lakh from their possession. The scam came to light when one of the victims identified as Pritesh Subhash Shinde received a message from IDFC bank saying that his loan application for a two-wheeler loan has been approved. Since he had not opted for any loan, he went to the spot from where he received the message and found that it was a two-wheeler showroom. He checked with the showroom management and found bogus documents like Aadhaar card, Pan card, voter’s card and other personal documents in his name required for obtaining loan filed at the showroom. He immediately rushed to the Sahakarnagar police station and the police officials along with the victim came to the showroom for further inquiries. The person who had put the file for loan purpose had arrived by the time the police and the victim were inquiring with the showroom staff. Initially the bank agent said that his name was Pritesh Shinde when grilled by the police but later revealed that his name was Kiran Shashikant Pednekar (34), a resident of Naigaon Vasai. He was immediately taken into custody and during interrogation he revealed the names of the other accused who were involved in the scam. The other six arrested have been identified as Anil Namdeorao Navthale (31), a resident of Balapur Akola, Pravin Vijay Khadakban (39), a resident of Naigaon, Devendra Kumar Keshav Manjhi (50), a resident of Palghar and Suresh Harishchandra More ( 41 ), a resident Ghodbunder in Thane and Pankaj Rajendra Prasad Singh ( 30), a resident of Vapi in Gujarat. Sahakarnagar senior police inspector Arun Waikar said, “It is a major scam and investigations have led to the arrest of seven persons and more will follow. They prepared forged documents in names of different persons, obtained loans and used the two-wheelers and money for their own benefit which is a major crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-wheeler-scam-busted-seven-arrested/story-ZOsbP1itrrT3ke2P5OcDZO.html

One of them was charged for leaving his colleague at the spot where robbers had committed a robbery and were rushing out of the targeted building while the second cop was charged for not using his SLR rifle during the situation despite being brandished with weapons by robbers.The CCTV footage which went viral on social media shows four armed robbers getting out of the society main gate. At the time of their exit from the society, two cops on night patrol arrive at the gate. DCP ( Zone 5 ) Namrata Patil said that the two beat marshals on the duty were suspended because the contable who was riding left the colleague at the spot, took a U-turn and went away and the second constable despite having SLR did not take action against the robbers. “The robbers brandished weapons at the police constable and they are yet to be arrested. The incident took place at 3.05 am and police reached at 3.15 am. The call was regarding an attack on a watchman ,” Patil said. The policeman on the two-wheeler sped away while the other tried to follow the robbers from behind after being ticked off by one of them wearing a helmet. The robbers had broken into three flats, stolen an LED worth Rs 15,000 belonging to resident Gaurav Tannu, cash of Rs 2,000 belonging to resident Paresh Shah and cash and valuables estimated to be worth Rs 4,000 belonging to resident Pritesh Chandiwal. Govind Hirman Yadav ( 44), the watchman guarding the building has lodged an official complaint in this regard. PSI and investigating officer Mahesh Bhosale said that the incident took place on Monday morning and they had received a call that a fight was going on in the area. “Initially the police thought that it was a fight going on in the area and did not open fire. Later, one of the police constables tried to corner one of the robbers but they escaped. That incident of policemen cornering the robber has not been captured on the CCTV. A number of CCTV cameras along the escape route of the robber are inactive due to the Metro work under progress. We have got good leads and will achieve a breakthrough soon,” Bhosale said. A case under IPC 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention ) has been registered against the four robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-cops-suspended-after-fleeing-from-robbers/story-P71NovRelbnKwtj2KYzlEJ.html

To not forfeit the tradition of New Year’s Eve parties amid the pandemic, restaurants and party hot spots in the Capital have come up with ample safety protocols, such as strict precautions for social distancing and sanitisation. “As the time of celebrations is coming near and people are looking forward to stepping out and enjoying Christmas and New Years, we have already started our preparations in full swing for events including placing furniture at a distance of six feet, kitchen and tables being sanitised every half an hour, irrespective of being used or not, among other stringent measures,” says Priyank Sukhija, CEO, First Fiddle Restaurant.Apart from using of masks, gloves and face shields, and placing sanitisers on tables, here’s how restaurateurs are planning to safeguard revellers against the spread of Covid-19: Limited reservations, partitioned tables to ensure safetyAllowing restricted number of guests is the plan for many, including Bhavuk Verma, partner, Bohca. He says, “Patrons will be greeted with a temperature check and a hand sanitisation booth. We’re accepting limited reservations only, while ensuring guests are allotted tables with partition screens to facilitate proper social distancing.”Pre-bookings only, no on-the-spot dinersOther restaurateurs plan to refrain from entertaining on-the-spot bookings.

From announcing the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus to tracing and studying the origins of the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been active in the global effort against the Covid-19 pandemic. According to official data from WHO, as on December 30, 2020, a total of 80,453,105 people have been infected with Covid-19 and 1,775,776 people have died due to the disease. Companies like Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca have developed a potential Covid-19 vaccine candidate. However, the rampant spread of a new Covid-19 strain that emerged in the United Kingdom has again caused concerns among countries. With more vaccine candidates emerging, here is a look back at some of the important scientific interventions by the WHO in the year ravaged by the pandemic - Jan 9: WHO announced the spread of a new cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China and also said that the Chinese authorities have identified a new coronavirus as the possible pathogen.February 11: The name for the new disease caused by the novel coronavirus was confirmed as Covid-19 by the WHO in accordance with the best practices for the naming of new human infectious diseases.  🚨 BREAKING 🚨"We now have a name for the #2019nCoV disease: COVID-19. I’ll spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine – COVID-19"-@DrTedros #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/Kh0wx2qfzkMarch 18: An international clinical trial named Solidarity was launched by WHO along with partner agencies intended to develop an effective drug for the disease. The trial involved 12,000 patients in 500 hospitals spread across 30 countries. April 13: A pool of 130 scientists, funders and manufacturers from around the world, pledged to work with the WHO to speed up the process of finding a Covid-19 vaccine. May 15: The WHO published a scientific brief about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporally related to Covid-19.June 17: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity trials were stopped by the WHO, citing medical evidence that the drug doesn’t reduce the mortality of Covid-19 patients who were already hospitalized. July 1 & 2: More than 1000 researchers and scientists from various countries participated in the second Covid-19 summit of the WHO. The summit decided the treatment based on the different stages of the disease and also discussed criteria to further proceed with various vaccine candidates.

Luke Letlow is the first American lawmaker to die in the pandemic that is witnessing a new surge amid concerns about the availability of vaccines, as conveyed by President-elect Joe Biden.Letlow, elected to the House from Louisiana state was to take office on Sunday when the new Congress will be sworn in. He reported Covid positive on December 18 and was transferred to a hospital on December 22. Doctors at the hospital told The Advocate that Letlow had no underlying conditions.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement, “Tonight, the United States House of Representatives sadly mourns the passing of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow.Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, said, “Our hearts break tonight as we process the news of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow’s passing.”A number of top US elected officials and aides have been infected by the deadly virus, including outgoing President Donald Trump, members of his family and cabinet such as Ben Carson, the housing secretary. Many among them reported going into isolation after potential exposure.The United States has been hit the hardest by Covid-19, with close to 20 million cases and more than 338,000 deaths. A new surge is underway as winter has set in, driving indoors all activities, howsoever limited and restricted. More than 200,000 infections and 3,700 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.Millions of Americans received their first shots of the two-dose vaccines either from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna in the past few days, but the rollout has been hobbled by delays.“The Trump administration’s plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind, far behind,” Biden said on Tuesday, in a blistering attack on the incumbent administration. “A few weeks ago, the Trump Administration suggested that 20 million Americans could be vaccinated by the end of December. With only a few days left in December, we have only vaccinated a few million so far. At the pace the vaccination programme is moving now, it would take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people.”The president-elect, who ran on the promise of according top priority to combating the pandemic, said that once in office — after January 20 — he will use presidential war powers accorded in the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of material needed for vaccines.Trump, who has seemed more focused on overturning his electoral defeat to Biden, tried to shift blame for the delays to the states. “The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states,” he wrote in a tweet. “Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-claims-life-of-us-lawmaker-days-before-he-was-to-take-office/story-1253XaM6pgtW72j6KY3UQI.html
30-12-2020||World||US reports first case of UK strain of coronavirus||A man in the state of Colorado on Tuesday became the first American infected with the new variant of the coronavirus that has swept through the United Kingdom and has since been reported from around the world, including India, leading to a new round of lockdowns and global travel restrictions.Scientists have found this variant more transmissible but not more harmful. The infected man is in his 20s and has no recent history of travel. State officials have said he is a resident of Elbert County, which is about 50 miles from Denver, the state capital, and has been put in isolation and officials are tracking all those who may have come in contact with him.“Today we discovered Colorado’s first case of the Covid-19 variant B.1.1.7, the same variant discovered in the UK,” said Colorado governor Jared Polis in a tweet. “The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority and we will monitor this case, as well as all Covid-19 indicators, very closely.”This new coronavirus strain was first detected in southeastern England and spread rapidly, accounting for a fourth of all cases in London. It has since been detected in India, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore and several other countries.Scientists say viruses are known to mutate and multiple strains of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 are currently circulating globally. “In the United Kingdom, a new variant has emerged with an unusually large number of mutations,” said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the key agency monitoring and combating infectious diseases. “This variant seems to spread more easily and quickly than other variants. Currently, there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness or increased risk of death.”Scientists do not know yet how wide is the spread of the new strain, or how different its impact is as compared to other variants. They are currently studying if it causes milder or more severe illnesses, if it can be detected using the same testing kits and how it responds to medicines currently in use and whether it would require changing the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines being circulated or on their way, said the CDC.There is no evidence yet that the new strain is resistant to current vaccines.Another variant of the coronavirus has been detected in South Africa, emerging independently of the UK strain. Yet another mutation has been detected in Nigeria.India is among a growing list of countries — more than 40 — that have imposed travel restrictions to and from the United Kingdom, which in turn has also announced curbs on South Africa flights. Restrictions have been under discussions in the United States but so far only New York, which has been the epicentre of the American outbreak, has announced rules mandating quarantine for travellers from the UK, punishable with fines.Public health officials in the United States, the country worst hit by the pandemic, are watching the new variant closely as they brace for a massive winter surge from the strain that has killed more than 338,000 people and infected close to 20 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. More 3,700 Covid-19 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours and 201,000 new infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reports-first-case-of-uk-strain-of-coronavirus/story-lACB400ZzMyl0DuLcQhUhI.html

The US government has rolled out two Covid-19 vaccines, one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna, after approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over two million people have been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) so far, almost one-tenth of the 20 million vaccinations promised by federal officials by year-end. Dr Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, said that the federal government made no real effort to get the vaccination infrastructure and the states are now scrambling to figure it out.“They got the vaccines, but the infrastructure to get people vaccinated, they just decided that was not their responsibility,” Dr Jha told CNN. “It strikes me as a level of incompetence I have to say I am stunned by,” he added.Also Read | Lessons India can learn from the vaccine rollout in other countriesMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has been trying to deflect the blame on the states for failing to achieve the vaccination target. Taking to Twitter, Trump said that the federal government has distributed Covid-19 vaccines to the states and it’s up to them to administer those vaccines. “The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!” he tweeted. The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!Later, Dr Jha said that the US president’s tweet “perfectly captures” the pandemic strategy of the federal government. He recounted the earlier instances of administration blaming the states for the speed of Covid-19 testing and the Personal protective equipment (PPE) availability issues. “They did they with testing, PPE, and now vaccines...Their theory of the case? Pandemic response has gone poorly because we have 50 failed governors...This is why we need change,” the public health expert tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stunned-by-level-of-incompetence-in-us-vaccine-rollout-public-health-expert/story-P3EBrzP2dYWSrzEGkk0PaI.html
30-12-2020||World||‘Tired of making deals with Prachanda’: Nepal PM Oli||Embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli said on Wednesday that he is “tired of making deals” with the rival faction leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and accused him of breaching various agreements reached between them on several occasions to keep the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s unity intact.Oli’s remarks came hours after a four-member Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou returned home without much success in its mission to patch up differences between Nepal’s feuding leaders.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda.Acting on the prime minister’s recommendation, President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party.Addressing party leaders and cadres of his faction in Kathmandu, Oli slammed leaders of the rival faction for their non-cooperation in running the party and government for the past two years since he came to power, My Republica newspaper reported. Oli, who is also the chairperson of a faction of the NCP, accused Prachanda of breaching various agreements reached between them on multiple occasions to keep the party unity intact, it said.“In fact, Prachandaji was negotiating with the Nepali Congress to form the government and at the same time he was bargaining with me although we (two communist parties) won elections after forging an electoral alliance,” Oli said. “I am tired of making deals with Dahal (Prachanda),” Oli said, adding that he had reached a number of agreements with the former prime minister for keeping the party unity intact.Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections.Oli urged Prachanda to renounce politics of betrayal, the report said. Maintaining that there is no constitutional provision to reinstate Parliament, Oli said he was forced to dissolve the House after knowing that the Prachanda-led faction was planning to file a no-confidence motion against him and introduce an impeachment motion against President Bidya Devi Bhandari in Parliament.Condemning the dissolution of Parliament, the NCP’s rival faction organised a massive protest rally on Tuesday. Addressing the rally, Prachanda had said Oli’s move to dissolve the House of Representatives is aimed at killing federalism and republicanism which were achieved after decades of struggle by the people.Nepal’s Supreme Court on Friday issued a show-cause notice to the Oli-led government, asking it to submit a written clarification over its decision to abruptly dissolve Parliament.The five-member Constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana asked the government to submit an original copy of the recommendations made by it to dissolve the House and the decision made by the President to authenticate the government’s recommendations within 10 days.

30-12-2020||World||Germany set for longer lockdown as death figures spike||German officials made clear Wednesday that they won’t be able to relax lockdown restrictions in early January as the country recorded more than 1,000 deaths in one day for the first time.That figure was likely swollen by delayed reporting but underlined the severity of the situation.Germany, the European Union’s most populous country, shut restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities on Nov. 2. That partial shutdown halted a fast increase in new infections for a while but failed to bring them down, prompting authorities to impose a fuller lockdown from Dec. 16, shutting nonessential shops and schools.Those measures run through Jan. 10. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governors of Germany’s 16 states will consult Tuesday on how to proceed.“We have to lament 1,129 deaths this morning alone — 1,129 families will be in mourning this new year,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a news conference.“These figures show how brutally this virus is still striking. But the numbers of deaths and infections also show that we are a very long way from the normality we would like,” he added. “So in this situation, I don’t see how we can return to the pre-lockdown mode.”“My expectation is that the lockdown will continue, because we must not take any further risks. The hospitals ... are at their limits,” said the governor of Germany’s most populous state, Armin Laschet.The deaths reported to Germany’s national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, over the past 24 hours exceeded the previous record set a week ago of 962 and brought Germany’s total death toll to 32,107.The institute’s chairman, Lothar Wieler, said “the most plausible explanation” for the spike in reported deaths was delayed reporting of cases over the Christmas holiday, following relatively low figures over several days.However, the figure fits into a recent pattern of high numbers of deaths.Germany had a relatively low death rate in the first phase of the pandemic but has seen hundreds of deaths per day in recent weeks. Among major European nations, Italy, the U.K., France and Spain still have higher death tolls.Wieler appealed to Germans to keep reducing their contacts to the absolute minimum, saying: “Let’s take the wind out of the virus’ sails together.” He said that, as of Tuesday, there were over 5,600 Covid-19 patients in intensive care, the highest number yet.The Robert Koch Institute said 22,459 new coronavirus cases were reported over the past 24 hours in Germany, which has 83 million inhabitants.Germany has reported nearly 1.69 million cases in total.The vaccination program launched in Germany and across the EU over the weekend offers hope. So far, 78,109 people in Germany have received their first vaccine dose.All the same, Wieler said Germans will have to stick to social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing rules for months.“It will take months before so many people are vaccinated that the circulation of the virus in the population is reduced,” he said.It’s unclear what measures exactly will continue beyond Jan. 10. Schools are the responsibility of state governments alone in Germany.Spahn said it’s “normal” to discuss what happens with schools, but “in case of doubt, I favor a week too many now rather than a week too few.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-set-for-longer-lockdown-as-death-figures-spike/story-SzPeFjADBPxajLSb7R6T2O.html
30-12-2020||World||Iran allocates payment to families of Ukraine crash victims||Iran’s cabinet has created a compensation fund to pay the families of the 176 victims of a Ukrainian passenger plane that was shot down by Iranian forces outside Tehran last January, the president announced Wednesday.Iran will pay $150,000 for each victim, state TV reported, without specifying a timeline for the awards. The announcement comes as the families of victims prepare to mark the anniversary of the Jan. 8 crash and diplomats from nations that lost citizens push Iran for more cooperation on the investigation and compensation issues.There was no immediate comment on Iran’s announcement from the five countries in talks with Iran about reparations.For days, Iran denied that its military was responsible for the downing of the plane. But with extensive evidence emerging from Western intelligence reports and international pressure building, Iran admitted that its military had mistakenly fired at the Ukrainian jetliner at a moment of heightened tension between Iran and the United States. Hostilities had reached a fever pitch the week before over the American drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, raising fears of further violence in the region.Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. Tehran blamed “human error” for the shoot-down, saying in a report released over the summer that those manning a misaligned surface-to-air missile battery wrongly identified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials.Canadian authorities allege that Iran has not disclosed all relevant evidence or provided satisfactory answers to a number of lingering questions, including the identities of those held responsible for the downing, the exact chain of events that led the Revolutionary Guard to open fire and the decision to leave Iranian airspace open to civilian traffic the same night that Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq.The plane, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukraine International Airlines bound for the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians, 17 Swedes, 11 Ukrainians, four Afghans and four British citizens according to officials. The route was popular with those traveling onward to Canada.For months, the governments of the five affected countries have demanded that Tehran accept “full responsibility” for the crash and pay compensation to the victims’ families in line with international agreements.Iran, for its part, has sent mixed messages on the matter of compensation, with Gholamreza Soleimani, the head of the country’s main insurance agency, saying in October that Iran would refuse to pay awards because the jet was “insured by European companies.”But other Iranian officials have promised to negotiate compensation with the five countries.“A mistake has been made by us but the base of the compensation should be decided,” said Mohsen Baharvand, deputy to the foreign minister, in September. “We have told our Ukrainian colleagues that international regulations are our basis.”The association representing the families of victims released a statement last week lambasting Iran’s compensation offer and demanding an independent and transparent investigation into the crash.“The families are vigilant and will not sign any document,” the statement read. “The murderer cannot play the role of mourner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-allocates-payment-to-families-of-ukraine-crash-victims/story-xGdQANYHfPUKx4Syk210XK.html

30-12-2020||World||Blast at Aden airport kills 16, wounds 60: Yemeni official||A large explosion struck the airport in the southern Yemeni city of Aden on Wednesday, shortly after a plane carrying the newly formed Cabinet landed there, security officials said. At least 16 people were killed and 60 were wounded in the blast.The source of the blast was not immediately clear and no group claimed responsibility for attacking the airport.AP footage from the scene showed members of the government delegation disembarking as the blast shook the grounds. No one on the government plane was hurt but many ministers rushed back inside the plane or ran down the stairs, seeking shelter.Thick smoke rose into the air from the near the terminal building. Officials at the scene said they saw bodies lying on the tarmac and elsewhere at the airport.Yemeni Communication Minister Naguib al-Awg, who was also on the government plane, told The Associated Press that he heard two explosions, suggesting they were drone attacks. Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed and the others were quickly whisked away from the airport to the Mashiq Palace in the city.“It would have been a disaster if the plane was bombed,” he said, insisting the plane was the target of the attack as it was supposed to land earlier.Mohammed al-Roubid, deputy head of Aden’s health office, told the AP that at least 16 people were killed in the explosion and 60 were wounded.Images shared on social media from the scene showed rubble and broken glass strewn about near the airport building and at least two lifeless bodies, one of them charred, lying on the ground. In another image, a man was trying to help another man whose clothes were torn to get up from the ground.According to one Yemeni security official, three Red Cross workers were among the wounded, though it was not clear if they were Yemenis or of other nationalities. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.The U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the explosion as an “unacceptable act of violence.” He said in a tweet that it was “a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing #Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace.”The ministers were returning to Aden after being sworn in last week as part of a reshuffle following a deal with rival southern separatists. Yemen’s internationally recognized government has worked mostly from self-imposed exile in the Saudi capital of Riyadh during the country’s years-long civil war.Yemen’s embattled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in exile in Saudi Arabia, announced a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month.The reshuffle was seen as a major step toward closing a dangerous rift between Hadi’s government and southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The Saudi-backed government is at war with with Iran-allied Houthi rebels, who control most of northern Yemen as well as the country’s capital, Sanaa.Naming a new government was part of a power-sharing deal between the Saudi-backed Hadi and the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of militias seeking to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The blast underscores the dangers facing Hadi’s government in the port city which was a scene of bloody fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed separatists.Last year, the Houthis fired a missile at a military parade of newly graduated fighters of a militia loyal to the UAE at a military base in Aden, killing dozens.Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Shiite Houthi rebels overran the north and Sanaa. The following year, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to wage war on the Houthis and restore Hadi’s government to power.The war has killed more than 112,000, including thousands of civilians. The conflict also resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-at-aden-airport-kills-16-wounds-60-yemeni-official/story-VA5U8BK0VXIE7bzUjR4FPM.html
30-12-2020||World||More Covid relief is needed, but $2,000 checks aren’t the way||President Donald Trump’s call to raise the $600 payments included in the recent Covid relief plan to $2,000 gave Democrats the opportunity to deliver extra help to the economy while embarrassing the opposition. Their House majority, with support from 44 Republicans, quickly passed a measure to deliver the additional payments. The Republican-controlled Senate then blocked it. With crucial votes in Georgia’s Senate runoff looming, Republicans are at odds with each other and with their president, and obstructing a popular proposal to boot.The only problem is that, as Democrats ought to realize, there are far better ways of spending those funds. Tempting as it might be to press their political advantage, they should pause and ask how best to help those in need.When the first big Covid relief plan — the Cares Act — was enacted in March, there was a good case for including generous and near-universal per-person payments. These could be delivered faster than more carefully targeted supports, at a time when concerns were high that demand in the economy might slump. That’s no longer the situation. In the aggregate, household incomes and savings aren’t under pressure. If anything, as former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers points out, it’s the opposite. For the great majority, the constraint on spending is the pandemic’s narrowing of opportunities, not financial stress.Despite all the strains of the pandemic, most Americans still have their jobs. Most aren’t falling behind on rent or mortgage payments. Extra cash is always welcome, but most Americans don’t need emergency financial aid. Yet many households are under severe financial strain and desperately need more support. For them, an additional one-time payment of $1,400 isn’t the right kind of help.The recent Covid relief plan was indeed too small. Democrats insisted on this throughout and they were right — but not because the plans under discussion skimped on the checks. The recent package should’ve included far more targeted relief for the neediest. Additional unemployment insurance should be put in place for the duration of the emergency. Support for renters facing eviction should be extended and improved. Subsidies for essential low-income workers who’ve put themselves at risk make sense. And state and local governments should be a priority. They’re having to deal with surging costs and diminished revenue — pressures that risk spilling over to teachers, health-care staff and other workers, while undermining vital public services.With interest rates close to zero, this is no time to be obsessed by fiscal rectitude — but spending almost half a trillion dollars on a relatively ineffective near-universal benefit isn’t costless or even, as its more reluctant supporters might argue, better than nothing. By significantly expanding public borrowing, it will narrow the scope for the additional well-targeted help that so many people still need.A new administration is poised to take office, presenting an opportunity to think again. President-elect Joe Biden and his team have rightly argued for additional fiscal support. They should make the case for a plan that’s smart and responsible. Giving $2,000 to most Americans whether they need it or not is neither.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-covid-relief-is-needed-but-2-000-checks-aren-t-the-way/story-oYmb1d32RKAcc1ndYP8OnI.html
30-12-2020||World||EU sets aside China’s rights record, seals pact with Prez Xi that may upset US||Chinese and European Union leaders sealed a landmark investment pact on Wednesday that would make it easier for their companies to invest in each other’s economies despite concerns around Beijing’s patchy labour rights record.President Xi Jinping had intervened earlier this month to extend key market access concessions to businesses under the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) that had been under discussion for years. President Xi’s concession persuaded the European Union to accede to the pact that Brussels expects to open up lucrative opportunities for its businesses.“Today, the EU and China concluded in principle negotiations on an investment agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted after a video call with President Xi that also involved EU Council president Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron; and German Chancellor Angela Merkel who holds the rotating presidency of the EU till tomorrow and was seen to have pushed hard for the deal.Also Read: Whats and whys of the EU-China investment agreementPresident Xi, according to a Reuters report, told the meeting that the investment deal will offer bigger markets and a better business environment for both Chinese and European investments. It shows China’s determination and confidence in opening up, President Xi said, adding that the pact would stimulate the global economy, promote economic globalisation and free trade.But the EU’s big win, as its leaders have projected the agreement, deals a huge blow to the US President-elect Joe Biden’s hopes of rebuilding the transatlantic alliance in an effort to take on an assertive China.There has been no reaction from the United States to the agreement so far; there will be more than one. President-elect Biden’s choice for national security adviser Jake Sullivan had earlier this month tweeted the incoming Biden administration’s request to hold “early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices”.Also Read: EU, China leaders seal long-awaited investment dealPolish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau too had called for more consultations and transparency to bring EU’s transatlantic allies on board. “A good, balanced deal is better than a premature one,” the minister tweeted last week. Members of European Parliament too have expressed concern at the EU rushing through the agreement.Indian officials who have been tracking the negotiations say President Xi’s concession was timed to get the agreement done and dusted before the end of Germany’s presidency and the Biden administration takes charge in a few weeks.One official said the promptness with which the EU had set aside concerns around China’s rights record also erodes its credibility as a defender of human rights, and that of its lawmakers.The pact with China comes less than a fortnight after European lawmakers adopted a resolution to condemn forced labour in China’s Xinjiang region, where workers from the Muslim Uighur community are coerced to manufacture goods ranging from cars to medical protective equipment that are often sold on the EU market.Beijing’s standard response to such criticism of its rights record has been a loud denial. An Indian official said it was unlikely that Beijing would have agreed for verification of its claim that its companies do not use forced labour.According to the EU, China had committed to pursue ratification of the International Labor Organization’s rules on forced labour.The 27-nation bloc said the agreement is the most ambitious that China has ever agreed with a third country and will give additional access to many areas including the electric cars and hybrid vehicles sector, as well as private hospitals, telecoms, cloud and financial services, international maritime transport and air transport-related services. According to EU figures, China is now the bloc’s second-biggest trading partner behind the United States, and the EU is China’s biggest trading partner. China and Europe trade on average over €1 billion a day, according to news agency AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sets-aside-china-s-rights-record-seals-pact-with-prez-xi-that-may-upset-us/story-BY37f9knPutdgu9gKqAlQM.html
30-12-2020||World||UK to follow new immunisation strategy for Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. All you need to know||The British government on Wednesday announced that it will follow a new immunisation strategy for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended inoculating as many people as possible with the first dose before offering others their second dose. The recommendations were published soon after the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine.Here’s all you need to know about the new immunisation strategy:1. The researchers and regulators have reportedly found that the first dose of AstraZeneca’s AZD1222 offers “very effective protection” from coronavirus, providing a longer period of immunity before receiving a second dose. 2. The JCVI said that the protection is obtained around two weeks after receiving the first dose of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine.3. According to the committee, the second dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose to maximise benefits from the vaccination programme in the short term. 4. While the JCVI has recommended that both the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high-levels of protection against Covid-19, the two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine must be administered three weeks apart. 5. It further stated that there are some data from the AstraZeneca vaccine trials suggesting that extending the time to the second dose may be better than having the second dose earlier.6. The committee has also advised not to skip the second dose as it may be important for longer-lasting protection, however, adding that the exact duration of protection is currently unknown.7. The committee said that the initial phase of the vaccine programme is estimated to cover around 99% of preventable Covid-19 deaths.UK health secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News that the new immunisation strategy for AstraZeneca can allow the authorities to provide the first dose to people “more quickly” and they can get the effective protection offered by the first dose. He also highlighted the advantages of AstraZeneca’s vaccine over other Covid-19 vaccines in terms of cost and storage feasibility.“It’s good news for the whole world because this vaccine is relatively cheap to produce...because it’s relatively easy to handle and just can be stored at a normal fridge temperature,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-follow-new-immunisation-strategy-for-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-all-you-need-to-know/story-xaZFAAZtmoQft6clPTRH9M.html
30-12-2020||World||Germany sees rapid EU approval of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine||Germany expects the European Union to give rapid approval to the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that was cleared for use in Britain on Wednesday, its top vaccines official said.Berlin’s support for AstraZeneca comes as EU member countries seek to fill supply chains for vaccination drives that began last weekend using a shot from Pfizer and BioNTech - the only one to win EU approval so far.Germany has made relatively quick headway, reporting a total of 78,000 shots administered, but there have been reports of setbacks with some vaccination centres shutting down temporarily due to supply shortages.Fatalities linked to Covid-19 in Germany hit a record daily high of 1,129 on Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 32,107, as local health authorities caught up with a Christmas reporting backlog. Total confirmed cases reached 1.69 million.Klaus Cichutek, head of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, said that, thanks to the rolling EU review of the AstraZeneca vaccine, it would be possible to take a quick decision once a formal application was submitted.No such application had been received by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by Wednesday morning, Cichutek told reporters, but a debate in its councils would follow as soon as it arrived.“Once the application is submitted a decision can be taken quickly,” Cichutek told a news conference.“THOROUGH AND QUICK”German Health Minister Jens Spahn urged “a thorough and quick examination” of the AstraZeneca vaccine by EMA, in addition to the expected clearance of a shot from Moderna in early January.“Vaccination is the key to getting out of this pandemic,” Spahn told reporters. “Preventing death and suffering is key. It is the key to getting our normal lives back.”Spahn confirmed that Germany expected to take delivery of 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer shot by the end of the year.But, even with increased supply going into early 2021, it would take months to inoculate the wider population.“I can only appeal for patience,” he said. “Please don’t forget that we have a vaccine ... that is reason enough for joy and optimism.”Amid heightened contagion, continued strong reductions of social contacts would continue to be necessary, officials said.“It will take months until enough people are vaccinated to reduce the circulation of the virus in the population,” said Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute responsible for coordinating Germany’s pandemic response.Federal and regional leaders are due to convene in the New Year to discuss whether to extend lockdown measures imposed before Christmas that are due to remain in force until at least Jan. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-sees-rapid-eu-approval-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-Fm9piXsL2WIjwuKnXoQxMO.html
30-12-2020||World||Prosecutors seek 9-year prison term for Samsung chief Lee||South Korean prosecutors on Wednesday requested a nine-year prison term for Samsung’s de facto chief, Lee Jae-yong, during a retrial of his bribery charges. The case is a key element in an explosive 2016 scandal that triggered months of public protests and toppled the country’s president. The development comes as Lee faces immense pressure to navigate Samsung’s transition after his father and Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-Hee died in October at age 78 after years of hospitalisation. Special prosecutor Park Young-soo demanded the Seoul High Court sentence Lee to prison. He said Samsung “more actively sought illicit benefits” than other businesses with regard to the 2016 scandal. Park said Samsung, which is South Korea’s biggest company, should “set the example” for efforts to root out corruption. Lee, 52, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was sentenced in 2017 to five years in prison for offering 8.6 billion won (USD 7 million) in bribes to former President Park Geun-hye and one of her longtime confidants to get her government’s backing for his push to solidify his control over Samsung. But he was freed in early 2018 after the Seoul High Court reduced his term to 2 ½ years and suspended his sentence, overturning key convictions and reducing the amount of his bribes. Last year, the Supreme Court returned the case to the high court, ruling that the amount of Lee’s bribes had been undervalued. In September, prosecutors separately indicted Lee for alleged stock price manipulation, breach of trust and auditing violations related to a 2015 merger between two Samsung affiliates that helped strengthen Lee’s control over the group’s crown jewel, Samsung Electronics. Lee’s lawyers denied the charges, calling them “one-sided claims.” They say the 2015 merger was “normal business activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutors-seek-9-year-prison-term-for-samsung-chief-lee/story-VMns6Bv2v0lHtsWD7waBMP.html
30-12-2020||World||Amid virus fears, China urges migrant workers to skip holiday travel||China is encouraging tens of millions of migrant workers not to travel home during February’s Lunar New Year holiday to prevent further spread of the coronavirus.The measure from the National Health Commission is not a direct travel ban but is still extraordinary because Lunar New Year is China’s most important traditional holiday and the only time of the year when many workers have the opportunity to travel home to see their families.The NHC said it was encouraging provincial governments to persuade workers to follow the suggestion while taking into account their personal wishes. It also said workers who stay behind should be paid overtime and offered other opportunities to take vacation.China has all but eradicated local transmission of the coronavirus, but authorities remain on high alert over a possible resurgence. Already, schools are scheduled to begin the Lunar New Year vacation a week early and tourists have been told not to visit Beijing, the capital, during the holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-virus-fears-china-urges-migrant-workers-to-skip-holiday-travel/story-o6VeRYK8lldUUDIpwWpRoO.html
30-12-2020||World||A year of trials: Controversies, pitfalls AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine faced||Researchers at the University of Oxford built their vaccine using adenovirus, a virus that causes cold in chimpanzees. They genetically altered the virus to make it carry a gene for a coronavirus protein, which researchers said would train a person’s immune system to recognize the real coronavirus. Adenovirus-based vaccines are not an anomaly. Russia’s Sputnik-V and a Chinese vaccine have also used similar technology, but both vaccines have not published credible results or submitted their findings to be peer-reviewed. Hence, the efficiency of these are unknown. Adenovirus vaccines have also been patented before for Ebola by pharma giant Johnson and Johnson.Why was its efficacy being doubted?In the spring of 2020, AstraZeneca and Oxford started running clinical trials in Britain and later in other countries. The first round of trials showed volunteers were producing antibodies and the vaccine was deemed to be on the right part. On November 23, however, the team behind the vaccine reported that due to an error, two sets of volunteers had received two types of doses. The group which had received two full doses of the vaccine developed only 62% efficacy, whereas the group that had received the accidental dose of one half shot followed by the full shot showed 90% efficacy. Reuters reported that researchers were baffled when the usual side effects of fatigue, arm aches, and headaches were much milder than expected. On checking, they found out that the group had been administered only half the initial dose of the vaccine. No one knows the reason behind this anomaly and the researchers have attributed it to a lucky coincidence. What impact did the dosing error have?The main issue seems to be with the limited size of the group which received half a dose followed by a full dose. It was considerably smaller than the group given two full doses and did not include participants over the age of 55. This controversy led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dose/full dose regime.However, researchers have stressed time and again that regardless of the dosing regime, none of the trial participants developed severe coronavirus symptoms or had to go into hospital with the disease after having just one dose of the vaccine, and both older and younger participants showed a similar immune response to the jab. Fewer than 2,800 volunteers got the initial half dose, out of the total 23,000 participants whose results were reported. That’s a pretty small specimen to base efficacy results on. In the Phase 3 trials, some neurological issues also cropped up in volunteers in the US and India. The US Food and Drug Administration did not tie the vaccine directly with the issue but the developer was asked to exercise caution. In its final report too, AstraZeneca and Oxford said that no serious safety issues were caused by the vaccine in the trial groupHow does it fare in comparison with other vaccines?The Oxford vaccine does not have to be stored and transported at a super cold temperature like the Pfizer/BioNTech one, which needs -70C. It can be easily stored in regular medical refrigerators at 2C-8C for up to five days, making it a more viable and less cost-intensive option for tropical countries. Moreover, at about $3-4 per shot, the Oxford vaccine is much cheaper than the Pfizer vaccine, which is said to be priced around $20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-of-trials-controversies-pitfalls-astrazeneca-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-faced/story-Xj7ryPRW77mBgXHwywzaGP.html
30-12-2020||World||Indian-origin UK company director banned over tax bill||An Indian-origin director of a ladies clothing manufacturing company in the east Midlands town of Leicester has been banned for six years after failing to pay a £98,000 tax bill, Britain’s insolvency officials said on Wednesday.Surinder Singh, 62, was the director of the company that was placed into compulsory liquidation in July 2019 after ceasing trading and failing to pay the tax bill which had accumulated from April 2018.The Official Receiver who investigated Singh’s conduct as director found that he had failed to ensure that the company kept accounting records. He had also withdrawn £180,000 between November 2017 and March 2019, but could not explain the reasons for the withdrawals.The Insolvency Service said Singh did not dispute that he failed to ensure the company maintained and/or preserved adequate accounting records and that the company traded to the detriment of the tax authorities.Robert Clarke, chief investigator at the service, said: “Surinder Singh tried to cloak his actions through a lack of records and attempted to gain an unfair competitive advantage by not paying the tax due”.“Directors have a clear obligation to make sure they maintain full and accurate records for their business, and we will take robust action against those who fail to maintain these required standards, as this case shows”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-uk-company-director-banned-over-tax-bill/story-eLo4UIFM7OaDByXODGNBDO.html
30-12-2020||World||New spike in UK cases as Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is approved||The Boris Johnson government was on Wednesday grappling with a new spike in Covid-19 cases – driven by relaxations over the Christmas period and the new variant – but its efforts received a fillip with the regulator approving the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.There were renewed calls for another lockdown and stopping schools from reopening after the holiday period ends in early January, as the number of new daily cases touched 53,135 on Tuesday evening – more than 10 times that of the April-May peak.London, which is among areas in south-east England where the variant is most detected, registered 14,875 new cases. The UK’s state-funded hospital system has come close to being overwhelmed, with 21,286 Covid-19 patients, forcing some hospitals to cancel other procedures.Johnson hailed the approval for the vaccine, which has an easier logistics delivery regime than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Calling its development in a short period “a triumph” for British science, he said: “We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.”The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the first batches expected within 24 hours and mass vaccination beginning from Monday. The two-dose vaccine is to be delivered three months apart. As of Tuesday evening, 616,933 people had received the first dose of the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine.Officials said that the three-month period between the two doses would enable a large number of people in the groups at risk being vaccinated. Everyone will still receive the second dose and this will be within 12 weeks of their first, a spokesperson for the Department of Health said.Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, said the company could provide the UK with up to 2 million doses a week, with the first doses arriving on Wednesday or Thursday: “Vaccination will start next week and we will get to 1 million a week and beyond that a week very rapidly.”“The good news with this is, we are going to be able to inject a lot of people with one dose very quickly, provide them with a reasonably good dose of protection until they get their second dose two to three months later. That will enable us to protect many more people because we can wait two to three months for the second dose,” he added.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population – we’ve got 100 million doses on order – add that to the 30 million doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population”.“So I can now say with confidence that we can vaccinate everyone, except of course for children because this vaccine has not been trialled on children, and anyway children are much, much less likely to have symptoms from the disease.”Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: “The regulator’s assessment that this is a safe and effective vaccine is a landmark moment, and an endorsement of the huge effort from a devoted international team of researchers and our dedicated trial participants.”Sarah Gilbert, professor of Vaccinology at Oxford said this is a day for the team developing the vaccine to celebrate, after a year of extremely hard work under difficult circumstances. “Now that the first authorisation or use of the vaccine outside of clinical trials has been granted, we still have more to do and will continue to provide more data to multiple regulatory authorities, until we are able to see the vaccine being used to save lives around the world.”Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, said: “‘For the past 25 years, staff at the Jenner Institute have worked to develop vaccines using novel technologies to protect people around the world from diseases that claim many lives each year. The work on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 builds on many years of research by a dedicated team of vaccinologists, and we are delighted to see the first emergency use licensure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-spike-in-uk-cases-as-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-is-approved/story-KR6HbJFhx527C6d0HBy6xH.html

He called the explosions a “cowardly terrorist act” that was part of the war on “the Yemeni state and our great people.”Mohammed al-Roubid, deputy head of Aden’s health office, told the AP that at least 16 people were killed in the explosion and 60 were wounded.Images shared on social media from the scene showed rubble and broken glass strewn about near the airport building and at least two lifeless bodies, one of them charred, lying on the ground. In another image, a man was trying to help another man whose clothes were torn to get up from the ground.According to one Yemeni security official, three Red Cross workers were among the wounded, though it was not clear if they were Yemenis or of other nationalities. He and other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the explosion as an “unacceptable act of violence.” He said in a tweet that it was “a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing #Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace.”The ministers were returning to Aden from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after being sworn in last week as part of a reshuffle following a deal with rival southern separatists. Yemen’s internationally recognized government has worked mostly from self-imposed exile in Riyadh during the country’s years-long civil war.The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, described the attack as a “cowardly terrorist act targeting the Yemeni people, their security and stability.”Despite “the disappointment and confusion caused by those who create death and destruction,” the peace agreement between the government and southern separatists “will go forward,” he insisted.Yemen’s embattled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in exile in Saudi Arabia, announced a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month.The reshuffle was seen as a major step toward closing a dangerous rift between Hadi’s government and southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The Saudi-backed government is at war with with Iran-allied Houthi rebels, who control most of northern Yemen as well as the country’s capital, Sanaa.Naming a new government was part of a power-sharing deal between the Saudi-backed Hadi and the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of militias seeking to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The blast underscores the dangers facing Hadi’s government in the port city, which was a scene of bloody fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed separatists.Last year, the Houthis fired a missile at a military parade of newly graduated fighters of a militia loyal to the UAE at a military base in Aden, killing dozens.In 2015, then-Yemeni Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government survived a missile attack, blamed on the Houthis, on an Aden hotel used by the government.Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Shiite Houthi rebels overran the north and Sanaa. The following year, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to wage war on the Houthis and restore Hadi’s government to power.The war has killed more than 112,000, including thousands of civilians. The conflict also resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blasts-heard-at-yemen-s-aden-airport-after-plane-carrying-newly-formed-govt-s-ministers-lands/story-tiY8bxuvaXStCP8m5VW0UP.html
30-12-2020||World||Earthquake aftershocks rock Croatia as teams search for survivors||Rescuers raced to search for survivors amid strong aftershocks after Croatia’s worst earthquake in 140 years killed seven people and devastated cities and towns in one of the nation’s poorest regions.The 6.3-magnitude tremor on Tuesday damaged most of the buildings near its epicenter in Petrinja, a town of 25,000 people, rendering them unusable and their inhabitants homeless, authorities said.The victims included a 13-year-old girl and a father and son who died together. Twenty-six people were injured, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said.The temblor, which rattled Europeans as far away as Rome and Vienna, was more powerful than both a 5.2 quake on Monday and a similar-sized tremor that caused $6 billion in damage when it hit the capital of Zagreb in March.Aftershocks, including two measuring 4.8 and 4.6, hit the area before dawn on Wednesday, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre.“This morning we were hit by the third, if not the fourth earthquake,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said on state TV’s Good Morning show. “Everything that has not yet fallen is falling from the ruins of Petrinja.”The disaster adds to an already difficult year for the Adriatic European Union member state, which is still busy repairing the 20,000 buildings damaged during the March quake while also tackling one of the bloc’s worst surges in coronavirus cases and a record economic recession.Plenkovic vowed the government will repair the damage, the extent of which hasn’t been estimated yet. While the government abolished a virus-triggered ban on movement between counties so those whose homes were destroyed could stay with relatives, he urged people to continue following social-distancing guidelines.“We are appealing to people to stick to epidemiological measures,” Plenkovic told reporters. “We still have a problem with the coronavirus pandemic.”Authorities evacuated the damaged hospital in the nearby city of Sisak, the region’s largest, taking patients to Zagreb. Buildings were also damaged in the capital, about 50-kilometers away.War DamagePetrinja was demolished in the 1991-1995 war for independence from former Yugoslavia. The damage on Tuesday resulted in collapsed facades and caved-in roofs that resembled the damage from the war, as many citizens spent the night by open fires outside.The US Geological Survey said the temblor was the nation’s strongest since the advent of modern seismic instrumentation, which began to gain prevalence in the 1880s.The government set aside an initial 120 million kuna ($19.4 million) in relief funds, Plenkovic said. Both Hungary and Slovenia said they were sending support, while Janez Lenarcic, the EU’s commissioner for disaster relief, will arrive in Croatia on Wednesday. He said the bloc was sending help today including winter tents, electric heaters, sleeping bags, and pre-made housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-aftershocks-rock-croatia-as-teams-search-for-survivors/story-iNCFerq2AuY80wAPNvuTbO.html
30-12-2020||World||Nashville bomber’s girlfriend warned he was building bombs||More than a year before he detonated a bomb in downtown Nashville on Christmas, officers visited Anthony Warner’s home after his girlfriend told police that he was building bombs in an RV trailer at his residence, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. But they were unable to make contact with him, or see inside his RV.Officers were called to Pamela Perry’s home in Nashville on Aug. 21, 2019 after getting a report from her attorney that she was making suicidal threats while sitting on her front porch with firearms, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said Tuesday in an emailed statement. A police report said Raymond Throckmorton, the attorney, told officers that day he also represented Warner.When officers arrived at Perry’s home, police said she had two unloaded pistols sitting next to her on the porch. She told them those guns belonged to “Tony Warner,” police said, and she did not want them in the house any longer. Perry, then 62, was then transported for a psychological evaluation after speaking to mental health professionals on the phone.Throckmorton told The Tennessean Perry had fears about her safety, and thought Warner may harm her. The attorney was also at the scene that day, and told officers Warner “frequently talks about the military and bomb making,” the police report said. Warner “knows what he is doing and is capable of making a bomb,” Throckmorton said to responding officers.Police then went to Warner’s home, located about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) from Perry’s home, but he didn’t answer the door when they knocked several times. They saw the RV in the backyard, the report said, but the yard was fenced off and officers couldn’t see inside the vehicle.The report said there also were “several security cameras and wires attached to an alarm sign on the front door” of the home. Officers then notified supervisors and detectives.“They saw no evidence of a crime and had no authority to enter his home or fenced property,” the police statement said.After officers visited Warner’s home last August, the police department’s hazardous devices unit was given a copy of the police report. During the week of August 26, 2019, they contacted Throckmorton. Police said officers recalled Throckmorton saying Warner “did not care for the police,” and that he wouldn’t allow Warner “to permit a visual inspection of the RV.”Throckmorton disputes that he told police they couldn’t search the vehicle. “I have no memory of that whatsoever,” he told The Tennessean. “I didn’t represent him anymore. He wasn’t an active client. I’m not a criminal defense attorney.”Throckmorton told the newspaper he represented Warner in a civil case several years ago, and that Warner was no longer his client in August 2019. “Somebody, somewhere dropped the ball,” he said.A day after officers visited Warner’s home, the police report and identifying information about Warner were sent to the FBI to check their databases and determine whether Warner had prior military connections, police said.Later that day, the police department said “the FBI reported back that they checked their holdings and found no records on Warner at all.” FBI spokesperson Darrell DeBusk told The Tennessean the agency had conducted a standard agency-to-agency record check.Six days later, “the FBI reported that Department of Defense checks on Warner were all negative,” the police department said.No other information about Warner came to the department or the FBI’s attention after August 2019, police said. “At no time was there any evidence of a crime detected and no additional action was taken,” the statement said. “The ATF also had no information on him.”Warner’s only arrest was for a 1978 marijuana-related charge.The bombing happened on Christmas morning, well before downtown streets were bustling with activity. Police were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Then, for reasons that may never be known, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast. Dozens of buildings were damaged and several people were injured.Investigators have not uncovered a motive for the Christmas day bombing nor was it revealed why Warner had selected the particular location, which damaged an AT&T building and has continued to wreak havoc on cellphone, police and hospital communications in several Southern states as the company worked to restore service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-bomber-s-girlfriend-warned-he-was-building-bombs/story-VSSOzu9HvnfnyXCU3ck72L.html
30-12-2020||World||Turkey, US in talks to discuss sanctions imposed over S-400s||Turkey and the United States have formed a joint working group to discuss sanctions that Washington imposed on its ally over its purchase of an advanced Russian air defense system, Turkey’s foreign minister said Wednesday.In a year-end news conference assessing Turkish foreign policy, Mevlut Cavusoglu also told journalists that Turkey wants “healthier” relations with the United States under President-elect Joe Biden’s administration.The US announced sanctions earlier this month to penalize Turkey over its procurement of Russia’s advanced S-400 system, under a US law known as CAATSA which aims to push back on Russian influence. It was the first time that CAATSA had been used to penalize a US ally.The sanctions target Turkey’s Presidency of Defense Industries, the head of the presidency and three other senior officials. They also include a ban on most export licenses, loans and credits to the agency.Ties between the allies have been plagued by numerous other disputes, including the jailing of American citizens and local consular staff, US support for Syrian Kurdish fighters considered to be terrorists by Turkey and the continued US residence of a Muslim cleric accused of masterminding the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.“In 2020, our ties with the United States were overshadowed by existing problems,” Cavusoglu said. “In 2021, we are prepared to lead our relations with the new administration in a healthier manner and we are prepared to take steps to overcome existing problems.”Cavusoglu said the proposal to set up the Turkish-US working group came from the American side and that experts from both countries had begun negotiations.“Because we support dialogue, we said ‘yes’ to the proposal and the negotiations at the level of experts have started,” he said.Earlier this month, Cavusoglu had said Turkey was considering possible steps to reciprocate against the sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-us-in-talks-to-discuss-sanctions-imposed-over-s-400s/story-c60CuhmMZ0n3fHGo0au2IO.html
30-12-2020||World||First reported US case of virus variant had no history of foreign travel||A Colorado man who became the first reported person in the US to have a Covid-19 variant that is spreading in the United Kingdom hadn’t been travelling, health officials said Monday, triggering a host of questions about how the new strain showed up in the Rockies.Colorado officials were expected to provide more details at a news conference Wednesday about how the man in his 20s from a mostly rural area of rolling plains at the edge of the Denver metro area came down with the variant.For the moment, the variant is likely still rare in the US, but the lack of travel history in the first case means it is spreading, probably seeded by travellers from Britain in November or December, said scientist Trevor Bedford, who studies the spread of Covid-19 at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.“Now I’m worried there will be another spring wave due to the variant,” Bedford said. “It’s a race with the vaccine, but now the virus has just gotten a little bit faster.”The man is in isolation southeast of Denver in Elbert County, state health officials said. Elbert County is a mainly rural area of rolling plains at the far edge of the Denver metro area that includes a portion of Interstate 70, the state’s main east-west highway.Colorado Politics reported there is a second suspected case of the variant in the state according to Dwayne Smith, director of public health for Elbert County. Both of the people were working in the Elbert County community of Simla. Neither of them are residents of that county — expanding the possibility of the variant’s spread throughout the state.Scientists in the UK believe the variant is more contagious than previously identified strains. The vaccines being given now are thought to be effective against the variant, Colorado health officials said in a news release.“Being more transmissible is no good,” Bedford said, adding that the variant will make it harder to rein in the pandemic.It’s not clear exactly why the variant appears to spread faster. It has an unusually large number of genetic changes, or mutations, particularly in areas that affect the Spike protein, according to reports by Public Health England.And the variant has a quirk: It fails to light up one of three targets in PCR testing, which has allowed scientists in Britain to more easily sort out and compare the variant infections with those caused by the regular coronavirus. So far, they’ve found no significant difference in hospitalizations or deaths.Public Health England deserves praise for that work, Bedford said, and the United States will struggle to accomplish anything similar because of the fragmented US health care system.“You’ll have academics and public health in different states doing their own studies,” he said. “I wouldn’t imagine being able to do anything systematically at the national scale.”The Colorado State Laboratory confirmed the virus variant, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified. Governor Jared Polis announced the case Tuesday, adding urgency to efforts to vaccinate Americans.Public health officials are investigating other potential cases and performing contact tracing to determine the spread of the variant throughout the state.“There is a lot we don’t know about this new Covid-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious. The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority, and we will closely monitor this case, as well as all Covid-19 indicators, very closely,” Polis said.The discovery of the new variant led the CDC to issue new rules on Christmas Day for travellers arriving to the US from the UK, requiring they show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.Worry has been growing about the variant since the weekend before Christmas, when Britain’s prime minister said a new strain of the coronavirus seemed to spread more easily than earlier ones and was moving rapidly through England. The nation’s first variant case was identified in southeast England.Dozens of countries barred flights from the UK, and southern England was placed under strict lockdown measures. Scientists say there is reason for concern but the new strains should not cause alarm.Japan announced Monday it would bar entry of all nonresident foreign nationals as a precaution against the new strain.New variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since the virus was first detected in China nearly a year ago. It is common for viruses to undergo minor changes as they reproduce and move through a population. The slight modifications are how scientists track the spread of a virus from one place to another.But if the virus has significant mutations, one concern is that current vaccines might no longer offer the same protections. Although that’s a possibility to watch for over time with the coronavirus, experts say they don’t believe it will be the case with the latest variant.The UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, has also been found in Canada, Italy, India, and the United Arab Emirates.South Africa has also discovered a highly contagious Covid-19 variant that is driving the country’s latest spike of confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The variant, known as 501.V2, is dominant among the newly confirmed infections in South Africa, according to health officials and scientists leading the country’s virus strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-reported-us-case-of-virus-variant-had-no-history-of-foreign-travel/story-JS2PukWKJ79rnFhVAronCL.html
30-12-2020||World||Convicted US spy Pollard arrives in Israel, Netanyahu greets him at airport||Jonathan Pollard, who spent 30 years in US prison for spying for Israel, arrived in Israel early Wednesday with his wife, triumphantly kissing the ground as he disembarked from the aircraft in the culmination of a decades-long affair that had long strained relations between the two close allies.“We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” Pollard said as he was greeted at Israel’s international airport by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli leader jubilantly presented Pollard and his wife Esther with Israeli ID cards, granting them citizenship.“You’re home,” Netanyahu said, reciting a Hebrew blessing of thanks. “What a moment. What a moment.”Pollard arrived on a private plane provided by American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire supporter of both Netanyahu and President Donald Trump.Pollard, 66, and his wife walked slowly down the steps as they exited from the aircraft. Pollard got on his knees and kissed the ground as his wife put her hand on his back with Netanyahu standing by in the darkness. Esther Pollard, who is battling cancer, then kissed the ground and was helped up by her husband.Pollard thanked Netanyahu and the Jewish people for supporting him. “We hope to become productive citizens as soon and as quickly as possible and to get on with our lives here,” he said.After landing, Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, and several lawmakers tweeted congratulations and greetings to the Pollards, who left from the airport for an undisclosed location.Pollard, a civilian intelligence analyst for the US Navy, sold military secrets to Israel while working at the Pentagon in the 1980s. He was arrested in 1985 after trying unsuccessfully to gain asylum at the Israeli Embassy in Washington and pleaded guilty. The espionage affair embarrassed Israel and tarnished its relations with the United States for years.Pollard was given a life sentence and US defense and intelligence officials consistently argued against his release. But after serving 30 years in federal prison, he was released on Nov. 20, 2015, and placed on a five-year parole period that ended in November. That cleared the way for him to leave the US.Pollard’s arrival was first reported by Israel Hayom, a newspaper owned by Adelson. The newspaper published photos of Pollard and his wife, both wearing masks, on what it said was a private plane that arrived early Wednesday from Newark, New Jersey. It said the private flight was necessary due to the medical needs of Esther Pollard. The newspaper’s editor, Boaz Bismuth, called it “the most exciting day” of his four-decade journalism career.Photographs of the plane with the Pollards matched the color scheme of aircraft owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corp., the hotel and casino company owned by Adelson. Flight-tracking data showed a Boeing 737 owned by the company, tail number N108MS, left Newark for Ben-Gurion International Airport outside of Tel Aviv.Effi Lahav, head of an activist group that had campaigned for Pollard’s release from prison, said Pollard’s “arrival was (kept) secret since we realized it’s better to be discreet regarding his arrival.”“We have no interest in defying anyone, for sure not ... the United States,” Lahav told The Associated Press. He called Pollard’s arrival “very moving and very historic” and a moment that his organization “waited for, wished for and prayed for and acted for throughout all these years.”The Ynet website said the couple was in quarantine, which is mandatory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of the coronavirus. The country has barred the arrival of all tourists, but appeared to be welcoming the couple as Israelis.Pollard’s release was the latest in a long line of diplomatic gifts given to Netanyahu by President Donald Trump. His arrival in Israel gives the embattled Netanyahu a welcome boost as he fights for reelection in March 23 parliamentary elections.Netanyahu has been one of Trump’s closest allies on the international stage. Over the past four years, Trump has recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the US Embassy to the holy city. In other departures from traditional US positions, Trump has also recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, said that Israeli West Bank settlements are not illegal and brokered a series of diplomatic agreements between Israel and Arab nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/convicted-us-spy-pollard-arrives-in-israel-netanyahu-greets-him-at-airport/story-1UdHFvpV97sJttu3lTbKjL.html
30-12-2020||World||‘Vaccine for the world’: UK approves use of 2nd Covid-19 drug with easier storage||Britain on Wednesday became the first country to authorize an easy-to-handle Covid-19 vaccine whose developers hope it will become the “vaccine for the world.” The approval and a shift in policy that will speed up rollout of the vaccine in the UK comes as a surge in infections threatens to swamp British hospitals.The Department of Health said it had accepted a recommendation from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to authorize emergency use of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and UK-based drugmaker AstraZeneca.“The rollout will start on Jan. 4 and will really accelerate into the first few weeks of next year,” British Health Secretary Matt Hancock told told Sky News. Britain has bought 100 million doses of the vaccine.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told BBC Radio 4 the company could start shipping the first doses of the vaccine Wednesday or Thursday “and the vaccination will start next week and we will get to 1 million — and beyond that — a week, very rapidly.”Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK have already received a different vaccine, made by US drugmaker Pfizer and German firm BioNTech.Soriot said it was “an important day for millions of people in the UK who will get access to this new vaccine. It has been shown to be effective, well-tolerated, simple to administer and is supplied by AstraZeneca at no profit.”Coronavirus vaccines have typically been given in two doses, with an initial shot followed by a booster about three weeks later.But in a change of approach, the British government said that with the AstraZeneca vaccine it would prioritize giving as many people as possible a single dose, which is believed to give a large measure of protection against the virus. It said people at the highest risk would get priority, and everyone would get a second jab within 12 weeks of the first.The new strategy comes against a backdrop of soaring infections in the UK. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has surpassed the first peak of the outbreak in the spring, with authorities blaming a new, more transmissible variant of the virus, first identified in southeast England, for the spike.Oxford University’s Dr. Andrew Pollard, one of the leaders of the development team, offered hope the newly approved vaccine will help.“At the moment, there’s no evidence that the vaccines won’t work against the new variant,” Pollard told Radio 4. “But that is something which we have to look at. We can’t be complacent about this variant or perhaps future variants.”Partial results from studies in almost 24,000 people in Britain, Brazil and South Africa suggest the shots are safe and about 70% effective for preventing illness from coronavirus infection.That’s not as good as some other vaccine candidates, but Soriot recently told the Sunday Times newspaper that he was confident the vaccine would prove as effective as its rivals.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be relied on in many countries because of its low cost, availability and ease of use. It can be kept in refrigerators rather than the ultra-cold storage some other vaccines require. The company has said it will sell it for $2.50 a dose and plans to make up to 3 billion doses by the end of 2021.“We have a vaccine for the world,” said Pollard.Researchers claim the vaccine protected against disease in 62% of those given two full doses and in 90% of those initially given a half dose because of a manufacturing error. However, the second group included only 2,741 people — too few to be conclusive.Questions also remain about how well the vaccine protects older people. Only 12% of study participants were over 55 and they were enrolled later, so there hasn’t been enough time to see whether they develop infections at a lower rate than those not given the vaccine.Researchers also were criticized for lack of information in September, when studies were suspended because a participant suffered a serious illness. AstraZeneca initially declined to provide further details due to patient confidentiality.Ultimately, the trials resumed after regulators reviewed safety data and decided it was safe to continue. Published partial results show no hospitalizations or severe disease among those who received the vaccine. A separate study testing the AstraZeneca vaccine in the US also is underway.The vaccine will become the second Covid-19 vaccine in use in Britain. On Dec. 2, regulators gave emergency authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Having another vaccine available means that more people can get protection, said Sarah Gilbert, an Oxford scientist involved in the AstraZeneca project. It takes a different approach than the Pfizer-BioNTech one or another developed in the United States from Moderna Inc.The ultra-cold storage those other vaccines need is “very impractical” in developing countries, said Dr. Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications for Britain’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. It means the AstraZeneca one “may reach more parts of the world than the Pfizer one,” he said.Britain’s action likely means the World Health Organization will soon clear the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in a global effort to help poor countries, called COVAX. The initiative, led by WHO and the vaccines alliance GAVI, has secured access to at least 100 million doses of the vaccine, with options and other deals to buy more. But none can be distributed until green-lighted by WHO.The UN health agency does not licence or regulate vaccines itself, but typically evaluates vaccines once they have been approved by an agency such as the UK. regulator or the European Medicines Agency. WHO experts conduct their own evaluation of whether or not the risks of a vaccine outweigh its benefits and then make a recommendation for the shots to be “pre-qualified” so they can be bought by donors for developing countries.Most coronavirus vaccines to be used in poorer countries likely will be made by the Serum Institute of India, which has been contracted by AstraZeneca to make 1 billion doses. In June, the pharmaceutical company announced that the Serum Institute would produce 400 million doses by the end of 2020 but as of early December, only about 50 million doses had been manufactured after production was halted several times.In addition to the Serum Institute, AstraZeneca also has deals with vaccine makers in Brazil, South Africa and China to make the Oxford-developed vaccine for use in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-for-the-world-uk-approves-use-of-2nd-covid-19-drug-with-easier-storage/story-oqzDaCrAVzwv1SFXXmWDAM.html
30-12-2020||World||EU officials formally sign post-Brexit trade deal with UK||The European Union’s top officials on Wednesday formally signed the long fought-over post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel put pen to paper during a brief signature ceremony in Brussels. The documents will now be flown across the Channel to London in a RAF plane for British Prime minister Boris Johnson to sign them.“The agreement that we signed today is the result of months of intense negotiations in which the European Union has displayed an unprecedented level of unity,” Michel said. “It is a fair and balanced agreement that fully protects the fundamental interests of the European Union and creates stability and predictability for citizens and companies”.The UK Parliament will later start debating the agreement setting up new trade rules between the 27-nation bloc and former member Britain. It is set to provisionally enter into force on Jan. 1. The agreement eventually needs approval from Britain’s Parliament, and from the EU’s legislature, which is not expected to take up the deal for weeks.The leaders of the European Parliament’s political groups said they would not seek full approval until March because of the specific and far-reaching implications of the agreement. The overwhelming expectation is that EU lawmakers will approve the deal.The 1,240-page post-Brexit deal was sealed by the EU and the U.K. on Christmas Eve, just a week before the year-end deadline.“On major issues, the European Union stands ready to work shoulder to shoulder with the United Kingdom,” Michel said. “This will be the case on climate change, ahead of the COP 26 in Glasgow, and on the global response to pandemics, in particular with a possible treaty on pandemics. On foreign affairs, we will seek cooperation on specific issues based on shared values and interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-officials-formally-sign-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk/story-7bL7Yxwu55nZjbZfwKiFPO.html
30-12-2020||World||First US Congress member dies of Covid-19||A representative-elect from Louisiana died of Covid-19 Tuesday, the first member of the US Congress to succumb to the disease.Republican Luke Letlow, 41, had been elected to Louisiana’s 5th district and was due to be sworn in on Sunday.Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards announced the news on Twitter with a “heavy heart.”“I am heartbroken that he will not be able to serve our people as a US Representative, but I am even more devastated for his loving family,” he wrote. Edwards said he had ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of Letlow’s funeral.Letlow is survived by his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, and two young children.“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” his family said in a statement to US media. Letlow had announced on December 18 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was quarantining at home. He was hospitalized three days later.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying the lower chamber “sadly mourns” his passing. “Congressman-elect Letlow was a ninth generation Louisianan who fought passionately for his point of view and dedicated his life to public service,” Pelosi said in the statement.“As the House grieves... our sorrow is compounded by the grief of so many other families who have also suffered lives cut short by this terrible virus.”House of Representatives Republican whip Steve Scalise, who also represents Louisiana, tweeted he was “devastated” to hear of Letlow’s death.The US has seen a troubling surge in coronavirus cases in recent months. As of Monday evening, the country had recorded 19,526,228 cases with 337,918 deaths, both by far the worst tolls in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-us-congress-member-dies-of-covid-19/story-vJSe7uSjb8VpqIbrdwcsbO.html
30-12-2020||World||UK Parliament to vote on ‘historic’ Brexit trade deal with EU||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recalled Parliament from its Christmas break on Wednesday to get the Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) struck with the European Union cleared through all parliamentary stages for the EU (Future Relationship) Bill to become law in time for January 1 next year.The 80-page bill, which follows a last-minute deal agreed with the European Union (EU) last week just days before the December 31 deadline of the end of the Brexit transition period, will be debated by members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons followed by the House of Lords.Johnson has urged MPs to back the “historic” bill, which he says is not “a rupture but a resolution” of the UK’s relationship with its European neighbours.“What we sought was not a rupture but a resolution, a resolution of the old and vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which bedevilled our post-War history,” said Johnson, as part of his opening speech in the Commons.“First we stood aloof, then we became a half-hearted, sometimes obstructive member of the EU. Now, with this bill, we shall be a friendly neighbour – the best friend and ally the EU could have – working hand-in-glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws, made by their own elected Parliament. That is the historic resolution delivered by this Bill,” he said.Once the bill is passed by Parliament, the UK-EU trade agreement will come into effect after 2300 GMT on Thursday. The once-rebellious Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party has fallen behind the agreement, paving the way for a relatively smooth passage.Opposition Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer has also instructed his MPs to vote in favour of the deal, arguing the alternative would be a no-deal Brexit.Labour are also planning to seek amendments to the bill that would require the government to provide twice-yearly economic impact assessments of the trading relationship.However, there is some disquiet with Labour ranks as senior backbenchers had called on him to rethink his position and oppose the bill.Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who support Brexit in principle, has said it will not vote in favour of the trade deal due to concerns Northern Ireland remains tied to the EU more closely than the rest of the UK.The Scottish National Party (SNP) and Liberal Democrats have also indicated they will vote against the legislation.However, with Johnson’s comfortable majority in the Commons, the bill is expected to clear the required parliamentary threshold to become law. It marks the culmination of four and a half long years of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-to-vote-on-historic-brexit-trade-deal-with-eu/story-jvCLVlZZNqLR2WvPfbJ2XM.html

Six days later on Christmas Eve, he became sick after working a shift in the Covid-19 unit, the report added. He got the chills and later came down with muscle aches and fatigue.He went to a drive-up hospital testing site and tested positive for Covid-19 the day after Christmas, the report said. Christian Ramers, an infectious disease specialist with Family Health Centers of San Diego, told the ABC News affiliate that this scenario was not unexpected.“We know from the vaccine clinical trials that it’s going to take about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop protection from the vaccine,” Ramers said.“That first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50%, and you need that second dose to get up to 95%,” Ramers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-nurse-tests-positive-a-week-after-receiving-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine/story-lwoEsJfmlD0WRk50FwoEKK.html

We remain grateful for the Pakistani government’s actions to appeal such rulings to ensure that he and his co-defendants are held accountable,” Rosen said on Tuesday. “If, however, those efforts do not succeed, the United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here. We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearl’s abduction and murder,” he added.US State Department had also expressed deep concerns over the Sindh High Court ruling to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl.According to Daily Pakistan, the Sindh High Court also ordered putting the names of accused Ahmed Omer Saeed Shaikh and others in the exit control list (ECL).The accused have been in jail for the last 18 years and ordered the accused to appear as and when the court summons them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-ready-to-try-pak-terrorist-omar-sheikh-in-daniel-pearl-case/story-dgL831MROfcLBHGfNYg1SI.html
30-12-2020||World||Greek nurse erects ICU at home to treat relatives with virus||What does a medical professional do when his wife and in-laws contract the disease at the center of a months-long pandemic?Gabriel Tachtatzoglou, a critical care nurse, did not feel good about the treatment options available in Greece’s second-largest city when his wife, both her parents and her brother came down with COVID-19 in November. Thessaloniki has been among the areas of Greece with the most confirmed coronavirus cases, and hospital intensive care units were filling up.Tachtatzoglou, who had to quarantine and could not go to work once his relatives tested positive for the virus, decided to put his ICU experience to use by looking after them himself.That decision, his family says, probably saved their lives.“If we had gone to the hospital, I don’t know where we would have ended up,” Polychoni Stergiou, the nurse’s 64-year-old mother-in-law, said. “That didn’t happen, thanks to my son-in-law.”Tachtatzoglou set up a makeshift ICU in the downstairs apartment of his family’s two-story home in the village of Agios Athanasios, located about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) from the city. He rented, borrowed and modified the monitors, oxygen delivery machines and other equipment his loved ones might need.He also improvised. Out of a hat stand, he fashioned an IV bag holder. At one point, the repurposed pole supported four bags dispensing antibiotics, fluids to address dehydration and fever-reducing medicine.“I’ve been working in the intensive care ward for 20 years, and I didn’t want to put my in-laws through the psychological strain of separation. Plus, there was already a lot of pressure on the health service,” Tachtatzoglou told the AP in an interview.In most countries, doctors and nurses are discouraged from treating close relatives and friends on the theory that emotional bonds could cloud their judgment and affect their skills. Tachtatzoglou says he remained in daily contact with doctors at Papageorgiou Hospital, the overwhelmed facility where he works, while caring for his sick family members, and that he would have hospitalized any of the four if they needed to be intubated..“I looked after them up until the point where it would pose no danger,” he said. “At all times, I was ready to move them to the hospital, if needed.”Greece, which has a population of 10.7 million, spent the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic with some of the lowest infection rates in Europe. As cold weather set in, the number of confirmed cases and virus-related deaths began doubling. The country’s cumulative death toll in the pandemic went from 393 on Oct. 1 and 635 a month later to 2,517 on Dec.1. As of Tuesday, it stood at 4,730.With ICU wards in Thessaloniki pushed to capacity, COVID-19 patients deemed too sick to a wait for a bed were taken to hospitals in other parts Greeks, riding in torpedo-shaped treatment capsules. Meanwhile, the situation for Tachtatzoglou’s family deteriorated as his wife and in-laws fell ill in alarming succession.Tachtatzoglou said he agonized constantly over whether to transfer his relatives to hospitals in Thessaloniki, knowing it would mean they would not be able to see each other and might get moved to a hospitals farther away.“We were reduced to tears. There were times when I was desperate, and I was really afraid I would lose them,” the nurse said.They all pulled through, although Tachtatzoglou eventually became infected with the virus himself.“I took precautions when I treated them, but I didn’t have the personal protection gear you find in hospitals,” he said. “That’s probably how I got sick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greek-nurse-erects-icu-at-home-to-treat-relatives-with-virus/story-DzNHsP3x4oLCGyURyKB5RJ.html
30-12-2020||World||Argentine Senate approves bill legalizing abortion after marathon 12-hour session||Argentina’s Senate passed a law legalizing abortion early Wednesday after a marathon 12-hour session, a victory for the women’s movement that has been fighting for the right for decades.The vote means that abortion will be legalized in Pope Francis’ homeland up to the 14th week of pregnancy, and also will be legal after that time in cases of rape or danger to the mother’s life. It will have repercussions across a continent where the procedure is largely illegal.The measure was passed with 38 votes in favor, 29 against and one abstention, after a session that began late Tuesday.It was already approved by Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies and has the support of President Alberto Fernández, meaning the Senate vote was its final hurdle.Argentina will be the largest Latin American country to legalize abortion and the vote was being closely watched. With the exceptions of Uruguay, Cuba, Mexico City, Mexico’s Oaxaca state, the Antilles and French Guiana, abortion remains largely illegal across the region.Argentina until now has penalized women and those who help them abort. The only exceptions were cases involving rape or a risk to the health of the mother, and activists complain even these exceptions are not respected in some provinces.Just hours before the Senate session began Tuesday, the pope weighed in, tweeting: “The Son of God was born an outcast, in order to tell us that every outcast is a child of God. He came into the world as each child comes into the world, weak and vulnerable, so that we can learn to accept our weaknesses with tender love.”A previous abortion bill was voted down by Argentine lawmakers in 2018, but this time it was backed by the center-left government. The outcome of the latest vote, however, had still been considered uncertain. That was partly due to the fact that the political parties, including the governing Peronist movement, gave their legislators freedom to vote as they chose. Two of the 72 senators were absent, and 43 of the remaining 70 senators were men.Outside the Senate, pro- and anti-abortion activists gathered, with the bill’s supporters wearing the color green that represents their pro-abortion movement.Argentina’s feminist movement has been demanding legal abortion for more than 30 years and activists say the bill’s approval could mark a watershed in Latin America, where the Roman Catholic Church’s influence has long dominated.“Our country is a country of many contradictions,” said Ester Albarello, a psychiatrist with a network of health professionals that supports the bill, who was among the demonstrators outside the congressional building. “It is the only one in the world that brought members of its genocidal military dictatorship to justice with all the guarantees. But we still don’t have legal abortion. Why? Because the church is together with the state.”Also outside the legislature, a group that calls its members “defenders of the two lives” set up an altar with a crucifix under a blue tent. Dressed in a white smock and light-blue face mask, teacher Adriana Broni said that even if the abortion law won approval, “I will not teach that it is a right to kill, murder, a baby who has no voice.”Supporters said the bill seeks to eradicate the clandestine abortions that have caused more than 3,000 deaths in the country since 1983, according to figures from authorities.In addition to allowing abortion within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, the legislation also will establish that even after that period, a pregnancy can be legally terminated if it was the result of rape or if the person’s life or integral health was in danger.It will allow conscientious refusal to participate in an abortion for health professionals and private medical institutions at which all doctors are against the procedure. But they will be required to refer the woman to another medical center. Conscientious objection also could not be claimed if a pregnant woman’s life or health was in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentine-senate-approves-bill-legalizing-abortion-after-marathon-12-hour-session/story-PZt5TyWkxManVd0juy9vKM.html
30-12-2020||World||North Korea prepares for major party congress amid growing challenges||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will convene a rare congress of the ruling party in early January, where he will seek to rally public support and outline new long-term economic and political goals in the face of unprecedented challenges.Kim chaired a politburo meeting on Tuesday to prepare for the congress, state media reported, without specifying an exact date for its start.As 2020 ends, the young North Korean leader is faced with compounding crises caused by international sanctions, natural disasters, and a self-imposed border lockdown aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak.While North Korea’s nuclear arsenal has grown, Kim’s high-stakes personal outreach to US President Donald Trump ended with no sanctions relief, and the incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden has said it won’t ease sanctions without more concessions.With Biden’s policy toward North Korea still in flux, Kim is more likely to use the congress to focus on domestic issues, particularly the ailing economy and North Korea’s “juche” ideology of self-reliance, analysts said.“Juche is truly being tested for the first time because the pandemic has forced North Korea into self isolation, when until now, it has been able to rely on China as a life support even during the harshest of economic times,” said Duyeon Kim, a North Korea expert at the US-based Center for a New American Security.North Korea has not reported any coronavirus cases, but the economy took a further hit when the country closed its borders to nearly all traffic, sending publicly reported trade with China tumbling by 75%.Economic controlsThe circumstances facing North Korea now are decidedly different from the last party congress in 2016, when Kim unveiled the first 5-year economic plan since 1980.With few options for solving the country’s spiralling problems, Kim’s government may roll back some economic and political reforms allowed in the earlier years, analysts said.“North Korea’s political and economic policies may become more conservative, given the prolonged difficulties and the likelihood of their continuation into 2021, and consequently the regime’s perceived need to reinforce control to ensure national stability,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent researcher and former open-source North Korea analyst for the US government.Already the government has imposed foreign exchange controls on diplomats, cracked down on currency traders, and markets have been more closely tied to centres of political authority, according to NK Pro, a website that tracks North Korea.While smugglers, who could help alleviate the worst consequences of the border closure, have been accused of anti-state actions, it said.In an unusually emotional speech in October, Kim apologised for failing to deliver on his economic promises, but also struck a defiant tone, vowing to crack down on officials accused of corruption or of failing the people, as well as doubling down on his programme of expanding the nuclear deterrent.In October, Kim called on his country to embark on an 80-day campaign to achieve its goals in every economic sector before the congress in January.Domestic focusThe politburo meeting on Tuesday approved agendas and proposals to be presented at the congress, state news agency KCNA reported.“All the preparations for the Party Congress are going off smoothly,” state news agency KCNA reported.Commercial satellite imagery has shown formations of people in downtown Pyongyang in recent days, possibly practicing for parades or other public events related to the congress, according to 38 North, a US think tank.Analysts will be watching for major leadership shuffles, which could provide clues to Kim’s plans for the future.The 2016 congress saw Kim officially elected to the position of chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party, and this gathering will likely be used to further cement his rule.Kim may offer some kind of olive branch to South Korea after saying in October that he hoped the two countries could repair relations after the coronavirus pandemic.But Kim may not break his silence on the stalled talks with the United States or the new Biden administration, Lee said.“He will probably want to maintain some flexibility until the Biden administration’s North Korea policy takes shape,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-prepares-for-major-party-congress-amid-growing-challenges/story-tK7YwhAiWNDOOAAn4jmUPJ.html
30-12-2020||World||Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine 79% effective, seeks approval in China||A vaccine developed by a unit of China National Biotec Group (CNBG) is 79.34% effective at protecting people from Covid-19 and the company is seeking regulatory approval for general public use in China, the developer said on Wednesday.The efficacy rate, based on interim analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials, is lower than 86% rate for the same vaccine announced by the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 9, based on preliminary data from trials there.A company spokeswoman declined to explain the discrepancy and said detailed results would be released later, without giving a timeline.There have been fragmentary releases of efficacy data for Chinese vaccine makers’ Covid-19 candidates, which are being considered by many developing countries for mass inoculation campaigns.Health experts warn that the differing results could undermine confidence in vaccines.Turkish researchers said on Thursday their interim results from a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech showed 91.25% efficacy only to see a confusing readout the same day from Brazil, which said the vaccine’s efficacy was between 50% and 90%.While the efficacy of the China-developed shots trails the more than 90% success rate of rival vaccines from Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc , it points to progress China has made in the global race to develop successful Covid-19 vaccines.China, whose President Xi Jinping has pledged to make its vaccines a global public good, has won several large supply deals with countries including Indonesia and Brazil - the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America respectively.But none of the Chinese drug makers have yet to release detailed efficacy data.The CNBG vaccine is among the five most advanced candidates from China in terms of development and has been used in its emergency use programme that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people since July.The CNBG unit, called Beijing Biological Products Institute, said in a statement that it had applied to the National Medical Products Administration for conditional approval of the vaccine.It did not give details such as the number of infections in the trial, what, if any, side effects it identified, how many volunteers were given the vaccine or a placebo.CNBG, a subsidiary of state-backed China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), has another vaccine in late-stage trials and both have been approved for emergency use in China even as studies have not been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinopharm-s-covid-19-vaccine-79-effective-seeks-approval-in-china/story-jvYGbaaCGl96CJXcG4VbhN.html
30-12-2020||World||US ranks 43rd in genome sequencing of virus samples to detect UK-like variants, shows data||The United States, the country worst affected by the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has not been proactive in sequencing cases to check for genetic changes, according to a global database on coronavirus genomes.The GISAID Initiative said that the United States ranks abysmally low - at 43rd spot. The report released last week said that of the more than 18 million cases, only 51,212 (or 0.3 per cent) have been genetically analysed for variants.The sequencing can help in detecting the spread of the virus, as well as understand if a particular variant has arrived in the country. The UK, according to its health authorities, was able to sequence 7.4 per cent of its documented cases which led to detection of the new strain in mid-December.On the top of the sequencing list are Australia which has sequenced 58.6 per cent of its cases, the highest worldwide, according to GISAID Initiative database. New Zealand, Taiwan, Denmark and Iceland are the other countries on top of the list.The United States has recorded its first case of the new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which many experts were already warning about.The Colorado man, who emerged as the first reported person in the US to have a Covid-19 variant that is spreading in the United Kingdom hadn’t been travelling, health officials said on Monday. This triggered a host of questions about how the new strain showed up in the Rockies.Colorado officials are expected to provide more details at a news conference on Wednesday about how the man in his 20s from a mostly rural area of rolling plains at the edge of the Denver metro area came down with the variant.India, meanwhile, sequenced over 4,000 genomes of the coronavirus and submitted to GISAID, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekhar Mande said last week.The CSIR’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad have alone done sequencing of over 2,200 genome sequences of coronavirus in India.The cases of new strain have also been reported in India - six on Tuesday and 14 today which took the total number of infected people to 20. The Union health ministry has said that all these people have been isolated separately, in different wards to check the spread of B117 variant.The variant has also been found in Canada, Italy and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ranks-43rd-in-genome-sequencing-of-virus-samples-to-detect-uk-like-variants-shows-data/story-PlKPTUFSZJMTTMh1d5pg1J.html

It’s the second coronavirus injection to be cleared for emergency use in UK after Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s in early December.The ruling will help the UK ramp up vaccination and provides vindication for the homegrown shot, which has faced questions about discrepancies in its clinical-trial results. The government has invested more in the product than in any other vaccine, buying 100 million doses. The shot can be deployed swiftly because it’s is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech one, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing.A first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will be given to as many people as possible, followed by a second dose within 12 weeks. A government advisory group said the priority should be to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible rather than completing a two-dose regimen right away.The approval comes as the UK seals its divorce from the European Union with a trade deal and tightens lockdowns. Coronavirus cases are surging in the country, with a new strain raising concern globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astra-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-gains-first-clearance-with-uk-nod/story-lkYXQL0tSWRVKL9EVrCpVO.html
30-12-2020||World||Chinese government controlling all research into origins of coronavirus, promoting fringe theories||Deep in the lush valleys of southern China lies the entrance to a mine shaft that once harboured bats with the closest known relative to Covid-19.The area is of intense interest because it may hold clues to the origins of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1.7 million people worldwide, but has become a black hole of no information because of political sensitivity. A bat research team that visited recently had their samples confiscated, two people familiar with the matter said. And a team of Associated Press journalists was tailed by plainclothes police in multiple cars who blocked access to sites in late November.More than a year since the first known person was infected with the coronavirus, an AP investigation shows the Chinese government is strictly controlling all research into its origins while promoting fringe theories that the pandemic originated elsewhere.The government is monitoring scientists’ findings and mandating that the publication of any research first be approved by a new task force managed by China’s cabinet under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by The AP. A rare leak from within the government, the dozens of pages of unpublished documents confirm what many have long suspected: The clampdown comes from the top.The AP’s investigation was based on interviews with Chinese and foreign scientists and officials, along with public notices, leaked emails and the unpublished documents from China’s State Council and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It reveals a pattern of government secrecy and top-down control that has been evident throughout the pandemic.“They only select people they can trust, those that they can control,” said an expert who works with the China CDC, declining to be identified out of a fear of retribution.China’s foreign ministry said in a fax that “the novel coronavirus has been discovered in many parts of the world” and research should be carried out “on a global scale.”China’s leaders aren’t alone in politicizing research into how the pandemic started. In April, President Donald Trump shelved a US funded project to identify dangerous animal diseases across Asia. Research into Covid-19’s origins is critical to preventing future epidemics, and the move severed ties between Chinese and US scientists. Although the World Health Organization says it will send a team to China in January to investigate, its members and agenda had to be approved by China.The probe into how the coronavirus first emerged started in the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, a sprawling complex where many of the first human cases were detected.In mid-December last year, Huanan vendor Jiang Dafa noticed people were falling ill, including a worker who helped clean carcasses at a stall who later died.At first, the Chinese CDC moved swiftly.On Jan. 1, the market was ordered shut, barring vendors from fetching their belongings, Jiang said. Internal China CDC data shows that by Jan. 10, researchers were sequencing environmental samples.In late January and early February, as the virus spread rapidly, Chinese scientists published a burst of research papers on Covid-19. Then one paper proposed without concrete evidence that the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan laboratory near the market. It was later retracted, but it raised the need for image control.An internal notice from a China CDC lab issued on February 24 put in new approval processes to standardize publication under “important instructions” from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Other notices ordered CDC staff not to share any data, specimens or other information related to the coronavirus with outside institutions or individuals.In early March, China’s cabinet, the State Council, centralized all Covid-19 publication under a special task force. The notice, obtained by the AP and marked “not to be made public,” was sweeping in scope, applying to all universities, companies and medical and research institutions. It said communication and publication of research had to be orchestrated like “a game of chess” under instructions from Xi and guided by propaganda and public opinion teams.The order went on to warn that those who publish without permission, “causing serious adverse social impact, shall be held accountable.”After the secret orders, the tide of research papers slowed to a trickle. Though the China CDC returned to collect some 2,000 samples from the market over the following months, nothing was published.On May 25, China CDC chief George Gao said no animal samples from the market had tested positive, ruling it out as the source.With the market proving a dead end, scientist turned their attention to hunting for the virus at its likely source: bats.Nearly a thousand miles away from Wuhan, bats inhabit a maze of underground limestone caves in Yunnan province. The coronavirus’ genetic code is strikingly similar to bat coronaviruses, and scientists suspect Covid-19 jumped into humans from a bat or an intermediary animal.Chinese scientists quickly started testing animals suspected of carrying the coronavirus. Records show scientist Xia Xueshan received a 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant to screen animals in Yunnan for Covid-19. In February, his team took samples from animals including bats, snakes, bamboo rats, and porcupines.But the government restrictions soon kicked in; data on the samples has not been released.Today, the caves in Yunnan home to the closest viral relative of the coronavirus are under close watch. Security agents tailed the AP team in three locations and stopped journalists from visiting the cave where researchers identified the bats responsible for SARS.Chinese state media has instead aggressively promoted theories suggesting the virus originated elsewhere, such as via frozen seafood, a hypothesis WHO and others have dismissed.The government is also limiting and controlling the search for the first human cases through the re-testing of flu samples.Hundreds of Chinese hospitals collect samples from patients with flu-like symptoms, storing them for years. The samples could easily be tested again for Covid-19, although politics could determine whether the results are made public, said Ray Yip, the founding director of the China CDC.Researchers in the US, Italy, France and elsewhere have already combed through some of their archived samples to identify the earliest cases of Covid-19 in late 2019. But in China, scientists have only published retrospective data from two Wuhan flu surveillance hospitals, out of at least 18 in Hubei province and more than 500 across the country.The little information that has trickled out suggests Covid-19 was circulating beyond Wuhan in 2019, a finding that could raise awkward questions for Chinese officials about their early handling of the outbreak.Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance said identifying the pandemic’s source should not be used to assign guilt.“We’re all part of this together,” he said. “Until we realize that, we’re never going to get rid of this problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-government-controlling-all-research-into-origins-of-coronavirus-promoting-fringe-theories/story-THsyufjEtWbaKY2ukorkCM.html
30-12-2020||World||China’s Mission Nepal suffers a huge setback. PM Oli didn’t play ball||The Chinese delegation deputed by President Xi Jinping to unite the faction-ridden ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) wrapped up its four-day visit on Wednesday, unable to deliver on its objective or even forge an alternative alliance led by the communists for national elections scheduled for next year, people familiar with the development said.Guo Yezhou, a vice-minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China’s central committee, who led a four-member core team of communist party leaders, boarded a flight out of Kathmandu’s airport on Wednesday morning after meetings with Nepal Communist Party leaders including Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli; and his two prime rivals within, former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda and Madhav Nepal, over the last few days.PM Oli had responded to a barrage of attacks from the faction led by Prachanda and Madhav Nepal by dissolving the House of Representatives on December 20 and recommending fresh elections. He later explained in a televised address that his decision was a pre-emptive strike against his rivals who were going to bring a no-trust motion against him in Parliament.ALSO WATCH | ‘Pakistan has become pawn of China due to CPEC’: IAF Chief RKS Bhadauria PM Oli’s move has set the stage for a formal split of the ruling NCP that was formed in 2018 by the merger of PM Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre. The 2018 merger was facilitated by China’s Guo Yezhou.Back in Nepal 34 months after the February 2018 visit that is credited to have helped build the foundation for the NCP, Nepal watchers said Guo Yezhou worked on several options to retain the dominance of the communist parties in Nepal’s politics during his four-day visit that ended Wednesday.The first was to convince PM Oli to rescind the recommendation to dissolve the 275-member House of Representatives on an assurance from the NCP’s Prachanda-Madhav Nepal faction to let him continue. But PM Oli didn’t agree because there was no guarantee that the Prachanda-Madhav Nepal faction would try to pull down his government and come to power. PM Oli is, however, learnt to have told the Guo Yezhou-led delegation that fresh elections were the only solution to the stalemate between the two sides. Prachanda and Nepal hadn’t agreed to give any commitment to the Chinese team either, demanding that PM Oli should reverse the order to dissolve parliament first.Guo Yezhou’s team also explored the possibility of mobilising an alternative government led by the communist party - but minus PM Oli - in case the dissolution is reversed by the five-judge bench of the Supreme Court. In this format, the team looked at the possibility of getting the Prachanda-Madhav Nepal support from opposition parties such as Janata Samajbadi Party boss Baburam Bhattarai and even Sher Bahadur Deuba’s Nepali Congress. This alternative fits well with the narrative being pushed by the opposition parties that pointedly targets PM Oli, and not the Prachanda-Madhav Nepal faction.The top court is hearing more than a dozen petitions that have challenged parliament’s dissolution on grounds that there was no provision in the constitution to dissolve the house if any party or alliance could mobilise the majority.In their conversations with both factions of the NCP, the Chinese team are also learnt to have floated the possibility of PM Oli and Prachanda factions papering over their differences to jointly contest the national elections scheduled to be held in two phases on April 30 and May 10 and let the electoral verdict decide who leads the next government. PM Oli, however, rejected this formulation right away.Guo Yezhou’s mission in Nepal also reached out to the next generation of Nepal Communist Party leaders from both camps to get them to nudge their seniors to keep the party united.

30-12-2020||World||Russian investigators open new fraud probe involving Navalny||Russian authorities have ramped up the pressure on top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny by leveling new fraud accusations against him.The Investigative Committee, Russia’s main investigative agency, said on Tuesday it has opened a new criminal case against Navalny on charges of large-scale fraud related to his alleged mishandling of some USD 5 million in private donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation and other organisations.Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany after an August poisoning with a nerve agent that he blamed on the Kremlin, ridiculed the new accusations as a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agitation.“It looks like Putin is in hysterics,” Navalny commented on Twitter.Navalny fell sick on Aug 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and two days later was flown still in a coma for treatment to Berlin, where he spent weeks in intensive care. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Navalny has accused Putin of ordering his poisoning. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the accusation.“They are trying to put me behind bars for failing to die and continuing to hunt for my killers and for proving that Putin was behind it,” Navalny tweeted.News of the investigation involving Navalny came a day after the country’s prison agency accused him of violating the conditions of his suspended sentence in a previous case and gave him one day to report to its office. In the decade since he started writing about official corruption in Russia and moved into running for political office, Navalny, 44, has been arrested repeatedly and faced various charges.The Federal Penitentiary Service pointed at an article by doctors from Berlin’s Charite hospital that was published in medical journal The Lancet and indicated that Navalny has fully recuperated. It ordered Navalny to visit its office in line with the terms of a 3 1/2-year suspended sentence he received for a 2014 conviction or face a real jail term if he misses Tuesday’s deadline.Navalny, who previously said that he planned to return to Russia once he fully recovered, scoffed at the demand, saying that the Federal Penitentiary Service’s reference to the article in The Lancet amounted to the government accepting he was poisoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-investigators-open-new-fraud-probe-involving-navalny/story-PPPP3GqUzlLua8hEPOx0uK.html

Amid this, a number of countries have commenced vaccination drives against the pandemic, with mostly the Pfizer-BioNTech SE or the Moderna vaccine being administered. Some countries, in fact, are using both.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSeveral countries are on the verge of approving a vaccine while others are still conducting trials or awaiting trial results. Here are some latest updates with regards to the Covid-19 vaccine drives or the vaccine development front:1. Singapore on Wednesday became the first Asian country to begin a vaccination drive for its healthcare workers, who were administered the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine. More healthcare institutions will follow in the coming weeks while senior citizens will start receiving vaccine shots from February.2. Ireland on Tuesday commenced vaccinations, with a 79-year-old woman becoming the first Irish citizen to receive a Covid-19 vaccine shot. Like most other countries, Ireland, too, has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine. Incidentally, on Tuesday, the country reported its highest single-day virus count of 1,546.3. Mexico’s deputy health minister on Tuesday said that China’s CanSino Biologics Inc will submit the trial results of its Covid-19 vaccine to the Mexican authorities next week. Mexico is among the countries where vaccinations kicked off, with more than 18,500 healthcare workers having received vaccine shots since last week, when the immunisation drive started.4. Russia has applied for phase 3 trials of its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, the world’s third worst-hit country, the South American country’s health regulator, Anvisa, announced on Tuesday. Anvisa further said that it would review the request within 72 hours.5. Iran on Tuesday started its first study of the safety and effectiveness of a Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine is the first in Iran to reach human trials stage and has been developed by Shifa Pharmed, a part of the state-owned pharmaceutical, Barekat.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccination-singapore-ireland-commence-immunisation-drives/story-xgpAXdTFC89WnOLbAscqcI.html
30-12-2020||World||Joe Biden criticizes pace of vaccine rollout, vows to accelerate||President-elect Joe Biden criticized the Trump administration Tuesday for the pace of distributing Covid-19 vaccines and predicted that “things will get worse before they get better” when it comes to the pandemic.“We need to be honest — the next few weeks and months are going to be very tough, very tough for our nation. Maybe the toughest during this entire pandemic,” Biden said during remarks in Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday.His comments come as the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 336,000 Americans, with experts warning holiday travel and gatherings could precipitate yet another spike in virus cases even as the virus has already been surging in states nationwide.Biden encouraged Americans to “steel our spines” for challenges to come and predicted that “things are going to get worse before they get better.”He also went after the Trump administration over its vaccination efforts, warning that the project, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, is moving at a slower pace than needed.“As I long feared and warned the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should,” he said.Earlier this month, Trump administration officials said they planned to have 20 million doses of the vaccine distributed by the end of the year. But according to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control, just over 11.4 million doses have been distributed and only 2.1 million people have received their first dose.At the current pace, Biden said, “it’s gonna take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people.”President Donald Trump deflected Biden’s critique. “It is up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government,” he tweeted Tuesday. “We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states.”White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement late Tuesday saying, “While partisan critics offer nothing but empty rhetoric to frighten Americans for political ends, President Trump delivers results.”Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, said he has directed his team to prepare a “much more aggressive effort, with more federal involvement and leadership, to get things back on track.”The president-elect said he would “move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction.”He set a goal of administering 100 million shots of the vaccine within his first 100 days in office, but said to accomplish that, the pace of vaccinations would have to increase five to six times to 1 million shots a day. Even with that pace, however, Biden acknowledged it “will still take months to have the majority of Americans vaccinated.”Biden acknowledged one of his challenges will be public skepticism over the safety of a vaccine, and has already been working to alleviate public concerns. Biden received his first dose of the vaccine on live television last week, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received hers, also on television, on Tuesday.The president-elect has made combating the coronavirus pandemic a central focus of his transition work. He has pledged that one of his first acts as president will be to release a comprehensive coronavirus aid bill to Congress that will include funding for expanded vaccinations and testing, among other things.He also has a Covid-19 task force working on ways to better streamline the government response to the pandemic and help turn the tide of infections. On Tuesday, Biden announced nine new members of his Covid-19 response team, including aides focused on vaccinations, testing and supply chain management.Still, Biden warned that it would take months after he’s in office for Americans to see positive change in the course of the virus.“Turning this around is going to take time. We might not see improvement until we’re well into March, as it will take time for our Covid response plan to produce visible progress,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-criticizes-pace-of-vaccine-rollout-vows-to-accelerate/story-ZINBXMgDfGOJiolxrtqjKL.html
30-12-2020||World||Sydney tightens Covid-19 curbs ahead of New Year’s Eve||Australian authorities restricted movement and tightened curbs on gatherings in Sydney on Wednesday, hoping to avoid a coronavirus “super spreader” event during the city’s New Year’s Eve celebrations, after detecting a new cluster of cases.Household gatherings were limited to just five people while the maximum number of people allowed to gather in public was capped at 30. Residential care facilities were closed to visitors.“We don’t want New Year’s Eve to be the cause of a super-spreader,” New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said as she announced the restrictions would take effect from midnight on Wednesday “until further notice”.Berejiklian reported 18 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the biggest daily increase in a week, with just half part of an outbreak in the city’s northern beaches that has grown to more than 100 people over the past week.NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said a new cluster in the city’s inner west, which includes six members of an extended family living in three different households, is expected to grow as members had joined Christmas gatherings.The outbreaks in Sydney have dampened the city’s New Year’s Eve harbour fireworks display, an event televised around the world.In addition to the new restrictions, authorities have imposed a “green zone” in key vantage spots around the harbour that will be restricted to residents and people with confirmed hospitality bookings who apply for and receive a permit.The usual 9 p.m. fireworks have been cancelled and the annual midnight session has been cut to seven minutes.“If I can stress again, the strongest message to everybody across New South Wales no matter where you are, is please limit your activity and your mobility,” Berejiklian said.Australia has reported just over 28,300 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-tightens-covid-19-curbs-ahead-of-new-year-s-eve/story-RAfDL8QiLSPvfrxTOzZk5L.html
30-12-2020||World||China struggles to get the world to trust its vaccines||Of all the developing countries testing China’s Covid-19 vaccines, few are friendlier to Beijing than Pakistan. In the years leading up to the pandemic, China financed nearly $70 billion across the South Asian nation on roads, railways and power stations, and Pakistan now has two Chinese clinical trials underway, with even senior government officials being inoculated.Yet interviews with people in Karachi, the nation’s biggest city -- as well as in other developing nations from Indonesia to Brazil, together with surveys and official comments -- show that China has failed to assure the millions of people who may have to rely on its vaccines.“I won’t take it,” said Farman Ali Shah, a motorcycle driver in Karachi for local ride-hailing app Bykea, as local shops closed early ahead of an 8 p.m. virus-induced curfew. “I don’t trust it.”That mistrust, and the reliance of dozens of poorer nations on China to inoculate their populations could set the stage for a major global political headache if citizens offered the Chinese vaccine feel they are being given an inferior product.China’s vaccines were meant to score a clear diplomatic win for Beijing, shoring up ties with dozens of poorer nations amid an anticipated shortage of Western-developed shots. But there has been little information about how the Chinese versions have fared in final-stage clinical trials, with just the United Arab Emirates and China itself endorsing the vaccines for emergency use so far. Meanwhile, some U.S. and European companies have published data on the safety and efficacy of their shots and started to deploy them.That uncertainty presents another roadblock in China’s efforts to extend its political influence across Asia, Africa and South America. Through its seven-year-old Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing spent billions on loans and projects and cultivated local elites to buttress its political and economic power -- efforts that have often backfired because of poor management and heavy-handed implementation. The mistrust was compounded by China’s exports early in the pandemic of subpar tests and personal protective equipment.“China has a great opportunity to do vaccine diplomacy and distribute a life-saving product,” said Jorge Guajardo, a senior director for McLarty Associates, who was Mexico’s ambassador to China for six years. “In my experience, every time they’ve engaged in diplomacy, they screw it up -- they manage to upset the countries on the receiving end of their aid.”Missteps could undermine President Xi Jinping’s claims that China’s ruling Communist Party has handled the virus better than western democracies. China, which saw the first known cases of Covid-19 a year ago, used its authoritarian system to virtually eliminate the virus, mass testing millions of people when cases emerged, shutting its borders and locking down parts of the country to snuff out infections. That approach has seen China’s economy begin to recover even as countries such as the U.S. and U.K. struggle to control outbreaks.Bolstered by its virus success, Beijing sparred with the U.S., U.K. and Australia over everything from the origins of the virus to crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. The pain of the pandemic also hardened the stance of the U.S. and China in wider economic disputes, including American efforts to stop countries from adopting the next-generation communications technology of China’s Huawei Technologies Co.“The key thing I am looking out for is if they come in with offers for a vaccine in exchange for a countries’ commitment to using Huawei 5G telecommunication lines, or to allowing China to invest in key sectors,” said Guajardo. “Given that they have a history of this behavior, it wouldn’t surprise me if they did it again.”China has made a global effort to reassure governments and populations about the efficacy and safety of its vaccines. In October, a group of ambassadors and diplomats representing 50 African countries toured a Sinopharm Group Co. facility amid a publicity blitz touting China’s promise to deliver vaccines to Africa. “When the coronavirus vaccine completes research and is put into use, we are willing to prioritize benefiting African countries,” said Liu Jingzhen, chairman of Sinopharm.In response to questions from Bloomberg, China’s Foreign Ministry said Chinese companies developing vaccines strictly comply with the law and clinical trials in the first two phases showed the shots were safe and effective. The Chinese government has administered more than one million emergency vaccine doses since July, it said, and “we have haven’t found any serious adverse reactions.”Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a tweet on Monday that Chinese-made vaccines may be the “only choice” for governments that haven’t secured supplies since “wealthy countries” had booked three quarters of the estimated 12 billion vaccines set for production next year. He separately told a briefing that the inactive Chinese vaccines can be distributed more widely than others using existing cold chain systems, and China would provide them to developing countries “on a priority basis including by donation and free aid.”“We should stand against seeking self-interest at the expense of others or hoarding or monopolizing supplies,” Zhao said in Beijing. “In particular, we must reject vaccine nationalism.”On China’s side is mathematics. The challenge of manufacturing, distributing and administering billions of doses means many developing nations may have little choice but to use Chinese vaccines for at least part of their populations. Many don’t have enough facilities to store Pfizer Inc.’s shot, which needs to be stored at -70 degree Celsius.China has also agreed to supply its vaccine to Covax, a World Health Organization-backed effort to provide a coronavirus vaccine to developing nations. AstraZeneca Plc, the other main Covax partner, is still waiting to gain approval. Britain’s drug regulator could clear its shot for use as early as this week,  according to a person familiar with the matter.Ironically, Chinese vaccine makers were initially at the forefront of the research, but China’s rapid control of the contagion left them scrambling to find places to carry out the vital third-stage clinical trials as U.S. rivals leapt ahead. Chinese companies now have third-phase trials running in at least 16 nations, with state-backed China National Biotec Group Co. testing from Argentina to Morocco; Sinovac Biotech Ltd. enlisting Brazil, Turkey and the Philippines among others; and CanSino Biologics Inc. testing in Pakistan, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Authorities at Brazil’s Butantan Institute, which is helping conduct clinical trials for the Sinovac vaccine, said on Dec. 23 the shot was more than 50% effective, meeting a minimum standard set by U.S. regulators for emergency authorization of Covid vaccines. It did not provide details, citing Sinovac’s request to reconcile data across different trials. The Brazil trial is Sinovac’s biggest so far with some 13,000 participants. A trial in Turkey indicated the vaccine is more than 91 percent effective, though it’s considered inconclusive as it was calculated from only 29 cases, compared with the 170 found in Brazil. Vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna Inc. have produced results well over 90%.“In a country where the Chinese vaccine is the only one available, you either accept it or not,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. “But when you have choices between different vaccines, people are rational. They’re certainly going to choose Western-made vaccines because they’re the No. 1 choice, the data is already available, and they’re safe. China, so far, they haven’t had any systematic data available.”CNBG and CanSino didn’t respond to Bloomberg’s requests for comment. A spokesman at Sinovac referred to recent press conferences in Beijing where health officials said the inactivated shots undergoing phase III trials and approved for emergency use have been found to be safe, with only mild side effects, and that there is a mechanism in place to follow up with those who get the shots. A Sinovac spokesman separately said the company could only disclose efficacy data after they are reviewed by Chinese regulators.Few places have seen the issue become more politicized than Brazil, South America’s largest economy and the third-most infected country after the U.S. and India.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, known as the “Trump of the Tropics,” has repeatedly attacked “Made in China” vaccines, even as political opponent Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo, endorsed the Brazilian-Chinese effort by Sinovac and the Butantan Institute.“We won’t buy it from China, it’s my decision,” Bolsonaro said in a radio interview in October. “It’s a matter of credibility -- there are other vaccines that are more trustworthy.”The government later backtracked on his statement. On Dec. 21, Doria said Sao Paulo would receive 5.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine within days.Still, a survey by polling institute Datafolha earlier in the month showed that half of Brazilians wouldn’t take the Sinovac-Butantan shot, the highest refusal rate among all the vaccines. Some 36% of respondents said they’d also reject a Russian vaccine, while 23% said they wouldn’t take a U.S. shot.The politics and public concern translate into hard economics for China’s drugmakers. When Brazil’s Health Ministry delivered a national immunization plan to the Supreme Court, it included a total of 300 million doses from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Covax, according to the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. Sinovac’s vaccine wasn’t mentioned.“Our regulatory agency is going to evaluate the data for efficacy and safety, but this needs to be well communicated to the population,” said Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist and founder of Instituto Questão de Ciência, a Brazilian non-profit that promotes science in policy making. “It’s quite a challenge to do so when the president and the federal government are the ones raising issues about the vaccine being made in China.”China may also be overestimating its ability to simultaneously vaccinate its own 1.4 billion population and meet the demand of hundreds of millions more in populous developing nations, said Huang at the Council on Foreign Relations, who has testified before U.S. congressional committees. CNBG said it is capable of making 1 billion doses of its inactivated vaccines, while Sinovac can produce 600 million doses, based on existing facilities and ones set to be completed soon. CanSino said it could make 200-300 million doses of its viral vector vaccines.If Chinese vaccines aren’t available, developing nations will turn to other suppliers “and China will lose leverage,” Huang said. “We’re not just talking about the economic loss -- diplomatic and strategic gains will also will be undermined.”For the more than 6 billion people who live in developing nations, access to a vaccine soon could help reverse the devastating economic impact, particularly for the poor and those in the informal economy. Some national leaders are trying to reassure citizens about getting inoculated.“I will be vaccinated first,” Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in a statement in mid-December. “This is to give people the trust and confidence that the vaccine we use is safe.” Indonesia has ordered 125.5 million doses from Sinovac, as well as 30 million from Maryland-based Novavax Inc. and is developing 57.6 million of its own shots. It’s also seeking doses from Covax, AstraZeneca and Pfizer.Read how Indonesia became a testing ground for China’s vaccinesSheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai, received the Sinopharm vaccine on Nov. 3. “We wish everyone safety and great health, and we are proud of our teams who have worked relentlessly to make the vaccine available in the UAE,” he wrote on Twitter alongside a photo of him receiving the vaccine.Such official endorsements may be enough to persuade some people to accept any inoculation if it receives approval.“I would be glad to receive a vaccine, regardless of whether it’s Chinese-made or otherwise, so long as it’s proven to be safe, effective and to have no long-term side effects,” said Francis Chung, a 29-year old finance manager who works for a Malaysian plantation company. “It should also be endorsed by the relevant authorities.”But many others remain skeptical. A survey in Kenya reinforced the concern that not all vaccines are equal. Africa-focused polling company TIFA Research found that respondents were least likely to take vaccines made in China and Russia, preferring vaccines from the U.K. or U.S.If global leaders fail to persuade their citizens that all the vaccines they approve for use are equally safe, they could face a backlash among those who believe they are being given a second-rate option. Even in Hong Kong, where China has expanded its grip on power this year, leader Carrie Lam reversed course on Dec. 23 and said residents can choose whether to take the Pfizer, Sinovac or AstraZeneca vaccines.“Transparency is needed in order to support more general public acceptance of the Covid-19 vaccines,” said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong. “Absent such data, it is all too easy to see a two-tier perception of vaccines emerging.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-struggles-to-get-the-world-to-trust-its-vaccines/story-xcFrneFEqscHBvSKH1gvrO.html
30-12-2020||World||Minneapolis officials outline new police disciplinary plan||Minneapolis’ mayor and police chief on Tuesday announced changes in the city’s disciplinary processes for police officers in an effort to make it easier to hold them accountable for bad behavior.Mayor Jacob Frey and Chief Medaria Arradondo, in their latest initiative to change department practices in the wake of George Floyd’s death, said the city attorney’s office would be more deeply involved in misconduct investigations as soon as they begin, helping to guide them and to analyze evidence.Frey said more than 50 percent of all disciplinary cases are either reduced or overturned, with arbitrators typically citing due process concerns such as faulty investigation. He called that unacceptable.“We want to take every reason that stems from City Hall for overturning a disciplinary decision off the table,” Frey said.The city attorney’s office will also offer the chief legal advice on disciplinary decisions, and work with the department’s training unit to make sure it is “fostering a culture of accountability and professionalism.”Tracy Fussy, the city’s mitigation manager, said the new initiative should cut through some of the bureaucracy by having “someone consistently birddog the process” and by putting the emphasis on the quality, rather than speed, of an investigation.“When misconduct goes unchecked, everybody suffers,” Fussy said. “So let’s stop that.”Minneapolis police have come under heavy pressure to reform since Floyd’s death in May, after an officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes, ignoring his cries of distress. The officer, Derek Chauvin, and three others on the scene were fired and charged in Floyd’s death, with trial scheduled in March.Critics said Floyd’s death was just one more instance of brutality in a department long unable to change its culture. Activists have attacked a system that rarely disciplines problem officers. Chauvin had 17 complaints against him and had been disciplined only once.A Minneapolis Star Tribune analysis the month after Floyd’s death found that statewide, more than 80 police officers had fought their firings in arbitration over the past 20 years, and about half got their jobs back. The newspaper’s analysis of decisions by the state’s mediation office included 10 cases involving Minneapolis police officers, with eight of them getting their jobs back.In the months since Floyd’s death, the city has struggled over how to reshape the department, with an unsuccessful push by several City Council members to do away with it entirely in favor of a new public safety unit.Frey and Arradondo, who opposed that move, have launched several initiatives since Floyd’s death. Those including limiting the use of so-called no-knock warrants, revising use-of-force policies and requiring officers to report on their attempts to de-escalate situations.Michelle Gross, of Communities United Against Police Brutality, was skeptical that the newest change would make much difference. She suggested the city’s need to minimize exposure to civil litigation over an officer’s actions would be a strong disincentive to the city attorney’s office in investing an allegation of misconduct.“A lot’s going to depend on whether they can figure out their conflicting roles,” she said.City Attorney Jim Rowader rejected that, saying his office “has a fidelity to truth and to the integrity of our institutions, not to individual officers.”The head of the city’s police union didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The city is in the midst of negotiating a new contract with the union. Arradondo announced in June that the city was pausing negotiations for a review of ways the deal could be restructured to give more flexibility, including on how discipline is handled.Frey declined Tuesday to give an update on where those negotiations stand. The city this month announced an agreement with an outside law firm, Jones Day, for free assistance that could include involvement in the negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-officials-outline-new-police-disciplinary-plan/story-FW9XLv1CHHGUIvkkrdij3L.html
30-12-2020||World||Trump campaign asks US Supreme Court to take Wisconsin case||President Donald Trump’s campaign asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to take its failed lawsuit challenging election results in swing state Wisconsin.Trump lost the state to Democrat Joe Biden by about 21,000 votes. The president’s campaign filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court seeking to disqualify more than 221,000 ballots in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the state’s two most heavily Democratic counties.Trump wanted to disqualify absentee ballots cast early and in-person, saying there wasn’t a proper written request made for the ballots; absentee ballots cast by people who claimed “indefinitely confined” status; absentee ballots collected by poll workers at Madison parks; and absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on ballot envelopes.The state Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit, ruling 4-3 that Trump’s challenge to voters who were indefinitely confined was without merit and that the other claims came too late.Trump’s campaign is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to declare that Wisconsin’s election failed and allow the Republican-controlled Legislature to appoint the state’s electors.Trump and his allies have suffered dozens of defeats in Wisconsin and across the country in lawsuits that rely on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud and election abuse. He asked the U.S. Supreme Court last week to reverse a trio of Pennsylvania Supreme Court rulings dealing with mail-in ballots and allow the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pick its own slate of electors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-asks-us-supreme-court-to-take-wisconsin-case/story-LjcotLOqsP3fKGqcot7ebL.html
30-12-2020||World||Hong Kong teen jailed for China flag insult||A Hong Kong teenager was ordered to spend four months in prison on Tuesday for insulting China’s national flag and unlawful assembly as Beijing increasingly targets prominent activists from the financial hub. Tony Chung, a 19-year-old who led a now-disbanded pro-democracy group, was convicted earlier this month for throwing the Chinese flag to the ground during scuffles outside Hong Kong’s legislature in May 2019.While serving his sentence, Chung will be waiting for trial over a charge of “secession”, which could land him life imprisonment according to the draconian national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong on 30 June. Chung is the first public political figure prosecuted under the new security law, which Beijing described as a “sword” to return “order and stability” to the financial hub after seven months of massive, often violent pro-democracy protests last year.He was sentenced to three months each for insulting the national flag and unlawful assembly, and told to serve four months behind bars.The teen is also facing separate charges of money laundering and conspiring to publish seditious content.Chung was arrested by plainclothes police opposite the US consulate in late October and had been remanded in custody since.Speculation has swirled that the authorities moved on Chung because he was hoping to ask for asylum at the US consulate in Hong Kong.CrackdownAn increasing number of pro-democracy activists across the political spectrum have fled Hong Kong since Beijing stepped up its crackdown on the city’s protests against China’s authoritarian rule.Under the security law, dissenting speech instead of acts can be alleged of vague yet severe offences like “subversion” and “collusion with foreign forces”. The law has also toppled the legal firewall between Hong Kong’s internationally recognised common law judiciary and the opaque, Party-controlled justice system in mainland China by allowing extradition of suspects across the border for trial. Last Sunday, China’s state TV CGTN reported that Hong Kong police had put 30 people who are not currently in Hong Kong on its wanted list for suspicion of breaching the national security law, including self-exiled activists Ted Hui and Baggio Leung.Prominent activists remain in Hong Kong have either been -- jailed like Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow -- or face frequent arrests and multiple charges.Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy media mogul who is also charged with the national security law, has been placed under house arrest and stripped of public speech -- his Twitter account included -- as Hong Kong’s High Court granted him bail last week. The decision, however, provoked serious criticism from China, which threatened to extradite Lai to the mainland for trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-teen-jailed-for-china-flag-insult/story-WLs1EbARruaG9W2wKmEryL.html

Several petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court against the prime minister’s action.“We are protesting the unconstitutional move by the prime minister and we will continue to protest until Parliament is reinstated,” said Laxman Lamsal, a regional assembly member.President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved Parliament on Dec. 20 on the recommendation of the prime minister and announced new elections will be held on April 30 and May 10, 2021.Oli became prime minister after his Nepal Communist Party won elections three years ago. Oli’s party and the party of former Maoist rebels had merged to form a unified Communist party.Tensions, however, have grown between Oli and the leader of the former rebels, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also co-chair of the party. The two had previously agreed that they would split the five-year prime minister’s term between them, but Oli has refused to allow Dahal to take over.The opposition has also accused Oli’s government of corruption and his administration has faced criticism over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Oli also has been accused of moving closer to China and drifting away from Nepal’s traditional partner, India, since taking power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-demand-ouster-of-nepal-leader-as-party-feud-grows/story-O3yAcSii3vy4pPyON7JmKI.html
30-12-2020||World||Russia opens new fraud probe involving Alexei Navalny||Russian authorities on Tuesday ramped up the pressure on top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny by leveling new fraud accusations against him.The Investigative Committee, Russia’s main investigative agency, said it has opened a new criminal case against Navalny on charges of large-scale fraud related to his alleged mishandling of some $5 million in private donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation and other organizations.Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany after an August poisoning with a nerve agent that he blamed on the Kremlin, ridiculed the new accusations as a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s despair.“It looks like Putin is in hysterics,” Navalny commented on Twitter.Navalny fell sick on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and two days later was flown still in a coma for treatment to Berlin, where he spent weeks in intensive care. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Navalny has accused Putin of ordering his poisoning. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the accusation.“They are trying to put me behind bars for failing to die and continuing to hunt for my killers and for proving that Putin was behind it,” Navalny tweeted. “He’s a thief who is ready to kill those who refuse to keep silent about his thievery.”News of the investigation involving Navalny came a day after the country’s prison agency accused him of violating the conditions of his suspended sentence in a previous case and gave him one day to report to its office. In the decade since he started writing about official corruption in Russia and moved into running for political office, Navalny, 44, has been arrested repeatedly and faced various charges.The Federal Penitentiary Service pointed at an article by doctors from Berlin’s Charite hospital that was published in medical journal The Lancet and indicated that Navalny has fully recuperated. It ordered Navalny to visit its office in line with the terms of a 3 1/2-year suspended sentence he received for a 2014 conviction or face a real jail term if he misses Tuesday’s deadline.Navalny, who previously said that he planned to return to Russia once he fully recovered, scoffed at the demand, saying that the Federal Penitentiary Service’s reference to the article in The Lancet amounted to the government accepting he was poisoned.Russian authorities have insisted that doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no trace of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. They refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing the lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.The European Union imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute after tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded that Navalny had been exposed to Novichok. Russia has hit back with its own sanctions against EU officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-opens-new-fraud-probe-involving-alexei-navalny/story-i1UiB1IdHpOlLMKRAvGG7J.html
30-12-2020||World||Mitch McConnell rebuffs Trump, Democrats by blocking $2,000 aid checks||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked an attempt by Democrats to force quick action increasing direct stimulus payments to $2,000 as President Donald Trump warned that failing to act now amounted to a “death wish” by Republicans.McConnell objected to a motion by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to approve by unanimous consent a stimulus-checks bill that passed the House on Monday. He also blocked a motion by Senator Bernie Sanders to vote on the stimulus checks immediately after the Senate votes on overriding Trump’s veto of a key defense policy bill.Floor requests to immediately pass legislation are frequently criticized as stunts, but this episode highlights how unlikely it is that the Senate will pass a bill increasing the payments before Congress adjourns Sunday.McConnell said the Senate will consider higher stimulus checks in conjunction with two other Trump complaints unrelated to the pandemic relief bill he signed into law: an investigation into alleged election fraud and reworking a law that shields technology companies from liability for user content.“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” McConnell said, without explaining when or if a vote will happen.But Trump wasn’t satisfied. In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, Trump said the GOP should pass the bigger stimulus payments “ASAP.” He also said they should deal with his other demands on the election and tech companies.Despite the push by Trump, spending $464 billion on higher stimulus checks has divided Republicans, some of whom are increasingly focused on the burgeoning national debt. Only 44 Republicans joined 231 Democrats on Monday to pass a bill increasing the payments to $2,000. In the Senate, just a handful of Republicans are now publicly on board, including Florida’s Marco Rubio and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.Armed Service Chairman Jim Inhofe said he would likely vote against $2,000 checks because of deficit concerns.“I’d have a hard time supporting that” he said. “It’s such a huge number.”Political impactThe GOP tension comes at a crucial time for Republicans who are fighting to maintain control of the Senate in a pair of Georgia runoff elections on Jan. 5. On Tuesday, both GOP incumbents in those races, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, also came out in favor of the $2,000 checks.McConnell has several options to tackle the direct-payment conundrum Trump put him in. With the Schumer attempt blocked, McConnell could point out that there is not agreement to process the House bill on the floor by the time the current session of Congress ends on Jan. 3.That approach could risk a backlash from Trump and his supporters, however. McConnell also could promise to work on the matter in the next Congress that starts next week.Kicking the can down the road leaves McConnell with another problem, with Sanders, an independent who causes with Democrats, saying he will delay any attempt to override Trump’s veto of a separate defense bill this week unless there is a vote on stimulus checks.Another option would be for McConnell to present his own bill, combining higher stimulus checks with other the two other issues that Trump wants addressed.But combining those elements into a package would poison a stimulus-checks bill for many Democrats. It would likely fail if brought to a vote.Sanders said he didn’t know what McConnell has in mind but the majority leader shouldn’t complicate a bill by adding Trump’s other demands.“The House passed, to their credit, a simple straightforward bill,” Sanders said in a brief interview Tuesday. “Let’s not muddy the waters. Are you for $2000 or not? Let’s not talk about so-called voter fraud or abortion or anything else.”Sanders’s demand for a vote on higher stimulus payments led him to block a separate Senate effort on Wednesday to unanimously override Trump’s veto of this year’s defense policy bill. That veto override, which was approved by the House Monday, will go through the full Senate process to get a vote before Sunday.Democratic openingDemocrats, for their part, are relishing the political turmoil for the GOP and hoping it will give them a chance to flip the Senate to help enact President-elect Joe Biden’s far-reaching agenda.“The House and the President are in agreement: we must deliver $2,000 checks to American families struggling this Holiday Season,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a tweet, calling on the Senate to pass the higher payments.Although Biden on Monday said he supports the $2,000 payments, it is unclear if he will prioritize them in his stimulus proposal to Congress after the Jan. 20 inauguration if Congress fails to pass them before then.The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget estimates that the bigger payments would raise disposable income in the first quarter to as much as 25% above pre-pandemic levels. The legislation would produce an additional 1.5% in GDP output, but not all of the growth would occur in 2021, according to Marc Goldwein, an economist who co-authored the CRFB projections.But many Republicans had opposed stimulus payments larger than the $600 in the existing law, in part over concerns about the price tag. Bumping the payments to $2,000 would cost roughly $463.8 billion, according to estimates by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-rebuffs-trump-democrats-by-blocking-2-000-aid-checks/story-6pGfQJS10HoloZeHzpbGIN.html
30-12-2020||World||Joe Biden blames Trump for slow vaccine rollout, pledges faster pace||President-elect Joe Biden slammed the slow roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine by President Donald Trump’s administration Tuesday, saying the plan was falling “far behind” where it needs to be.“As I long feared and warned, the effort to distribute the vaccine is not progressing as it should,” he said. “If it continues to move as it is now, it’s going to take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people.”Biden listed his plans to speed the massive vaccination project, what he called one of the biggest operational challenges in decades.Biden said he would invoke the Defense Production Act soon after taking office to help ramp up vaccine production and repeated his vow to distribute 100 million doses of the vaccine in his first 100 days in office, meaning 1 million shots every day.More than 2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US since the process began on Dec. 14, according to a nationwide tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- far fewer than the 20 million the Trump administration promised would be administered by the end of the year.“I’m going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction,” he said. “The Biden-Harris administration will spare no effort to make sure people get vaccinated.”Biden spoke after getting a briefing from his coronavirus advisory team. Among other steps he listed were a massive education campaign to increase trust in the vaccines, particularly among minority communities that haven’t always been “treated with honesty and dignity” throughout US history. He also warned Congress that it will have to appropriate tens of billions of dollars more than the $900 billion bill it just passed to fund his plans to increase testing and other steps.Earlier Tuesday, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he’s concerned that January virus levels in the US may be worse than December’s after many Americans traveled for the holidays. The US has seen over 19.3 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 335,000 deaths.“We certainly are not at the numbers that we wanted to be at the end of December,” Fauci said of the rate of vaccination on CNN. “Even if you undercount, 2 million as an undercount, how much undercount could it be? So we are below where we want to be.”The army general running the US vaccine-distribution effort said earlier this month that a lag between when shots are produced and when they are cleared for shipment led to widespread confusion over how many doses states will receive.Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operations officer for Operation Warp Speed, said the US would allocate 20 million doses of the vaccines by the end of December, though some may be delivered in the first week of January.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris went to a low-income, largely African-American part of the District of Columbia on Tuesday to get her vaccine as part of the incoming administration’s effort to boost trust of the shots.“That was easy,” she joked. “I barely felt it.” Her husband, Doug Emhoff, was also getting the shot at the United Medical Center.“I trust the scientists,” Harris told reporters who accompanied her. “I urge everyone, when it is your turn, get vaccinated.” She said she chose that medical center so people living in minority communities knew they could get the vaccine from people who worked “in the hospital where your children were born, or where an elderly relative got medical treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-blames-trump-for-slow-vaccine-rollout-pledges-faster-pace/story-kuKFCc9i1wPYofIlVNhAXJ.html
30-12-2020||World||‘Covid-19 wake-up call’: WHO warns future pandemics to be far deadlier||Pandemics far deadlier than Covid-19 are likely in future, warned the World Health Organization (WHO), as more countries detected new strains of the deadly coronavirus. “This is a wake-up call,” WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan told reporters. “This pandemic... has spread around the world extremely quickly and it has affected every corner of this planet, but this is not necessarily the big one. We need to get ready for something that may even be more severe in the future.”Japan and Australia on Tuesday reported their first cases of a mutant of the virus originally found in South Africa, while Pakistan joined countries detecting the strain from Britain. UAE reported cases of a new strain, without specifying its origin. The UK variant has been in Germany since November, health officials there said on Tuesday, after detecting it in a patient who died in the north of the country.Surging cases forced Rio de Janeiro - one of Brazil’s worst-hit cities - to block access to beaches on December 31 to prevent large crowds from celebrating New Year’s Eve. Officials in the Thai capital of Bangkok announced new restrictions, including the closure of some entertainment facilities during the New Year’s holiday, as infections continued to rise following a recent coronavirus outbreak. South Africa banned alcohol sales and made masks mandatory in public from Tuesday after a surge in cases. Russia has said that its Covid-19 death toll was more than thrice the number reported previously, making it the country with the third-highest fatalities. The Rosstat statistics agency said the deaths recorded between January and November had risen by 229,700 compared to the previous year. “More than 81% of this increase in mortality over this period is due to Covid-19,” said deputy PM Tatiana Golikova, meaning that over 186,000 Russians have died from the coronavirus disease.The UK reported a record 53,135 new cases on Tuesday. More people are now hospitalised with Covid-19 in England than at the first peak of the outbreak in the spring. Belarus and Argentina began their vaccinations with shots of Russia’s Sputnik V, while Iran began the first phase of human clinical trials of a locally developed vaccine. The US on Tuesday began vaccinating its troops stationed in South Korea, which reported its worst daily death toll of 40 from the virus. US vice-president-elect Kamala Harris received the vaccine on Tuesday.The EU on Tuesday demanded that China release citizen journalist Zhang Zhan and several other jailed reporters, lawyers and human rights activists. Zhang was jailed on Monday for four years over her coverage of the early stages of the outbreak in the original epicentre of Wuhan.China reported 15 new locally transmitted cases on Tuesday, seven of them in Beijing. All of the capital’s new infections were close contacts of previous cases in the most recent flare-up. Two of the confirmed patients are drivers for ride-hailing apps, raising the risk that the cluster - which now stands at 17 - could continue to grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-wake-up-call-who-warns-future-pandemics-to-far-deadlier/story-4utd4KrG5IRzJXkLX5T27L.html
30-12-2020||World||Boeing’s 737 Max returns to US skies with American Air after 21 months||Boeing Co.’s 737 Max has returned to commercial service in the US, with the first flight since two deadly crashes prompted the longest aircraft grounding in the nation’s history.An American Airlines Group Inc. 737 Max 8 departed Miami at 10:40 a.m. Tuesday on the first leg of a round trip journey to New York’s LaGuardia Airport. American’s president, Robert Isom, is planning to be on both flights. US regulators lifted the flying ban last month after ordering extensive revisions to the plane’s flight-control computer and other changes.For Boeing, the Max’s return is the keystone of the company’s efforts to restore a balance sheet battered by the grounding and the coronavirus pandemic. The Max accounts for about 80% of Boeing’s backlog of aircraft orders and represents the company’s only offering in the crucial single-aisle market, in which the US planemaker trails Airbus SE.American said it hasn’t seen signs that customers are trying to avoid the Max. The carrier has scheduled 588 Max flights in January, according to data compiled by Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.“Bookings on the Max are comparable to other aircraft, and we aren’t seeing data to suggest customers don’t want to fly the aircraft,” Sarah Jantz, a spokeswoman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier, said in an email.The aircraft returned to commercial service earlier this month when Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA began operating regular domestic flights with the Max. The airline had operated 516 Max flights through Monday, while Grupo Aeromexico SAB flew 73, according to Cirium.Last week, a Max flown by Air Canada on a test flight experienced engine issues that forced the crew to make an emergency landing in Tucson, Arizona, Aviation24.be reported.Southwest Airlines Co., the Max’s largest customer, plans to fly the model next year, as do United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc.The Max was grounded in March 2019. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-s-737-max-returns-to-us-skies-with-american-air-after-21-months/story-qxoMSQjWbmiM3lRnztpiDL.html

Speaking to the media on Wednesday evening, Sawant said that “the Goa government is not interested in going ahead with this proposal”. “The Indian Institute of Integrative medicine, a premier Government of India agency, had sent us a proposal... We had sent it for examination to different departments. It does not mean we are going for cannabis cultivation,” Sawant said.The proposal was vetted by the Goa law department, with law minister Nilesh Cabral saying that he was in favour of legalising cannabis for medicinal purposes only. On Tuesday, while the proposal received the vocal support of a section of the ministers in the Goa government, Sawant appeared ambiguous claiming that “just because the file has moved, it didn’t mean a decision has been taken.”Also read: Bars, restaurants to restrict entry, limited parking at Connaught PlaceThe opposition Goa Forward Party had hit out at the government for what it said was the promotion of Goa as a ‘vices hub.’“How will they handle the law and order crisis that will consequently emerge from the legalisation of cannabis cultivation, who will be the watchdog to ensure that it is for medicinal purpose only? And if the watchdog himself starts accepting bribes to allow it to be pilfered and the young generation gets access to it, the future generations will get access just so that they can fill their pockets,” Sardesai had said.No sooner Sawant announced that the government was not interested in pursuing the proposal, Sardesai claimed victory. The proposal was expected to meet with resistance from within the cabinet leaving hopes of it making it to the Goa Legislative Assembly slim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-interested-goa-cm-scuttles-proposal-to-allow-cannabis-cultivation/story-dEj7HKMDQwtJPep99HSgmL.html
30-12-2020||India||Ex-PM told Major about coalition conundrum||London: The short-lived United Front government of the 1990s was under considerable strain, struggling to manage a coalition of 13 diverse partners, and then Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and finance minister P. Chidambaram did not always see “eye to eye,” according to a confidential document just released by the UK’s National Archives.Deve Gowda told then Prime Minister John Major during the latter’s week-long visit in January 1997.that Chidambaram was “very good” in the world of finance, but was not inclined to prioritise the problems of rural India, says the document.A three-page account of discussions between Major and Deve Gowda while flying from Kolkata to Bengaluru was one of the documents released by the National Archives. No officials were present on either side ; the only other person who was present when the discussion took place was Major’s wife Norma.A spokesperson for Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (Secular) said the then Prime Minister had said nothing negative about Chidambaram, and “it is a fact that governments and finance ministers in India had not been very focussed on rural India.” “So our leader just pointed out that and tried to focus on rural India during his short stint in power,” added the spokesperson T A Sharavana, an ex-member of the legislative councilHT reached out to Chidambaram but received no response. Described as a “virtually unprecedented degree of access”, the note based on details reported by Major and written by John Holmes in Downing Street to Fiona Mylchreest in the Foreign Office says that Deve Gowda “went out of his way to speak frankly to the Prime Minister, for example about internal difficulties”.Deve Gowda at the time was heading an uneasy 13-party United Front government after the 1996 election threw up a fractured verdict. Chidambaram had resigned from the Congress in 1996 and joined the Tamil Maanila Congress, which was part of the coalition.Deve Gowda told Major during the 150-minute flight that there were “significant strains” within the coalition, explaining how difficult and constraining it was to manage 13 parties, and added that he and Chidambaram “did not see eye to eye” in some areas.According to the note, “He (Deve Gowda) told the Prime Minister…Chidambaram was very good but his skills lay in the world of finance and big city life. He was not inclined to give sufficient priority to the problems of rural India”.He “went on to say that he was very concerned about the future of rural India, and in particular about Indian agriculture…It was clear to the Prime Minister that the way to Deve Gowda’s heart was through extra help for agriculture, for example training, new techniques and assistance of any kind”.Deve Gowda, who was prime minister between June 1996 and April 1997, went on to make two political claims that were later proved wrong. The note says that he believed at the time that the Congress had been “permanently fractured” and that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was “unelectable”.The note says: “Deve Gowda began with the Indian political scene…He believed that the Congress Party was now permanently fractured and that in the post-dynastic era of Indian politics (he was particularly scathing about the dynasty phenomenon) they could not regroup. The Party was too corrupt and their time had passed. Meanwhile the BJP was unelectable”.The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance went on to win two successive elections in 2004 and 2009, while the BJP similarly won in 2014 and 2019. The declassified note suggests that Deve Gowda developed a rapport with Major, who faced a general election back home in May 1997.At a reception in Bengaluru, the note says: “{Deve} Gowda surprised everyone by calling for silence as the Prime Minister was leaving and saying that he was sure everyone present shared his desire to see the Prime Minister win the election (greeted by a round of applause).” Major’s Conservative party lost the election to Labour led by Tony Blair.The note adds: “The Prime Minister believes that he has established an excellent personal relationship with {Deve} Gowda, who pressed him and Mrs Major to return to India whenever they wanted, preferably soon”.“It was noteworthy that Gowda not only came to the reception in Bangalore, but also insisted on coming to see the Prime Minister off, although Indian protocol had insisted beforehand that he could not possibly do either of these things.Janata Dal (Secular) spokesperson said Deve Gowda had been “prescient if what is happening in the Congress today is any indication,” and his assessment then that the BJP was unelectable was in the context of the circumstances prevailing then, adding: “Politics is not stagnant water but keeps changing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-pm-told-major-about-coalition-conundrum/story-z9CPJDvGGx4E6ASGvGnufJ.html

Pooja Pawaria, 27, and Rohit Dhankar, 25, both residents of Rohtak, were killed in a daylight attack near the Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU). The man’s brother, Mohit, suffered bullet injuries and is undergoing treatment at a government hospital.Deputy superintendent of police Sajan Singh said the woman’s uncle Kuldeep Singh, his son Kapil Kumar and three others were arrested on the basis of a complaint of the man’s father. They were booked under sections 302 (murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 of the Arms Act. “We are interrogating the accused. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of hate crime. We are looking into all angles,” Singh added. A police official said Pooja, an orphan, was raised by her uncle, who is a property dealer. She was a divorcee and had been staying in Rohtak for several many months, he added, requesting anonymity. DSP Singh said the uncle called the Rohit’s relatives to the court for marriage. “Later, he asked the groom’s relatives to come near MDU as they wanted to hold some discussion before the marriage. When they reached near MDU, Kuldeep opened fire at Mohit’s car,” he said. “Kuldeep’s son and his aides pumped bullets into Pooja, who was in a different car, killing her on the spot,” added the DSP. Rohit and his brother were rushed to the hospital by an auto-driver, a witness to the incident, the police said. The police retrieved CCTV footage of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-couple-shot-dead-before-court-marriage/story-RAGo3X4cDDCub3WMnXmGeI.html
30-12-2020||India||Possible that Covid-19 UK strain entered India before, says AIIMS director||As at least 20 cases of the new UK strain of Covid-19 have been detected so far in India, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria on Wednesday said there might be some possibility that the UK strain was there in India before, during November-December as the strain was in the UK in September and there were people who got infected at that time. “It’s a possibility that UK strain may have entered India in November/early December. But if you look at it epidemiologically, this strain leads to an increase in infections. But if you look at our data for last 4-6 weeks, there was no spike in cases,” Dr Guleria told ANI.Assuring that India is well-placed to combat even if there is an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases due to this new strain, the AIIMS director said India’s recovery rate is very high. So far — whenever the strain has entered India — it has not affected India’s number of cases or hospitalisation significantly, he said. Acknowledging that the new strain is more dangerous as it is believed to be more infectious, Dr Guleria said there is need to be extra careful now to make sure that it does not impact India in a big way. The government had launched the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), comprising 10 labs, in the wake of the new strain of the coronavirus being detected in the UK. The department of biotechnology on Wednesday said a high-level inter-ministerial committee will guide INSACOG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/possible-that-covid-19-uk-strain-entered-india-before-says-aiims-director-randeep-guleria/story-zbHcEoduYOcgguXkJ0ZoLM.html

30-12-2020||India||We are the minor partners in TN, says BJP as AIADMK rules out power sharing||Three days after the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) snubbed its ally Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) saying that there will be no power-sharing and that Edappadi Palaniswami will be its chief ministerial candidate in the assembly election, the saffron party on Wednesday acknowledged that the Dravidian party is the big brother in the alliance.Referring to the chief ministerial candidate, the BJP’s national secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge CT Ravi initially said that the NDA coordination committee will take a call on the CM before conceding that the decision would be of the majority party (AIADMK) in the alliance.“Across India BJP leads the NDA but in Tamil Nadu, it is the AIADMK and we are the minor partners. Obviously, they (AIADMK) will take the decisions including the chief minister candidate,” Ravi said. “Officially, the NDA coordination committee will announce it.” BJP leaders have underlined that announcing chief minister candidate is a matter of procedure which has been made into a controversy. “From our party’s side, only national (BJP) president J P Nadda can make political announcements,” said a senior BJP state leader not wishing to be named. Nadda’s visit to Chennai has been postponed since he contracted Covid-19 earlier this month. “But the situation may change after elections depending on our performance,” the BJP leader said.The BJP is expecting to negotiate between 40-50 seats out of the 234 assembly constituencies in the state. In its alliance with the AIADMK for last year’s Lok Sabha elections, BJP contested in five out of the 39 parliamentary seats but drew a blank. The BJP which has no MLA or MP from the state, will also negotiate for cabinet positions but a source said that they were flexible on that aspect. Ravi, however, said that they will take a decision on ministerial positions after the election results.Earlier in the day, Ravi had tweeted that the NDA would announce the chief minister candidate after elections. But in the next tweet, he clarified that the chief minister will be from the largest partner. A majority of BJP and AIADMK leaders see Ravi’s statement as ironing out differences that arose in the past few months over this issue. “We were upset but there seems to be better understanding now,” said a senior AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity. “Cadres from the lower rung up to the top leadership have now accepted our alliance with the BJP. But, of course, a section of us are aware that Tamil Nadu people are not in favour of the BJP and we can win even without them. But some ministers think we may lose without the BJP.” The alliance which was formed ahead of last year’s Lok Sabha elections has seen posturing from both sides on various issues. After Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016, the BJP made its way through a weakened AIADMK. The ruling state government has supported the Centre’s schemes such as the three new farm bills, CAA and triple talaq. But recently the AIADMK has also asserted itself by rallying for the state like bringing in 7.5% reservation to government school students who clear The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and opposing the three-language formula in the National Education Policy. Their ties are also influenced by external factors such as actor Rajinikanth’s exit from politics and VK Sasikala’s imminent release from prison in January. “There seems to be internal tensions but both AIADMK and BJP have no other option but to remain in the alliance,” said S Anandhi, political commentator and professor at Madras Institute of Development Studies. “We will know in the coming days on who calls the shots during seat sharing and agreeing on the chief ministerial candidate.”There was unease within the AIADMK camp which had made significant announcements on Palaniswami’s candidature and continuing the alliance which the BJP had neither countered nor reciprocated until now. It annoyed the AIADMK when several BJP state leaders continued to make statements that the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu will be their choice and there could be a coalition government -- which they have now stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-the-minor-partners-in-tn-says-bjp-as-aiadmk-rules-out-power-sharing/story-SDr6GDGA0c8qvDDBFncniM.html

30-12-2020||India||China cautions against use of ‘Tibet card’, says it will damage bilateral ties||Against the backdrop of US President signing into law measures to bolster the right of Tibetans to choose the next Dalai Lama, Beijing on Wednesday cautioned that any move to play the “Tibet card” to meddle in its internal affairs would further damage India-China relations.The Chinese embassy in New Delhi outlined Beijing’s position on the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020, signed into law by Trump on Monday, in a response to what it said were reports in the Indian media supporting the US legislation and “advocating Indian interference in China’s Tibet (Xizang) affairs”.The unusually blunt statement from the Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong called for “an objective and fair stance” on the “highly sensitive nature” of Tibet-related issues and China’s territorial integrity.“We hope some Indian media take an objective and fair stance on issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, grasp the highly sensitive nature of Xizang-related issues, look at Xizang’s economic and social progress objectively, do more to help China-India bilateral relations move forward instead of advocating playing ‘Tibet card’ to meddle in China’s internal affairs and further damage the bilateral relations,” Ji said.There was no immediate reaction to the statement from Indian officials.Also read: Nitish Kumar trashes RJD’s claims of defections from JD (U), says party is unitedThe development comes amid the nearly eight-month military standoff between Indian and Chinese troops on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has taken bilateral relations between the two countries to an all-time low. The two sides haven’t been able to agree on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the LAC despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. Ji noted that under the “Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation” signed by India and China in 2003, New Delhi recognised Tibet Autonomous Region as part of Chinese territory, and didn’t allow Tibetans to engage in political activities against China. “It is in the fundamental interests of China and India... to enhance political mutual trust, properly manage differences, and strive to return China-India relations to the track of healthy and stable development,” Ji said.The Tibetan Policy and Support Act, which was passed by the US Congress earlier this month, strengthens US support for Tibet, including by sanctioning Chinese officials if they try to appoint the next Dalai Lama.The Chinese government usually refers to the current Dalai Lama, who has lived in India since he escaped from Tibet in 1959, as a “separatist” or “splittist”. China has also bristled at visits by the Dalai Lama to areas such as Arunachal Pradesh, which it claims.Also read: 6th round of talks ends positively, says minister; next meeting on Jan 4Chinese officials have said the next Dalai Lama will be chosen within Tibet in compliance with Chinese laws and regulations and through a process that will have to be ratified by authorities in Beijing. They have also said that the current Dalai Lama and India cannot have any role in this process.The Chinese embassy spokesperson contended the US legislation “maliciously distorts [Tibet’s] social development, makes groundless accusations, denigrates China’s ethnic and religious policies, and interferes in the normal reincarnation procedure of living Buddhas under the pretext of human rights and religion”. She further contended that the “real purpose of the act is to undermine Xizang’s prosperity and stability” and that the legislation “grossly interferes in China’s internal affairs and gravely violates the fundamental principles of international laws”. The spokesperson claimed Tibet “has been part of China since ancient times” and its affairs are “purely China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference”. Tibet-related issues are “not about ethnicity, religion or human rights, but an important matter of principle concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, and the Chinese government is “determined in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests”, she said. “China firmly opposes any country, organisation or individual supporting the anti-China separatist activities of the ‘Tibetan independence’ forces in any form and under any pretext,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-cautions-against-use-of-tibet-card-says-it-will-damage-bilateral-ties/story-1yIPOF5uoFUS0CTRvLuuTP.html

30-12-2020||India||‘Won’t withdraw protest’: Farmers stick to resolve as talks yield little progress||Firming up their resolve, the farmers’ unions protesting the three contentious farm laws on Wednesday said that they will not take back their movement and won’t form a committee to scrutinise the legislation as asked by the government. The remarks from a farm union representative came after nearly five hours long meet between the Centre and 40 farm unions at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital.Thousands of protesters, primarily from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at borders around Delhi in the bitter cold asking for the rollback of three laws pushed for clearance by the government in September this year. The farmers have alleged that the laws will lead to corporate dominance of the farm sector and erode their incomes.“Talks were positive today. The government has been saying that we should end agitation and form a committee. But we didn’t listen to them. We won’t take back our movement. We won’t form any committee,” All India Kisan Sabha’s Punjab president Balkaran Singh Brar said after meeting with the government representatives. Also read - Farmers’ protest: Consensus on two issues, says Tomar; next meeting on January 4“We’ll discuss MSP in next meet,” Brar told news agency ANI. Marking a shade of progress, the government on Wednesday said consensus has been reached on two issues out of four after the sixth round of talks with the protesting farmers’ unions.The government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve to protest farmers’ concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.The next meeting will be held on January 4, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said. The minister also said that the talks were held in a good environment and ended with a positive note.Tomar said the union leaders kept insisting on the repeal of the three farm laws, but the government side tried to explain to them the benefits of the Acts and sought to know specific problems faced by the farmers.On farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee for procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), the minister said the government has already said that it is ready to give a written assurance.Also read: Centre proposes committee to review farm laws, rules out repealThis meeting comes after a long gap as after the last meeting the situation resulted in a standoff with farmers being stern on their demand for a complete withdrawal of the laws and the Centre on not accepting it.The meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital started around 2 pm and went on for over four hours.

30-12-2020||India||IPS officer in Chhattisgarh crowdsources book bank for tribal youth||On repeated demands by the tribal youth of Chhattisgarh’s newest district, an IPS officer posted there has crowdsourced a book bank and collected over 3000 books. Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi, the newest (28th) district of Chhattisgarh, which comprises mostly Amarkantak forest, has this book bank at the district police office. Officers, doctors, lawyers, and people across the globe have contributed to the book bank. “I conceived this book bank in the month of April but then we were fighting Covid-19 in this new district hence shared the idea and made an appeal on social media for contribution in September. It is a remote and tribal populated district and we don’t have any quality library here. Many students who would meet me demanded a library. Also, I realised the role of good books and guidance to clear an exam as I have also wasted many years just trying to find the right material,” said Suraj Singh Parihar, who is the first superintendent of police of the new district. The officer said that the objective of the book bank is to support students especially the poor, the needy and the tribal ones to help them clear competitive examinations. “The other objective is also to earn goodwill for police and to engage youth in meaningful actions and channelise their energy positively as Maoists are trying to expand their base in the Achanakmaar-Amarkantak region,” said Parihar. Through this book bank, mainly class 10, 12, graduates and PG students will be benefited. Children of policemen will get a free subscription and civilians will also benefit by paying an annual nominal token amount for membership. “Most of the students who live here suffer from lack of books for competitive examinations. I believe that this Book Bank is surely a boon for us because all sorts of books are available in this bank,” said Sukrit Rajak, a graduate student of the district. The bank will officially be open for students from January 1, 2021. “We have devoted two front rooms of the district police office for this purpose. We have not counted but we have received thousands of books from hundreds of donors from all over India and abroad. Many civil servants have also donated for the cause,” Parihar added. Many celebrities like folk singer Malini Awasthi, kabaddi player Rahul Chaudhary, comedian Apoorv Gupta, IAS, IPS and other officers have appealed on social media for people to donate for the cause. People contributing to the book bank claimed that they are satisfied and happy contributing for the cause. “I feel very satisfied contributing to this book bank started by the IPS officer. I came to know through social media and immediately contributed for the cause,” said IRTS officer, Sumit Kumar posted in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-in-chhattisgarh-crowdsources-book-bank-for-tribal-youth/story-nXC1u8e9bl5cOIln6UtfVN.html

The Dalit woman was working at the same panchayat office as a part-time sweeper for about a decade. The stunning change of fortune is yet to sink in.“Only my party can do such things. I am really indebted to it,” she said, unable to control her tears when she was escorted to the block president’s seat.Anandavalli who dropped out of school, hails from a family of Marxist supporters. Her husband, a painter by profession, is also an active CPI (M) worker. She joined as a part-time sweeper in 2011 and her salary was Rs 2,000 a month, but she was now drawing a salary of Rs 6,000. After taking up the new assignment, she resigned from the temporary post.“I was a bit nervous. But my party leaders and well wishers prodded me to take up the new responsibility. I will do my best to make by block panchayat a role model,” she said. She won the recent local body election from Thalavoor division by 654 votes. “My responsibility is heavy now. I will work hard to make life better for all people in my block,” she said.But her success as a woman is not the only exception for the Marxists in the recent local body elections. A 21-year-old student Arya Rajendran was made the Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. And four other young women were also given new responsibilities.Twenty two-year-old law student Saruthi, who loves to ride motorcycles, has become the president of Olavanna panchayat in Kozhikode district. Reshma Mariam Joy, 21 was elected president of Aruvapualm panchayat in Pathanamthitta, Radhika Mahadeven (23) became the president of Malampuzha local body in Palakkad and Anas Stephi, president of Pozhuthana panchayat in Wayanad district. Reeling under many charges and allegations of corruption, the party gave tickets to many youngsters this time to beat incumbency and odds stacked against it and many emerged victorious.Many members of Kudumbhasree, a successful self-help group of women, have also been elected to local bodies. More than 7,000 candidates who emerged victorious are Kudumbhasree members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-woman-who-worked-as-part-time-sweeper-at-panchayat-office-is-now-its-president/story-W1tv23esyeUWXIMdF0HWPP.html

30-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Consensus on two issues, says Tomar; next meeting on January 4||After the sixth round of talks with the protesting farmers’ unions on Wednesday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said consensus has been reached on two issues out of four. The next meeting will be held on January 4, the minister said. The minister also said that the talks were held in a good environment and ended with a positive note. This meeting came after a long gap as after the last meeting the situation hit a dead end with farmers being stern on their demand for a complete withdrawal of the laws and the Centre on not accepting it. The meeting started around 2pm and went on for over four hours. Though there was no definite answer to farmers demands, the environment on Wednesday was amicable as the leaders mingled with the central representatives during lunch and evening snack time.Here are the major takeaways from the meeting:Breaking bread, if not ice: Farmer union leaders so far refused food offered at Vigyan Bhawan as they have always arranged for their food cooked at langar. On Wednesday, as they were having their langar food, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal joined them. The union leaders too, in the evening, accepted the beverage offered by the government during the tea break.‘Govt will withdraw electricity amendment bill’Punjab Kisan Union state president Ruldu Singh Mansa said the government has offered to withdraw the electricity amendment bill and to amend the ordinance to remove the penal provision on farmers in stubble burning cases. “Farmers feel that if reform is introduced in the Electricity Act, they’ll suffer loss. Unions wanted that electricity subsidy given to farmers by states for irrigation should continue. The consensus was reached on this issue,” agriculture minister said.Send women, children, elderly home: Minister’s request to farmersUnion minister Tomar requested the farmers several times to withdraw the protest as talks are going on. On Wednesday too, he requested the union leaders to send women, elderly and children back as they are suffering in the chilly weather in Delhi.Offering prayers at Vigyan BhawanAfter the evening tea break, farmer leaders offered ‘ardaas’ (prayers) at the meeting venue before resuming the talks. A committee to examine the lawsThe ministers have proposed to set up a committee to examine the new farm laws. Earlier too, this was proposed but the farmers’ unions were stern that they want an immediate withdrawal of the laws. After today’s meeting as well, Balkaran Singh Brar, Punjab President,All India Kisan Sabha, said they won’t form any committee. The agitation will also not stop. No consensus on MSP yetThe Centre has been reiterating that the system of minimum support price will remain. The Centre, in earlier meetings, agreed to give this in writing. But farmers want legal backing of MSP, to which the Centre has not yet agreed. “Discussion will continue on the legal aspect of MSP and other issues on January 4,” Tomar said.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-s-protest-next-meeting-to-take-place-on-january-4/story-z3nf3deIUiQhKpZtQpo0IK.html

30-12-2020||India||Now, health officials detect Shigella bacterial infection in Kochi||After Kozhikode in north Kerala, a new case of Shigella bacterial infection has been reported from Kochi on Wednesday, adding worry to overworked health workers.Ernakulam district collector S Suhas said a 56-year- old woman was diagnosed with the contagious disease and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the port city. He said water bodies in affected areas and surrounding locations will be chlorinated and health officials were working to find out the source of the infection. Health officials said samples of her relatives and neighbours were also sent for tests and the source of the pathogen was being ascertained. They are worried because Kochi is surrounded by many water bodies including backwaters and rivers. The district medical officer has called an emergency meeting in the evening to review the situation. Also read: Centre proposes committee to review farm laws, rules out repealThe bacterial outbreak first came to light two weeks ago with the death of an 11-year-old boy in Kozhikode district. Later, at least 36 people were diagnosed with the infection but recovered after a week or so. Health officials later said it was localised and contained effectively. After the outbreak in Kozhikode, all water bodies in the affected areas were chlorinated and medical camps were organised. Many were diagnosed with the infection at these camps. Experts said Shigella bacteria triggers infection called shigellosis and usually it is mild but it can trigger serious trouble to patients suffering from co-morbid conditions. They said the bacteria, after entering the body, either through contaminated water or through stale food, attacks the epithelial lining of the colon triggering inflammation of the cells. In most cases, experts said, patients may experience diarrhoea and fever and after some time symptoms may subside. An infected person shows minor symptoms in a day to two but it may take a week or so to show acute symptoms, they said, Usually children below 10 years are prone to the infection, though elderly can also get infected, experts said adding that patients with underlying medical conditions may require a heavy dose of antibiotics and medical care. Personal hygiene, drinking boiled water and proper hand sanitation can prevent the infection, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-health-officials-detect-shigella-bacterial-infection-in-kochi/story-1k1PDwgYh7ciXYX7h3qPcL.html

The state executive Committee (SEC) issued the order after the union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, as chairperson national executive committee, on Monday issued guidelines for the implementation of extended lockdown in containment zones and continuation of unlock guidelines outside containment zones till January 31, 2021.“As such..., the SEC hereby orders that the guidelines, instructions issued vide JK govt’s order 91 and 92 dated 29 November, 2020 shall continue to remain valid till 31-01-2021,” the SEC said in an order.It said that all the existing protocols and instructions shall continue to remain valid till January 31,2021.The instructions came after a few cases of mutant coronavirus which was first reported in the UK, were found among passengers who have returned to India from that country.Meanwhile Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) sounded an alert on Wednesday and urged health authorities in Kashmir to prepare for the potential spread of the new strain of Covid-19 in the valley.“New Covid-19 strain is knocking on our door. We need to be prepared and alert,” said DAK President and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan.“The new variant is on the move and it can sneak in anytime,” he said. “We have to prepare in advance to deal with the virus. Advance planning and preparedness is critical to help mitigate the impact of any eventuality.”“We need to intensify surveillance activities and gear up hospitals to prevent an outbreak,” Dr Nisar said.“The best way to prevent the virus is to stop it from coming in as once the virus enters the community it is difficult to control it.” Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir have been showing a decline for the past few months after peaking in September. On December 29, the Covid-19 tally in Jammu and Kashmir stood at 1,20,527 including 1,879 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-administration-extends-covid-19-unlock-protocol-by-a-month/story-gYqwhylmJJAVf0ZTzXUkaJ.html
30-12-2020||India||Cabinet approves export of Akash missiles||The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday gave its go-ahead to the sale of Akash surface-to-air missile systems to friendly foreign countries and created a high-powered panel for swifter approval to export of military hardware at a time India has set a target of clocking defence exports worth $5 billion by 2024, officials said. “So far, Indian defence exports included parts/components etc. The export of big platforms was minimal. This initiative of the Cabinet would help the country to improve its defence products and make them globally competitive,” the defence ministry said in a statement announcing the decision. The committee set up to speed up exports will have the defence minister, external affairs minister and the national security adviser on board. The missile --- already in service in the Indian military --- has an indigenous content of 96%. The missile, which has a range of 25 km, was inducted into the Indian Air Force in 2014 and in the army a year later. Officials said after its induction in the armed forces, several foreign countries had shown interest in the Akash missile during international and local defence exhibitions, and the Cabinet’s approval would allow India to take part in tenders issued by various countries. The export version of Akash will be different from the weapon system currently deployed by the Indian armed forces, the statement said without specifying the differences in configuration. “Besides Akash, there is interest in other major platforms like coastal surveillance system, radars and air platforms,” the statement said, adding that the high-powered panel had been created to provide faster approval for export of such platforms. The committee will authorise the export of major indigenous platforms to various countries, apart from exploring various options including the government-to-government route to sell military hardware abroad, officials said. “The Government of India intends to focus on exporting high value defence platforms to achieve a target of 5 Billion USD of defence export and improve strategic relations with friendly foreign countries,” defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted. Experts described the development as positive. “India has already demonstrated its potential to manufacture defence equipment for exports. We are exporting a wide range of military hardware. The Cabinet approval for Akash export along with the setting up of the committee will boost our vision of becoming Atmanirbhar in the defence sector. It will also enhance India’s stature in the global market as a weapons exporter,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). India exported defence equipment worth Rs 10,745 crore in 2018-19 --- seven times the figure in 2016-17. Officials said other defence platforms that hold export potential include the light combat aircraft, Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, Prahar surface-to-surface missile, supersonic cruise missile Brahmos, sonars, a variety of unmanned systems and battlefield radars. Defence items already being exported include the advanced light helicopter, offshore patrol vessels, personal protective gear, surveillance systems and a variety of radars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-export-of-akash-missiles/story-WN7MQTnK0i2DJtag6o5NcI.html

He has, however, denied having any knowledge of Majeed’s criminal past. He is very much under our radar and it has also come to fore that his brothers had been jailed on murder charges. His criminal antecedents are also being investigated,” Dr M Tamil Vanan, Jamshedpur senior superintendent of police (SSP), said on Wednesday.Also read: New spike in UK cases as Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is approvedPolice were also launching random checking of passports of which police verification was done manually till 2018 as Majeed’s passport in his fake name of Md Kamal was made from Patna in 2017 on the address of Inam’s residence at Telco Barinagar. Digital police verification of passports started after 2018. Inam met Kutty in Dubai for the first time in 1999 and again in Malaysia in 2007.A police team, led by Mango PS OC Vinay Kumar and Telco PS OC Akhileshwar Mandal, picked up Inam Ali, who is a Tata Motors employee, on Tuesday and interrogated him for over six hours during which he admitted that Majeed’s fake passport in the name of Md Kamal was made in Patna on the address of his Barinagar house in Jamshedpur in 2000. Majeed’s Aadhaar, PAN and other documents were also made on this address.Investigation has also found that trainee ASI Mahba Minz had given clean chit to Majeed in his report stating that Abdul Majeed alias Md Kamal was living at his grandfather Md Ashiq Ali’s Barinagar residence from childhood and had gone away for 10 years for work. The report, signed by Telco PS OC Akhileshwar Mandal on June 21, 2019, also stated that there was no criminal case against Majeed. His passport was renewed on the basis of this report from Ranchi.The case took a curious turn after a probe found that Ashiq Ali is Inam Ali’s father who was murdered by Salim, brother of Telco Urdu School principal over a dispute in 2000. Soon after, Inam Ali’s elder brother Irshad Ali alias Butto murdered the principal of Telco Urdu School. Both Salim and Irshad were in jail for these two murders and later came out after a mutual compromise was done.Inam’s younger brother Nijam Ali alias Chota Nijam too was in jail on murder charges and has many cases pending against him while his friend Bara Nijam was killed in a police encounter in 2007. Inam’s family originally hailed from Pratapur in Siwan district of Bihar. Inam’s fourth brother Kamruddin alias Karfu works as a safety officer in Qatar while their youngest brother Asif Ali is a civil contractor for the past 7-8 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-into-criminal-past-of-dawood-s-aide-majeed-s-jamshedpur-accomplice/story-dGwxx3QR1n92bcQaAgVrTK.html
30-12-2020||India||Centre proposes committee to review farm laws, rules out repeal||Three Union ministers holding their sixth round of talks with protesting farm leaders on Wednesday rejected the demand to repeal the three agricultural laws cultivators say will hurt their livelihoods. The Centre, however, proposed to set up a committee to examine the new farm laws. Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash also discussed the possibility of a law on guaranteeing minimum prices for farm prices, said a senior farmers’ representative present in the talks. The ministers shared meals with farmers during a lunch break after the first round of talks, presenting a picture of bonhomie amid the tough negotiations.In the first round of talks earlier today, which was followed by a lunch break, the farmers raised their core issue of scrapping three recent pro-reform laws. Among their clutch of demands, farmers have also demanded a law to make federally fixed minimum prices, known as minimum support prices.“The ministers didn’t say anything on this but said they wanted to discuss the demand for a law on MSP,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan, the leader of a faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union.In the second round of talks, which were on at the time of filing this report, the government said a committee could be formed to scrutinise the three laws.A government official also explained the pros and cons of a law on MSP. The government argued that a law making MSP compulsory for even private traders, essentially prohibiting sale of any farm produce below state-set prices, could spark chaos in markets. Tomar said private traders may not buy at MSP rates if doing so wouldn’t be profitable for them. Further discussions are on. The three farm laws passed in September essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will enable large corporations to dictate prices and exploit them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-proposes-committee-to-review-farm-laws-rules-out-repeal/story-w6XMfswhBkKwmrIy9xtuOL.html
30-12-2020||India||Maharashtra government stable, attempts to bring it down won’t succeed, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar||Confident that any attempt by BJP to bring down the Maharashtra government won’t succeed, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar has asserted that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi dispensation is stable and it will continue to rule the state.He also slammed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) action against leaders of the ruling alliance and their family members as “misuse of authority”.“It has been a year now (since the Thackeray-led MVA government assumed office)... they (BJP) were to bring down the government in two months, then they were to do so in six months, then in eight months. But, nothing will happen,” Pawar told PTI in an interview.“It is a stable government and it will continue,” he said.The MVA government comprising of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress completed a year last month. All through this period, various BJP leaders have been saying that the government will collapse, citing ideological differences among the alliance partners.BJP and Shiv Sena had contested the 2019 assembly polls together, but their alliance fell through over the issue of chief ministership.It was Pawar who is said to have then rallied Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress together to form the MVA government. The Maratha stalwart, who has been Maharashtra’s Chief Minister four times and has also been union minister at the Centre in the past, is seen as the guiding force behind the functioning of the Thackeray-led government in the state.When asked about the ED’s notice to Shiv Sena leader and Saamana Editor Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha, Pawar said, “This is a misuse of authority.” The ED had summoned Varsha for questioning in the over Rs 4,300-crore PMC Bank money-laundering case. She is now expected to appear before the central probe agency on January 5 after skipping the summons thrice.Pawar said, “They even tried to give me a notice once but later withdrew. I was not even a member of the bank and I didn’t have any account in that bank.” Last year, the ED registered a criminal case in the multi-crore Maharashtra Sahakari Cooperative Bank (MSCB) and the role of Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar and others had come under the scanner of the agency. The ED did not eventually summon Pawar, but the NCP President had at that time insisted that he would visit the probe agency’s office. He dropped the plan later after the state police requested him not to go ahead to avoid possible law and order situation.Shiv Sena has also been alleging that the central probe agencies were targeting its leaders unfairly.Former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who has recently joined Sharad Pawar’s NCP, was also summoned by the ED for questioning in connection with a money-laundering case linked to a land deal in Pune.Last month, the ED had raided premises linked to Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in connection with a money-laundering case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-government-stable-attempts-to-bring-it-down-won-t-succeed-says-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar/story-x8RvG6OvfoHLkdGkbAIMAJ.html

On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand government issued an order extending the Covid-19 guidelines till January 31, 2021. An order issued by Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand stated, “Keeping in view of the fresh surge in cases globally and emergence of new a variant of the virus in the United Kingdom, there is a need for maintaining caution and strict surveillance.” The order further mentions that strict vigil is also needed to be maintained to prevent any fresh surge in cases “in the wake of upcoming New Year celebrations and ongoing winter season which are favourable for the spread of the virus.” District administrations have been asked to take appropriate measures in this regard.The state government has allowed districts, based on their assessments of the situation to, “impose lockdown restrictions with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19, such as night curfew.” District administrations have also been asked to ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour of wearing masks, following social and physical distancing is followed by the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-the-shadow-of-covid-19-uttarakhand-preps-for-new-year-celebrations/story-88rvxTYVwWOGYtBlLfq7kK.html

As per official release, the contract was signed by Bhoramdev Cooperative Sugar Factory Kawardha and Chhattisgarh Distillery Limited’s subsidiary NKJ Biofuel for a period of 30 years. On behalf of the state government, the MoU was signed by the Managing Director Bhoramdev Cooperative Sugar Factory, Bhupendra Thakur, while Aranya Kedia signed on the behalf of Chhattisgarh Distillery. Addressing the program, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said that setting up of the ethanol plant will prove to be important in ensuring timely payment of sugarcane price to farmers and ensuring full utilisation of sugar factory capacity. The establishment of the ethanol plant will generate direct and indirect employment opportunities in the region and will form the basis for economic prosperity in the region, the CM added. “Chhattisgarh has kept the issues related to farmers and their development work paramount. The state government was the first to waive the agricultural loans and in view of the interest of the sugarcane farmers, the ethanol plant is being set up by the PPP model as a permanent solution to the economic hardship of sugar factories. This is the first example in the country to set up an ethanol plant by PPP model. Chhattisgarh will also have an important contribution in the production of biofuels in the country by setting up an ethanol plant in the state,” Baghel said. Cooperative Minister Tekam said that with the setting up of the plant in the state, the sugarcane producing farmers would be able to pay the price of sugarcane on time and the demand for sugarcane will increase as well. Farmers will derive direct benefit out of it, he said. “For the Ethanol plant to be set up by Chhattisgarh Distilleries Ltd with a capacity of 40 Kilo Liter Per Day (KLPD), a tender of Rs 5.27 crore per annum has been accepted. Under the PPP model, only land will be made available by the factory on licence. More than Rs 100 crore will be disinvested by the investor on setting up the ethanol plant. The plant is planned to be completed within one and a half to two years to start ethanol production,” a government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-signs-contract-to-set-up-india-s-1st-ethanol-plant-under-ppp-model/story-MohpVxKb9ex9tCFKApIHUL.html

30-12-2020||India||Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal join farmer leaders during lunch at Vigyan Bhawan, share langar food||During all past meetings between the leaders of the agitating farmers’ groups and the Centre, farmers brought their food cooked at langars set up at various protest sites, including Singhu border. It became a statement on part of the farmers that they rejected the hospitality of the government. So in all past meetings, during the lunch time, farmer leaders had lunch together while ministers and other Central representatives had lunch separately. The union leaders either brought food or got it delivered during the lunch time.On Wednesday, however, another message was given and this time it was by the ministers as Piyush Goyal, Narendra Singh Tomar joined the leaders during the lunch break. Food was served to the ministers by the farmer leaders.After the last round of talks remained inconclusive on December 5, several attempts to hold another round of talks went in vain as farmers remained stern in their demand for an immediate withdrawal of the three agriculture laws that they apprehend will corporatise farming. The government, meanwhile, held several outreach programmes to explain that the government is pro-farmer and the new laws will benefit them. This meeting may break the ice between the farmers and the Centre though it is unlikely that the Centre would agree to the farmers’ demand of withdrawing the laws. A middle path can be reached at today’s meeting as both the parties want to end the deadlock. The protest at Delhi borders has been going on for over a month now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-singh-tomar-piyush-goyal-join-farmer-leaders-during-lunch-at-vigyan-bhawan-share-langar-food/story-vdvHscoVMTcFWgfyCFXqhP.html
30-12-2020||India||BJP MP Vasava to withdraw resignation after talks with senior leaders||A day after tendering his resignation from the BJP, Lok Sabha member and former Union minister Mansukh Vasava on Wednesday said he has dropped the idea of quitting the party following talks with its senior leaders.Vasava, a six-time MP from tribal-dominated Bharuch in Gujarat, had on Tuesday said he was quitting the BJP only due to health problems and had no issues with the government or the party.Talking to reporters after meeting Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in Gandhinagar on Wednesday morning, he said, “Senior party leaders told me that I will get free treatment for my back pain and neck pain only if I continue to be an MP. This is not possible if I resign as an MP. Party leaders asked me to take rest and assured that a system will be put in place wherein local party workers will do work on my behalf.” “The only reason why I had decided to resign from the party and as an MP was my health issues. I also discussed the same with the CM today. Now, after getting assurance from the senior BJP leaders, I have decided to withdraw my resignation.I will continue to serve my people as an MP,” Vasava said.The tribal leader claimed that it was a misconception that he was upset with the government or the ruling BJP over some issues pertaining to tribals of Narmada district, particularly about the inclusion of 121 villages in the Eco Sensitive Zone.“The governments in the state and at the Centre are putting all their efforts into resolving the issues related to the Eco Sensitive Zone. I have no issues with the party or the government. On the contrary, I firmly believe that tribals benefited more under the BJP rule than under any previous governments,” he said.On Tuesday, Vasava had resigned from the party and also claimed that he will resign as MP after meeting Lok Sabha Speaker during the upcoming Budget Session of the Parliament.Vasava had tendered his resignation in the form of a letter to Gujarat BJP President C R Paatil.In the letter, Vasava, an outspoken and straightforward tribal leader, said although he had tried his best to be loyal to the party and also tried to assimilate the party’s values in his life, he is ultimately a human and prone to commit “mistakes”.“I am ultimately a human and humans tend to commit mistakes. To ensure that the party does not suffer due to my mistakes, I hereby resign from the party, and I seek forgiveness from the party for it,” he had said in the letter.Paatil had told reporters on Tuesday that Vasava was particularly unhappy about the declaration of the Eco Sensitive Zone in his constituency.“The main issue is the declaration of an Eco Sensitive Zone by the Centre in his constituency. Now, it appears that some people are misguiding locals over the issue after the Collector had made some entries about the land parcels. We are trying to convince Vasava and I am confident that a solution will arrive soon,” the state BJP chief had said.Vasava was inducted into the Cabinet as the union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2014. However, he was abruptly dropped in July 2016.On December 20, he had dashed off a letter to the PM demanding withdrawal of the Eco Sensitive Zone from 121 villages of Narmada district.He claimed that local tribals were angry because of the “unnecessary interference” by the officials after those 121 tribal-dominated villages were included in the Eco Sensitive Zone.Later in the afternoon, Vasava claimed that it was his health, not Eco Sensitive Zone, which forced him to take the decision.“I am having no issues at all with the BJP or the government. The only thing is that I remain unwell most of the time and the doctors have advised me to take rest now, Though I am an MP, I could not travel much and be with my people due to this back pain, which has now started affecting the functioning of my brain,” Vasava had told reporters on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-vasava-to-withdraw-resignation-after-talks-with-senior-leaders/story-xYCgDotmgMJY17dQNwoQ8J.html

It has called the farmers again today, but how will they proceed when the government refuses to compromise,” said Congress leader Kumari Selja. She added the government should support the farmers and listen to their demands by repealing the three laws.“The entire country depends on the farmers. It is time that this government should embrace them as well,” Selja said. “People have lost faith in the BJP. Ten farmers from Haryana have lost their lives. The chief minister of Haryana should take a delegation to the Prime Minister and make him understand the situation on the ground.”Also Read: ‘Talks will be held on all issues; hope farm stir ends today’: Union minister Som PrakashAnother Congress leader Pritam Singh accused the government of murdering democracy. “The talks with the government have been inconclusive.” He said the government brings the farmers to the table but says the laws will not be undone. “It is the responsibility of the central government to break this deadlock by repealing the laws.”The Congress’s criticism came as Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal, and Som Prakash began the sixth round of talks with 40 farmer leaders on Wednesday amid their protests against the three agricultural laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-bjp-for-aiding-corporate-interests-seeks-swift-resolution-to-farmers-protests/story-FwNyzmxveD1lDURRKEezcK.html

Any malicious link, email, message or phone call offering priority to receive Covid-19 vaccine is fraud. “Due to apprehension associated with COVID-19, Cyber criminals are playing various tricks. They may offer to “pay and register” in getting priority to receive first CORONA VACCINE, through malicious link, mail, message or phone call. Be aware otherwise you may get defrauded,” the Centre has said.  Due to apprehension associated with COVID-19, Cyber criminals are playing various tricks. They may offer to "pay and register" in getting priority to receive first CORONA VACCINE, through malicious link, mail, message or phone call. Be aware otherwise you may get defrauded.The Centre has drawn up a plan for vaccination in which the vaccine will be offered first to to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to people above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated co-morbidities. State and local authorities have already registered these people. The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and legislative assembly election will be used to identify population aged 50 years or more.Twenty-three ministries and departments of the Centre and states have been identified and assigned roles (planning, implementation, social mobilization, awareness generation etc.) for vaccine roll out. A total of 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators will be used for the Covid-19 vaccine storage.Incidents of fraudsters already on prowl have been reported sporadically. In Madhya Pradesh, calls were made to people asking them to pay Rs 500 and register for vaccine. “Fraudsters from Haryana, Hyderabad and Telangana are targeting people on the pretext of registration for Covid-19 vaccine. We are creating awareness among people and asking them not to share any OTP and download any app for registration,” said MP cyber cell additional superintendent of police Rajat Sakhlecha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-fall-for-pay-and-register-scheme-for-covid-19-vaccine-alerts-centre/story-la6m7zCVDRJQgkMjYD6NgM.html
30-12-2020||India||From pushing electric mobility to boosting textile sector, Niti Aayog charts 2021 reforms map||Accelerating electric mobility, enhancing competitiveness of textiles industry, improving credit access for small and medium enterprises, and pushing water conservation measures will dominate Niti Aayog’s to-do list in the new year as it seeks to further the government’s reforms agenda for sustained economic growth. As the think tank continues to work with various stakeholders to boost the country’s economy, its Vice Chairman and economist Rajiv Kumar said the government has already used Covid-19 crisis for taking several steps to lay the foundation for a “rapid and sustained growth in the coming years”. While noting that these steps and reforms have to be further consolidated, Kumar asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is “certainly not protectionist” and has been continuously expanding the scope for Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). “In the next calendar year, the Niti Aayog will be looking at several areas for pushing the reform agenda forward. These will be broadly in the field of pushing the movement on electric mobility. “... the second area that we will be working on is collaboration with the textile ministry in setting up mega textile firms which will improve the competitiveness of the textile industry, help us to expand our exports for both the fabric and the garment sectors,” he told PTI in an interview. Besides, he said the Niti Aayog will push forward the agenda on water conservation and better water use as well as look at the possibility of improving access to formal credit for small and medium enterprises because they will be one of the pillars for Aatmanirbhar Bharat. According to him, Niti Aayog will work on creating a body of scientific and empirical evidence to examine the appropriateness of natural farming techniques in India whose proponents have claimed that this can bring down the costs dramatically and increase farmers’ income also quite significantly. Doubling farmers’ income is a priority for the Union government. “So, the Niti Aayog is now working closely with ICAR and other agriculture universities to have a body of empirical evidence through field trials to examine the benefits of natural farming,” Kumar said. The government think tank will also look at the possibility of mainstreaming the use of traditional medicine and promoting integrated medicine practices as has been done in several other countries. “Because the efficacy of traditional medicine that is AYUSH has come out as being shown to be quite high in the COVID-19 pandemic period,” he pointed out. Niti Aayog is playing a key role in COVID-19 vaccine rollout and its member V K Paul is heading the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC). Emphasising that steps have been taken to convert the COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity, Kumar said, “already the economy has bounced back, much better than what all of us had expected”. He expects the country’s economy, which contracted in the first two quarters of the current financial year, to register a small positive growth in the January-March quarter. “It will of course grow at very high rates in 2021-22 but beyond that also it will achieve its potential rate of growth which is estimated at 7-8 per cent,” he said. Noting that there is a need to focus on improving the global competitiveness of India’s industry and achieve global scales, Kumar said those will require the continuation of the government’s efforts to reduce logistic costs and improve credit availability for all units, especially for small and medium enterprises. “And continue on the focus of expanding infrastructure capabilities plus promote public private partnership, so as to give larger space for private enterprise for accelerating economic growth in the country,” he opined. On the government’s disinvestment programme, Kumar said the Niti Aayog has recommended sale of stakes in several CPSEs (Central Public Sector Enterprises) and that the Union Cabinet itself has approved more than 20 such proposals. “So it (stake sale in CPSEs) is very much on the cards and has been on the cards for this government,” he added. Disinvestment process is progressing for various CPSEs, including Air India and BPCL. To a query about India’s decision not to be part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Kumar said Modi government is certainly not protectionist because it has continuously expanded the scope for FDI and made it under the automatic route for most areas. “Walking out of the RCEP was done because it was clearly seen that until we have improved our competitiveness, for which now the government is taking very active steps, joining the RCEP under the condition it was offered would not have served the national interest,” he pointed out. According to him, India walking out of the RCEP is certainly not moving away from the country’s commitment to take a greater part in global technology, financial, goods and services flows. The Niti Aayog Vice Chairman also noted that India still continues to have nine Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and is negotiating 19 FTAs with various countries. “But we have to be very cognizant of which agreement serves our national interest and which does not,” he stressed. In efforts to boost economic output, the Niti Aayog played an active role in formulating the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for ten key sectors. This year, it came out with a draft model Act and rules for states on conclusive land titling with an aim to reduce litigations and ease the land acquisition process for infrastructure projects. Also, the Niti Aayog released a draft report titled ‘Guiding Principles for the Uniform National-Level Regulation of Online Fantasy Sports Platforms in India’.

30-12-2020||India||3 union ministers, 40 farm leaders in huddle over Central farm acts||Three Union ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash — and 40 farm leaders on Wednesday afternoon started the sixth round of talks on a clutch of demands by farm unions, including repeal of three agricultural laws, at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan. According to an official, farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government is open to negotiations and suggested that, if everyone agreed, the talks could take up the easier issues first. The official said railway minister Goyal and Tomar held two meetings with home minister Amit Shah before heading to the meeting’s venue. The first issue farmers want discussions on were the “modalities (that are) to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts”.Second, the unions want “mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative support prices recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission into a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities.”The farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution.Their last demand is continuation of subsidised power for agricultural use, instead of a proposed switch to direct cash, which farmers say will increase power costs for them.The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and erode the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates, known as minimum support prices (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-union-ministers-40-farm-leaders-in-huddle-over-central-farm-acts/story-e3iWsXAIRbvIsGb8Y3qd5H.html

The cloud cover ahead of Tuesday’s snowfall had kept the night temperature around the freezing point for two consecutive nights in most parts of the valley but the respite ended as the mercury plunged to minus 11 degrees in Gulmarg in north Kashmir, the officials said. They said Gulmarg tourist destination was the coldest recorded place in the valley. Pahalgam, which serves as the base camp for annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 9 degrees Celsius -- a drop of six notches in 24 hours. The officials said the minimum temperature in Srinagar — the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — was minus 2.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday night. Qazigund – the gateway town to the valley – recorded the minimum of minus 2.5 degrees Celsius, while Kupwara, in the north, registered a low of minus 2.8 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, in the south, minus 6.5 degrees Celsius, the officials said. Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’ -- the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley. The chances of snowfall are most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall, the officials said. While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ – which began on December 21 -- will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-reels-under-sub-zero-temperatures-gulmarg-shivers-at-11-degrees-c/story-oqhu0OLJQB52NB23Q84wFK.html

The parade itself will be shorter, with smaller marching contingents compared to previous years, the people said. No more than 25,000 spectators will be allowed at Rajpath this year, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade that showcases India’s military might and cultural diversity, the people cited above said. Children below the age of 15 will not be permitted at the parade. The size of the marching contingents from the armed forces and the para-military will also be smaller. These squads will only have 96 participants compared to 144 in the ordinary course, officials said. The shortened route of the parade will see it end at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort, the officials said, adding that the number of cultural programmes will also be fewer.

Until 2019, tributes were paid to martyrs at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate. Also, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) showcased its anti-satellite weapon for the first time. Jammu and Kashmir took part in the parade for the first time as a Union Territory. Its tableau was based on the theme “Back to Village”.

30-12-2020||India||Kangana Ranaut back in Mumbai, Congress tweets reminder for anti-drugs agency||The Maharashtra Congress on Wednesday reminded the Narcotics Control Bureau, probing the alleged Bollywood-drugs nexus, that actor Kanagana Ranaut, who claims to have information on the drugs links in the film industry, is back in Mumbai. The party sought to know when the actor would be summoned by the anti-drugs agency. On September 9, the NCB arrested actor Rhea Chakraborty over drugs-related allegations following actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The agency had also summoned actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, among others, for questioning.The Congress put out an old video of Kangana Ranaut where she is heard saying that she was a “drug addict”. “Dear NCB, She is bk! When will you call @Kangan Team for this video? Also Modi govt gave Y category security to her (she is still enjoying at the cost of exchequer) as she wanted to give info abt drug racket in bollywood. She is still hiding info abt crime which is an offense.(sic),” Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeted the 14-second video clip on Wednesday morning.  Dear NCB, She is bk!When will you call @KanganaTeam for this video? Also Modi govt gave Y category security to her ( she is still enjoying at the cost of exchequer) as she wanted to give info abt drug racket in bollywood. She is still hiding info abt crime which is an offense pic.twitter.com/z5PWUWE8BASawant pointed out that while other actors and people related to the film industry were summoned and interrogated on the basis of the messages they exchanged, Kangana Ranaut has still not been questioned by the agency. “Karan Johar and other film personalities were interrogated by the NCB for the old cases and videos of the drug links. Why Kangana is being spared when she herself has admitted of having consumed drugs and her former friend Adhyayan Suman, Shekhar Suman’s son, has alleged that Kangana Ranaut took drugs and also forced him to take drugs,” said Sawant.BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar however questioned the state government, why it was not probing Ranaut using its own agencies. “If the MVA government, in which Congress is a ruling partner, thinks she has links in drug dealing in the film industry, why home department does not initiate an inquiry. The state government has its own narcotics bureau and state home minister Anil Deshmukh had announced on the floor of the Assembly to probe the links. Why has it not been initiated? MVA government had announced similar inquiries in phone tapping, tree planting drive by previous government? They should tell the people of Maharashtra about the status of these inquiries,” he said.Ranaut on Tuesday visited Siddhivinayak and Mumbadevi temples and tweeted, “The amount of hostility I faced for standing up for my beloved city Mumbai baffled me, today I went to Mumba devi and Shri Siddhivinayak ji and got their blessings, I feel protected, loved and welcomed. Jai Hind Jai Maharashtra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-back-in-mumbai-congress-tweets-reminder-for-anti-drugs-agency/story-S9o4Lmc9WwjjqQMTbG8ExI.html

He added that talks would be held on all issues, including on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) policy which has been the tipping point of the protest. Prakash is one of the three representatives of the Centre who have been holding talks with the farmers, the other two being agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railway minister Piyush Goyal.Speaking to news agency ANI, Prakash said, “We hope that the talks will be decisive. Talks will be held on all issues including MSP with an open heart.

30-12-2020||India||Japan committed to working with India for realising better health for the people: Satoshi Suzuki||Japan sees India as the “most natural strategic partner” to promote a free and inclusive Indo-Pacific, and this year’s Malabar naval exercise was an example of efforts by the four members of the Quad to ensure the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki has said. In a wide-ranging interview, Suzuki spoke of cooperation with India in spheres ranging from security to trade and investment. He also said there is no scope in a rules-based free and open Indo-Pacific for attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion. Edited excerpts:With the world focused on Covid-19 vaccine delivery and economic recovery, what role can Japan and India jointly play in these efforts as important members of the G20? What is your view on the proposal by India and several other countries for IPR waiver for wider access to vaccines? Is Japan looking to closer cooperation with India on delivery and distribution of vaccines, including in third countries? Year 2020 turned out to be an unprecedented one with our days so much affected by Covid-19. Protecting lives and recovering the economy have become a top priority for governments across the world. That is why Japan is supporting the efforts of the government of India through 50 billion yen (about Rs7,500 crore) budget support and 1 billion yen (about Rs150 crore) grant assistance, as well as through international organisations such as UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and IFRC. As rightly pointed out, our two countries are also important partners in the framework of G20. In the G20 Riyadh Summit, Prime Minister [Yoshihide] Suga underscored the need to take a holistic approach for securing equitable access to vaccines as well as therapeutics and diagnoses in light of Covid-19. In this regard, Japan is supporting the concept of patent pool, to which India has also expressed its support, which promotes voluntary licensing of intellectual property to enable emerging countries to have access to vaccines and medicines. Japan is committed to promote multilateral cooperation, including its support to COVAX facility, which aims at accelerating the development and manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines, and at guaranteeing fair and equitable access to them by our partners, including India. In the fight against Covid-19, it is important to ensure that all people have access to needed health services of sufficient quality at an affordable cost. This is exactly what Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means. India and Japan are cooperating towards this goal of attaining UHC in India, through such a mechanism as Healthcare Joint Working Group. Japan remains committed to working with India for realising better health for the people in India and beyond. Also Read: ‘Covid-19 wake-up call’: WHO warns future pandemics to be far deadlierThe Indo-Pacific is an area where Japan had an early start in cooperation with India. What will Japan’s priorities be for this region in 2021 and will there be continuity in Japan’s Indo-Pacific policies under Prime Minister Suga’s administration? India has been the most natural strategic partner for Japan in its efforts to promote the vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Suga expressed that his administration will continue to attach significance to this vision in his first telephone conversation with Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi on September 25 and in the East Asia Summit meeting in November. We look forward to working with India in 2021 to make further progress in our joint endeavours in such areas as connectivity and maritime security. Has there been progress in efforts by Japan, Australia and India in developing supply chain resilience? Will more countries in the Indo-Pacific be made part of these efforts? Commerce and trade ministers of Japan, India and Australia held a virtual meeting in September and decided to work towards launching a new initiative for resilient supply chains in the Indo-Pacific region. Their relevant ministries are in touch with each other. As you pointed out, it is important to involve and seek understanding of other countries for this initiative. How did Australia’s inclusion in this year’s Malabar exercise alter the significance of these drills? Will Australia now continue to be part of this exercise? I was happy to see Australia joining the Malabar exercise along with India, Japan and the US this year. These four countries, or the Quad, share a common vision of ensuring a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific in which the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are ensured, and all countries enjoy freedom of navigation and overflight. The Malabar exercise this year was a great example of our joint efforts to this end. By operating together at sea, the four maritime forces strengthened partnerships among them, which is the foundation of cooperative actions to maintain a rules-based maritime order. I am looking forward to seeing the four maritime forces continuing to operate together in the future. Japan was one of the first countries to speak of the need for maintenance of status quo along the Line of Actual Control amid India’s standoff with China. Japan also faces the challenge of China’s aggressive actions within its territorial waters. Your views on these issues. In a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific where the rule of law prevails, there is no place for any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion. Be it in Ladakh, in the East China Sea, or in the South China Sea, Japan stands firm to uphold the principles that underpin a rules-based international order. I think this is also the best example where we have seen growing strategic convergence in both countries’ thinking. Japan had announced an initiative aimed at helping its companies moving out of China and for diversifying markets. Is this likely to benefit firms that move to India or expand their operations here? More precisely, the government of Japan is trying to help Japanese industries to diversify their supply chains so that they will be more resilient. In this regard, two pilot projects and feasibility studies in India have been adopted for “Program for Strengthening Overseas Supply Chains” in November, which are the first and only two projects from outside ASEAN. The trilateral initiative among Japan, India and Australia mentioned above is also a part of such efforts. India has been within the radar scope of Japanese companies long before Covid-19. I am pleased to see that the number of Japanese companies operating in India has been steadily increasing, reaching 1,454 in 2019. I hope in their efforts to strengthen supply chains resilience, more companies will come to India. I also want to stress at the same time, however, that this would not naturally happen. A further improvement of business environment is important here, while I commend the recent surge of India in the “ease of doing business” ranking (#63 in 2019). To make India more attractive to investors, predictability and stability of business environment are critical, including the continued free flow of goods, such as intermediary goods which are indispensable to fulfil Make in India objectives. Also Read: Japan to join ‘Five Eyes’ to check China’s clampdown on UyghursWhat is the status of Japan’s major projects and initiatives in India, including the bullet train project and the initiatives in the northeastern states, as well as joint projects in third countries? Are there any new proposals to boost regional connectivity? Japan is pleased to be partnering with India for a number of important projects. Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is a flagship project which will transform the Indian railway culture not only with its amazing speed and comfort but also through technology and skill transfer. The tenders for important packages, including its largest civil package, have been successfully being made, infusing much needed economic stimulus after Covid-19. Japan’s efforts for the development of India’s northeast attest the deep trust India places upon Japan. The region is strategically important and full of potentials. Japan is providing a range of supports from road connectivity, forest and biodiversity conservation, water and sanitation, hydropower generation, to local schools. I am co-chairing, with foreign secretary [Harsh] Shringla, the Act East Forum to advance these efforts and to explore new possibilities. Our collaboration with India in third countries expresses the importance India and Japan attach to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. To take an example of Bangladesh, in a stretch where India is improving roads, Japan is building bridges. This is a perfect example of our complementary roles to enhance connectivity. Another example is in the Maldives where India built Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital, to which Japan donated medical equipment. I believe we can further explore such collaborations in third countries to realize our shared vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Japan took the lead in drafting a declaration on India’s possible entry into RCEP at a later stage. Will Japan continue with its efforts to convince India to join RCEP? Japan understands the current position of the government of India. Having said that, we strongly believe it is beneficial for India and for RCEP if India can join this broad regional economic partnership agreement. RCEP will ensure India will be integrated in the most vibrant region and be a part of its value chains. That is why Japan took a lead in drafting Ministers’ Declaration on India’s Participation in RCEP. This declaration is unprecedented in many ways. First, India can accede to RCEP if India so wishes at any time. Other countries cannot accede until 18 months will pass after its entry of force. Second, it expressed the will of RCEP Member States to commence negotiations with India at any time if India so wishes. Third, India can participate in RCEP meetings as an observer if India so wishes. Unlike other trade agreements where the meetings are only open to their participants, India can benefit from these RCEP meetings even before becoming a member. Japan is committed to continuing to work with India as a trusted partner. One of such efforts is our cooperation to elevate India’s industrial competitiveness. Japan is prepared to share our experience and expertise so that India’s manufacturing sector will become even stronger. Is there any update on the India-Japan Summit? Are we likely to see a visit by the Japanese Prime Minister in 2021? At the first telephone conversation between Prime Minister Suga and Prime Minister Modi in September, it was confirmed that annual Summit meetings would be resumed once the situation related to Covid-19 be improved. I hope that the situation will improve to permit us to hold the meeting between the two PMs at the earliest possible and mutually convenient time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-committed-to-working-with-india-for-realising-better-health-for-the-people-satoshi-suzuki/story-dwDCk0WVdgWECH8kKwCfeM.html

Recently, he was not seen in his home constituency of Kendrapara when CM’s private secretary VK Pandian had gone there for a discussion on a riverport project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-mp-anubhav-mohanty-answers-to-women-s-commission-over-domestic-violence-charge/story-Bqxf2j8zaRlxtwwU3V7UsI.html

There are however, exemptions to the above rule due to the amendments made in the Income-tax Act, 1961, via Budget 2019 which stipulates the following categories of people will not be exempted from the penalty 1. Individuals who have deposited an amount or aggregates of the amount exceeding Rs.1 crore in one or more banking accounts2. Individuals who have incurred expenditures exceeding Rs 2 lakh due to foreign travel.3. Individuals who incur expenditure or aggregate expenditures of Rs 1 lakh and more due to electricity consumption.Filing ITR dues also guarantees that the interest payable on the tax refund is calculated from April 1 of the relevant assessment year. In case of belated filings the individual loses out on some amount of the interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-doubles-penalty-for-missing-itr-due-date-this-year/story-nPPksEqGkMJKHoQGbdGFrI.html

The practice of mass conversions should stop. As far as I know, in the Muslim religion, one cannot marry someone from another religion. I personally do not approve of conversion for marriage,” Rajnath Singh told ANI in an exclusive interview.He was responding to a question about the misuse of “love-jihad law” enacted by the Uttar Pradesh government. Rajnath Singh is Lok Sabha MP from Lucknow.He said there is a difference between “natural marriage” and forceful religious conversion for marriage.“In many cases, you may have seen that the religious conversion is being done forcefully and sometimes it is done under greed. Natural marriage and forceful conversion for marriage has a big difference and I think governments which made these laws have considered all these things,” he added.Answering a query, he said a true Hindu will not practice discrimination.“I believe that a true Hindu will not do discrimination based on caste, religion and sects. Our religious scriptures also do not give permission for this. India is the only country that has given the message of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam” (The whole world is a family). No country did this,” he added.The Uttar Pradesh government has enacted a law to prohibit fraudulent and forcible conversions, including conversion for marriage.The Madhya Pradesh government has also approved the Freedom to Religion Bill 2020.

The panel will also include Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, ex- Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, and former Union minister Jitendra Singh.“The Congress President has approved the formation of the committee to plan and coordinate the activities of the Indian National Congress to commemorate the historic 50th anniversary of the Bangladesh Liberation War won in 1971, which holds testimony to the special relationship between our two countries,” the party said in a statement.Congress leader Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister when India defeated Pakistan in the Bangladesh liberation war.The formation of the Congress panel comes days after the government went all out to mark the Vijay Diwas that is observed annually on December 16 to celebrate the liberation of Bangladesh from Pakistan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the National War Memorial in New Delhi to mark the anniversary. The government has announced celebrations to commemorate the golden jubilee of the 1971 war.

30-12-2020||India||Amid protests over farm laws, BJP seeks to build support base in rural Punjab||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans a rural outreach in Punjab as it has identified a lack of leadership and a weak cadre across the state’s villages as a reason for its inability to break the impasse over three farm laws passed in September. The plan has been devised as the BJP is gearing to contest elections in Punjab on its own starting with the local polls in February following Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) exit from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The SAD quit the over two-decade-long alliance with the BJP in protest against the farm laws that have triggered protests. A BJP leader said the failure in nurturing leadership in rural Punjab has prevented the party from stemming the ongoing agitation against the laws and clear the misconceptions about them.Also Read: Farmers’ protests: Sixth round of talks today; unions want repeal of laws, higher MSP“The BJP could not convince the farmers of the benefits that they stand to gain once the laws are implemented. It did not help that the SAD, which was a part of the NDA, and therefore a part of the decision-making process played a double-game and backed out at the last moment. Had they been part of the NDA, it would have been easier for us to clear the misconceptions,” the leader said on condition of anonymity.BJP strategists have warned that a lack of direct contact with people in Punjab’s rural areas could upset its expansion plans ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. This has prompted the party to begin preparations for a membership drive in the rural areas, opening offices at the block levels and to identify candidates for the assembly polls.Former Union minister Vijay Sampla, who has been a Parliament member from Punjab, said they were making amends by focussing on rural areas. “When we were in alliance with the SAD, they kept us out of the rural areas. They did not allow BJP leaders to hold positions in the rural development bodies and would even dissuade us from holding public programmes in these areas. They back-stabbed us on the farm laws. So, the party will put in 10 times the effort required to build its base in Punjab.”Sampla rejected the perception that the BJP is on shaky ground in Punjab over the farm laws, saying they are not allowed to hold public programmes. “Just as the TMC [Trinamool Congress] government in West Bengal is not allowing BJP leaders to step out and hold programmes, the Congress government is doing the same in Punjab.” He added the Punjab government is worried the BJP without the SAD has emerged stronger. “On Monday, we met the state DGP [director general of police] to complain that we were not even allowed to hold public programmes to mark the [birth] anniversary of [late] former PM [Prime Minister] Atal Bihari Vajpayee [on December 25],” he said.A third leader said the local elections and finding candidates for all the seats will be the first big challenge for the party. “Earlier the SAD used to play big brother in the state and allocate seats to the BJP. Now we have to contest all the seats to increase our hold over the urban areas.”SS Jodhka, a sociology professor at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said caste and class factors will impact the BJP’s plans in Punjab. “It is natural for the party to want to have its own social base in Punjab. But in the current context, it would be difficult for the BJP. In the rural areas, there has been a communal divide as well with the Sikhs opting for the SAD and the urban Hindus the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-protests-over-farm-laws-bjp-seeks-to-build-support-base-in-rural-punjab/story-5SLTfXNOrDdMn1zpHtLgpI.html

Should this be done? Derogatory remarks should not be made against a Prime Minister. Prime Minister is not just an individual but an institution. In my political life, I have never used abusive words against any former Prime Minister. The kind of sloganeering done against the Prime Minister - ‘mar ja, mar ja’ this kind of sloganeering. I felt hurt,” he said.He said farmers should keep away people raising derogatory slogans.He said it is the duty of the opposition to maintain the prestige of the post of Prime Minister.“The opposition should understand its responsibility. I am no one to advise them but the institutions should be respected. If the institutions are weakened, democracy gets weak,” he said.He said the Prime Minister was serving the poor and marginalised from his heart.Singh said he has refrained from making any derogatory remarks about any former Prime Minister.“Once in my party, there was a remark made about former Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh but I had contradicted that remark at that time. I had said that Dr.Manmohan Singh is our Prime Minister and no derogatory remarks should be made against him. I have never used derogatory remarks against any Prime Minister, whether Narasimha Rao, HD Deve Gowda or anyone.” He added that he has always respected institutions, sometimes even going against party interests. “Till the day I will do politics, I will never break any tradition to criticise an institution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-says-prime-minister-is-not-just-a-person-but-an-institution-lashes-out-at-derogatory-remarks/story-NkA6tlEBkfhOE0ZLxiVEWO.html

30-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protests: Sixth round of talks today; unions want repeal of laws, higher MSP||The Union government will hold the sixth round of talks with protesting farmers’ unions on Wednesday, a fresh attempt to resolve a politically challenging strike by farmers who have encircled the Capital and want three recent pro-reform agricultural laws scrapped. Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal had sent out a letter to farm leaders on Monday, responding to an e-mail by the farm unions on December 26 in which they had agreed to restart negotiations after rejecting the government’s appeal to resume the dialogue process several times. In his letter, the farm secretary invited 40 leaders who represent the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of over 500 farm organisations involved in the month-long agitation over a set of reforms they say will hurt their livelihoods. The agriculture ministry’s invite, a copy of which HT has seen, had said the talks would be led by Union ministers. Three Union ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — are likely to represent the government side, an official said. Also Read: At Chilla border, farmers plan to launch protest march on Jan 26The farm ministry letter said officials would discuss issues related to farmers in the three laws, signalling the government’s broad strategy to find a solution by addressing points in the legislation that farmers may have objections to. In their December 26 email to the farm ministry, the farmers, however, stuck to their demand that talks must be geared towards a repeal of the laws. The farmers spelt out issues on which they want discussions (on modalities to repeal the laws and legal guarantee for MSP). In their email, they said the first issue they wanted discussions on were the “modalities (that are) to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts”.The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and erode the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates, known as minimum support prices (MSP). Second, the unions want “mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative MSP recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission into a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities.”These top two demands are the trickiest and are likely to be a test of the fate of negotiations.Although the government has made desperate attempts to restart negotiations with the unions, it is not prepared to scrap its reformist agenda. Instead, the government has proposed a set of concessions and amendments. These include greater oversight of proposed free markets and a written assurance on continuing the mechanism of MSP. The farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution, they stated in their letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-hold-sixth-round-of-talks-with-farmer-unions-today/story-TdyvdQHfDAlh3737ThzwvL.html

Everyone was free. Nobody was under detention and were free to move about. But the results which came out of the local bodies and gram panchayat polls have made it clear that terrorism and separatism were defeated and democracy won in Jammu and Kashmir,” Rajnath Singh said in an exclusive interview with ANI. He was asked about allegations levelled by National Conference and PDP that they were not given a level-playing field in the recent District Development Council elections in Jammu and Kashmir.The National Conference and PDP had fought the elections as part of People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD).

Independents won 50 seats and smaller parties also won on several seats.NC leader Omar Abdullah had alleged that the administration did not provide them a level playing field “at the behest of the ruling-BJP”.PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti had accused the Centre of “sabotaging” the participation of non-BJP parties in DDC polls.The panchayat elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 and the bypolls for vacant seats were held alongside DDC polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorism-was-defeated-democracy-won-in-local-body-polls-in-j-k-rajnath-singh/story-h2MM6Gn8Y5uQVKf2y1zDWM.html

This is a much needed safety norm which India should adopt and be at par with global standards,” FADA President Vinkesh Gulati said in a statement on Tuesday.He, added that while the government’s vision to make driving safer for its citizens is appreciated, it will definitely increase the price of vehicles. The implementation of BS-VI emission norms led to a big price increase, and this will also come with a price increase, he added.“We hope OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) absorb the major cost of input due to the second airbag as it will impact the sales in the short-term.

But no meaningful outcome has come and there is status quo,” the defence minister said.“If there is status quo, it is natural how deployment can be reduced. There will be no reduction in our deployment and I fell their deployment will also not come down. I don’t think that status-quo is a positive development at all. Talks are on and they result in a positive outcome, that is our expectation,” he added.Singh said that hotline messages have been exchanged.“On what issues talks will be held, an exchange of messages is taking place between the two countries,” he said.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said after the WMCC meeting on December 18 that both sides agreed to maintain close consultations at the diplomatic and military level.It said they agreed that the next (9th) round of Senior Commanders meeting should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-meaningful-outcome-of-talks-with-china-on-lac-standoff-rajnath-singh/story-pKaBb2JXkEOriBIhal2GcL.html

India has that capability, that power,” he said. India had carried out surgical strike on terror launch pads across the border in 2016 after Uri terror attack. It had carried out an aerial strike on terror camp in Balakot in 2019 following terror attack Pulwama. The minister had slammed Pakistan during the graduation parade at Airforce Academy in Dundigal earlier this month and said that the neighbouring country has continued with its “nefarious acts” on the border, even after losing four wars.

According to a study by Public Health England, the new variant does not cause illness more severe than other variants of the virus. Earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had approved placing more regions of the country under the highest level of restrictions - also known as tier 4. The country’s health chief further warned that England is “back in the eye” of the Covid-19 storm, with as many patients in hospital as during the initial peak in April.Here are the latest updates on the new Covid-19 variant: 1. The United States reported the first case of the variant in Colorado. State officials said that the variant was found in a man in his 20s who has been in isolation in Southeast Denver in Elbert County adding that he has no travel history. Dwayne Smith, director of public health for Elbert County said that there was a second suspected case of the new variant in the state, according to Colorado Politics.2. On Tuesday, six cases of the new variant were detected in India, prompting the government to direct genome sequencing of samples from all passengers who arrived in the country between December 9-22 and tested positive for coronavirus or were symptomatic. The Union health ministry added that all six infected passengers were in isolation and their close contacts were being traced.3. The Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association wrote to the Air India Director (Operations) demanding details regarding the variant. “We demand the company procure info from labs and promptly inform all pilots who have tested Covid positive and pilots who may test positive in future if they are infected with this deadlier variant of SARs-CoV-2,” the association said in the letter.Also Read: States scramble to locate hundreds of UK returnees4.

Delhi’s daily Covid-19 tally has been below the 1,000-mark for five consecutive days with 703 new cases reported on Tuesday. Over 84,000 coronavirus tests were conducted in the last 24 hours.5. Chile on Tuesday recorded its first case of the British variant of Covid-19 which led to authorities reinstating a compulsory quarantine period for all visitors entering the country from abroad. Chilean undersecretary of health Paula Daza said a Chilean woman who returned on December 22 had tested positive for the variant. adding that Daz said that the woman had travelled to London to visit family adding that she was asymptomatic, in quarantine and in good health.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today6.

30-12-2020||India||Centre, farmer unions to hold sixth round of talks today, protesters firm on demand for repeal of laws||The Centre and the protesting farmer unions will hold talks on Wednesday, the sixth round of dialogue between the two sides to resolve the deadlock. The talks will be held in Delhi after the farmer unions agreed to restart negotiations.The Centre had sent an invitation on Monday to these unions for holding the talks. The farmers are sticking to their position that the parleys will only be on the modalities of repealing the three new farm laws and giving a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) among other issues.Ahead of the crucial talks, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal on Tuesday met senior BJP leader and home minister Amit Shah.Tomar, the minister for agriculture, and Goyal, the minister for food and consumer affairs, and MoS commerce and Industry Som Parkash have been representing the Centre at the talks with the farmers. Tomar had said on Monday that he is hopeful of an early solution to the impasse.Total five rounds of talks, including one each on December 1, 3 and 5, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides. The sixth round was originally scheduled for December 9, but talks were called off after an informal meeting of home minister Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough.Farmer unions have deferred to Thursday their proposed tractor march against the contentious agriculture laws, so that the rally does not clash with their talks with the government.Thousands of protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points - Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri - for over a month, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee for MSP.The opposition has also been pressurising the government to find a solution to end this impasse. While the Congress is demanding an immediate repeal of the three laws, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) accused the Centre of bulldozing the farm laws without consulting states.NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that the opposition parties will take a call on their future course of action on Wednesday if the government fails to resolve the impasse.The three laws being opposed by the protesters are Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 which were passed by Parliament in September.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-farmer-unions-to-hold-sixth-round-of-talks-today-protesters-firm-on-demand-for-repeal-of-laws/story-SRsnWNtFLuDvaBciFL794K.html

30-12-2020||India||How the economy fared: the masses felt the brunt of Covid-19||The Indian economy was battling a crisis even before the Covid-19 pandemic threw it off the rails. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been falling for the past three years. From a peak of 8.26% in 2016-17, GDP growth slowed to 4.18% in 2019-20. To make matters worse, there were questions on the veracity of official GDP data – and when Arvind Subramanian, chief economic advisor in the Narendra Modi government’s first term, argued that the numbers were overestimates, the credibility crisis grew much bigger. That the government itself held back the release of a report on employment until the 2019 elections and junked a consumption survey after the findings were leaked to the media further muddied the waters. Then, Covid-19 struck. Come August 2020, when GDP estimates for the quarter ended June were released, all this took backstage, and for a valid reason. Thanks to a nationwide 68-day hard lockdown that started on March 25, India’s GDP contracted by a massive 24%. There has been a sequential recovery since, with the September contraction easing to 7.5%, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the economy to shrink by 7.5% in the current fiscal year. The public discourse has suddenly shifted from high growth to merely growth. RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee’s projections of the economy growing at 0.1% and 0.7% in the quarters ending December 2020 and March 2021 have been received with enthusiasm. Also Read | Unprecedented rise in China’s ‘market-subverting’ impact on global economy going forward: Niti AayogThat the Indian economy is making a sequential recovery (month-on-month) is beyond doubt. Measures such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) suggest that economic activity is already very close to pre-pandemic levels. However, that is not the central question anymore. Come June 2021, the base effect will give an artificial boost to growth numbers for at least four quarters. For instance, even if the June 2021 GDP growth rate is 20%, it would mean that in absolute terms the GDP would still be lower than what it was in the quarter ending June 2019. The real economic challenge for India lies beyond 2021-22. Once the favourable base effect has subsided, what will India’s growth trajectory be? It is this question that has polarised economists. One school of thought – the government subscribes to this – is that the pandemic’s shock has unleashed what the Austrian-born Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter described as the process of creative destruction. Inefficient businesses and policies, which were holding back the India growth story, have perished with the pandemic and what awaits us is a radical realignment of productive resources which will unleash hitherto untapped tailwinds for growth. This would not have been possible had the government not unleashed second generation reforms in critical areas such as agriculture and labour, which its predecessors shied away from implementing, not because of ideological differences but lack of political will and mandate. More could happen on this front, especially on disinvestment and perhaps corporate houses being allowed to run banks once again. There are credible and respected economists who subscribe to this.The other school of thought – and this too has credible economists subscribing to it -- believes that the pandemic’s shock will only exacerbate the crisis the economy found itself in earlier. The pre-pandemic economic slowdown was not a result of lack of second-generation reforms, but a lack of demand, they argue. India’s rich, while they are a significant number in absolute terms, are not enough to drive the country’s macro growth story. They might also have increased their precautionary savings in the wake of the pandemic. It is the poor, who spend a much larger part of what they earn, sometimes even more, who matter for mass demand and hence growth. It is this large underclass, whose incomes took a hit from policies such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax, which has also suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. While the policy response offered them subsistence-level support through increased allocations on the rural employment guarantee scheme and free rations, it has not done much to provide what economists refer to as a fiscal counter-cyclical boost. On the contrary, the reforms, which are being held up as revolutionary, might trigger a fresh income squeeze on this underclass. In the name of getting rid of local middlemen, farmers may be exposed to corporate buyers with much larger bargaining power than earlier. The labour reforms might have done away with even basic protections at workplace. The current recovery is more likely to be profit-led than wage-led, economists are telling us. This also means that it has a much smaller base. The pandemic’s headwinds to mass demand could generate a vicious cycle and stall growth. Also Read | Post-Covid economic recovery: Can the rich also hurt growth?Both arguments have their merits – and their proponents. It is unlikely that the debate will be settled anytime soon. And interestingly, there are enough data points to support both arguments. If high-frequency indicators support one, consumer confidence surveys, support the other. And we will not have anytime soon, the comprehensive employment and consumption spending data (the best proxy for income data in India) that is indispensible for this debate to be settled this way or the other. This is exactly why the state of politics needs to be tracked as closely as the economy. In Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a leader whose popular appeal is unmatched by any Indian politician in decades. While there is a clear ideological, Hindutva component to Modi’s popularity, it is also based on a simultaneous process of delivering centralised welfare benefits to a large number of poor people. The ability to keep delivering on this front depends on budgetary resources, themselves a function of overall economic growth. While moves such as demonetisation and the implementation of GST in Modi’s first term were portrayed as a surgical strike against the corrupt, current second generation reforms are being sold as changes which will boost the income (not asset holdings such as toilets, or houses or cooking gas cylinders) of the poor. Which is why the only thing that can be said with certainty at this point of time is that the jury assessing the economy’s performance is likely to move beyond economists and expand to include the people at large. Limited capacity to absorb Covid-19 shock due to downturnThe Indian economy was in an acute downturn even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell from 8.3% in 2016-17 to just 4.2% in 2019-20. The slowdown came against the backdrop of two big policy disruptions to the economy: demonetisation in November 2016 and the roll-out of Goods and Services Tax in July 2017. Because both government revenue and corporate health took a hit from the prolonged slowdown, the capacity of the Indian economy to absorb the Covid-19 shock was already limited.  Among major economies globally, one of the worst hitIndia has been among the worst hit by the economic impact of Covid-19. According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook published in October, India’s GDP is expected to contract by 10.3% this year. This is a much higher contraction than that expected for most major economies of the world. While economic growth is expected to increase sharply to 8.8% in the next fiscal year, this is more a reflection of the base effect and the 2021-22 GDP is likely to be lower than the 2019-20 level. To be sure, many other institutional and private forecasters have projected a lower contraction . For example, the Reserve Bank of India has projected a 7.5% contraction in India’s GDP this year. Even if the RBI’s projection turns out to be correct, the fact remains that India will be among the worst performing major economies this year.  Fiscal stimulus not enough of a responseIndia imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns among all countries in the world on March 25. For the next 68 days, when the maximum restrictions were in place, economic activity took a huge hit. It was primarily the lockdown that led to a collapse in GDP in the June quarter this year, causing growth to contract by a record 23.9%. Once the restrictions were eased, a sequential economic recovery has been gaining momentum. Most high frequency indicators, be it the Nomura India Business Resumption Index or Purchasing Managers’ Indices, capture this trend clearly. While most economists agree that India has done well to deal with the supply-side impact of the pandemic, the jury is still out on whether or not this sequential recovery will face demand-side headwinds.  Economic recovery gaining momentumWhile India imposed one of the harshest lockdowns to deal with the spread of the virus, the economic policy response to the pandemic, at least the fiscal part of it, has been among the weakest in the world. A very large part of the economic policy response to Covid-19 has focused on credit guarantees and liquidity measures, even as calls for fiscal intervention to spur demand and income growth became louder. While the government did announce some key pro-poor measures such as increasing allocation on the rural employment guarantee programme and providing free rations, their overall fiscal impact was limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-economy-fared-the-masses-felt-the-brunt-of-covid-19/story-88Hpt6wCC5ZUkl4lLIawFL.html
30-12-2020||India||6 UK returnees positive for new coronavirus mutation||Six cases of a more infectious strain of the coronavirus have been found in people who arrived from the UK, the government said on Tuesday, before top experts called for “extraordinary precautions” and senior officials indicated that a flight ban on the UK may be extended further to stop the spread of the mutation. All six of the infected people were now in isolation, the health ministry said in a statement, adding that their fellow travellers and close contacts were being traced. At least one of them, 47-year-old Mary Winfred Ann Parrie, left the quarantine facility at Delhi airport after landing, and took a train to Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh before she was tracked down.In all, the government has identified over 30,000 people who returned from UK to monitor for infections, but the effort has been complicated by many disclosing inaccurate contact details. Also Read | States scramble to locate hundreds of UK returnees“Data from UK confirms it is more transmissible. The variant is spreading there very rapidly and displacing other variants. This is very important globally because increased transmission will increase number of people infected and therefore number of severe cases. That’s why we should take extraordinary precautions,” said K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor (PSA) to the government, while adding that the mutations seen in the variant do not appear to be such that will make current coronavirus vaccines ineffective.  Earlier in the day, the Union health ministry confirmed that genomic testing had found the new variant – at present known as VOC-202012/01 – in three samples at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Hospital (Nimhans) Bengaluru, in two at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad and in one at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. State officials later disclosed that three of these people were from Karnataka, and one each from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. “All these persons have been kept in single room isolation at designated health care facilities by respective state governments and their close contacts have also been put under quarantine,” the Union ministry said. First detected in London and Kent in mid-September, the variant was identified by UK authorities as a matter of concern on December 14. They later disclosed evidence that it appeared to be more transmissible, and was behind a spike in cases in the country’s capital as well as its south-east. The variant has 23 changes in its genome, eight of which appear to influence the spike protein that the pathogen uses to latch on to host cells. Some of the other changes could make it more adept at infecting susceptible cells and possibly even evade some immune response, although detailed studies are underway. In a preliminary assessment released late on Monday, UK scientists estimated that VOC-202012/01 did not lead to more deaths or hospitalisations but caused noticeably more secondary infections than the older variant. “Vaccines will work against the new variants. They help develop wide range of neutralizing antibodies, so the whole repertoire of protective antibodies that is being created with the current set of vaccines is enough to tackle the current variations in the virus,” said VijayRaghavan.A second top expert, Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said significant mutations such as the new variant could impact infection control efforts. “This can destabilise systems in India as well as the world. This particular strain may have its own run, hence we have to be very careful,” he said, while also urging people to not let their guard down during New Year celebrations. “Please remember it’s easy to suppress a new virus in the beginning because chain of transmission is smaller,” he added. Both officials outlined several steps the government was taking to tackle the new threat. These include regular testing of a proportion of positive samples by a new consortium of government labs called Insacog and aggressive test-and-trace activities for those who returned from UK as well as any other individual who is found with the new strain.Paul and VijayRaghavan were part of the government’s weekly briefing on the Covid-19 situation in the country. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan opened the briefing, the last for the year, by highlighting numbers that reflected the outbreak was receding in the country. “The cumulative positivity rate is now 6.02%, and over the last week, it has come down to 2.25%,” he said.To protect these gains, the public will need to keep their guard up, the officials reiterated.“The numbers are showing consistent decline, which is very reassuring. This is particularly since several nations are facing a devastating situation and that is also a very sobering moment for all of us,” said Paul, urging people not to hold large New Year parties since “they can become superspreading events”.Experts said not much changes in terms of how the disease is handled, based on what is known about the UK variant. “It (new strain) was always likely. Nothing changes in terms of what we need to do. Usual precautions will work well for this variant as well,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-uk-returnees-positive-for-new-coronavirus-mutation/story-g0caDjko5oskQaIDvxA9RK.html
30-12-2020||India||Where India stands in global Covid-19 spread||The graph of daily new Covid-19 cases and deaths in India has been on a decreasing trend for at least three months, after daily new cases and deaths peaked in mid-September. An average of nearly 22,000 new cases was recorded in India every day in the week ending December 27, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. This is less than a quarter of the nearly 92,000 daily new cases reported on average in mid-September . This drop in new cases is not a reflection of a global trend. The daily new cases in countries such as the US and Russia continue to grow. This trend has now placed India in a better place globally in terms of the Coronavirus disease than it was three to four months ago.India’s share of new Covid-19 cases down to 4.5%India imposed a stringent lockdown to curb the spread of the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in late March while its daily new cases peaked in the middle of September. India’s share of new confirmed infections in the world kept increasing every month in this period. Less than 1% of the new cases in March were reported from India while its share in new cases in September was an overwhelming 31%, which means nearly every third positive case in the world was reported in India. This is based on data compiled by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The number of new cases India reported in August and September was more than any other country (the US, with half the number of new cases, was in the second position). In terms of deaths as well, India was the country with the highest number of reported Covid-19-related deaths in September.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe figures look better now. This month (upto December 27), India was behind two other countries (US and Brazil) in terms of new reported cases while it was behind seven other countries in terms of new reported deaths. India’s share of new cases decreased from 31% in September to only 4.5% in December. The country’s share of deaths fell from 20.5% in September to 3.5% this month (again, upto December 27). This means India is not as significant a contributor to global Covid-19 cases and deaths as it was in September. India has not seen a second wave of casesAmong the five countries with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, India is the only one to not have seen a second wave of cases, at least as of now. It has been about 10 months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, and many big countries have seen multiple waves of new cases in this period. The US and the UK are in their third wave of cases while countries such as Italy, France and Spain have recently crossed their second waves. Russia seems to be near the peak of its second wave now. But the case trajectory in India shows a clear peak in mid-September followed by a continued drop in the daily new cases. There was only a brief disruption in this decreasing trend in mid-November when cases in some of India’s big states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan started increasing again, signalling the possibility of a second wave. But that did not hold for long and cases across India continued to decrease. This has happened despite the country seeing potential superspreader events such as Diwali that was marked by large crowds gathering in marketplaces and the Bihar assembly elections. India has a low death rateIndia has the second highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world but the country is in the third position for the total number of deaths. This gap would have been wider if only new cases and deaths are taken into account, with India being in third place by number of new cases in December and in eighth place by number of new deaths. This is because India’s case fatality rate (deaths as a share of confirmed cases) is low, in fact the lowest among 10 countries with the highest number of deaths. Nearly 148,000 people have died of Covid-19 in India, which is 1.4% of nearly 10.2 million confirmed cases so far. Among the top 10 countries, the fatality rate is the highest in Mexico, at 8.8%. The US has 87% more cases than India, but 125% more deaths. On the other hand, India has 37% more cases than Brazil but has reported 23% fewer deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-india-stands-in-global-covid-19-spread/story-7nWIEZHEbjmYsazJP4HMOL.html
30-12-2020||India||Experimental therapies not to be used indiscriminately, warns ICMR||The India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday warned against indiscriminate use of experimental therapies in treating patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , saying it puts too much immune pressure on the Sars-Cov-2 virus, causing it to mutate faster.The warning comes in the backdrop of the discovery in the UK of a new variant of the virus that causes Covid-19. The new strain, scientists say, is more transmissible than the original one. “The question arises why should these variations occur? These variations occur because of the immune pressure on the virus. The immune pressure on the virus may be related to the environment, may be related to the host, or may be related to your treatment, or may be related to other modalities which cause this pressure on the virus. Therefore, it is important from the scientific community perspective also that we do not put immune pressure on the virus,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. Dr Bhargava’s remarks came at the government press briefing on Covid-19 updates on Tuesday.Six UK returnees have tested positive for the new UK variant of Sars-Cov-2, according to the initial results of genome sequencing of positive samples released by the Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomics Consortium (INASCOG) labs on Tuesday. Three of the samples that came in positive for the new UK variant were from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, two from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and one from ICMR-National Institute Virology, Pune.“Also, why we have to maintain judicious use of therapies which are going to benefit; if their benefit is not established, we should not use those therapies otherwise they would put tremendous immune pressure on the virus, and the virus will tend to mutate more. Therapies that are well established should be used, and those that are not well-established their judicious use has to happen,” Bhargava added.Critics of convalescent plasma therapy in the past had pointed out how its indiscriminate use could lead to significant mutations in the virus.From November 25 to the midnight of December 23, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from UK.All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by the states to Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR) tests to detect Covid-19. Of all the samples tested, 114 samples have been found Covid-19 positive so far. These positive samples have been sent to 10 INSACOG labs for genome sequencing.Bhargava said: “Genetic mutations occur in these respiratory viruses; and these minor drifts may occur from time to time. Once several drifts occur then they can become important and can become the variant as has happened in the United Kingdom, which has higher transmissibility of about 60% or so. That is a point of concern although we are testing in India for the variations regularly.”Genomics experts, however, say there is not much of a change in terms of how the disease is handled after finding the new UK variant in India.“It was always likely. Nothing changes in terms of what we need to do. Usual precautions will work well for this variant as well,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Clinical microbiologists also say that the testing process will also largely remain the same in laboratories.“Increased transmissibility means more people will get infected and since there are no implications on the pathogenicity, which is its ability to cause disease, it isn’t much of a concern. For Covid-19 detection the same RT-PCR testing will be conducted, and government’s surveillance system is already in place that will be conducting large-scale genome sequencing to check for the new variant. So nothing essentially changes on ground,” said Dr Navin Kumar, head of clinical microbiology and infection prevention, Manipal Hospital, New Delhi. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experimental-therapies-not-to-be-used-indiscriminately-warns-icmr/story-XLCI9Zvl4gXRMnOnrQYbVI.html
30-12-2020||India||PM inaugurates 351-km dedicated freight corridor in UP, hits out at previous govts||Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated on Tuesday the 351-km New Bhaupur-New Khurja section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) and Operation Control Centre (OCC) in Uttar Pradesh’s  Prayagraj via video conferencing. Speaking at the inauguration, the PM also accused the previous governments of delaying the dedicated freight corridor project and ignoring modernisation of railways. “Our past experiences tell us that the infrastructure projects related to the country’s development should be kept out of politics. The country’s infrastructure is not tied to any party’s ideology. It is not meant for five years, but a mission to benefit the people of the country.”The prime minister further stressed that this project was the living example of the work culture of his government, as the freight project was given permission in 2006 but the then government lacked the “seriousness and urgency” with which it had to take it up with the states. However, he added, “till 2014, not a single km track of the project was laid and the funds sanctioned could not be spent properly. After 2014 ,it was restarted and officials asked to take it forward and by then the budget had gone up by 11 times”.The 351 km Khurja – Bhaupur section in the Eastern DFC, Uttar Pradesh, is built at a cost of Rs 5,750 crores.The new stations in this section are Bhaupur, Kanchausi, Achalda, Ekdil, Bhadan, Makhanpur, Tundla, Hathras, Daudkan & Khurja.  Some of the important Industrial Areas that straddle this section are Aligarh, Khurja, Firozabad and Agra, railway ministry said.“The Dedicated Freight Corridor shall reform the transportation sector and will create more capacity on trunk routes of Indian Railways as goods trains shall be able to ply freely on Dedicated Freight Corridor without any restrictions imposed by movement of passenger trains,” the ministry said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-inaugurates-351-km-dedicated-freight-corridor-in-up-hits-out-at-previous-govts/story-LTA6pWggrXJ0SLKxoOIwrN.html
30-12-2020||India||Pakistan has become pawn in Chinese policy: IAF chief RKS Bhadauria||Pakistan has increasingly become a pawn of China and the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan has opened options for Beijing to expand its influence in the region through Islamabad, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Tuesday.In an address at a seminar organised by think-tank Vivekananda International Foundation, he said Pakistan’s dependence on China is going to increase as the country is set to reel under a Chinese debt-trap.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said India’s “most important” national security challenge is to understand China, its “possible game plan” and the deepening and evolving Sino-Pak relationship.“Pakistan has increasingly become a pawn in Chinese policy. Under an increasing CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) related debt trap, we are going to witness further military dependencies in the future,” he said.“The US exit from Afghanistan has opened increased options for China in the region -- both direct and through Pakistan -- allowing it a possible entry into Central Asia, a region that they have been eyeing for long,” the IAF chief added.The Air Chief Marshal said coercion and economic dependence are being used as tools for making weaker countries accept one-sided actions, in an apparent reference to China.“We are now witnessing a rise in attempts to alter the status quo through wanton disregard or selective interpretation of established international laws and norms. Coercion and economic dependence are being used as tools for making weaker countries accept one-sided actions, thereby undermining the established order itself at the international level,” he said.“Fragile states find it convenient to align with dominant powers to ensure regime survival, thereby affecting the regional security scenario further and something we need to increasingly factor in in our national security matrix,” he added.Replying to a question on possible military cooperation among India, the US, Japan and Australia under the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition, he did not rule out such a possibility and indicated that discussions are underway.“Quad, as a kind of execution, has not happened so far. But as a plan of action, it is possible,” he said.Without naming China, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria also referred to the “debt-trap diplomacy” to achieve geopolitical goals by ensnaring the recipient countries with loans that cannot be repaid.He said it has allowed “foreign created and controlled” ports and facilities very close to the Indian mainland and island territories. “With the new PLA doctrines underscoring the importance of developing force projection capabilities to counter US global dominance, there is a direct impact of such development on our security matrix,” he said.“For example, what happens if China was to use one of such launching pads for an action against us in a conflict situation? Does the third country port or launching pad become a target for us or not? What are the implications? It is something we need to factor in, it is something that needs to go into our planning process and thinking process,” he said.Talking about national security challenges, the IAF chief said there are very few major states that still have unsettled borders to the extent India does to its north.“On our northern borders, the Himalayan barrier, which separated South Asia from China, has been literally flattened by the massive infrastructural development and the time it takes to travel large distances has really shrunk,” he said.“The western border has been active from the day Pakistan was created. In addition to the terrorism inflicted upon us through proxy actions, we have been thwarting continuous attempts by our adversary to breach our territory and sovereignty on many occasions,” he said.The IAF chief said the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific regions are witnessing a tectonic shift in the strategic sphere as the maritime trade and the economic centre of gravity drift towards them.“With the West and the US in a strategic retreat for the last couple of years, it has opened up a window of opportunity for a geo-strategic realignment and this is being largely shaped by China. China’s rapid economic growth and expanding economy has allowed it to invest heavily into military technology and research and development,” he said.

30-12-2020||India||When Zoom became a verb, and home, an office||Till February 2020, the 29-year-old (name withheld to protect identity) was an upwardly mobile driver in Chennai. In 2016, he bought three cars spending upward of Rs 35 lakh — to ferry passengers for an aggregator service. His equated monthly instalments (EMIs) come to Rs 26,000, but he hired two drivers and his own expenses were low. Having migrated from a village in Villupuram four years ago, he lived with three other unmarried men like himself in a hostel in Teynampet; he enjoyed his work, driving in the streets of the big city, striking up conversations with people from around the country, and sometimes, the world. Then, in March, his life was upended as India declared a lockdown.“I haven’t been able to pay my EMIs since March,” he said. After the moratorium on loans announced by the Reserve Bank of India ended August 31, he requested his bank to excuse him till the year-end. “I don’t know what I’m going to do next year,” he said. Though he has been back on the road since June, when Tamil Nadu allowed cabs and autos to ply again, passengers are few. His drivers have long quit their jobs and returned to their villages. “I don’t know how much longer we can rely on driving for a living,” he said.Around nine kilometers away, the 15,000 sq ft office of SaaS (software as a service) company, Kissflow Inc, in Tidel Park — complete with a pool table, a café bar and swings as seating — is being made ready for the 225-odd employees set to return starting January 2021 in a “3+1” workflow model adopted by founder Suresh Sambandam. They have been working from home since the national lockdown was announced. In the new system, every fourth week, a cluster of teams that work together will be asked to come to office —it’s voluntary, Sambandam added. “We want them to come to work, hang out with each other, go into huddles. This will help teams bond and it’s fine that only 50% of the work is getting done that week,” he said. The rest of the time, they will continue to work from home. And the town hall meetings, which took place every Friday for all employees, will continue to take place over video conferencing.The pandemic has affected work and life in a manner that has been both unprecedented and disruptive. Zoom, once an app, is now a verb, and it’s not the only indication of its meteoric rise in popularity. On August 31, video conferencing app makers, Zoom Video Communications posted $663.5 million in revenue in the second quarter. In comparison, last year, its revenue was $145.8 million. As offices began to ask their employees to work from home (WFH) — India’s largest software services company, Tata Consultancy Services, announced that up to 75% of its global workforce will work from home by 2025 for instance — it became clear that such digital tools would become the norm.However, the pandemic was also a year where joblessness soared. According to a livelihood survey carried out by researchers of Azim Premji University among nearly 5,000 self-employed, casual, and regular wage workers across 12 states, nearly 87% of the self-employed workers in urban areas reported that they had lost their employment. The survey also found a massive increase in unemployment and a dramatic fall in earnings. Even those who were still employed saw a fall in earnings.For 35-year-old Ganga, who sold fruit in Delhi’s Shankar Market before Covid struck, this year has pushed her further into precarity. Ganga, who lost her income when the lockdown was instituted and markets were closed, eventually found work in a small-scale factory. However, her income was considerably less. To spin a wheel that wrapped bicycle tyres, she would receive as little as 40 paise a wheel; it added up to anywhere between Rs 5,000 to 6,000 a month. In December, the factory asked Ganga to leave because the supply of wheels to wrap fell short. Experiences have been disparate, but a common concern emerged around the world: companies were forced to consider how the open office could be made safer for clusters of employees.  At an online webinar in April, Delhi-based architect Manit Rastogi, founding partner of architecture firm Morphogenesis, predicted that larger companies may consider a hub-and-spoke model: smaller offices or spokes that lie close to their employees’ homes which do not require them to run the risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus by travelling to the main office, or the hub. In this solution, technology serves as the bridge. “We have moved from an industrial model of work, everyone clocking in and out, to a post-pandemic model, which is about productivity,” Rastogi said. Furniture-makers have teamed up with scientists to research what constitutes a safe open office. In June, US furniture company Steelcase announced that it had teamed up with disease transmission specialist Dr Lydia Bouroubia, the director of The Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been studying the spread of pathogens through fluids like droplets in the air. Other companies introduced new products into the market tapping into that very basic need of any office goer: comfortable workspaces. Subodh Mehta, senior vice president (B2C) Godrej Interio said that their work from home furniture range, which previously “comprised about 3% of the sales, increased five times” during the lockdown and subsequent unlock months. This included sales of the 30 new products launched this year.However, author Aparna Piramal Raje said WFH was more of a “living at work” situation, which isn’t sustainable. Most companies, she argued, will come up with a “hybrid plan”. Sambandam’s Kissflow is already on it.(With inputs from Divya Chandrababu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-zoom-became-a-verb-and-home-an-office/story-2RlqLn3QOUvlaVG6yd0UCL.html
30-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Six cases of Covid-19 caused by Sars-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (or B.1.1.7 as some are calling it) have been diagnosed in India. All six are patients who flew in from the UK over the past week, who tested positive for the virus, and whose samples were then sent for genome sequencing which confirmed the presence of the mutant strain – it has up to 23 mutations – of the coronavirus that was first sequenced in the UK in September. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone (over the past week, I’ve repeatedly emphasised that there is a high likelihood of the variant already being in India). The new strain is the predominant one in the UK, especially London; there have been 70 flights a week from the UK to India since May; and until last Monday, when it was tightened, the screening process for passengers arriving in India was a sham (it had started off well, but, over time, came to rely more on documentation and self-declaration and less on the actual screening itself).The identification of the new strain here should spur health authorities in India to aggressively trace all those who travelled to India from the UK over the past month (at the least). Some of them may be asymptomatic carriers who have passed on the virus to others. The contact tracing process is hampered by human stupidity – at least some of the people who have travelled into India from the UK, it emerges, have provided false addresses or phone numbers; some recent travellers are believed to be keeping their phones switched off so that they cannot be reached (see page 11). This is behaviour that is potentially harmful not just to themselves and the people in their immediate vicinity (friends and family), but the public at large.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageDispatch 233, on December 28, explained that researchers in the UK have found out that the new strain is 56% more infective than the old one. It isn’t known whether the mutant strain causes more severe cases of Covid-19 or results in more fatalities, but this is actually irrelevant. The mere fact that the variant is more infective is enough: this logically means more cases of the coronavirus disease. Even assuming that the rate of hospitalisations and deaths does not change at all for the new variant (and is exactly the same as it is for Sars-CoV-2), the higher number of cases (caused by the higher infectiveness of the variant) will mean more hospitalisations and more deaths. And even assuming the proportion of hospitalisations that turns into severe cases remains constant, it means an increase in the number of severe cases. Indeed, because the higher infectiveness means more infections, which means even more infections, and so on, in a classic exponential progression, the new strain leads to a scenario which results in more deaths than even an increase in the case fatality rate would. That’s all the more reason for health authorities here to trace and isolate, something that most states have become pretty careless about, with the number of daily new cases falling. India ended Monday with just around 270,000 active cases, according to the HT dashboard (the US has 7.7 million).Also Read | Where India stands in global Covid-19 spreadIndia is the 21st country to have identified the new variant of the virus. The others are: Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Israel, Canada, Lebanon, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France. There is another strain, which shares some characteristics of B.1.1.7 that has been identified in South Africa and Nigeria. Over the course of the week, the last of the year, more countries will identify the UK strain in people testing positive, just as India itself will see more cases caused by the new strain. It’s a year-end challenge that the country should negotiate carefully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-Vuq1mRYWOLbJbeUDiryerJ.html
30-12-2020||India||GST revenue may exceed Rs 1 lakh crore for third consecutive month||Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in December are expected to exceeded Rs 1 lakh crore for the third consecutive month, signifying sustained recovery in business activity. Revenue from the tax on consumption has been on an uptrend after staying in contraction mode for six months in a row since March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 68-day nationwide hard lockdown.According to available data so far, GST collections look good, with increased demand from consumers in the festive season, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity. The finance ministry will release GST revenue data on Friday.“Even key economic indicators point towards a sustained recovery. GDP (gross domestic product) numbers for the second quarter is quite encouraging compared to the previous quarter. This improvement will be reflected in the GST revenues,” one of the officials said.EY India chief policy advisor DK Srivastava said, “The high frequency indicators have been showing a slow but sustained turnaround.” India’s GDP contraction moderated sharply at 7.5% in the second quarter of 2020-21 compared to 23.9% in the preceding quarter. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing remained high at 56.3 in November, while PMI services was at 53.7 in November. An index of over 50 in PMI indicates expansion.Reflecting the trend, GST collections have shown positive growth since September. While GST revenue in September could not cross the Rs 1 lakh crore benchmark, it still saw a 4% growth to Rs 95,480 crore that month compared to a year ago. Revenue collection in October saw an impressive 10% year-on-year growth to Rs 1,05,155 crore. And collections in November also saw a 1.4% year-on-year growth to Rs 1,04,963 crore.Rajesh Gupta, co-founder and director of accounting software firm Busy Infotech, expects GST collection in December to exceed the November figure of Rs 1,04,963 crore.But he cautioned that the demand could decline after the festive season. “Government should take measures in advance to support businesses post festive season because sustaining the collections in the months of February and March will be a real challenge,” he said.Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the financial technology platform ClearTax, said, “GST collections for December 2020 are expected to remain stable at current levels due to the ongoing festive and holiday season. Further, the implementation of the e-invoicing system since October 2020 will continue to scale the numbers. The system curbs fake invoicing and (fake) input tax credit menace to a greater extent.”Gupta added that the December number could also benefit from a backlog. “To some extent, tax payments via Form DRC-03 while filing GST annual returns for FY 2018-19 & FY 2019-20, due by 31 December , may contribute to the revenue coffers,” he said. Form DRC-03 is a digital intimation of payment made by the taxpayer voluntarily or made against a show cause notice issued by authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-may-exceed-rs-1-lakh-crore-for-third-consecutive-month/story-JWrgbg1NEkANkd8wQHcrMO.html
30-12-2020||India||‘Political murder’: Kumaraswamy decries death of Karnataka legislative council deputy chairman||JDS leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy condoled the passing away of Karnataka legislative council deputy chairman SL Dharmegowda on Tuesday and called it a “political murder”. He said, “He was more than a brother to me. He was very hurt by the way he was treated by some members during the recent council proceedings and felt humiliated. It is not suicide but a political murder.”Kumaraswamy was referring to a recent one day sitting of the council where the BJP and the JDS joined hands to try and remove legislative council chairman Prathapchandra Shetty who belongs to Congress by bringing in a no-confidence motion. Dharmegowda tried to preside over the proceedings but was manhandled by some Congress members with Shetty later rejecting the motion citing procedural lapses.Dharmegowda’s body was recovered from a railway track at Gunasagar village of Kadur Taluk in Chikmagalur district in the early hours of Tuesday, state police said.65-year-old Gowda is believed to have died by suicide. The police are examining an alleged death note found near his body. According to police sources, Gowda had asked his official gunman and escort to leave him alone on Monday evening. He had left his home in Shakarayapatna in an old personal Santro car with his driver and came to Gunasagar at around 6 pm. He then asked his driver Dharmaraj to leave him alone and wait at a distance as he had to meet someone.Also read: ‘Chinese air force heavily deployed in Ladakh theatre in support of PLA’ - IAF chiefHis last call is said to have been to a friend named Hemant and he is said to have made enquiries about train timings. When Gowda did not return home even late at night, worried family members are said to have alerted authorities who mounted a search. By then, his cellphone was turned off but based on his last cell signals, they searched and located his body on the Mankenahalli railway track.The police sent the body for autopsy to McGann Hospital in Shivamogga and he was later buried at the Madagadakere farmhouse that the family owns in Shakaryapatna. The JD(S) MLC is said to have been distressed over the way he was treated by some members during recent chaos in the council when he was manhandled.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa, leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah, KPCC president DK Shivakumar and former PM Deve Gowda were among other leaders who expressed shock and condoled the death of Dharmegowda.Leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah rejected Kumaraswamy’s charges and said, ‘he was a personal friend to me. His father Lakshmaiah who was a legislator was well known to me and the entire family was close to me. One has to look who forced him to sit (in the council chairman’s chair)”.CM Yediyurappa too condoled the death and flew to Kadur to play his last respects. “The entire state is shocked by the demise. I pray to God to give his family strength to face this,” he said.Former PM Deve Gowda broke down while talking about Dharmegowda and said, “It is shocking to learn the news of deputy speaker of state legislative council and JDS leader SL Dharmegowda’s suicide. He was a calm and decent man. This is a loss of the state.”Revenue minister R Ashoka too blamed the opposition’s behaviour towards Dharmegowda for his extreme step. “I have been told that he has mentioned this incident of what happened in the Council recently in the note that has been recovered. We will know once the full investigation is complete.”Also read: CDC forecasts 400,000 US Covid deaths before Trump’s exitA close associate of JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy, Gowda hailed from an influential political family. His father SR Lakshmaiah was a three-time MLA from Birur assembly constituency and Gowda himself had once been elected from there in 2004. Gowda’s brother SL Bhojegowda is also an MLC.Speaking to HT Bhojegowda said, “There were no personal or financial reasons for him to take this extreme step. He was upset about what had happened (in the council). I and other party leaders had told him not to take things to heart as these are common in politics, but he seemed to have taken it very seriously.” Police have not released the content of the alleged death note. A case has been registered in Ariskere police station and senior police officials said that further investigations are on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-murder-kumaraswamy-decries-death-of-karnataka-legislative-council-deputy-chairman/story-HbPPPXL5vR2f8NuaEfPIPJ.html
30-12-2020||India||At 3.6 degrees, Delhi feels like 2° due to strong, chilly winds||Residents of north-west India shivered in cold wave or severe cold wave conditions on Tuesday, with icy winds blowing across the Capital making the weather seem more frigid than it actually was. The Safdarjung observatory, which provides representative weather data for Delhi, recorded a minimum temperature of 3.6 degrees Celsius.Delhi’s “feels like” temperature, which takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body perceives the temperature, was as low as 2 degrees Celsius, weather scientists said. That was mainly because of strong, chilly winds blowing at 15 to 20kmph that enhanced the perception of cold, they said.“For example, in winter a strong wind can feel much colder than the measured temperature would indicate. Conversely, on a humid day in summer, it can feel uncomfortably hotter than the air temperatures would suggest..,” according to the UK Met Office.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches less than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains.Also Read | Expect cold wave, fog in Delhi in the next four days: IMDDelhi’s Lodhi Road and Ayanagar recorded minimum temperatures of 2.7 and 2.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum temperature in the city on Tuesday was 18.1 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees below normal.Many stations in the northern plains recorded 0 degree or near 0 degrees Celsius minimum temperatures. Hisar and Narnaul, both in Haryana, recorded 0 degree and 0.3 degrees Celsius, respectively. Amritsar (Punjab) recorded a minimum temperature of 0.4 degrees Celsius. Bhilwara, Pilani, Sikar and Churu (all in Rajasthan) recorded a minimum temperature of 0.9, 0.9; 0.5 and 0.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.“Severe cold wave was recorded in many parts of Punjab and Haryana and cold wave conditions were recorded in Delhi,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.“Extremely cold winds from snow-clad Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are reaching the plains now. The average wind speed was around 15kmph in Delhi, which increased the feeling of chill so the “feels like” temperature was around 2 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperatures will be low for the next two days and may even dip further,” he said.New Year’s Day is likely to bring relief, when the minimum temperature is forecast to rise to around 5 degrees Celsius and to around 7 degrees Celsius on January 2 and 3, Shrivastava said.A fresh western disturbance is likely to hit the Western Himalayan region around January 4, which may bring light rains and thundershowers to the plains including Delhi.Under the influence of the strengthening of cold and dry northwesterly/northerly lower-level winds, minimum temperatures are likely to fall by about 2 degrees Celsius over most parts of north-west and central India during the next three days and rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius over the subsequent three days (January 1 to 3).Ground frost conditions are likely over northern Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi during the next two days.“Many parts of north-west India are reaching the freezing point. We are expecting December 31 to be the coldest. Around January 2, a cyclonic circulation is likely to form over south Rajasthan and anticyclone over Chhattisgarh and Odisha. A confluence zone is likely to develop over Madhya Pradesh and east Rajasthan which is likely to bring rain to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president of climate change and meteorology at private forecaster Skymet Weather.Highest weather station in India:• India MD established a meteorological centre in Leh in Ladakh on Tuesday.

30-12-2020||India||Woman who fled to Andhra Pradesh has UK strain||A woman who tested positive for Covid-19 at the New Delhi airport on her return from London, but gave the slip to the authorities in the national capital and travelled to Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district by train last week, potentially exposing her co-passengers to the virus, has been detected to be infected with the new strain of Sars-Cov-2. State health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said on Tuesday that Mary Winfred Ann Parrie, a private school teacher in Rajahmundry, was afflicted with the new strain of the virus found in the UK, as confirmed by the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), which has done genome sequencing of her naso-pharyngeal swab samples. The samples, collected by the authorities at the government hospital in Rajahmundry, were sent to the CCMB on Friday and the outcome of the test was declared on Monday. Bhaskar said Parrie, currently in an isolation ward in the hospital, was asymptomatic. Parrie, a resident of Ramakrishna Nagar in Rajahmundry and working in a private school, left for London a couple of months ago along with her husband and daughter after the lifting of the travel restrictions. She returned to India to see her son on the night of December 21. Soon after landing, she was subject to testing for Covid-19 at the health centre in the New Delhi international airport. When she tested positive, airport authorities handed her over to Safdarjung Hospital for treatment. Since she was asymptomatic, she was asked to be in quarantine for seven days. After getting her out-patient card slip done, Parrie quietly left the place. On December 23, East Godavari district authorities received a communication from additional district magistrate of Delhi (north-east) Shubhankar Ghosh, stating that Parrie, along with her 22-years-old son Riyan, who came to receive her at the airport, might be travelling to Rajahmundry on the Andhra Pradesh Express. “Since she is corona-positive, there is apprehension of transmission of the infection to other persons from her. As per the protocol, she has to be isolated in institutional quarantine,” Ghosh said in the letter, requesting the East Godavari district authorities to get her admitted to any institutional quarantine facility. Health authorities went on high alert and informed both the railway police and local police officials. As soon as the train arrived in Rajahmundry railway station in the early hours of December 24, the police located Parrie and her son disembarking from a first-class compartment. The authorities made her and her son sport the PPE kits and drove them straight to the Rajahmundry government hospital. In the morning, both Parrie and Riyan were subject to Covid-19 tests. “The mother was found positive and Riyan negative,” East Godavari district coordinator of medical and health department Dr Ramesh Kishore said. The authorities admitted both mother and son in separate isolation wards in the hospital and started looking for passengers who may have come in contact with Parrie and her son during their travel from New Delhi to Rajahmundry . Kishore said initially the authorities proposed to send her swab samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, but later sent themon Friday to CCMB, one of the designated centres to test samples for the new Sars-Cov-2 strain that is ravaging the UK. The mother and son claim that they did not interact or come in touch with anyone on the train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-who-fled-to-andhra-has-uk-strain/story-tejDCNXZI6NB5c0ib5ZPLP.html
30-12-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Pfizer, Moderna deals hit roadblock||The Narendra Modi government is likely to inoculate 300 million Indians with made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines only as authorities are fast losing hope of inking deals with Pfizer or Moderna—the two companies to roll out vaccines so far. While the negotiations with Moderna hit a roadblock a few months ago, Pfizer is yet to submit details asked for by the drug regulator. According to officials involved in the vaccine administration plan, there are doubts if Pfizer has enough spare capacity to cater to Indian requirements after fulfilling its current commitments with the US, UK, EU, Bahrain, Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. The drug major has a few plants including one in Lincoln, Nebraska . According to media reports, Pfizer has received orders for 1.1 billion doses of its vaccine. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization or CDSCO—the body that scrutinizes applications for new vaccines— asked Pfizer to present its case two weeks ago but the company sought more time to formally submit its papers for an emergency authorization. Interestingly, while Pfizer has delayed submission of its proposal to CDSCO, it is in touch with the government’s expert committee on vaccine administration (NAGVAC). “From our discussion, it seems Pfizer might not have the required capacity to address India’s demand,” said a senior official who asked not to be named. Both Pfizer and Moderna, another top official claimed on condition of anonymity, have received several co-production offers from Indian companies. “But any co-production in India would also entail fresh round of trials in this country as per our drug laws. And that would mean additional costs,” this person said. While Pfizer can still be tapped for supplying vaccines for the second half of 2021, India’s vaccine planners are keen to line up supplies for the 300 million people who are in its first four priority groups. India has few logistics and cold storage chains that can support Pfizer’s requirement for keeping its vaccines at minus 70 degree Celsius, the price too, is a constraint. According to an official, the health ministry’s initial budget for vaccination is Rs 50,000 crore. As many as seven Indian vaccines are at different stages of trials. Another two, SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have applied for emergency approval. SII is expected to be given the go-ahead for emergency rollout in the next few days. The company is manufacturing the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccinationpfizer-moderna-deals-hit-roadblock/story-q3pR9A9v3tRWOs9Pt4QYRP.html
30-12-2020||India||States scramble to locate hundreds of UK returnees||Hundreds of people who came back from the United Kingdom (UK) are either missing or not cooperating with health authorities who fear that some of them could be infected by the new, hyper-infectious, mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the UK, and still worse, spreading it. Many of the missing are from Karnataka and Telangana, the two states where maximum number of persons returned from UK since November last week. To be sure, it isn’t clear how many of the close to 3,500 people from Punjab who returned from the UK are missing, although a state government official said most are yet to be traced. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe Union health ministry asked the states to test all persons who returned from the UK in the past one month using the RT-PCR test, the gold standard of tests, to detect Covid-19 virus. From November 25 to midnight, December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from UK, said a health ministry statement.Of them, 2406 people came to Karnataka . The local government is struggling to locate nearly 570 of them who have gone missing, according to Karnataka Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar. The minister added that the state home department and the police have been pressed into service to trace these people, who have also switched off their phones. Of the 1,614 passengers who came to Bengaluru, 26 tested positive for Covid-19 ; and three of the 26 tested positive for the new UK strain of the virus according to the minister. The three include a 34-year-old woman and her six-year-old daughter.“I have been promised that within 48 hours all of them will be traced,” Sudhakar said. Of the 570 missing passengers, 204 have given addresses in Bengaluru.Telangana government officials said that of 1,100 UK returnees to the state, 279 were not traceable. Dr G. Srinivasa Rao, director of public health of the state said his department has forwarded the names and details of the missing returnees to district officials. “Rest have been traced and their swab samples have been taken for testing,” he said.Punjab has not yet completed tracking of UK returnees. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, nodal officer for Covid in the state said 1822 Punjab-origin people have landed in Indira Gandhi International Airport at Delhi and 1604 in Guru Ram Dass International Airport at Amritsar since Diwali.“We are yet to complete the task of tracking all of them. Our district administrations are on toes to track them. There is a large number who are yet to be traced. We are expected to come out with the exact figures by Wednesday evening.” In Tamil Nadu, where one person has tested positive for new strain of Covid-19, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said that the state has been able to trace almost all 2,200 people who came from the UK since December 1. “We have provided details of a few who could not be traced,” he said, without giving the number of missing returnees.Odisha health officials said 27 UK returnees of the 181 who came back between November 30 and December 21 remain untraceable. Director public health, Dr Niranjan Mishra, said some of them gave only their phone numbers or vague addresses. Of the 227 people who have returned from the United Kingdom to Uttarakhand in the past one month, about 20 are not traceable, Abhishek Tripathi, chief operational officer for COVID-19 in the state said. Most of the returnees are from Dehradun and incomplete addresses and mobile numbers are the reason for the missing returnees, according to officials. However, in some states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the administration has been able to trace all the returnees and have collected their swab samples for RT-PCR tests.In Uttar Pradesh, the Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Alok Kumar said of the 1,655 people who have returned from the UK since December 9, 568 are not traceable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-scramble-to-locate-hundreds-of-uk-returnees/story-27w5hneWmwa5mfnpVKOyIJ.html
30-12-2020||India||TMC leader shot dead in Bengal’s Howrah district, mob ransacks buses, shops||A Trinamool Congress youth leader from Howrah district, was gunned down by motorcycle-borne assailants in the Shalimar area on Tuesday afternoon, police said. Dharmendra Singh was riding pillion on a party worker’s motorcycle around 4 pm when the hitmen blocked their path and opened fire in front of eyewitnesses. Singh was rushed to a private hospital but succumbed to bullet injuries. Singh was associated with real estate business, local TMC workers told the police. “An investigation is on. No arrest was made till 9 pm,” an officer from the local police station said on condition of anonymity. TMC workers went on the rampage after the incident and ransacked four buses and several shops. They also set fire to some two-wheelers. The Rapid Action Force had to be deployed to disperse the mob. Some unidentified men also broke into the residence of a local youth, Vicky Singh, around 6.30 pm and ransacked it before setting the furniture on fire around. Sigh and his wife, who had moved into the apartment about six months ago, were not present when the incident took place. The apartment was locked from outside. Two fire tenders brought the blaze under control. Arup Roy, the local TMC legislator and minister alleged that the murder was possibly carried out by hitmen sent by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but did not make any specific complaint. Surajit Saha, president of the BJP’s Howrah town unit, dismissed the allegation saying the murder was a fallout of rivalry between two groups in the TMC. He also alleged that the deceased had faced criminal charges in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-shot-dead-in-bengal-s-howrah-district-mob-ransacks-buses-shops/story-JaDNmrQPV9ksDpWidazcNN.html
30-12-2020||India||Days after row, Karnataka House deputy chairman found dead||The body of the Karnataka Legislative Council’s deputy chairman, SL Dharmegowda, was found on railway tracks at Gunasagar village of Kadur Taluk in Chikmagalur district in the early hours of Tuesday, just two weeks days after he was manhandled during a special session of the council.According to the initial probe by the police, 65-year-old Dharmegowda, who belonged to the Janata Dal (Secular), appeared to have died by suicide, and an alleged death note found near his body was being examined.Dharmegowda was at the centre of a controversy in the state council, which convened on December 15 for a one-day session, during which the JD(S) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tried to dislodge chairman Prathapchandra Shetty of the Congress by bringing in a no-confidence motion. Dharmegowda was manhandled when he tried to preside over the proceedings; Shetty later stepped in to reject the motion citing procedural lapses.Former state chief minister HD Kumaraswamy suggested that the incident was the reason behind the death, which he described as a “political murder”.“He was more than a brother for me. He was very hurt by the way he was treated by some members during the recent council proceedings and felt humiliated. It is not suicide, but political murder,” Kumaraswamy alleged.Siddaramaiah rejected Kumaraswamy’s contention while condoling the death. “Dharmegowda was a personal friend. His father Lakshmaiah, who was a legislator, was well known to me; the entire family was close to me. One has to look who forced him to sit (in the council chairman’s chair),” Siddaramaiah said.Police officers familiar with the initial investigation said the circumstances and sequence of events leading to his death suggested that Dharmegowda ended his own life.Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said that Dharmegowda asked his official gunman and escort to not accompany him as he left his home in Shakaryapatna in a Santro car with his driver on Monday evening. They drove to Gunasagar, around 19 km away, at around 6pm, and Dharmegowda later asked his driver, Dharmaraj, to wait at a distance  because he had to meet someone. But he later changed his mind and asked the driver to go back.The people cited above said his last call was to a friend named Hemant during the call, Dharmegowda made enquiries about train timings.When Dharmegowda did not return home at night, worried family members alerted authorities, who mounted a search. By then, his cellphone was switched off, but based on his last cell-tower signals, they searched and located his mutilated body on the Mankenahalli railway tracks.Police sent the body for an autopsy at McGann Hospital in Shivamogga, and Gowda was later buried at the family’s Madagadakere farmhouse in Shakaryapatna. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa, leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah, state Congress president DK Shivakumar, and JD(S) leader and former PM Deve Gowda expressed shock and condoled the death of Dharmegowda.Yediyurappa flew to Kadur to play his last respects. “The entire state is shocked by the demise. I pray to god to give his family strength to face this,” he said.Former PM Deve Gowda broke down while talking about Dharmegowda. “It is shocking to learn the news of deputy speaker of state legislative council and JD(S) leader SL Dharmegowda’s suicide. He was a calm and decent man. This is a loss of the state.”Dharmegowda came from an influential political family. His father SR Lakshmaiah was a three-time MLA from the Birur assembly constituency, and Dharmegowda too won that seat in 2004. His brother SL Bhojegowda is also an MLC.Speaking to HT, Bhojegowda said: “There were no personal or financial reasons for him to take this extreme step. He was upset about what had happened [in the council]. I and other party leaders had told him not to take things to heart as these are common in politics, but he seems to have taken it very seriously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-row-k-taka-house-deputy-chairman-found-dead/story-iDRF3wPws6xuhDTGMLsjUJ.html
30-12-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi reluctant to return as Cong chief; Plan B on cards||If there’s one message that Rahul Gandhi’s previously unannounced overseas visit has sent to many in the Congress leadership, it is that he isn’t keen on returning as party president, a post he gave up in May 2019 after its general election debacle.Hindustan Times spoke to several Congress leaders, some of them part of his core group, about the party’s plans to appoint a permanent president. Two of them confirmed, on condition of anonymity, that Rahul Gandhi was reluctant to return to the post and that attempts were being made to change his mind. A third leader said it was more or less certain now that he wouldn’t return as Congress chief anytime soon.Rahul Gandhi flew to an undisclosed destination abroad on Sunday, the eve of the Congress’s 136th anniversary and at a time when thousands of farmers have massed on Delhi’s borders in protest against a set of contentious laws aimed at opening up agricultural markets. ALSO WATCH | ‘Low level politics by BJP’: Congress defends Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visit The visit also preceded the expected start of the process of electing a permanent Congress president next month to relieve his mother Sonia Gandhi of her responsibilities as interim chief.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi leaves for Milan a day before Congress foundation dayIt has been 18 months now that India’s oldest political party has been in a state of flux. While Sonia Gandhi agreed to take over as interim chief, her poor health has been a cause of concern. The party said it would begin the internal elections process after 23 senior politicians in August demanded an overhaul of the party in a joint letter they wrote to the leadership. Signatories to the letter included MPs Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, his deputy Anand Sharma, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh and former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan. When party general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said this month that 99.9% of the Congress rank and file want Rahul Gandhi back as president, it upset those who had been seeking a transparent, democratic system.“Senior leaders are trying to convince him. They have all spoken with Mrs. {Sonia} Gandhi to try to change his mind, but we can say that he is reluctant,’’ said one person aware of development.Those who back Rahul Gandhi’s return to the helm argue that no one other than a Gandhi can keep the party united. These include senior leaders Ambika Soni, Harish Rawat and AK Antony, who asked Gandhi to return even at a December 19 meeting with representatives of the letter writers who demanded an overhaul  Gandhi kept quiet at that time, but at one point he did tell the signatories to the letter: “I am a common worker like you and I will work like that.’. Those close to the family believe it is unlikely that Rahul Gandhi will change his mind, but his core team says it will be able to prevail on him to return to the helm. Just in case Rahul Gandhi doesn’t relent, Hindustan Times learns,a Plan B is also being discussed within the party. Signatories to the August letter sent to the party suggested that the Congress adopt a collective leadership system. Also Read | Congress’ Sonia Gandhi hits out at ‘black’ farm lawsAccording to Plan B, the party could appoint four vice-presidents (one for each zone) to work under Sonia Gandhi as President.“Her presence would be like {that of} a figurehead as no one has any opposition to her but the four vice-presidents would then collectively take all decisions. They would each have three-four general secretaries under them,’’ said a senior leader of the party, on condition of anonymity. He noted that Rahul Gandhi became president in December 2017 and his term was to expire 2022 before he gave up the post in May 2019, owning responsibility for the Congress’s electoral defeat. Sonia Gandhi can continue as president unless a consensus candidate emerges before the election, the leader said. The emergence of a consensus candidate is, however, unlikely because of divisions between the so-called old guard and young guard in the party.HT reached out to Surjewala for a comment, but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-reluctant-to-return-as-cong-chief-plan-b-on-cards/story-U0tDOuzcjTjNqfP6g3kPTI.html
30-12-2020||India||IIT engineers to ensure Ram temple’s structural stability||Engineers from India’s top institutes, including IIT-Delhi and IIT-Mumbai, will work to improve the structural stability of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya to ensure the pillars of the holy building last a thousand years, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) chief Alok Kumar announced on Tuesday. Kumar said the process of designing the structure’s foundation pillars was stuck because a stream of the Sarayu river was found flowing underneath a portion of the building. “When the testing of the pillars was carried out, it was found when pressure was applied, they sank by about four inches. Since, the area is already in a seismic zone, we have decided to come up with a structurally safe option,” he said. The Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra trust is also negotiating to increase the land holding of the complex from the current 70 acres to 108 acres to accommodate a museum, a gathering space and a prayer hall. “We are trying to negotiate with those who own the land around the temple; if they agree to part with the land they will be compensated,” Kumar said. A proposed mosque complex coming up outside Ayodhya town is also designed to have a hospital, and a museum.To come up with a safe design for the pillars, members from IIT Delhi, IIT Mumbai, IIT Roorkee, National Building Research Institute (NBRI), Tata Consultancy and Larsen & Toubro will work together, said Kumar.About 700 tonne of weight was put on the testing pillars to assess their load withstanding capacity. Tests were also conducted to assess their resistance to earthquakes, but cracks were noticed during the tests, Kumar said. The pillars of the Ram Temple are expected to last a thousand years, he added. VHP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) authorised by the trust to collect donations for the temple, said it will initiate the process of collection of funds for the temple’s construction on January 15. Kumar said it 525,000 villages will be visited for collection . “Funds will be collected in a transparent way...deposits will be made in branches of Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-engineers-to-ensure-ram-temple-s-structural-stability/story-sYbCNwGvELEwsInyo3I3SN.html
30-12-2020||India||Rajinikanth junks plans to enter politics citing poor health||Superstar Rajinikanth on Tuesday cancelled his plans to enter politics on health grounds, a decision that came just two days ahead of the expected announcement of his party’s launch date and left a large section of his followers who have been waiting for his political foray for years disappointed.The 70-year-old actor, who has a cult following, released a three-page statement on Twitter, apologising to his admirers and members of the Rajini Makkal Mandram, a group that has been working on the ground ever since he announced his plans to enter politics in 2017 after years of speculation.“With regret, I’ve to say that I can’t start a political party. Only I know the pain of making this decision,” Rajinikanth said in his statement in Tamil. “Without entering politics, I will serve people.”In 2016, Rajinikanth underwent a kidney transplant. He was admitted to Apollo Hospitals in Hyderabad on December 25 following complaints of severe blood pressure fluctuations and exhaustion. He returned to Chennai after his discharge on December 27. He was advised to avoid activities that could increase his chances of contracting Covid-19. In Hyderabad, the actor was shooting for a movie, but filming had to be suspended after four crew members tested positive for Covid-19. “My hospitalisation was a warning by god,” he said in the statement. “Despite strict protocols, four out of 150 tested positive in a well-organised film shoot...what will happen when thousands assemble for my campaign?” he said, adding that it was not possible to solely rely on social media for an election campaign.Rajinikanth indicated that he did not want to sound chivalrous by saying he will join politics despite severe health concerns and that he did not want to make his supporter “a victim”.The decision, which put an end to years of expectations and preparations, plunged a section of his fans in disappointment while others said they will accept whatever is best for their “Thalaiva”, or leader, as Rajinikanth is fondly called. “You stay inside your house and campaign, and do good to people. We will work the streets across Tamil Nadu,” a teary fan said outside Rajinikanth’s posh Chennai residence, urging him to change his decision.Mohammed Rabik, the Madurai district secretary of Rajini Makkal Mandram, said he “accepted” the decision. “Since he said (in the past) he was joining politics, we worked towards that. Now, we will work towards however he wants us to serve people,” said Rabik, who joined a Rajini fan club back in 1972.Rajinikanth’s decision will be a relief for both the state’s ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) before the 2021 assembly elections, especially after the death of charismatic leaders such as J Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and M Karunanidhi of the DMK, experts said.“The damage that (actor-turned-politician) Vijayakanth caused these parties should not be forgotten,” said R Kannan, political commentator and author of MGR: A Life. Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), which was formed in 2005, bagged an 8% vote share in 2011 and he became the opposition leader in the assembly. His party won 29 of the 41 seats it contested, becoming the second-largest party after the AIADMK, which formed the government. However, since then, the DMDK has been unable to make a mark in electoral politics.In 1996, Rajinikanth triggered a flutter when he remarked that even god cannot save Tamil Nadu “if Jayalalithaa is elected to power”. His stand is considered one of the contributing factors behind a growing public opinion against Jayalalithaa, who was already facing corruption charges. Eventually, an alliance led by the DMK swept the polls. “Everyone’s wish, including mine, is that he recovers fully and returns to act in cinema,” DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi said.D Jayakumar, minister for fisheries and an AIADMK spokesperson, said: “We are confident that Rajinikanth will extend his support to the AIADMK.”Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan, who is campaigning in Mayiladuthurai district for his Makkal Needhi Maiam party, said he will meet Rajinikanth after returning to Chennai. “I’ve the same feelings as his fans. Even though it feels like a slight betrayal, his health is most important to me. My Rajini has to be well,” Haasan said during his campaign. Haasan had previously said he was willing to join hands with Rajinikanth politically for the benefit of people. Earlier this month, Rajinikanth had said he would launch his party in January and disclose the specifics by December 31. His fans expected him to field candidates in all 234 constituencies in the state in next year’s assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajini-junks-plans-to-enter-politics-citing-poor-health/story-vlrdvHkN5eoeHbwYAKF0vO.html
30-12-2020||India||Goa govt considering legalising cannabis cultivation, opposition sees red||The Goa government is considering a legislation that will make the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal purposes a legitimate activity, people familiar with the development have said.The proposal, which originated in the Health Department has been vetted by the Law Department, but is likely to encounter resistance in the Cabinet as well as from the Chief Minister’s Office and there is no indication that it will succeed in making it to the legislative Assembly that is scheduled to meet in late January. Speaking to the media, Goa’s Law Minister Nilesh Cabral said that his department has vetted the file from a ‘legal perspective’ after he received it from the Health Department. According to Cabral only controlled farming of marijuana for medicinal purposes, will be permitted so that the natural drug could be sold to pharmaceutical companies.“It is on the same ground as how liquor is regulated. If you recall before 1985 there was no ban on this. The NDPS Act was brought by the central government and charas, ganja were added in the scheduled list of banned drugs,” said Cabral.“Today in several states in India the form of this plant known as bhang is sold over the counter through a licenced establishment like a bar licence,” Cabral said. The minister who said that he was personally in favour of legalising the cultivation of marijuana, also claimed that he had seen the use of marijuana to cue cancer.“This plant is originally from India. If it is used for health reasons and not recreational… I don’t see why not. I’ve seen people using it in curing last stage cancer. This is already being officially used in America, Canada Australia so why should our people remain behind. It can be cheaply made available if people are suffering from cancer,” he added. The Chief Minister’s Office has rejected the suggestion that the Goa government has ‘taken a decision’ to permit the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal purposes and said that the mere movement of a file didn’t amount to a decision of the government. The opposition Goa Forward Party has hit out at the government for what it said was the promotion of Goa as a ‘vices hub.’ “The Chief Minister has confirmed that the file has really been moved but that there has been no decision. The meaning of this is that since the file has been moved, there is an intention to do it. They have taken this stop because they want to promote Goa as a vices hub to completely finish the next generation,” Vijai Sardesai, the leader of the Goa Forward Party, now in the opposition, said. “How will they handle the law and order crisis that will consequently emerge from legalising cannabis cultivation? Who will be the watchdog to ensure that it is for medicinal purposes only? And if the watchdog himself starts accepting bribes to allow it to be pilfered and the young generation gets access to it, the future generations will get access just so that they can fill their pockets,” Sardesai said. “Will good tourists come to Goa if cannabis is legalised? Or will only the rubbish and drug addicts end up here. Casinos are here. Now you want to bring drugs and next you will want to bring (legal) prostitution,” Sardesai said.Earlier in this month, India voted in favour of removing marijuana from the list of ‘most dangerous drugs’ at the United Nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-considering-legalising-cannabis-cultivation-opposition-sees-red/story-TfVsZVGXwSGenFHaDibXFM.html
30-12-2020||India||UK Covid-19 variant reaches India, govt on guard: All you need to know||India on Tuesday recorded the first six cases of the UK variant of coronavirus among travellers who returned from Britain, prompting the government to enforce stricter precautions and speed up contact tracing for co-passengers. The new UK variant genome of SARS-CoV-2 – B.1.1.7 – was detected in three samples in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Hospital (NIMHANS) Bengaluru, two in the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad and one in the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, the health ministry said.The presence of this new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far.Here are the key developments prompted by the tracing of UK variant in India:Govt takes cognizance of the reports of virusAll infected people have been kept in single room isolation at designated health care facilities by respective state governments and their close contacts have also been put under quarantine, the ministry said. “Comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on,” the Union health ministry said. The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG labs, the ministry added.India may extend ban on flights from UKIndia is likely to extend the ban on flights from Britain in a bid to contain the spread of a new strain of coronavirus, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday. “I foresee a slight extension of the temporary suspension. I don’t expect that extension to be a long or indefinite extension. In the next day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current temporary suspension,” Puri said.Genome sequencing for all Covid-19 positive flyers who arrived in India from Dec 9 to 22All international passengers who arrived in India from December 9 to 22 and tested positive for Covid-19 will be subjected to genome sequencing as part of the Centre’s strategy to detect the mutated coronavirus strain that has emerged in the United Kingdom recently. Others will be followed up by the state and district surveillance officers and will be tested as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, even if asymptomatic, between fifth and 10th day of arrival, according to the Union health ministry’s guidance document on genomic sequencing.Govt to increase number of genome sequencing for Covid-19The government will increase the number of genome sequencing for Covid-19 in view of the new coronavirus strain that was first detected in the United Kingdom, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday. “An important development is the establishment of INSACOG which is a consortium of 10 government labs to do genome sequencing of the Sars (Covid-19) virus or any variant of that virus. These labs belong to ICMR, BioTech India, CSIR and health ministry,” Bhushan said.Samples of 15 who came to Delhi from UK sent to check new strain of virusTest samples of 15 people who recently arrived in Delhi from the UK and tested positive for Covid-19 have been sent for genome sequencing to check if they have contracted the new variant of the virus, PTI reported on Tuesday. The results are expected in the next three-four days, it said. The Delhi government had earlier said that people who had arrived in the Capital recently from the UK are being traced and tested, and a separate institutional quarantine facility has been set up at the LNJP Hospital for positive cases.Covaxin can work against mutated coronavirus: Bharat BiotechCovaxin, a vaccine candidate being developed by Bharat Biotech for Covid-19, can offer protection against mutations of coronavirus, Chairman and Managing Director of the city-based vaccine maker Krishna Ella said on Tuesday. He also said the company has approached regulatory authorities seeking approval for an emergency license to use the vaccine, developed in collaboration with ICMR and the National Institute of Virology and now undergoing phase 3 trials.Pilots’ association writes to Air India for details of UK virus strainIndian Commercial Pilots’ Association has written to Air India’s director of operations, seeking information about the new Covid-19 variant. “We demand the company procure info from labs and promptly inform all pilots who have tested COVID positive and pilots who may test positive in future if they are infected with this deadlier variant of Sars-CoV-2,” the association said in its letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-covid-19-variant-reaches-india-govt-rushes-to-control-outbreak-all-you-need-to-know/story-BkRVFqFYNLFZZYBr8BmK2M.html
30-12-2020||Editorials||Winter shelters for the homeless: Don’t cut corners||For the last few days, the northwestern part of India has been in the grip of a cold wave or severe cold wave conditions. This situation is likely to continue in the National Capital Region for the next three days. With the mercury dipping, the homeless in Delhi have been using free-of-cost night shelters set up by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which, as of December 30, has shelter homes (RCC building, porta cabins, tents and temporary buildings) at 281 locations for 8,299 people. According to the DUSIB, on Tuesday night, 6,509 people stayed at these shelter homes. However, just setting up shelter homes is not enough. According to a report in ThePrint, a news portal, facilities at many of the shelters ---- bedding, toilets and water ---- are not adequate. Thanks to Covid-19 and social distancing norms, these DUSIB shelters are now forced to admit a fewer number of people. A study by Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), a non-profit, also found many shelters were not functional. There is also a discrepancy in the numbers of homeless people. According to HLRN, the number of homeless in Delhi at any given point is around 150,000-200,000. DUSIB claims that its 2014 survey showed 16,000-17,000. The variance in numbers suggests that there is an urgent need to assess the correct number and then review the arrangements made for them. The problem of homeless people and shelters is symptomatic of a larger problem: The lack of adequate and safe housing. It is imperative that people have access to housing (including social rental housing and hostels) with adequate facilities (water, electricity, sanitation) and also access to affordable housing finance, including rental and ownership. The Centre’s aim to provide housing for all by 2022 is a step in the right direction because for every citizen, secure housing means income, security and a future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/winter-shelters-for-the-homeless-don-t-cut-corners/story-xMQAg36Lx9ock5HgbtBttO.html
