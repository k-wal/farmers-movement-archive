04-12-2020||News||India and the geopolitics of technology | Analysis||Splinternet, the balkanisation of the internet, digital sovereignty, and data localisation are some of the more popular terms that have come to define the debate on the future of data, and, more broadly, on the future of technology. The argument boils down to the different ways in which governments and transnational organisations (such as the European Union) choose to access, use, and allow data to flow across borders.Countries that have closed their data markets to external actors — such as China — are commonly referred to as digital authoritarianists. Those that are guided by judicial standards, the rule of law, and support the freer — but not always free — movement of data have come to be known as digital democracies. The political, ideological, and economic tensions between, and within, these categories of actors shape what might be called the geopolitics of technology. This form of geopolitics is as much about competing domestic regulations, the renewed focus on anti-trust laws, and domestic standards on privacy legislations, as it is about international affairs. Greater cooperation on Artificial Intelligence (AI) or blockchain technologies, between entities in different countries, requires mediation and cooperation across borders. This is a matter of data diplomacy.At least 14 countries have appointed negotiators to shape data diplomacy. Designations such as tech ambassador, ambassador of innovations, ambassador for digital affairs, and ambassador for cyber diplomacy are becoming increasingly common.And they all want to deal with India. It is, after all, the largest open data market in the world. Close to 600 million Indians currently use 4G data. India also has the highest per capita consumption of data (above 10 GB per month) anywhere in the world. It is a treasure trove for big tech firms, as much as it is for those firms within India wanting to expand operations outside its borders.Yet, India’s unique data demography is unlikely to sustain current levels of international interest and domestic needs in the long-term. A lot will depend on the kind of digital democracy that India aspires to be. How open or closed will it be to the movement of data across its borders, is the moot question for the fast-growing number of global “tech ambassadors”.To an extent, the question of data openness will be resolved as India’s Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) becomes a law, potentially in 2021. A joint parliamentary committee is currently examining the PDPB. This crucial legislature will outline localisation requirements for personal data, thereby setting out clearer rules for the cross-border movement of data. It will also lead to the creation of a Data Protection Authority (DPA) to regulate the use of personal data. Over the next year, there is a very good chance that India will have developed its legal digital architecture.More urgently than before, India needs to consider what exactly it wants out of the fast-changing geopolitics around technology. This goes beyond banning Chinese apps or considering how India can absorb the slow move to diversify global supply chains. This is about ensuring India’s evolving domestic data architecture supports its international interests, with the clear view to benefit from the same. The aim must be to negotiate its weight in data and find the right balance for India’s future between localisation and internationalisation.This balancing act has much to do with conceptualising a centralising vision, as well as with administrative organisation. There are a range of ministries that are involved in the PDPB, as well as those that focus on the future of emerging technologies such as AI. The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) mooted the PDPB. The ministry of commerce and industry has taken positions internationally with regard to data.In September 2020, the minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal, made clear that India was not in a position to sign onto a charter at the G20, known as the Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT), and for excellent reasons. How could India sign onto an international norm-setting agreement, without first passing the PDPB? Moreover, the minister made clear that “equitable access to data” was central to India’s concerns.The ministry of external affairs created the new, emerging, and strategic technologies (NEST) division in January 2020. The focus is on strategic technologies such as 5G, emerging technologies, and tech diplomacy. The division hit the ground running. It invested in an initiative along with the office of the principal scientific adviser to the government to assess the transformational effects of disruptive technologies such as digital currencies, big data computing, communication hardware, and others. Moreover, senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) oversee diverse elements of domestic and international data-related developments.It will be key to connect these assorted elements of the State by way of a coherent narrative that articulates a common Indian position on the future of technology. More importantly, it is essential for these different domains — between trade, law, finance, and diplomacy — to negotiate the right balance between domestic needs, international requirements, and India’s long-term position in a market area that can be — but automatically will not be — India’s for the taking.To start with, the government could consider appointing its own coordinator for technology. The aim should not be to add to the bean count of global tech ambassadors, but to appoint at least a minister of state-ranked individual to synthesise India’s pulsating story with the view to effectively shape the geopolitics of technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-and-the-geopolitics-of-technology/story-dd2DGyVvuhH7XmOfVSpLwL.html
04-12-2020||News||To preserve its edge, the silent service must innovate | Analysis||Navies are often referred to as the silent service and, in the case of the Indian Navy (IN), this description is apt. It is anecdotally recalled that in the preparatory stages of the 1971 war, the then Prime Minister (PM), Indira Gandhi, would meet the three service chiefs and receive a detailed briefing from the Army and Air Chiefs. The Navy, it was believed, had a marginal role and, towards the end of the meeting, the PM would glance at her watch and then the Naval Chief (Admiral Charles Nanda) and ask if he had anything to say and end the deliberations even before a no could be said.However, the IN acquitted itself with aplomb in that war and adopted innovative tactics — such as towing small missile boats to locations in the Arabian Sea that allowed them to attack Karachi on December 4 with devastating effect and deploying the aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, in the Bay of Bengal with unexpected efficacy. Yes, the IN lost the INS Khukri to an enemy submarine, but the silent service had demonstrated its credibility and December 4, 1971, is enshrined in its collective memory with quiet pride.In his annual comments in the run-up to Navy Day, naval chief Admiral Karambir Singh outlined the orientation of the IN as a force that is ”combat-ready, credible and cohesive” (3C) and highlighted operational details, which were impressive given the IN’s diminutive size.The raison d’ etre for any military force is to be prepared for war should the exigency arise and the dialectical element, as raksha mantri Rajnath Singh alluded to at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, is that the more a nation acquires a credible combat capability and related political resolve, the lesser the probability of a potential adversary going down the path of adventurism.Despite the constraints imposed by the pandemic, the IN has carried out a number of operational mission-based deployments in the Indian Ocean to maintain the appropriate ”presence” to safeguard India’s maritime security interests. This allowed the naval chief to assert that while some Chinese research and fishing vessels had been deployed in the Indian Ocean, there had been “no infringement” of India’s maritime boundaries. The IN also evacuated 4,000 Indian nationals as part of the Covid-19 effort from the neighbourhood and provided food aid to a set of African nations, even while engaging in disaster relief and anti-piracy operations. While the recently-concluded Malabar naval exercises has received considerable attention, the IN participated in a total of 13 bilateral /multilateral exercises and PM Narendra Modi’a advocacy of security and growth for all in the region (SAGAR) was given a fillip in a variety of ways.But while the IN remained active through the year, it is not evident that this tempo that can be satisfactorily sustained in the next few years with the current funding trends. Admiral Singh, in December 2019, had noted that the allocation for the IN had dropped to under 14% of the total defence budget and this was not adequate for the long-term acquisition plans that had been mooted.That was a pre-Covid-19 observation and the fiscal picture this December is bleak. India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will shrink substantially, and the next few years will be ”lean” years for the Indian military. As the Cinderella service (one that gets the least funding), many big-ticket items of the IN may have to be placed on the backburner even as the national security matrix remains complex.Limited resources will have to be innovatively utilised by the IN to retain the 3C sheen and here, a remark by Admiral Singh may point to the way ahead. Acknowledging the budgetary constraints that the IN would have to factor in, the naval chief indicated that leasing options could be examined. India had obtained a nuclear submarine on lease from the former Soviet Union in 1988, and this is a niche that could be reviewed in a meaningful manner — particularly with the United States (US) in the current geopolitical context. The US has a template for leasing assets to allies and how this will play out in a “partnership” would have to be negotiated but it is feasible.In this phase of Covid-induced austerity, the IN will benefit from investing in information technology in a strategic manner and shape it into a force multiplier. Surveillance across all three domains (surface, sub-surface and space) with adequate focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and spectrum dominance could be the key to IN retaining the edge that it needs to remain credible. China has been investing heavily in autonomous (ie AI-enabled) drones that operate in communications-denied and GPS-denied environments and this has the Pentagon worried. India’s hi-tech human talent, which is being harnessed by the world’s leading corporates and universities, needs to be given the necessary incentives to irrigate the Indian techno-strategic ecosystem in a more effective manner. The silent service should explore these uncharted waters as its relevance in the affairs of the Indo-Pacific acquires greater salience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-preserve-its-edge-the-silent-service-must-innovate/story-FRE47ZFZbyrgYFN88rvJWN.html
04-12-2020||News||Reform institutions to ensure equitable representation to women||As a document, the Constitution lays the legal foundations for a country’s governance and formulates the institutions tasked with implementing the principles enshrined in it. For India, these institutions are the legislature, the judiciary, and the executive. With the legislature being empowered to make the laws, the judiciary tasked with adjudication and the executive being duty-bound to ensure implementation, the three are meant to safeguard and actualise the founding document’s core tenets. Seventy-one years have passed since India adopted its Constitution, guaranteeing equality to all its citizens, including its largest minority population — women. This was a radical step undertaken by the framers, considering that most supposedly liberal democracies had refused to guarantee universal suffrage at that time. What is also important is that the framers didn’t just confine themselves to providing women with a guarantee of formal equality, but through Article 15(3) that reads: “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children” — also opened avenues for the State to take steps towards promoting substantive equality. This was a crucial provision as it implied that the framers realised that Article 15 alone wasn’t enough, and that special provisions were required to ensure that women are able to exercise their right to equality.Have we been able to achieve these targets?The legislative branch, made up of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha account for only 103 female Members of Parliament (MPs) out of 795 sitting MPs. This is approximately 13% representation. This raises the question as to whether, we as a country are truly committed to equal representation especially when the foremost representative body in our democracy provides barely any representation to the country’s largest minority? Unfortunately, this lack of representation isn’t limited to the legislature but rather spreads to the judiciary as well, where female judges account for 6% of the Supreme Court and 11.5% and 27.6% in the high courts and the lower judiciary respectively. These figures are also indicative of successive decreases in women’s representation with each rung of the judicial hierarchy. This is disheartening considering the fact that the institution that was envisioned to protect the principles of the Constitution has failed to ensure them. In terms of representation in the police, female personnel account for 7.28% (State of Policing Report, 2019) of the country’s police force. This is striking when we consider the fact that it is required by law for female uniformed personnel to be present when escorting/arresting a female accused. Considering the serious lack of female representation, how has the police been able to comply with this law? And in the off chance that it has failed to follow procedure, would that not be a violation of the accused’s right to dignity and liberty?It was BR Ambedkar who stated that a Constitution was only as good as the individuals who implemented it. Thus, a modern democratic nation-state must aspire to develop institutions that enshrine within themselves constitutional values as originally conceptualised in their foundation. The failure of these institutions to provide equitable representation to women, continues to serve as a stark reminder of what poor implementation can do to a fantastic document. Two decades into this century, India must put behind itself the regressive ghosts of its past that continue to haunt its institutions. As the country looks to move towards a more just and equitable future, it must begin by reforming its institutions to represent more accurately some of its most important stakeholders.

04-12-2020||News||Coal power plants need an integrated approach||As the contribution of renewable energy (RE) in electricity supply increases, proportionally fewer coal plants may be needed. The ones that remain will have to operate more flexibly to accommodate the varying nature of RE. Most coal plants were not designed to operate this way. In addition, there are regulations to clean up coal power by retrofitting equipment for pollution control. The problem is that all three aspects — retirement of older plants, pollution control equipment, and making plants more flexible — are being planned in isolation. By thinking at a systemic level, we can address all three aspects at a lower cost, with better public health outcomes.At a national level, there is excess generating capacity. This has provided the rationale for several studies recommending early retirement of older coal plants, mostly using a plant age of 25 years as the threshold. These studies suggest replacing the energy from these older plants by RE or energy from newer, and presumably more efficient, coal plants that have not been able to run to full capacity. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC)’s emissions norms require emissions control systems (ECS) for oxides of sulphur (SOx), nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants. While there are fewer details on regulations or rules for making coal plants more flexible, many utilities are working on doing so.There are several problems with this approach. First, these three issues are being looked at in isolation and second, simple binary rules are being recommended to address each. On the issue of excess capacity, the extent varies across the country. Most studies examine only aggregate utilisation of coal plants, their Plant Load Factor (PLF), which misses the value of output at peak times. This is key for a high-RE future. It is also not clear how long this excess capacity will last; decisions to either add or retire generation capacity should be based on long-term considerations. One advantage of older plants is that they are fully depreciated and thus have much lower fixed costs than newer plants. The issue of retirement of older plants is intertwined with the need for flexibility because older plants, which are of sub-critical technology design, are more suitable for flexible operations. In addition, if a distribution company that has no excess capacity has to run some plants at low PLF, then it is economically better for it to retain older plants with low fixed costs in its portfolio rather than contract for supply from a newer plant.The issues of pollution control and requirements for flexibility are also inter-related. We will confine ourselves to control of emissions of SOx because this is the pollutant which is currently most contentious. Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) is the most commonly-used technology to control SOx. Operating a plant with FGD in flexible mode makes the operation of FGD more challenging, likely requiring augmentation of the control and instrumentation systems, and possibly hardware changes, increasing costs and complexity.The current emissions control approach relies on a one-size-fits-all policy. A recent study found that the health benefits from FGD varied greatly by location, with the highest benefit being 28 times that in the location with the lowest benefit. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) recently carried out a study to examine the issue of plant-location specific emission standards instead of a uniform standard, and has recommended segregation of areas by the level of ambient SOx into five categories and that pollution control be required only in the two categories with higher SOx levels. One gap in the CEA’s study is that it did not consider secondary particulates due to SOx emissions. More nuanced installation of FGD based on plant location-specific environmental conditions plus expected duty cycle can save a significant amount of money. However, the implementation of such an approach will be challenging given the difficulties in monitoring compliance in India.As we have seen, the three issues — retirement, pollution control, and making plants flexible — are inter-related. They need to be addressed in an integrated fashion by distribution companies based on long-term system-level considerations of demand, supply and availability of new technologies. Distribution companies should be best placed to make these decisions because they are responsible for power procurement and additions or retirements of generation capacity from their portfolio.As electricity markets become more effective, the true value of flexibility, the value of RE, and the need for capacity adequacy will become better known. This will make it easier for the distribution companies to make decisions about the optimal plan for retirements, making plants flexible, and installing FGDs. Therefore, rather than issuing rules on these issues in isolation, the government should focus on accelerating the introduction of effective electricity markets that provide the right signals for stakeholders to both invest in, but also operate plants once built, in the most cost-effective and clean manner.Daljit Singh is visiting scholar and Rahul Tongia is senior fellow, Centre for Social and Economic Progress, a Delhi-based not-for-profit think tank.

04-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves judgement in ED’s plea for custody of alleged aide of Sena MLA||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday reserved its judgement on the application by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against a special court order which denied them further custody of Amit Chandole, the alleged close aide of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, in connection with a money laundering case. ED submitted that they had interrogated Chandole for three days, but as he had allegedly diverted funds collected through money laundering overseas, the time was insufficient to ascertain where the funds were diverted. In view of this, the agency claimed that the special court’s refusal to extend his custody was erroneous and should be set aside. Chandole’s counsel opposed the application stating that as ED had failed to find any incriminating evidence against him, the special court’s decision was justified and hence the application should be dismissed. A single-judge bench of justice Prithviraj K Chavan, while hearing ED’s revision application which challenged the November 29 order of a special holiday sessions judge, was informed by additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh, representing ED, that the investigating agency had got a three-day custody of Chandole on November 27 and applied for an extension on November 29 which was rejected. Singh submitted that Chandole has an arrangement with Tops Group whereby whatever money was collected by them was shared and that Chandole had diverted his share overseas. He added that ED wanted extension of custody to know where the money was shifted. The case against Chandole was registered based on an October 15 complaint by Ramesh Iyer, a former employee of Tops Security Group. Iyer has alleged that Chandole was the beneficiary of a 2014 contract between Tops group and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The contract was for supply of security guards, and some part of the amount paid by MMRDA went to private accounts of Chandole. Singh further submitted that they had seized Chandole’s income tax returns and the agency needed to investigate the money laundering case. He further submitted that the central agency had to prove through a large number of bank records, computers, proceeds of crime, data and paperwork, including the contract between MMRDA about Chandole’s involvement in the case, and the same could not be interrogated within three days. However, advocate Rizwan Merchant, appearing for Chandole said ED was trying to get to Sarnaik through Chandole. Merchant submitted that the order passed by the session judge was a reasoned one as ED had failed to place any documentary evidence on record. After hearing the submissions, the court reserved its order and the same is expected to be passed in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reserves-judgement-in-ed-s-plea-for-custody-of-alleged-aide-of-sena-mla/story-57aERusKqG4yEYUQEmgrZI.html
04-12-2020||City||Decide in 2 weeks if you’ll permit man convicted for possessing child pornographic material to enter India: Bombay HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the central government to decide in two weeks if it would allow an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) based in the United States of America to visit, considering he had been denied entry into the country earlier on the grounds of being “morally depraved”, as he had been convicted in the US for the possession of child pornographic material. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Milind Jadhav has directed the immigration department to treat the petition filed by the man before HC requesting entry to the country, and his additional affidavits, as representation of the OCI. The bench has further directed the immigration authorities to pass a reasoned order, with reference to its relevant legal position: whether the request of the petitioner to enter India is again refused by the authority or not. The directive came on a petition filed by the man, a 57-year-old chartered accountant (CA) residing at Connecticut, who wants to meet his aged parents – 90-year-old father and 85-year-old mother – both of whom reside in Mumbai. He said he had lived in India since his birth and had moved to the US in the year 1990. Thereafter, he said he had visited India a number of times, but when he landed at the Mumbai international airport on September 1, 2018, the immigration officer on duty did not permit him to exit the immigration and enter India. He informed HC that he then made various efforts and took up the issue with Indian authorities through his lawyers to find out why he was not being allowed to enter India but did not get any response from the authorities concerned. The immigration officer had filed an affidavit in reply to the man’s petition, stating that the petitioner’s passport was cancelled by the US authorities because in 2013, he was convicted for the possession of child pornographic material. “As per the competent authority of the Government of India, foreigners who are morally depraved need to be blacklisted and prevented from entering India,” stated the officer’s affidavit. It added that the immigration officer had refused the entry of the petitioner to India on these grounds. However, the petitioner’s counsel, senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf, controverted the claims. He maintained that the 57-year-old CA holds a valid passport issued by the US Department of State. Dr Saraf asserted that merely because of the endorsement of his prior conviction on the passport, he cannot be prevented from entering India, especially when he has already undergone the five years’ probation. The senior advocate termed the refusal “arbitrary”, claiming that there were no rules or regulations in place which prevented such entry of an individual.In this backdrop, HC had on November 26 this year, directed the immigration officer to place on record the relevant statutory provisions, policy decision or memorandum, if any. However, no such decision was placed before the court on Thursday, prompting HC to direct the central authorities to treat the petition as representation of the petitioner and take a decision on it in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations. “We do not find a decision by the respondent authority with reference to any policy, rules or regulations, declaring that in such a situation a foreigner cannot be allowed to enter India,” said the bench, adding, “No decision has been taken by the authority in the case of the petitioner recording any reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/decide-in-2-weeks-if-you-ll-permit-man-convicted-for-possessing-child-pornographic-material-to-enter-india-bombay-hc-to-centre/story-poJBkWIeAfbFAcurmA4wdL.html
04-12-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: No space for violation of building bye-laws||Do we want to live in a city of slums? One time regularisation of large scale building violations in rehabilitation colonies will be irrational, illogical and fraught with adverse implications, not only for the residents of these colonies but also for Chandigarh’s basic fabric and structure. Rehabilitation colonies are always planned based on minimum threshold of liveability and sustainability. Adding more area, more population and more activities will invariably lead to uncontrolled congestion, acute shortage of basic infrastructure, services and quality of life. Adding more space and activities beyond their capacity will turn these places into slums, defeating the very purpose for which they were planned and created. A detailed and objective evaluation will be required before any decision is taken. Considering the larger implications of regularising unauthorised construction, this will put in motion large scale similar constructions in other colonies and villages in UT, and destroy the very fabric of Chandigarh. If this is the intention of city fathers and part of their political agenda, the MC should be given all the power and unbridled authority to frame the policy, approve it and sincerely implement it to make Chandigarh a city of slums characterised by haphazard and large scale unauthorised and unplanned development. Jit Kumar Gupta, ChandigarhHefty penalty a mustThe MC should definitely not regularise large scale building violations in rehabilitation colonies. Doing so will encourage other people to do the same, who will know that all they have to do for approvals of housing units is pay a small penalty. The MC should ensure that such buildings are destroyed and the owners charged a hefty penalty. Ishita NaraOthers will be encouraged to break rulesMC must not allow large-scale building violations in rehabilitation colonies. Such a move gives tacit licence to others to break the rules in future. Regularisation processes will then become an unending ordeal for civic authorities. The department of urban planning of the Chandigarh administration should be given the authority to take cognisance of and deal with such problems. It is the only government agency qualified to ensure that Chandigarh is saved from cumulative urban blight. I suggest a unit in the state department be set up to study and document why such violations occur and work out ways of discouraging them while respecting people’s new requirements ushered in by socio-economic changes. A periodic examination of the building rules should be done as part of the planning principles and policy and necessary amendments warranted by development made beforehand. This is a sane way to conserve the original concept of the city beautiful based on Sun, Space, and Verdure – a farsighted idea that has made it a World City, not a merely world-class city. Dr SS Bhatti, ChandigarhOne-time settlement onlyTo rehabilitate residents of Chandigarh, particularly those belonging to the poor strata, Chandigarh administration, Chandigarh Housing Board, MC built dwelling units of several types. Out of these, normally several houses are of EWS or LIG houses just with one room accommodation with a little space in and outside of the room. In certain cases, only a single room is built without toilets as people are expected to use public toilets close by. With time, however, families grow and compel the allottees to add extensions to the housing units, which are treated as violations of the terms and conditions of the allotment. Though this could be risky when it comes to stability of the structure, poor families are forced to make the changes. MC authorities therefore need to take a compassionate decision to give them a chance to regularise the changes after paying a reasonable charge. However, this should be a one-time concession. Habitual offenders should not be allowed to make a mockery of the system. SK Khosla, ChandigarhFamilies compelled to make changesWhen the houses are allotted to the economically weaker sections either by the MC, estate office or the Chandigarh Housing Board, these houses are in a very shabby condition and are hardly liveable. Certain units don’t even have toilets and allottees are expected to use public conveniences. But gradually when families expand, the home owners renovate the units and then they are called encroachers. This is strange. The authorities concerned should compare the units and see which families actually desperately needed to make the changes and accordingly after ensuring the safety of the structures get these regularised. The homes of very poor families should definitely not be demolished. DS Chahal, ChandigarhDeal strictly with violationsOne time regularisation is a good move by the administration provided it doesn’t become a norm. Strict implementation of any rule is lacking in our system of governance and so those violating building norms need to be dealt with strictly. To set an example, let there be resumption of some plots/flats thereby ensuring that no one dares bend the rules. Chander VijSending a wrong messageRegularising violations will send the wrong message to the public that everyone is free to break the rules, which will pave the way for unlimited changes. However, given the risk to structures because of the violations, regular checks should be conducted to ensure people stick to the rules. Allottees should be made to pay hefty penalties for violations. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliDon’t demolish buildingsDemolition of a building if it is structurally safe should not be ordered, but to prevent repeat violations the administration should ensure that the homeowners are made to pay steep fines so that they do not repeat such acts again. Avinash GoyalTime for a fresh startThe MC is right in its decision to grant one-time regularisation of large-scale building violations in rehabilitation colonies. The reason is that most of these violations were done years ago and in case the home owners are penalised they are likely to move court for relief. It will then take years for the issues to be resolved. In many cases the violations have taken place because of poor enforcement of the extant rules and regulations by the MC officials. We will also have an opportunity to start afresh the implementation of the current regulations governing the rehabilitation colonies once the legacy violations are taken care of. One essential rider before regularising the building violations is that there will be no further tolerance by the MC of any violations henceforth. Anil Kumar YadavDon’t set a bad precedentChandigarh is the first planned city of the country. Therefore, rehabilitation colonies have also been developed with structural designs aimed at creating uniformity in design. The residents in these colonies have resorted to major building / structural changes and encroachments .The MC’s plan to regularise the violations might give relief in existing cases but it should not set a precedent for cases in future. Any violations after regularisation must be penalised heavily and the structure demolished.SS Arora, MohaliPositive impactAs a goodwill measure the authorities should regularise all buildings which are structurally safe and fall under extended FAR (floor area ratio) as a one-time measure. Some building authorities are increasing FAR keeping in view space restrictions within highly populated colonies. Nominal changes for regularising the violations should be imposed in rehabilitation colonies to not impose an unnecessary burden on financially backward families. Col TBS Bedi (retd)Law equal for allThe administration makes bye-laws to regulate construction and design of buildings. If a building plan is not prepared by an architect factoring in free flow of air and light, location and terrain, it is not approved by the government. A regulatory mechanism is put in place after consideration of factors such as requirements of neighbours. Regulating such additions, alterations and demolitions in violation of approved plan will amount to the administration rewarding rule breakers and punishing the law abiding members of the civic society. There are times when such changes also adversely affect the residents of neighbouring buildings by obstructing free flow of air/light or endangering its stability. It will not be right for the MC to implement a one-time regularisation policy for large-scale building violations not only in rehabilitation colonies but elsewhere as well. This will encourage more violations. Hence, demolition of unauthorised additions and alterations and violations should be the policy with no exception. Earning revenues by one-time regularisation policy should not be the aim. The law should apply equally to all citizens of India without any discrimination/distinction and violators should not be shown any mercy.Col SK Aggarwal (retd), Panchkula Only need based regularisationsThe MC is to blame for the mess for not checking violations in the first place.But now regularisation can be done provided: 1. The violations are not encroachments on government land 2. The basic structure of the building is left intact and not weakened3. Do not cause any inconvenience to anyone in the neighbourhood 4. Are strictly and judiciously need based. MC should evolve a policy for allowing need based alterations in future. AK Sharma, ChandigarhEncouraging spread of slumsThe MC plans to fill its coffers by regularisation of violations in housing units in rehabilitation colonies. This is an invitation to disaster as the lives of people will be at risk if the buildings are structurally weak. The MC first wasted money by rehabilitating the Sector 25 Kumhar Colony in sector 52 by constructing tin sheds, and is now rehabilitating them again in Maloya and demolishing the tin colony. Chandigarh is now not as beautiful as it used to be as councillors/ministers have been responsible for the spread of slums because of greed for votes.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliNo compromise on safetyWhile there should not be much of an objection to minor or technical violations and irregularities, it needs to be ensured that structural safety, privacy and rights of others are not compromised in any way by the regularisation. Doing so indiscriminately will only encourage people to break the rules. Everyone needs to learn that harsh punishment and strict implementation of rules will force people to comply. The authorities often look away when norms are violated and take action much later. Why wasn’t action taken against the defaulting MC officials? Rules are flouted with impunity with political support. This has to stop.DS Banati, MohaliShort-circuiting governanceOn the face of it, the so called one-time regularisation policy for large scale building violations may seem to be a people friendly gesture, but in fact it tantamounts to incentivising breaking of rules besides compromising on building safety. All logic against allowing breach of rules will cut no ice with politicians who lord over the bureaucracy, the custodians of statute/rule books.Election time is the best period to pluck the fruits of short-circuiting governance. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaNo place for selfish acts A modern city such as Chandigarh should not be destroyed by regularising unplanned structures, something that the MC started doing the moment it came into existence. Cases of building violations are increasing with the support of politicians due to vote banks. Democracy does not give special power to anyone to spoil the beauty of a city because of their selfishness. Needs and baseless desires cannot be fulfilled. Violations should be stopped by the administration. Politicians should not be supported and helped by bureaucrats in such cases, which should be dealt with strictly. Elected MC members should understand their duties towards the beautiful city and try to ensure it stays this way. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliLitigation won’t helpDemocratically, all laws, especially those related to buildings, should cater for changes with the passage of time. Therefore, building laws made by the UT administration at the time of Le Corbusier need to be updated. Dealing with those violating building laws can lead to long drawn court cases, which are a waste of time and money. Chandigarh has now allowed open space utilisation rules and other structural changes. It will be thoughtful if one time regularisation policy is considered to rehabilitate the colonies. This will check the huge expense of filing cases in courts.Capt Amar Jeet Kumar, MohaliNo pressure on officialsAll violations should be penalised, even demolished. Enforcement agencies need to act strictly and UT adviser Manoj Parida should ensure that the officials do not face political pressures to bring the guilty to book. The enforcement wing should continue this activity with zeal, and ensure that Mohali and Chandigarh become smart cities and not encroached upon urban villages. I fail to understand why the MC is being lenient on violators. Allottees in lower income houses have added multiple floors, extended balconies and cantilevers for conversion to rooms, which causes stress on the structural stability of the original structures. The governments are trying to legalise encroachments on public land, only for vote-banks, showing total disregard for the laws that are in force today. There needs to be a zero tolerance policy to such acts.

04-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get 10 conservation reserves||The state board for wildlife (SBWL) on Friday cleared a proposal to declare 10 conservation reserves (CR) spreading over 1,000 sq km in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who chaired the meeting, also approved the declaration of 269 sq km area at Kanhargaon in Gondpipri tehsil, Chandrapur as a wildlife sanctuary. A committee was also set up to study the leopard deaths, leopard kills and proposes measures to reduce it in the state.Thackeray, who also unveiled Maharashtra Forest Manual, 2020, reiterated that the state government will conserve forest and it will not just remain lip service.“Forests are an important part of our lives. We cannot act only as per our convenience; we talk about global warming but hack trees on the other hand. This is not correct. The forest we have must be conserved and expanded. The wildlife in the forests follow the law of nature and they follow it. We, on the other hand, make laws and rules that are convenient to us, and even break them,” Thackeray said, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO). Aaditya Thackeray, state environment and tourism minister, who was present during the meeting, called the decisions taken in the meeting “historic”. He said, “In no other time has the environment and wildlife got so much importance that it always deserved. We are committed to being a green government and will ensure that sustainable development continues.”Among those approved in western Maharashtra were Chandgad CR (225.24 sq km), Ajra-Bhudargad (246.63 sq km), Gaganbawda (105.48 sq km), Panhalgad (72.9 sq km), Vishalgad (92.24 sq km), all in Kolhapur district.At Sindhudurg, the 56.92 sq km Dodamarg-Amboli CR which connects tiger breeding areas of Karnataka’s Bhimgad Sanctuary and Goa’s Mhadei Sanctuary was approved, and Jor-Jambhali CR (65.11 sq km) and bird haven of Mayani CR (8.67 sq km) at Satara, were approved.In Vidarbha, Munia (97.37 sq km) in Nagpur and Mahendri (67.48 sq km) in Amravati was approved as CR, but the board was yet to decide on Mogarkasa (37.7 sq km) in Nagpur.Aaditya in a tweet said that it was decided that there will be a “subgroup of the board to work on the upgrade of conservation reserves to sanctuaries with adequate dialogue with local populations across various places in the state.”The committee will study leopard-human conflicts and will look into rising leopard deaths and leopard kills. Between January and December, 172 leopards were killed, which is the highest in at least five years for a calendar year.(With inputs from Badri Chatterjee)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-get-10-conservation-reserves/story-buPIYNCN2C78RDEOkL1UeL.html

Junaid and Asif are sons of Iqbal Mirchi, an aide of gangster Dawood Ibrahim, while Hajra is Mirchi’s wifeED officials told HT that the agency has also requested the court to issue order directing the authority concerned to confiscate the properties belonging to these three under FEO Act.Open ended non-bailable warrants have already been issued against all three on the basis of the prosecution complaint filed on December 9, 2019 by ED before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court.The anti-money laundering agency had initiated money laundering probe against Mirchi and his family on September 26, 2019.While probing the matter, ED has, in the past, provisionally attached assets linked to the Mirchi family to the tune of approximately ₹798 crore in India and abroad under the provisions of PMLA.ED officials have so far arrested five accused persons including Dewan Housing Finance Corporation’s (DHFL) Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and Humayun Merchant in the case.The probe has revealed that DHFL allegedly extended loans to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi who died in the United Kingdom in August 2013.

04-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP demands no West Bengal government employee should be used in 2021 polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has urged the Election Commission of India to conduct the crucial 2021 West Bengal assembly polls with the help of central government employees only and not to involve any employee of the West Bengal government in the poll process. This came a day after a section of the state government employees expressed their allegiance towards the Trinamool Congress in a meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat.“The BJP demands that in the interest of conducting free and fair polls, which is one of the prime objectives of the ECI, the entire poll process should be conducted by central government employees and not a single person from the state should be used,” the BJP wrote in its letter to the chief electoral officer (CEO) of West Bengal. A four-member BJP delegation led by Pratap Banerjee, vice president of the party’s state unit, met the CEO on Friday. Also read: BJP springs a surprise in Hyderabad civic polls, keeps TRS away from majority mark“We were shocked to learn that on December 3, a meeting was held in the state secretariat between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and members of the Paschim Banga Rajya Karmachari Federation (a federation of state government employees), in which the convener and members of the federation in a serial manner pledged their allegiance to Banerjee and TMC in the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha elections,” the letter, submitted to the state CEO, stated. The BJP also alleged that in the meeting one of the federation members went to the extent of asking the chief minister to give them guidelines on how they can work towards ensuring electoral victory for the TMC. The TMC, however, took a dig at the BJP. “There is no end to the demands of the BJP and they want everything. Someday they may demand that state elections be held with the help of Interpol,” said Tapas Roy, state minister and a TMC veteran. With an eye on the crucial 2021 Bengal assembly elections, the chief minister also announced 3 per cent dearness allowance for 10 lakh state government employees from January 1, 2021. This would cost the state exchequer Rs 2,200 crore.Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s head in West Bengal, has already said that there would be heavy deployment of central armed police forces during the elections and the state police will not be allowed to come near the polling booths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-demands-no-west-bengal-government-employee-should-be-used-in-2021-polls/story-ln7Fck4tdouVERn94lm86M.html

However, after a counselling session by the medical college doctors, he was not found eligible for the vaccination, as per the minister, authorities of the medical college and the university which runs the medical college. The minister on Thursday expressed his willingness to volunteer for the vaccine trial amid reports in a section of media that response to the trial from people was not good and that in the first four days of the trial less than 50 people turned up for the same. The minister said on Thursday, “I am willing to volunteer for Covid-19 vaccine trial. I will go to the medical college on Friday. If people like us come forward for the trial it will inspire others to do so.”Dean of People’s Medical College, Bhopal, Col (retd) Anil Dixit said on Friday, “As per the guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) the person desiring to volunteer for Covid-19 vaccine trial should not have any of his family members infected with Covid-19. Since, as per the information from the minister, his wife and son were infected with the virus, vaccination of the minister is not possible under the eligibility criteria.”Also read: BJP springs a surprise in Hyderabad civic polls, keeps TRS away from majority mark बहुत इच्छा थी कि #Corona वैक्सीन के ट्रायल में वॉलंटियर बनूं और इसके माध्यम से समाज के लिए कुछ करूं। वैक्सीन ट्रायल के लिए ICMR के एलिजिबिलिटी क्राइटेरिया में फिट नहीं बैठ सका इसकी मन में बहुत पीड़ा है।#COVID19 #CoronavirusVaccine @drharshvardhan @BJP4India @BJP4MP pic.twitter.com/y8YIPUYb7nHome minister Narottam Mishra said, “I thought it was an opportunity for me to do something to serve the society but I was not found eligible after the counselling session. This is why I am pained. However, I also feel that the process of monitoring of the volunteers after the vaccination should be simplified as it involves regular monitoring for over a period one year. This may lead to apprehensions in the mind of people volunteering for the trial.”Vice-chancellor of People’s University, which runs People’s Medical College, Dr Rajesh Kapoor said, “The reason why a person who, or any member of his family, has been a Covid-19 patient is excluded from the list of volunteers for the trial is that there are chances of them having developed antibody against the virus after being infected with the disease. Hence, such a trial will not suggest a true result.”Dr Kapoor said, “The trial began four days back but I can’t comment on the level of response of people to the trial as we are not supposed to share the same with media as per the ICMR’s guidelines. However, the trial is being conducted as per the international norms and we are ensuring compliance of every aspect of the trial. We have a target of conducting the trial on 2,000 volunteers in a month or so but we don’t want to go for any publicity campaign either as this might result in a large number of people turning up for the trial and it will be difficult for us to manage the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-minister-volunteers-for-covid-19-vaccine-trial-gets-rejected/story-B53msJifvl3XiH6uEB4xcM.html
04-12-2020||Chandigarh||Badnore inaugurates remodelling work at Chandigarh’s Sector-39 waterworks||UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday laid the foundation stone for augmentation of water storage capacity at Sector 39 waterworks, virtually from Punjab Raj Bhawan. While briefing about the project, MC commissioner (MCC) KK Yadav said that at present the available raw water storage capacity at the waterworks is 48 million gallons (MG), and the clear water capacity is 15 MG. This storage capacity is sufficient for the city’s half-day water requirement only. In case any of the four rising mains (pipes) from Kajauli get damaged or an electricity shutdown in Kajauli, it takes approximately one day to get the repairs done and results in a water crisis in the city. But with the proposal to create additional raw water storage capacity by remodelling/redesigning the existing seven storage tanks, their capacity will be increased, he added. The MCC said that the height of the raw water tanks will also be increased from 48 MG to 92 MG. He informed that the total cost of the project is Rs 39 crore, of which the Chandigarh administration has provided Rs 28 crore, and Chandigarh Smart City Limited has provided Rs 11 crore. The work will be completed in two years. Yadav said that after the completion of this project, the total water storage capacity at the waterworks will be 109 MG, which is sufficient to meet the city’s peak daily requirement. He said that the CREST has also proposed to install floating solar panels on the raw water tanks that will have a capacity of 12 megawatts. The governor said that the MC is providing the citizens of Chandigarh access to safe and clean water three times a day, through the project of enhancing the storage capacity of clear water tanks, provision of pumping machinery, the recycling pump house, and laying of required lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/badnore-inaugurates-remodelling-work-at-chandigarh-s-sector-39-waterworks/story-fi83Duj6IKcGcM374P3muI.html
04-12-2020||Chandigarh||HC warns it will stay EWS admissions in Chandigarh school||In a significant development, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Chandigarh administration to clear its stand on reimbursements to private schools to admit students from economically weaker sections (EWS), saying it would stay EWS admissions for the next academic session in a Sector 27 school if the administration did not respond. The high court acted on the plea of Chandigarh’s Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, which runs Bhavan Vidyalaya in Sector 27. The school had approached the court in August alleging that UT had not paid reimbursements since 2012 and on October 26 the court had asked for the UT’s response within four weeks, which was not given. A stay on admissions are likely to have an impact on other schools too, which might move the court.According to data available with the UT education department, 56 schools had reserved 730 seats for the year 2019-2020 under the Right to Education Act for the EWS category. “The administration has not given reimbursements to private schools for the past nine years. It was given only for the entry level class,” said HS Mamik, president, Independent School Association (ISA). On Friday, the application was filed by Bhavan Vidyalaya, submitting that the UT administration had issued a notice for the next academic session without taking a decision on the reimbursements. The school pleaded that the administration be restrained from compelling it to admit students under the EWS category till the previous dues were reimbursed. Rs2.5 crore due to school, court toldA sum of around Rs 2.5 crore was due to the school since the year 2011-12, the court was told. Meanwhile, the administration’s counsel stated that a decision had already been taken as directed by the court and a detailed response would be submitted by the next date of hearing. He also claimed that the school was entitled to a reimbursement of Rs29 lakh and not Rs 2.5 crore, because it admitted a specific number of students under the land allotment scheme for schools under which it had undertaken to admit EWS students. Reimbursements would be paid only for 15% EWS students and not 25% as claimed, the counsel said.This claim was, however, countered by Manisha Gandhi, senior advocate and the school’s counsel. She said that the amount stated by UT took care of expenses incurred while admitting the students at the entry level. Every year, a certain number of students were admitted and promoted to the next class. Thus, the student strength kept increasing but the administration had not repaid the expenses incurred in this context, Gandhi told the court, adding that as of now the school has 212 EWS students and the intake initially was 23 students. To this, however, UT’s counsel had no answer. The court adjourned the matter for December 16, observing that if a satisfactory explanation for the figure of Rs 29 lakh was not forthcoming, EWS admissions for the coming academic session would be stayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-warns-it-will-stay-ews-admissions-in-chandigarh-school/story-dwUd7hf45tIEwqrpsKN18I.html

04-12-2020||Gurugram||Will move no-confidence motion against BJP-JJP govt in Haryana, says Hooda in Gurugram||Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday said that the Congress would move a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government in Haryana. Slamming the government over its stance on the farmers’ protest, the Congress leader said that it had lost the support of people and the House, and demanded that a special session of the Vidhan Sabha be convened at the earliest. Speaking at a press conference in the city, Hooda said that some MLAs were playing a double role and making statements against the government and in support of the farmers’ movement, but continuing to support the government. “The no-confidence motion will make clear who stands where. We will get to know who is standing with the farmers and who is playing a double role. We request the governor to convene a special session soon,” said Hooda adding that while two independent MLAs had already withdrawn their support, 4-5 MLAs of JJP had been making contradictory statements. On being asked if independent MLAs, who had supported BJP earlier, were in touch with Congress, Hooda said that the no-confidence motion will make things clear. “Five to six MLAs have already made statements in the public. This is the reason why we are bringing the no-confidence motion.” He refused to share if BJP MLAs were also in touch with the party. Hooda also said that along with the no-confidence motion, the Congress would bring an amendment seeking punishment for anyone purchasing crops at a price lesser than the Minimum Support Price (MSP).Criticizing chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for his remarks that the state’s farmers had not participated in the protests against the new agriculture laws, he said that the state government had made a big mistake by using lathi-charge and tear gas on farmers. “The Haryana government made a mistake by using water cannons and tear gas. How can anyone stop farmers from going to the national capital of the county? Their actions are condemnable,” said Hooda. He also raised objections to statements made by ministers from the government alluding to foreign funding of farmers and connections to Khalistan. Reacting to Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare Minister JP Dalal’s statement about foreign funding being provided to farmers, Hooda said that the minster should apologise and resign for insulting farmers. “This is an insult to the farmers as well as the country. This is the biggest farmer movement I have seen. Their demands are genuine. The government should listen to them and not aggravate matters further,” said Hooda. Responding to allegations that the Congress was misleading farmers and indulging in political opportunism, Hooda said that the party was simply extending support to the farmers. “Farmers’ protest is beyond caste, religion, region and politics. The agitation is being led by farmers alone; it represents the voice of a common farmer. Congress is only extending support to farmers,” said Hooda. BJP Haryana spokesperson Raman Malik accused the Congress of making efforts to destabilise a democratically elected government. “Haryana government has been elected democratically. It’s not a real-estate deal which can be easily broken or dropped by Mr Hooda. Haryana will defeat your agenda” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/will-move-no-confidence-motion-against-bjp-jjp-govt-in-haryana-says-hooda-in-gurugram/story-381aOhFWC5XcDm9W78G0QP.html

This includes more than 200,000 health care workers and the process for the same has started across the state. In Gurugram, more than 23,000 private health care workers and 4, 575 government workers have submitted their details for the same.On December 2, a meeting was held at the state level on Covid-19 vaccine roll out and implementation. As per the official data, the 6.7 million targets includes almost 250,000 health care workers, 450,000 frontline workers and 5.8 million people above the age of 50 years and 220,000 people with comorbidities, aged below 50.Although the registration process has been ongoing for more than a month, it is in the last week that the process gained momentum. To speed up the process, the Gurugram health department has set a 24-hour deadline for over 176 private health care facilities that have failed to share the data. Of 728 private hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and diagnostic labs, at least 230 had submitted details till December 1. This mostly included big hospitals and labs. In the last three days, the number has increased to almost 550.The issue of delay in vaccine beneficiaries’ data was raised at a district level task force meeting under the Covid-19 vaccine programme on December 1. Private health care units were given till December 4 to furnish details of health care workers. “Almost 75% of the data has been fed in the government portal. For the remaining, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has been asked to ramp up the process of collecting details,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, who held a meeting with IMA representatives on Friday. Dr MP Singh, who was recently appointed as the district nodal immunisation officer, said, “A day has been given to private facilities and IMA to share details. More than 23,000 private health care workers are now registered. The data collection work has to be finished before the second task force meeting next week.”In October, the Union ministry of health and family welfare clarified that frontline health workers — doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers and surveillance officers — will be considered as the priority group to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an all-party meet on Friday, to discuss the vaccination strategy, said that eight potential vaccines, including three indigenous ones, are in different stages of trials. According to a statement issued by the central government, the Centre is working with states to identify the priority groups for vaccination that will include health workers, frontline workers and high-risk individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-targets-6-7-million-vaccinations-in-first-year-after-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out/story-rmBCruamWFseyCtNAEOzeL.html

Thousands of farmers across the country have been protesting against the three newly enacted farm laws— The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — passed by Parliament during the monsoon session. The farmers fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of large corporations and lead to the removal of the minimum support price they receive on important crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/16-protesters-detained-at-kherki-daula-toll-plaza/story-7wCcQq0c7KtgIVORSzBzxK.html
04-12-2020||Gurugram||Parents hesitant to fill school forms for Family ID scheme||The district administration has roped in private schools for circulation of forms for the government’s Family ID Card scheme, which is aimed at bringing welfare schemes, property deeds and driving licences under one umbrella. However, parents of schools students say they are apprehensive of sharing personal information like Aadhaar, PAN (Permanent Account Number), income status as well as caste through the schools.Parents said filling the Family Id Card form, initially rolled out in 2019, has been made mandatory by schools based on the directives issued by the Haryana government. The Parivar Pehchan Patra or Family ID Card scheme was introduced to create a database of the state population. The state administration had first collected the details of the government employees and then reached out to Below Poverty Line (BPL) population who are availing of benefits under government schemes.According to the data available with the district administration, at least 112, 236 households have been covered under the scheme. To increase the enrolment, the district administration has been holding camps in different government buildings. Departments like food supply and education have been included in the task of reaching out to people. Private schools have started circulating Family ID Card forms to parents over the last few days and asked them to submit the form directly in school or through mail. Prasanto K Roy, a city-based technology and public policy professional, whose ward is a class 9 student at a private school in Sohna, received the letter on December 2. The mail sent by the school states that the hard copy of the filled form has to be shared at the school reception or a scanned copy of the same emailed by December 10. “This data collection exercise is problematic on multiple fronts. A lot of data is being sought, above and beyond what is required to deliver education and related services,” said Roy. He said that the demand for Aadhaar number violates Supreme Court guidelines. “The government website says ‘data to be taken with consent’, but the state government is mandating that consent via schools. There are also reports of plans to cross-link this database with other databases. In the absence of a privacy law, I worry about the potential abuse of this data,” said Roy. Another parent, whose child is enrolled in a school located in Sector 49, requesting anonymity, said, “There is no official notification by the state government that makes submission of details like Aadhaar mandatory. Forcing parents to give their details is a violation of privacy. There aren’t enough details that could clarify our doubts.”The administration has received almost 25,00 filled forms through private schools, so far, said Mahinder Singh, city project officer for Family ID Card scheme. He, however, clarified, “Aadhaar, address and mobile number are mandatory columns to fill. People can leave PAN detail out.” According to him, nearly 80% of the data from government schools has already been submitted. Indu Boken, the district education officer, said, “In the initial days, some parents had concerns about sharing bank and PAN Card details. After discussions with the administration, filling up these two columns are now not mandatory. I have spoken to school association heads and assuaged their concerns.”KR Pratap Singh, president of the Haryana Progressive School Conference, a consortium of private schools, supported the state government’s move. “There is no harm in having the headcount of a family and sharing the Aadhaar number for a scheme that would lead to better planning of the future. As many as 85 schools under the consortium have already started circulating mails and Family ID forms. We have asked the school management to finish the task at the earliest.”However, in a letter, Pratap asked schools to let dissenting parents be and those who have reservations against specific columns can omit those.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/parents-hesitant-to-fill-school-forms-for-family-id-scheme/story-hZzLWcvB5sdfxTrFslqSvJ.html
04-12-2020||Gurugram||Air remains toxic; may get worse, warn experts||Air quality in the city remained “very poor” for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, recording 318 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily AQI bulletin. Gurugram, however, remained the least polluted city in the National Capital Region thanks to the influence of easterly winds, which, experts and officials said, are dispersing pollutants to a degree.Delhi, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad all recorded higher levels of air pollution on Friday. Delhi and Faridabad recorded “very poor” AQI, with readings of 382 and 383, respectively. However, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida, lying further east, recorded severe air with AQI readings in excess of 400. Experts and officials said that “very poor” air is likely to persist in the region till at least December end, and cautioned that another severe smog episode is likely around December 7. Sachin Panwar, an independent city-based air quality scientist, said, “The current pollution levels will persist for the next few weeks, with periodic episodes of severe smog. There are no weather systems expected to pass over the region in the foreseeable future, and with temperatures continuing to drop, pollutants have begun to accumulate and air may enter the severe category in Gurugram too, if wind speeds slow down further.” Panwar pointed out that winds are currently blowing from the southeast of Delhi, and causing westward dispersal of pollutants. “Gurugram, lying south of Delhi, is positioned favourably. Wind speeds in the city were also higher than in Noida and Ghaziabad, where models showed stagnant airflow on Friday, leading to severe air in those cities.” Gurugram’s average level of ultrafine particulate matter (PM2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was recorded at 360 micrograms per cubic metres (ug/m3) on Friday.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in upper end of very poor category on 05.12.2020 and very poor category on 06.12.2020... The air quality is likely to improve from December 7 but remain largely in Very Poor category.” Wind speeds are expected to remain between 5 and 10kmph over the next three days.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “We are monitoring the situation. Grap rules are already in place. If air quality enters the severe category, we will abide by any orders that are issued, either by the CPCB or the new commission on air quality management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-remains-toxic-may-get-worse-warn-experts/story-ljr1w91xzU4gBcoabmm6YN.html

MCG’s Ward 28 includes sectors 38, 39, and Jharsa.As per MCG officials, the drive will commence at 8.30am from Sector 38 on Saturday and will continue till 5pm. MCG officials privy to the matter said that areas falling under sectors 38 and 39 have a high quantity of C&D waste, due to which Ward 28 was selected for the initiative.Workers will clear mixed waste, C&D waste, and also implement measures to curb pollution, such as cleaning high dust accumulation stretches and subsequently, sprinkling water on them. Further, trees and grass in the ward would also be pruned by horticulture wing officials while all illegal hoardings and posters will be removed and seized by civic body officials. MCG joint commissioner Pradeep Ahlawat said that the garbage and debris will be transported to designated spots. Further, all roads and stretches would be made dust-free. “Due to the heavy collection and clearance of waste, sizeable numbers of earthmovers and tractor-trolleys have been provided to the workers along with tree pruning machines. Unlike the usual practice of allocating resources for a citywide coverage, the rationale behind this drive is to thoroughly clean a specific ward in a single day’s operation before proceeding to a different area,” said Ahlawat. Officials said that depending on the drive’s success, it would be replicated in MCG’s 34 other wards.With more than 800 staff members from MCG’s sanitation branch, C&D waste branch and horticulture branch taking part in the drive, the civic body has directed all workers to maintain strict coronavirus protocols, such as the continuous wearing of masks and social distancing.It is the largest gathering the MCG has arranged since the national lockdown in March. MCG had initiated a similar initiative from February 25 to March 4 last year when the civic body ran a 168-hour continuous drive to clean 28 stretches, covering more than 120 kilometres of road length in the city. More than 2,500 MCG workers participated in the week-long drive on a rotational basis. In the drive, workers lifted garbage, sprinkled water on roads after removing dust, cleared posters, hoardings, encroachments, repaired footpaths, maintained green belts, and desilt drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-clean-up-ward-28-on-saturday/story-BLuouMvVYiqO2SVFmt1QHJ.html

The PHED officials swung into action for a reality check of the projects days after CM Nitish Kumar called upon the legislators in the assembly last month to bring to his notice about any kind of irregularities they found in the execution of the seven resolves programme, of which tap water supply scheme is also a part. He said that 89 per cent of the households had been connected with tap water supply project. As per the reports submitted by the district magistrates of 28 out of 38 districts, 186 of the 2,954 projects inspected were noticed incomplete, while 279 projects were found non-functional during the inspection. As many as 1,952 projects were running without any complaint, but 562 projects of different scales had minor issues and 189 had major problems. Also read: AT HTLS 2020, Nirmala Sitharaman says MSP for farm produce will continuePHED secretary Jitendra Srivastava, however, claimed that data was being misinterpreted as the officials reported on many incomplete projects that were not supposed to be inspected right now. “Only the complete projects were to be inspected. The survey report categorically said that as many as 2,604 projects out of the total compete 2,640 schemes were found functional,” said the secretary. He said that the DMs have been told to ensure complete rectification of minor and major problems in the scheme within a week and impose a suitable penalty on the responsible contractors. “Inspections are being carried out by independent bodies for realistic assessment of the projects. The DMs have been told to carry out project assessment in days to come,” said Srivastava. In Khagaria, 49 out of 231 projects inspected by the PHED - highest in any district - and were found to be incomplete. The maximum number of minor complaints (144) in the scheme was reported from Purnia, while Kisanganj has the maximum number of projects (82) affected by major complaints. The opposition parties, including the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), had raked up irregularities in the seven resolves schemes during the elections by dubbing it as the largest scam in the history of the state. The state government has allotted Rs 4,310 crore budget to the PHED to connect all houses across 56,079 wards with tap water supply by the end of this fiscal. Officials said that around 49,000 wards have been covered under the project and work on the rest was going on in full swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/reality-check-41-tap-water-supply-projects-in-bihar-partially-or-fully-non-functional/story-burecB6w0hyqUnulDcdAPJ.html

A heavy police force was deployed at the spot along with the building branch officials of all the four MC zones.The authorities said that encroachments were done on-road portion and a chunk of land earmarked for a leisure valley in the area. The civic body will now take up road construction projects in the area.While many houses have completely been razed, only the illegal part of a large number of houses, animal sheds were demolished by the MC. Residents gathered in huge numbers to demolish the buildings suspecting that the MC might damage the entire building while razing the illegal portions.Owners of a few houses/godowns also sought time for making some alternate arrangements. The civic body officials said that another demolition drive will be conducted in the area if owners failed to raze encroachments on their own.Assistant town planner (ATP), MS Bedi said, “The encroachments have been razed and the MC will now commence the process to construct the road. Also, the encroachments have been removed from the area where LIT has to establish a leisure valley. No protests were witnessed at the spot and the drive was conducted peacefully in presence of the police force.” Municipal town planner (MTP) SS Bindra also visited the demolition site to take stock of the situation.Earlier on November 2, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu also visited the spot and directed the officials to remove encroachments from the road portion as well as from the land earmarked for establishing a leisure valley. Ashu stated that the project to establish a leisure valley will be completed in six months. Residents left without a roof in cold weatherLeft homeless in chilly weather, the residents cried foul stating that no action is being taken against wealthy house owners and school that is situated on the other side of the stream, which is also a part of encroachment.They said that no notices were served to them.A house owner Amit said, “We have been living in this area for over a decade and the MC has demolished our house even when it was not established on the road portion. My family including children and the elderly are now without a roof in these extreme weather conditions.”It is said that most of the area residents are labourers and are struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. The demolition drive taken up by the civic body has added to their woes as even the sheds established for the livestock have been razed by the authorities.A month after the demarcation process was completed, the MC is yet to initiate action against over 950 permanent encroachments in the form of houses, commercial and industrial encroachments alongside Buddha Nullah. During a visit to the city on November 27, the monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also directed the civic body to start demolishing illegal buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anti-encroachment-drive-ludhiana-mc-razes-200-illegal-structures-in-gopal-nagar/story-l8qGF48gxq8o9qxixk3ZYI.html

04-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers blocking essential services, increasing Covid-19 threat, says petition before SC||A public interest petition before the Supreme Court on Friday has sought the immediate removal or dispersal of farmers gathered at Delhi borders in order to ease the movement of traffic and prevent a possible spread of Covid-19 among protesters, as the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws entered its ninth day on Friday.The petition, filed by law student Rishabh Sharma, also cited the October 7 judgment of the Supreme Court, on the months-long protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh against the amended citizenship rules, in which the apex court had said that while the right to protest and dissent against governments is a fundamental right, it is not an absolute one and public places cannot be occupied indefinitely to stage protests. The court had also held that such protests ought to take place in designated areas and not on public roads.Sharma pointed out that despite farmers being allotted the Nirankari grounds in central Delhi’s Burari to peacefully protest, lakhs of farmers were still gathered at the borders of the capital city, blocking traffic along arterial roads connecting the city with the National Capital Region.“This protest is causing lot of trouble to the citizens of India,” the petition stated and demanded the opening of the borders and a direction to protesters to move to the designated place.Sharma also said such massive gatherings have the potential to become Covid-19 hot spots besides blocking essential medical and emergency services. “The protest is blocking the roads for all the emergency/medical services which are very much required to be supplied within the territory of Delhi in order to stop the spread of coronavirus as the cases of coronavirus are increasing rapidly in Delhi,” stated the petition filed through advocate Om Prakash Parihar.The petition also expressed concern over the health of elderly farmers protesting at the border points. “The coronavirus is affecting mainly elderly people and the protest at Delhi border is mostly consisting of elderly men and women. The petitioner is seeking urgent direction to shift them (protesting farmers) to the place already allotted by the Delhi police in view of immediate threat of coronavirus infection and spread.”Security personnel continued to remain deployed at Singhu, Tikri, Chilla and Ghazipur border points. Several routes in and around the capital are closed on Friday and vehicles are re-routed wherever possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-blocking-essential-services-increasing-covid-19-threat-says-petition-before-sc/story-bt3FwC8CwSVPvmxShQBAhP.html
04-12-2020||City||Delhi govt orders shifting of unused tents from Burari to Singhu border||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Friday directed the district administration to shift unused tents from the Burari ground to Singhu border, where a large group of farmers and their families from Punjab, Haryana and other states are protesting against three contentious farm laws passed by Parliament in September.The directions were issued after health minister Satyendar Jain visited the Singhu Border protest site on Friday afternoon to look into arrangements. “We want to ensure that at least the elderly people, women and children get the tents. We have to protect them in the winter and from Covid-19 too,” Jain said.HT had on Friday published a report flagging the lack of arrangements by the government at the Singhu border and underutilised amenities at Burari.By Friday afternoon, even as representatives of farmer groups engaged with the central government, the size of the crowd in Sindhu and several other city borders swelled with several protesting groups leaving the Burari ground – designated as a protest site by the central government last week.At the Singhu border, a large group of protesters are living in makeshift tents set up on roads and truck and tractor carriages, with numerous makeshift kitchens set up in the vicinity. Help from several student groups, charitable bodies and non-government organisations have been poured in over the past one week – providing arrangements ranging from toilets to medical centres. “The farmers are being deliberately harassed by the people in power… A bill which is meant for the farmers should be made after taking their consensus. Politicising the matter will not help,” Jain said at the Singhu border.Later, he requested revenue minister Kailash Gahlot to formally issue directions regarding the shifting of tents from one location to another.The tents set up by the government at Burari are fireproof and water-resistant, a government official said. Officials, however, did not give a count of such available tents, saying if there is a shortage, it will be covered by Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-orders-shifting-of-unused-tents-from-burari-to-singhu-border/story-l8Yt96129aGRHiOSe58JZP.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Minimum wages in Delhi to go up slightly||Delhi will witness a slight increase in the minimum wages for workers for the first time after the Covid-19 pandemic, with the government approving an increase in the dearness allowance . The increased minimum wages would apply retrospectively from October 1, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday.After the latest increase in the dearness allowance, minimum wages in Delhi will be Rs 15,492 per month for unskilled workers, Rs 17,096 for semi-skilled workers and Rs 18,797 for skilled workers, said a statement issued the office of Sisodia, who also holds the labour portfolio.Currently applicable minimum wages in Delhi are Rs 14,842 per month for unskilled workers, Rs 16,341 for semi-skilled-workers and Rs 17,991 for skilled workers.Technically, minimum wages were last revised in Delhi in March 2017, which was notified in October 2019 – after the Supreme Court’s nod – after a long legal tussle involving industry groups, labour unions and the city government.Other than such revisions, minimum wages are supposed to witness a variable increase biannually with the concerned state government doing a fresh assessment of the dearness allowance element in the wages after giving due consideration to factors such as average all-India consumer price index numbers.This year, dearness allowance points – which are factored in during the bi-annual assessment process – were frozen by the Central government for the period between January 1 and June 30, in the light of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, thus affecting the bi-annual assessment process.“Dearness allowance for workers – especially those who are at the bottom of the social strata -- cannot remain frozen, especially at times of crisis caused by a pandemic. Accordingly, the new minimum wages, after including Dearness Allowance, will be applicable to unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled categories in all scheduled employments. These revised wages will be applicable from October 1, 2020,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minimum-wages-in-delhi-to-go-up-slightly/story-JWSuEEWyMqFEqhhZJ81rzN.html

Zahid had named the accused in their statement that he was present at the time of looting the shop in question.The special public prosecutor for the police had also said that the mobile phone location of the accused stated that he was present at the spot while also adding that all the other co-accused in the present case are in judicial custody. He submitted that there are 100 persons seen in the CCTV footage, however, it is difficult to identify the petitioner in the said CCTV footage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-arson/story-7djhjGzPb4lzIsQk6fBX2I.html
04-12-2020||City||DDC polls: Nail-biting triangular contest in north Kashmir’s Sangrama||North Kashmir’s Wagoora and Sangrama, where polling was held under the third phase of the district development council (DDC) elections on Friday, has candidates from powerful political clans sitting on the edge of their seats.While the DDC seat in Wagoora is reserved for women, for which Safina Baig, wife of former PDP patron Muzaffar Hussain Baig, is contesting as an Independent against the joint candidate of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), Sangrama has a triangular contest in store with journalist-turned-politician Suhail Bukhari, a People’s Alliance candidate, up against Jammu Kashmir Apni Party candidate and former legislator Shoaib Lone and Irfan Hafeez, an Independent.Polling for both the seats was held amid tight security and more than 25 percent voters exercised their franchise.Muzaffar Baig had recently resigned from the PDP as its patron after wife Safina, who was the head of PDP’s women wing, was denied a ticket by the PAGD and instead the seat was given to an NC candidate. This led Safina to contest as an independent candidate in the DDC polls. Baigs, who have earlier enjoyed influence over two Baramulla and Sangrama seats, faced flak in the bastions after Muzaffar Baig nephew Javeed Baig left the PDP to join Apni Party. Another one of Muzaffar’s brothers also joined the Apni Party. Moreover, a day before polling, the former Baramulla MP’s son from his first wife, Zahid Baig, released a video criticising Safina on social media.“This election is an important one for the Baigs, especially Safina. If she manages to win the DDC seat, they (Baigs) can start afresh from this place,” said young businessman Fayaz Ahmad after casting his vote at a polling station set up inside Government School, Sultanpora.“Over 300 people have voted in the first four hours and more are coming in. It is going to be triangular contest between Safina, the Apni Party and the alliance candidates,” he said adding that it is high-stake battle for senior Baig (Muzaffar).At Kreeri, the native village of former minister and NC leader Basharat Bukhari, voters came in small groups at three polling stations. “This is a local election, but one of the most important one for Baig, Bukhari and Shoaib Lone,” said Kreeri BDC chairman Ghulam Mohiudin Sofi, while asking his supporters to vote on the symbol of a particular candidate.The Lones are contesting on both the seats with Nasreena for Wagoora and Shoaib for Sangrama. Shoaib had lost in the last two assembly elections by a thin margin, so victory is crucial for him this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ddc-polls-nail-biting-triangular-contest-in-north-kashmir-s-sangrama/story-7J1nBdomNHNIfWCnkunYWO.html

Sharma was arrested in the case related to the alleged murder of a man by a riotous mob in New Usmanpur area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-kalita-points-fingers-at-police-during-hearing-on-bail-plea/story-Tr05TOW0X5TxrflsVzPIwJ.html

04-12-2020||City||Delhi’s AQI settles at far end of very poor due to change in wind pattern, may turn severe by Saturday||New Delhi: Delhi’s air quality plunged to the far end of the ‘very poor’ zone on Friday as the wind speed and pattern changed, resulting in the slow dispersion of pollutants. At least 17 of the 35 monitoring stations had turned deep red, reaching the ‘severe’ zone on Friday. The overall air quality index (AQI) is likely to deteriorate further over the next two days and may touch ‘severe’ by Saturday morning, government agencies have forecast. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin, the AQI was 382, higher than 341 on Thursday. It was 373 on Wednesday. Most of the monitoring stations that are in ‘severe’ category include hot spots such as Anand Vihar, ITO, Vivek Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela and Mundka, among others.On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301-400 is considered ‘very poor’ while 401-500 is ‘severe’. According to weather scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with stubble burning incidents being negligible at present, local pollutants that have accumulated in the atmosphere have not been able to disperse because of unfavourable weather conditions.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed was just around 6-7 kmph during the day, which is not favourable for dispersal. “Besides, the wind direction changed to easterly from northwesterly. Whenever there is a change in wind direction, it impacts the air quality as winds turn calm for a while and do not allow dispersion. The night temperature is also below normal, which again is not favourable for dispersion. There was increased moisture because of easterly winds, which traps pollutants close to the ground, resulting in deterioration in air quality,” Srivastava said.He said the air quality may turn ‘severe’ over the weekend and any improvement is likely only after December 7 when northwesterly winds are likely to return. “From December 7-9, there may be an improvement in air quality as winds speed is expected to remain on the higher side,” he said.The Safdarjung Observatory, the official marker for the city’s weather, recorded a minimum temperature of 8 degrees C, a notch below normal. The maximum settled at 28.8 degrees C, four notches above normal.The System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, said the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM 2.5 level was just 1%. “The air quality is likely to deteriorate further over the next couple of days because of reduced ventilation and increase in moisture. However, it is likely to recover around December 6-7 with the return of good wind speed,” the SAFAR bulletin stated.According to experts, every year after peak pollution in November, which is mostly attributed to contribution from stubble burning, bad air episodes are seen towards December-end and early January. This is mainly because as compared to November, meteorological conditions are even more unfavourable during this time while the baseline pollution (local emission from Delhi and neighbouring regions) stays the same. This includes local waste burning, industrial fumes, vehicular emissions and dust suspension, among others.The CPCB on Friday wrote to the Delhi government, asking various civic agencies to act immediately on emission from open burning of waste; improper handling of construction waste; industrial emissions; dust from unpaved roads and open spaces, which have been reported by citizens on the Centre’s Sameer app.The letter said while stubble burning is almost over, the major sources of pollution are open dumping and burning of garbage, construction/demolition activity, unpaved roads and pits and re-suspension of road dust. “The areas of concern are hot spots, namely Narela, Anand Vihar, Mundka, Dwarka and Punjabi Bagh in Delhi and Faridabad, Jhajjar, Noida and Bhiwadi in NCR,” the letter said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said an aggressive strategy is required to curb local sources of pollution to prevent these peak pollution episodes. “We have been raising it time and again that surveillance on the ground and effective monitoring are required across Delhi-NCR to reduce local emissions. The agencies across NCR have to have a combined strategy and effort to bring any real change in minimising local emissions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-aqi-settles-at-far-end-of-very-poor-due-to-change-in-wind-pattern-may-turn-severe-by-saturday/story-jN3uIIL93OkQFSaABjl4ZN.html
04-12-2020||City||Woman murdered, dumped in a sack at a construction site in Delhi||New Delhi: Delhi police on Friday arrested a 27-year-old man for allegedly bludgeoning and strangulating a woman to death and then throwing her body at a construction site in Wazirabad in a sack late on Thursday night. The man was arrested minutes before he was preparing to flee Delhi.Police have identified the arrested man as Ashish Jha, 27, who is married and has a daughter. Jha works at a private parking and has rented out a portion of his house in Wazirabad. The woman who died was identified as a 20-year-old resident of Burari who was known to Jha and was unmarried, police said.Jha’s had taken the woman to his house on Thursday night when his wife was in her parent’s place. A senior police officer said Jha and the woman consumed alcohol but late in the night, an argument started between them. “As both were inebriated, the argument turned violent and Jha smashed the woman’s head on a wall multiple times. As she fell unconscious, he strangulated her to ensure she’s dead. The man waited for more than an hour, planning to dispose of the body. He stuffed her body in a sack and dumped it at the adjoining plot where construction is going on,” the officer said.On Friday morning, police got a call after locals and construction workers spotted the body.

04-12-2020||Delhi||Govt intensifies awareness drive on hepatitis||With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic affecting over 586,000 persons and killing almost 9,500 people, the Delhi government in association with the autonomous Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) conducted a campaign on Friday to make people aware of blood-borne hepatitis on the 23rd Hepatitis Day. Hepatitis is an inflammatory condition of the liver, which if not treated can lead to cirrhosis or scarring, thereby reducing liver function. “We also need to ensure serious efforts are being taken to deal with hepatitis-like diseases. Hence, it would be useful to include it in the school curriculum to create health awareness from childhood, and pay special attention to our body and mind along with physical and economic matters,” said deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia, who was present at an event to mark the day at the Delhi secretariat. The event, held virtually, was attended by 700 students from 31 schools. The minister extended his compliments to ILBS director Dr Shiv Kumar Sarin and his team for their untiring efforts towards prevention, cure and creating mass awareness on viral hepatitis. “The health department and the team of ILBS have fought vigorously against hepatitis for 23 years. Phase-1 of HEPiSCHOOL programme in cooperation with the education department was launched last year to further spread awareness in schools, through various health talks. Due to this, many lives have been saved,” said Sisodia. At the event, Phase -2 of the HEPiSCHOOL programme was launched to further intensify awareness in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-intensifies-awareness-drive-on-hepatitis/story-twS67uLnDXhhamU9Jf4YcM.html
04-12-2020||City||Farmers protest: Traffic jams on Delhi’s border points during rush hour||New Delhi: With main Delhi-Haryana and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh borders remaining fully or partially closed, traffic movement remained affected in the city, mainly in eastern and outer districts. Vehicles moving towards Delhi from Haryana and UP were diverted to alternative routes, causing jams on the border points and on the nearby roads. However, the situation was relatively better on Friday as the motorists were aware about the closure of the borders and diversions.Like the last three days, when at least two more borders connecting Delhi to Noida and Ghaziabad, were partially closed, no new road was blocked on Friday. Gagan Chawla, 41, an IT professional who was travelled from Noida to Delhi and back, said due to closure of Chila border the available alternate routes witnessed heavy traffic. “I heard it was even worse on Thursday. However, while returning to Noida there isn’t much chaos,” he said.Vipul Garg, who was travelling from Ghaziabad to Delhi, said traffic on Friday was relatively better than Thursday. “Yesterday, I had to take alternative routes to reach Delhi via Apsara border but today, since I was aware I could easily avoid traffic jam,” said Garg, a businessman. While the commuters continued to face problems due to the traffic jam, the protesting farmers who had blocked the expressway carriageway in Ghazipur on Thursday morning said they have left space for ambulances and other emergency vehicles to pass. The closure of the border routes also slowed down the movement of the vehicles on Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road and other routes through which the motorists were entering Delhi from Ghaziabad.The Chilla border (Delhi-Noida Link Road), which was closed completely for at least 22 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday, was partially opened on Thursday. Even on Friday, one carriageway connecting Noida from Delhi remained open while the opposite carriageway going towards Delhi from Noida was completely closed as the protesting farmers remained on that road along with their tractors and other vehicles. The police diverted the traffic on other routes such as DND, Kalindi Kunj, Dallupura, Khoda, New Ashok Nagar, and Kondli border borders. Although heavy traffic was witnessed in the morning and evening hours of Friday on those routes as well, the situation was slightly better than what it was on Thursday.The other border points closed by the police are mostly located around Singhu and Tikri borders. Many of these routes were used by farmers in the last three days to enter Delhi despite strong barricades at the two main borders.The border points fully closed since Wednesday were the Jharoda, Lampur, Auchandi, Safiabad, Piao Maniyari, and Saboli. Badusarai border remained open only for light motor vehicles such as cars and two wheelers, while Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheeler traffic.Delhi police also issued traffic advisory in advance and even took to social media to continously update commuters about live traffic situations. Anil Mittal, additional spokesperson, Delhi police, said in an advisory, the Chilla border on Noida Link Road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. “People are advised to avoid Noida link road for coming to Delhi and use DND, Mittal said.He added, due to the on going farmers’ protest, Ghazipur Border on NH 24 and NH 9 are also closed for traffic from UP to Delhi. “People are advised to avoid NH 24 and use Apsara/Bhopura/DND flyover to enter Delhi,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-traffic-jams-on-delhi-s-border-points-during-rush-hour/story-nZGRvcR0yR6BV6GqiqPCSM.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Beyond their call of duty: Doctors who are tending to protesting farmers||A group of four doctors — all private practitioners — have set up a medical camp at the Singhu Border, where thousands of farmers have gathered since Friday to protest against the new farm laws passed by the Central government. The group said at least 1,000 farmers visit them daily, majority of them with complaints of hypertension or asthma due to continuous sloganeering and active participation in the protest. While cough and cold, diarrhoea or digestive issues have been the most reported ailments, at least two farmers have had to be referred to Civil Hospital in Sonepat with more serious complications — one of them having suffered a mild cardiac arrest.The medical camp is self-funded by a group of doctors from Delhi and Haryana, all of them MBBS, including one surgeon. Sukhwinder Singh, an MBBS from a government medical college in Rajasthan, who is one of the medical practitioners at the camp, said they at present have four doctors, who are running the camp with the help of around six paramedical staff, who have chipped in since Sunday — two days after the farmers started camping at Singhu border. “I belong to Sirsa in Haryana. My grandfather is also a farmer and he inspired me to pitch in and we together formed a group and came to Singhu border with whatever basic equipment and medicines we could gather. We are all private practitioners and have no affiliation with any hospital or organisation,” Singh said.He added that in the past three days (since Sunday) they’ve attended to at least 1,000 farmers daily — most of who suffered from complaints of high blood pressure, irregular breathing, hypertension, digestive problems or basic cough and cold. “The number of patients is high because we advertised about our camp in the area by distributing pamphlets and posters. So even local residents are visiting us for medical advice, the doctor said.“At least 30% of all our cases were those of hypertension and irregular blood pressure. This was mainly because the majority of participants are elderly farmers and continuous sloganeering leaves them exhausted. The first day, we also had patients who suffered lacerations due to clashes that broke out here. We advised them medication and asked them to come for follow ups,” he said.Other doctors who are running the medical camp are Ramanjeet Singh, CS Warring (a surgeon) and Parmeshwar Siddhu.Sixty-two-year-old Kulwant Singh, from Moga in Punjab, who saw a doctor at the camp on Tuesday, said since Friday, after the police fired tear gas shells, he is having irritation in his eyes and problems in breathing. “They checked my oxygen levels and blood pressure. They’ve advised me medication and have asked me to come back. It’s a free of cost service and very helpful for elderly farmers like us,” Singh said.Another farmer, Parmjeet Singh, 55, from Amritsar, said many of them have forgotten their medicines back home before joining the protests. “Many suffer from diabetes or other ailments for which they need regular medication. The camp has provided us with our routine medical care free of charge, “ he said.The doctors said keeping in mind the high number of patients approaching them, they are now planning to expand the camp and call on more doctors to pitch in.COVID CONCERNThe doctors running the camp said that they are also mindful of Covid-19 patients as the protesters were not adhering completely to social distancing norms. One advice that they have been doling out to their patients is always wearing a face mask. “We also check them for Covid-19 symptoms. We are in touch with hospitals and if required any patient who show symptoms of Covid will be sent there,” the doctors said.Teams from Red Cross Society and National Health Mission are also present at Singhu border. An emergency medical technician, from the national health mission, Sonepat, that falls under the Union ministry of health, said they have made arrangements of ambulances at the spot. “On Friday, we had to rush a 47-year-old to Sonepat Civil Hospital. It was a case of a mild heart attack. He is okay now. Most of the passengers I have ferried had complained of vomiting, fever, cold or breathlessness. Teams from Red Cross Society are also keeping an eye on the crowds here,” the technician said, wishing not to be named. Harjit Singh Bhatti, former president of AIIMS residents doctor association, said a team of five has also set up a medical camp at the Tikri border protest site, with the help of doctors from AIIMS, Safdarjung, and Hindu Rao hospital. He also has set up a camp at Singhu border.“Many protesters ask for painkillers. Since a large number of protesters are elderly, there is a chance that they are diabetic or have hypertension, which can lead to cardiac events due to severe fluctuation of their blood pressure. Due to stress and other factors, they can’t take medicines on time which can become a cause of worry. Most of these farmers sleep in the open at night leading to high-grade fever as well,” he said.With pressing cold wave conditions setting in on the national capital, the farmers, on their part, have also taken several measures to protect themselves against the harsh winter.Hundreds of tractor trollies and SUVs stationed on the Kundli highway are lined with multiple tarpaulin sheets to fend off the chilly winds. The insides of these vehicles are lined with hay and blankets to keep the protesters warm during cold Delhi nights. The minimum temperature on Tuesday stood at 8.1 degree Celsius -- two notches below normal.While a section of elderly protesters sleep inside these vehicles, they are not enough to accommodate all protesters leaving many with no option but to camp out on the roads in the open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/beyond-their-call-of-duty-doctors-who-are-tending-to-protesting-farmers/story-Rd9o9B26KiMmwyHKKQCUUI.html

Now traditional traders have teamed up to developed their own e-commerce local application and reach out to consumers.Sachin Nivangune, president, Pune district retail traders’ association, said, “We are developing e-commerce websites as well as applications to reach out to consumers and deliver products at their doorsteps, besides providing attractive discounts. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) is helping us to develop an application.”Devendra Sarda, chief executive officer of online supermarket store Picodel said, “We cater to a wide range of products, including grocery, fruits, vegetables, sweets, chicken, cosmetics and medicines and deliver to customers’ doorsteps through 200 shops. At present, we are starting our service at Kharadi and Magarpatta areas on an experimental basis. Our order delivery time is within one and a half hours. We have decided to compete them major e-commerce firms by going online.” Vijay Narela, trader and managing director of Bhartiya-Dukan (B-Dukan) application developed to bring traders under one roof, said, “E-commerce companies have badly affected our business. We are developing an app that will provide customers cash back, discounts and other offers like other e-commerce companies.” Consumer database CAIT, a leading advocate for small traders and business in country, has appealed to traders and their organisations to collect information from their respective areas, create database and connect to promote their businesses. The database should also cover various organisations, social, cultural and religious bodies, clubs, schools, colleges, hospitals, hotels, temples and nursing homes. The information will help traders reach out to their neighbourhood as per their needs and demands.Seminar on e-commerceRajendra Batiya, executive chairman, Maharashtra wing of CAIT said, “We are collecting information on different types of organisations so that we can connect with them. In the coming days, we will provide training to traders on how to run e-commerce business. We will also organise a statewide seminar on e-commerce challenge and solutions.”“Connecting traders with consumers in a cohesive manner and giving the latter a right to choose a product coupled with reasonable price and efficient delivery system will benefit the stakeholders,” said Batiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/local-traders-unite-to-have-their-bite-of-e-commerce-biz/story-z2Riw9PnfMEpTHX8CFMSmK.html
04-12-2020||Pune||Multi-layered plastics form 44% of total plastic waste in city: Swach audit||City-based Swach, an organisation involved in waste management, participated in a global audit of plastic waste. As per the brand audit conducted this year in October, multi-layered plastics used in food packaging was the most common type of plastic forming 44 per cent of the total plastic waste in the city.The audit was a part of a global initiative by Break Free From Plastic to identify producers of plastic waste and the report was released in an online webinar on Thursday. Von Hernandez, global coordinator, Break Free From Plastic movement, said that big brands are major producers of plastic waste and they should be held responsible.“Big brands which contribute to plastic waste should be held responsible from extraction to disposal of this waste. We, through brand audits, take into account the actual waste which is generated. Since 2018, the waste generation has only increased and this trend is worrying,” said Hernandez.Echoing similar views, Emma Priestland, global corporate campaigns, Break Free from Plastic movement, said that unlike the bid companies, the small start-ups and businesses in various countries have shown a positive side to plastic generation and disposal. “Though plastic waste is on the rise, many small businesses and start-ups have come up with innovative ways to run an eco-friendly and sustainable business which does not harm the environment,” said Priestland.She further added that waste pickers play a very crucial role in brand audits to understand the waste generated.Lubna Anantakrishnan, project manager, Swach, said that they studied waste across 1,000 households in Aundh. “We sorted through the waste on the first day. We observed a mixture of dry and wet waste. Secondly, the milk packets that were thrown away were not cleaned and dried before disposing off. This causes problems in recycling the waste. In multi-layered packaging there was food contamination. We also could not brand audit sanitary waste and diapers as their brand names were not visible,” said Anantakrishnan.Speaking during the webinar, Lakshmi Narayanan, founder member of Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat, Pune’s trade union of waste pickers, said that waste pickers already fulfil the producer’s responsibilities under Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) . “We urge brands not to divert highly recyclable materials like PET away from waste pickers, but instead to design inclusive EPR initiatives which compensate waste pickers and scrap traders for their contribution to effective recycling,” said Narayanan.Kedar Sohoni, founder-director at Green Communities, said, “The key responsibilities lie with the producers to check plastic waste. All the laws related to extended products responsibility is about this. If the brands were doing a good job in disposing the waste, there would be no such audit required. The brands use 30 to 35 per cent of the MRP (Maximum retail price) for just logistics whereas they simply shrug off their responsibility to dispose off the plastic which is causing pollution.”Waste generated in Pune*Dry waste: 25% of total waste*Plastic waste: 25% of dry waste or 6% of total waste*Non-recyclable plastic waste: 39% of plastic waste*Recyclable plastic waste: 61% of plastic wastePune’s brand audit data revealed*At least 44% plastic waste comprises multi-layered plastics which is used in food packaging*27% of the plastic waste was low-density polyethylene (LDPE)*76% of all plastic waste was food packaging*Plastic type==Total count==Percentage of total waste*PET==495=14%*HDPE==109==3%*LDPE==927==27%*PP==335==10%*PS==40==1%*O==1,523==44%*Total==3,429==100%Source: Pune’s plastic brand audit, SwachCaption: Swach workers sort plastic waste as a part of the brand audit conducted in October this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/multi-layered-plastics-form-44-of-total-plastic-waste-in-city-swach-audit/story-NfJ9p2YxNhIno50Ckleu2O.html

04-12-2020||Pune||Former MLA’s initiative, citizen participation protects 85-acre urban reserve forest land in Pune||The conservation of an 85-acre urban reserve forest land in Tilekarnagar, survey number 47 in Kondhwa budruk is a result of citizen participation led by former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Yogesh Tilekar. The transformation of one of the largest forest strips has been named after Dr Shree Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari and serves as home to several rare species of birds, flora, fauna and a large number of peacocks. Currently, Tilekar has converted a five-acre area into a Smruti Van (memory garden) in the names of the deceased persons whose family members visit the spot and plant trees in the memory of their near and dear ones. The Smruti Van has been named after Pundalik Dada Tilekar where more than 1,000 trees have been planted. Also, gym equipment and animal mannequins have been placed to attract children and forest lovers to the area. A sum of Rs 7 crore has been spent for preservation and development of the urban forest. At his instructions, the entire 85 acres of forest land has been fenced by utilising the MLA development fund. Yogesh Tilekar said, “The idea came to my mind when I got to know that such a large portion of forest land was lying desolate with nobody paying attention towards its upkeep. I decided to take it up as a national cause and through citizens participation prepared a detailed report for phase-wise development for the garden. We have spent around Rs 7 crore during the first phase and require another Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore for the development of the entire forest garden.” The funds were made available by the then forest minister Sudheer Mungantiwar and the project was inaugurated by home minister Ranjeet Deshmukh. Tilekar has big plans for the conversion of major garden space into Ayurveda forest and starting tourist-centric projects like ropeways and rock-climbing which would add to revenue generation for further protection of the reserve forest. Regarding security and further upkeep of the forest, Tilekar said, “The forest department must deploy guards and take an active interest in the protection of the national heritage. Also, citizens must be alert and ensure that vandalism and anti-forest activities must be reported to the authorities. Our aim is to make it a national success on lines with the Taljai forest garden project.” Sanmeet Patil, a resident said “We thank the former MLA for taking an active interest in developing the forest. The current elected representatives are not paying any attention to the garden. We need more security, CCTV surveillance and strong security at the exit and entry gates and continuous patrolling in the forest area as it is surrounded by concrete jungle from all the sides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/former-mla-s-initiative-citizen-participation-protects-85-acre-urban-reserve-forest-land-in-pune/story-haMBURxDdywaWvveslXTrK.html

04-12-2020||Pune||Extended rainfall, lockdown affect strawberry production in Mahabaleshwar||Strawberry production in Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in Maharashtra, which accounts for almost 80 per cent of the total strawberry produced in India, has been affected due to extended rainfall and lockdown restrictions.The extended monsoon which led to heavy rainfall during September and early October has adversely affected the fruit quality as well as output, said producers from Mahabaleshwar. As a result, the prices have gone up by almost 100 per cent as compared to the same duration last year.This year, the selling price is Rs 300 per kilogram in Pune and Mumbai, while the normal rates during this season are between Rs 150 to Rs 200 per kg based on the quality of the fruit.Balasaheb Bhilare, head, Strawberry Growers Association of Maharashtra, said, “Due to lockdown induced restrictions, strawberries were cultivated late this year as plant exports from foreign countries such as Spain, Italy and America were delayed. Farmers usually plant the crop in September. However, plants came late and were sowed in October. After that, a retreating monsoon affected the plants as a result of which the overall cycle changed and fruit came in December in the market. Therefore, the prices are high.”At least 80 per cent of strawberry produced in India comes from the Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra) while rest comes from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan.According to Bhilare, farmers this year cultivated only 60 per cent of strawberries. “Out of total 4,000 acre of farming land, due to the uncertainty of the market, bad weather and fear of losses, farmers cultivated strawberries on 2,500 acre of land. Therefore, production is also less,” he said.In Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani and Wai belt of Satara district, around 4,000 farmers produce strawberries.Arvind More, retailers and wholesaler of fruits, Market Yard, said, “The rate is higher as compared to last year. Normally, fruits come in the Diwali season. The strawberries came late in the market and are limited in quantity. Due to which, the rate is high. Despite that, people are buying it.”Prakash Dhamdhere, fruit retailer, Lake Town city, Bibvewadi, said, “The rate of one kilogram of strawberry is Rs 200 to 250 of second-grade quality whereas good quality strawberry is Rs 350 to Rs 400 per kg.”Ramchandra Sable, former head of department of agriculture meteorology of MPKV Rahuri and associate dean and principal Agriculture College Pune, said, “The sort of untimely rains, higher humidity, temperature and cloudy weather have affected the plants and damaged the crop. Such weather affects the quality of high-value crops such as tomatoes, grapes, strawberries.”Uncertainty over strawberry festivalThere is uncertainty over the strawberry festival which is usually held during the Easter weekend (March-April) due to the pandemic. “Due to the possibility of the second wave of Covid-19, there is uncertainty about the festival, ‘’said Balasaheb Bhilare, head, Strawberry Growers Association of Maharashtra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/extended-rainfall-lockdown-affect-strawberry-production-in-mahabaleshwar/story-PN00VGk1p5Dn0wdV9y6boL.html

This means the picture in the state is changing. This is reflected in today’s results (loosely translated from Marathi).”Pawar’s comments came after MVA candidates Arun Lad and Abhishek Wanjari’s wins in Nagpur and Pune division’s graduate constituency seats.The MVA is on its way to winning four out of six legislative council seats. The MVA has won Aurangabad, Nagpur and two seats from Pune. BJP has only won one seat in Dhule-Nandurbar and in Amravati independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik is expected to support the ruling MVA.NCP’s Arun Lad’s win in Nagpur came as a surprise for the MVA as it was a BJP stronghold since the party’s inception. Union minister Nitin Gadkari and former CM Devendra Fadnavis’ father late Gangadharrao Fadnavis have contested and won from this seat previously.Pawar praising the alliance-performance in Nagpur division said, “We have not had much success in the last several decades, mainly in the Nagpur division.

On the contrary, they complained, this plan would increase bottlenecks and traffic in the area, and also expressed apprehension that the proposed constructions would increase the difficulties for the local population because the construction is sought to be done in a totally unplanned manner.Acting on the PIL, on April 25, 2019, another bench of HC had restrained MMRDA from cutting mangroves for the construction of the link roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-pil-opposing-versova-lokhandwala-link-roads/story-hknIyna96tSKV1BylpUeuL.html

It said though there is negligence, it cannot be termed as “wilful breach or wilful disobedience” to proceed against the magistrate for contempt.A division bench of justices SS Shinde and VG Bisht disposed of the contempt petition filed by Yogesh Athavale, an advocate from Ratnagiri district, hoping magistrate Vikram Jadhav will deal with judicial work before him with greater care, caution, and circumspection.Athawale had moved the high court for initiating action for contempt of court against Jadhav alleging the magistrate was wilfully disregarding binding precedents of superior courts. Athawale cited four specific instances. His counsel, Murlidhar Patil, submitted that the instances pointed to that the magistrate’s habit of overlooking and disregarding binding precedents on flimsy grounds without properly going through the text of those binding precedents. He said it not only amounted to misconduct in the discharge of duties but was also contemptuous.Advocate SR Nargolkar, who represented the high court administration, submitted the magistrate was summoned by the guardian judge of the district for counselling and he has been suitably counselled. In such circumstances, Nargolkar said the contempt petition was liable to be disposed of, as nothing remained in the proceeding to be done further.The high court accepted that in at least two of the four orders passed by the magistrate, the precedents were not even mentioned. In the third, the magistrate merely mentioned the superior court judgments cited by Athawale but did not deal with it whereas, in the fourth, he erred on the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/disregarding-binding-precedents-no-contempt-says-bombay-hc-exonerates-magistrate/story-JINpN6oaZHpiRBG3rTGW1H.html

Thursday’s meeting at Vigyan Bhawan between the Union ministers and the representative of farmers’ groups which went on for over seven hours seemed to move a little ahead. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had the government has no ego and it was discussing the issues raised by farmers with an open mind. Another round of talks will be held on Saturday. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 were introduced by Parliament in September.While the Centre continues to maintain that these laws would eliminate middlemen and enable farmers to sell their produce in commercial markets, farmers fear they would be denied the right to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce and big corporations would exercise control over them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-snarls-continue-on-delhi-borders-as-farmers-protests-enter-day-8/story-9TFyixFvySbtW34JF6iTLO.html

04-12-2020||Lucknow||Shivpal Yadav calls Akhilesh’s 1 seat offer a joke, seeks socialist front against BJP||Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) chief Shivpal Yadav has called the Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav’s offer of leaving ‘one seat’ for his uncle’s party in 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, ‘a joke’.He said his party was looking for a handful of winnable seats for the PSP-L to enter into any prospective alliance with SP.Shivpal said he would launch his party’s poll campaign with a rally in Meerut on December 21 and from December 24 onwards the party would launch a state-wide village-level contact programme over farmers’ issues.The day before Diwali, Akhilesh Yadav had said at a press conference in Saifai, Etawah that his party would make an ‘adjustment’ and leave Shivpal’s Jaswant Nagar seat. He said he would also make Shivpal Yadav a cabinet minister when the SP returned to power in the state. Shivpal is the sitting Jaswant Nagar MLA.In response, Shivpal dismissed the offer.“The one-seat offer is a joke. So far as the idea of being (made) a cabinet minister (is concerned), I have been a cabinet minister several times. So, it’s not a big deal. What we are looking for is a handful of winnable seats.”He reiterated that all socialist parties must come on a single platform if they wished to defeat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Through various ways and over a hundred times, I have said that various socialist forces must unite, giving respectable place to each one of them. So far, as the Samajwadi Party (SP) is concerned, it has not given any positive indications to the overtures and I could not have any dialogue with the SP leadership.

04-12-2020||Lucknow||UP sees marginal rise in revenue collections in November, misses target||The Uttar Pradesh government may have hit a speed-breaker on the road to economic recovery with its total revenue collection going up by only Rs 345.97 crore in November 2020-2021 vis-à-vis the collections in the same month in 2019-2020. Although, the increase in revenue collections continued for the fifth consecutive month in the state, the comparatively lower increase in collections during the festival season have raised some questions. “Uttar Pradesh collected total revenue of Rs 10,903.87 crore in November 2020-2021 against Rs 10,557 crore collected in the same month in 2019-2020. This indicates an increase of Rs 345.97 crore in November 2020,” said minister for revenue Suresh Khanna while speaking to media persons here. The revenue collection is far below the target of Rs 13,825.24 crore.Uttar Pradesh’s total revenue collection had gone up by Rs 1,828.44 crore in October 2020 vis-à-vis total collections made in the same month in 2019. The excise department witnessed an increase of Rs 190.93 crore with its collections going up from Rs 2,273.85 crore in November 2019 to Rs 2,464.78 crore in November 2020, meeting 83% of its target. The stamps and registration department exceeded its target, collecting Rs 1,628 crore in November 2020 (103.8% of the target) against Rs 1,421.37 crore in the same month last year.“An increase in collections by the stamps and registration department indicates that people have sufficient funds to invest in property,” said Khanna.A close scrutiny of revenue recovery in November 2020, however, indicates that low increase in revenue collections was apparently because of lesser GST collections during the festival season. “The GST collections remained about Rs 3,712.69 crore in November 2020 against Rs 4,170.71 crore in the same month in 2019. The VAT collections, however, went up by about Rs 381.59 crore,” he said. Additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal attributed the low GST collections to late filing. Diwali was celebrated in October in 2019 and so the same was reflected in November 2019. Diwali has been celebrated in November in 2020 and so the GST collections made during the festival will be reflected next month,” said Mittal. “It’s good that the state government’s total revenue collections have increased. There are, however, certain issues like the dip in GST in November 2020, which is surprising. Low GST collections in November either indicate lesser spending on Diwali or late filing of GST returns by traders. Hopefully, this will be made up in the subsequent months,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, department of economics, Lucknow University.Also Read: FIR against 14 under new law on conversionOther heads witnessing low revenue collections include transport department --Rs 697.71 crore against Rs 735.83 crore in 2019-2020. The state’s non-tax revenue that also comes from mining of minor minerals has, however, gone up from Rs 190.19 crore in November 2019 to Rs 253.15 crore in the same month this year. The government spends a sum of Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore every month to pay salaries and pension to its employees. It will have to borrow funds to allocate money for development works and meet its committed expenditure if the total revenue collections continue to remain low in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-sees-marginal-rise-in-revenue-collections-in-november-misses-target/story-9gEPukMjY05oC4gEeDszcJ.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI continues to stay in very poor category||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the very poor category on Friday morning. At 7am, the air quality index (AQI) was 335, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The average AQI on Thursday was 341. However, government agencies have forecast a deterioration in air quality from December 4 onwards, as wind speed is going to reduce and turn calm around December 6-7, and may plunge further. At the same time, a change is likely in wind pattern from north-westerly to easterly, which may bring moisture allowing accumulation of pollutants close to the ground. Also, shallow fog in the morning is expected on December 4-5. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and that above 400 is considered severe. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the air is likely to remain in the very poor zone on Friday, but from Saturday, wind speed will slow down and there will be further deterioration of air quality. IMD scientists warned that on December 6 and December 7, the AQI might even slip to the severe zone. “Our forecast says that on December 6 and December 7, the air quality will be at its worst and is even likely to slip into the latter end of very poor or severe,” a senior IMD scientist said. He added that the change in wind direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. “Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants close to the ground,” he said. On Thursday, the minimum temperature settled at 8.2 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The maximum was 27.2, two notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-continues-to-stay-in-very-poor-category/story-xuUQpaupPsgw4eLBJGGlQM.html

Ever since the central government has taken the charge, they have added to the problems in this country. Be it farmers’ issue or managing the Covid-19 crisis, this government has failed in many aspects.”On the first anniversary of MVA, he said, “MVA has performed well despite facing so many natural calamities.”Talking about his government in the state, he said, “In our state government, everyone has worked hard towards the betterment of the state.”The MVA government of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Congress in Maharashtra, completed one year on November 28. It came to power after all of an 80-hour government of the BJP after the 2019 polls.

Meet Mann, who heads the group, said they have joined the farmers’ agitation as they “felt the pain of the crop grower”. “We have arranged everything for farmers. In the daytime, we provide them langar, milk, tea, kheer and other eatables. Our volunteers have been bringing dairy products and vegetables from nearby villages,” he added.Raju Mann, a farm leader, said the khaps and students have lent their support to the farmers and they are turning up in large numbers.Two brothers, Sukhvinder Singh, a student of Class 8, and Kirpal Singh, a student of Class 10, who had shifted to Bahadurgarh from Amritsar 10 years ago, have been taking part in the protest. “Every morning, my father drops us at the dharna site before going to his tailor shop.

04-12-2020||Mumbai||BMC aims to vaccinate 1 crore Mumbaiites within a month||Expecting a rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine early next year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in its blueprint of immunisation process aims to vaccinate around 1 crore Mumbaiites within a month in the first phase. The civic body estimates that Mumbai is home to 2 crore people in 2020. “So far, the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given the nod to vaccinate around 1.25 lakh health workers from public and private sectors. Along with this, with the approval of ICMR, we may include police, employees of solid waste management and citizens above 50 years in the first phase. But we are yet to get an official approval from ICMR,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. The Union health ministry has instructed all states to keep a blueprint of their first vaccination process ready. The civic body has been holding regular meetings with senior health officers, including deans of medical colleges. As per the initial planning of the blueprint, other than medical colleges, the civic body will start vaccination points at peripheral hospitals (except maternity hospitals). Also, two vaccination centres will be located in every civic ward. “We are trying to create as many vaccination centres as possible to fasten the process. We have also created a blueprint on the training process of the vaccine providers. We also have to procure cold chain boxes (vaccine carriers that help maintain the temperature, until it is delivered to the centre) from the government for transportation of vaccines,” he said. The King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital in Parel and BYL Nair hospital in Mumbai Central are conducting second and third phase of clinical trials of Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine. While Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, known as Sion Hospital, and the government-run JJ hospital will soon commence clinical trials of the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine – Covaxin. Currently, BMC has identified a 5,000-sqft floor space in a five-storey civic body building in Kanjurmarg for a cold storage facility. The temperature of the cold storage facility will be structured based on the vaccine type. “Two vaccines are undergoing clinical trials in the city. One needs a cooling temperature between -2 and - 8 degrees. So, the first three-storey will be designed specifically for the vaccine. While the second vaccine needs another set of temperatures. Once the second vaccine gets approval, we will customise the other two floors as per its required temperature,” said a health officer from BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-aims-to-vaccinate-1-crore-mumbaiites-within-a-month/story-pBRqMy3lwZMxm32ARgoqIP.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Trade and labour groups join farmers’ stir in Maharashtra||eeshanpriya@htlive.comFarmers in Maharashtra, under the umbrella of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), marched to the tehsildar and collectors’ offices on Thursday and submitted petitions in support of the farmers protesting in Delhi against the Centre’s new farm laws. The protests were carried out across 400 tehsils and 36 districts in the state. Ajit Navale, Maharashtra general secretary of AIKS said, “Protests at every tehsil and district collectors’ offices across Maharashtra started on Thursday morning.” Forty-eight more groups, comprising labourers, tribals, bank employees and social organisations under the banner of Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti, joined the farmers on Thursday’s protest. Vishwas Utagi, convener of Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti, said, “The peaceful protests were carried out successfully across the state. We will also meet senior Congress leaders within the next few days, demanding that the Maharashtra government strengthen labour laws in the state, and enact a legislation in the upcoming Assembly session of December to protect the interests of farmers. Agriculture is a state subject and the central government is trying to encroach upon it. We want to create a strong lobby by joining hands with political parties to protect the rights of our state.” The Congress party also carried out protests throughout the state in solidarity with the farmers protesting in the national capital. Local leaders from each district handed over memorandums to the officials from the collectors and tehsildars’ offices. The party has been calling for the abolition of the farm laws, which were passed in the Parliament in September. In Mumbai, a protest was held at Bharatmata Cinema in Parel by the Trade Unions’ Joint Action Committee which consisted of the state units of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC ), Bharatiya Kamgar Sena Mahasangh, New Trade Union Initiative (NTUI), Trade Union Centre of India (TUCI), state government employees and also the Shramik Ekta Mahasangh (Pune) which has been operating throughout Maharashtra for over 30 years. Meanwhile, the state unit of Congress during a meeting passed a resolution at Vidhan Bhavan to support the farmers protesting in Delhi for more than a week. The meeting was attended by party legislators, senior leaders from the state and officer-bearers from the All-India Congress Committee. “The Modi government has passed three laws using its thumping majority in the Parliament. We will stand firm behind the farmers during their protest on the borders of the Delhi,” the resolution stated. “The central government should make changes to the laws to weed out the doubts in the minds of the farmers. If the Modi government is terming the laws to be in the interest of farmers, why is it not being amended as demanded by the farmers,” said Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trade-and-labour-groups-join-farmers-stir-in-maharashtra/story-77UyPIVokA49jdFbCLSGuM.html
04-12-2020||City||Maharashtra was never afraid and never will be, says CM Thackeray; attacks Centre during govt’s first anniversary event||At an event organised to celebrate the first anniversary of his government, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said that Maharashtra has “never been afraid and it never will be”. The statement came at a time when a central investigating agency is probing a ruling-party legislator. Thackeray added that the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is ready to “dismantle and defeat” political challenges in the future. Thackeray, along with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and state Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat unveiled ‘Unstoppable Maharashtra’, a booklet, partially coloured in saffron, which listed out the government’s decisions pertaining to agriculture, education, health, law and order, industries, environment, tourism, food and civil supplies in its first year in power. The leaders also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) indirectly in their respective addresses. The MVA government completed a year in power on November 28. Speaking at the event held at the Sahyadri state guest house in Malabar Hill on Thursday, Thackeray said, “The cover of the booklet says ‘Maharashtra has never stopped and never will be stopped’. Similarly, Maharashtra has never been afraid and never will be afraid. We will surely combat the natural calamities, but if somebody tries to draw a political crisis onto us, then Maharashtra will dismantle and defeat it… The government is on firm feet and it will take steps further to solve the issues of people.” Speaking at the event, Pawar said that the MVA government has taken decisions for the people and farmers, and thus it will have the support of the citizens and will continue to remain in power for years to come. “The farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting for the past eight to 10 days. It is because those who are in power do not understand the problems of the farmers. But the farmers in Maharashtra did not come on the streets in the past one year, and that is an achievement of this government,” Pawar said. Without naming the BJP, Thackeray’s deputy targeted the Opposition in the state and said that several attempts were made to topple the government, but they remained unsuccessful. He said that the state government has no threat till the three leaders – Sonia Gandhi, Pawar and Thackeray – continue on their resolve to run the MVA alliance. “The Opposition gave a lot of dates…. It said the government will collapse in two months, then in six months. Today, media persons asked me what is the future of this government. I told them, Sonia Gandhi, Pawar saheb and Uddhavji Thackeray have firmly decided to run the MVA…. [and] till [they are together] then there is no threat to the government,” said Ajit Pawar. He added that the government firmly stands by the Common Minimum Programme. In an apparent reply to his nephew, Sharad Pawar, who spoke after Ajit, said, “The people of the state do not forget the government that works for them. Though the CM speaks less, he is clever and has successfully run a three-party government. I am confident that this government will continue to work for the people for five years but we have to run the government for the next 25 years.” The CM too was confident that the people of the state back his government. He also slammed the Opposition for “practising politics” during a pandemic and calamities. “Natural calamities are not in our hands. But when politics is practised during natural calamities, it is quite anguishing… This government has not come together for politics. In the beginning, we were called a three-wheeler [auto rickshaw] government, but they never realised there is a fourth wheel, which is the people’s faith [in the government],” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-was-never-afraid-and-never-will-be-says-cm-thackeray-attacks-centre-during-govt-s-first-anniversary-event/story-rlhQvDreA5RVufxFwasqmL.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Advocate files petition seeking suspension of Kangana Ranaut’s Twitter account||An advocate has filed a petition in the Bombay high court (HC) against actor Kangana Ranaut and sought suspension of her Twitter account, like that of her sister Rangoli Chandel, on the grounds that Ranaut used the account to spread hatred and disharmony in the country through derogatory tweets. The petition has included Twitter Inc. as a party and sought directions to the social messaging service provider to suspend Ranaut’s account and implement its community guidelines diligently and bar people inciting hatred among masses. The petition filed by advocate Kashif Ali Khan Deshmukh, while referring to the malicious tweets by Chandel in April, stated that after the account was suspended, Ranaut came out in support of her sister through a video wherein she reiterated what Chandel had tweeted. Chandel had suggested genocide of persons belonging to a minority community through her tweet. The petition states that a complaint was lodged with Amboli police about the video, but no action was initiated against the actor. The petition further adds that in later months, the actor maligned public servants and also tried to disrupt the harmony between the Hindu and Muslim communities through controversial tweets pertaining to Bollywood. The petition also refers to a tweet wherein the actor maligned a lower court. Apart from approaching the police to lodge complaints against the animosity filled tweets, the petitioner stated that he wrote to the grievance officer of Twitter Inc. which has its office in Bandra-Kurla Complex to suspend the Twitter account. However, as no action was initiated, he approached the HC and make Twitter Inc. a party by invoking article 226 and section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. According to Deshmukh, the petition has prayed for suspension of Ranaut’s Twitter account and sought directions to Twitter to implement its community guidelines for users stringently. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/advocate-files-petition-seeking-suspension-of-kangana-ranaut-s-twitter-account/story-vRyoCI8zSyKsf2OIGbCkmJ.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra zilla parishad educator first in India to win $1-million teacher prize||It is a proud moment for the zilla parishad schools in Maharashtra, as one of their educators, 31-year-old Ranjitsinh Disale, has become the first teacher from India to win the prestigious $1-million Global Teacher Prize for innovation in teaching. The award is bestowed by London-based Varkey Foundation and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). The winners were announced by actor-writer Stephen Fry in an online ceremony from the Natural History Museum, London, on Thursday.Disale, a teacher at the zilla parishad school in Solapur’s Paritewadi, was among the 12,000 educators from 140 countries, who had been nominated for the prize. The prize was set up to recognise one exceptional teacher making an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in society. Disale will donate 50% of his prize money to the other finalists who were nominated for the award, so that children across the globe get quality education. “In his winning speech, Mr Disale made the extraordinary announcement that he will share half the prize money with his fellow Top 10 finalists, resulting in the other nine finalists receiving just over US $55,000 each. This is the first time in the Global Teacher Prize’s six-year history that the overall winner has shared the prize money with the other finalists,” stated the official release issued by Varkey Foundation on Thursday. The foundation, which has promoted the prize since 2014, said Disale has “transformed the life chances of girls” at the zilla parishad primary school. Disale’s journey of adopting technology in education started in 2009, when he entered the zilla parishad school which had very few students enrolled. Dropouts owing to child marriages, poor learning outcomes and child labour were common. However, he did not give up and decided to bring about a change. Gradually, he realised that students had to be brought to school by making learning more interesting and teaching beyond textbooks. He then decided to use technology to better the learning experience for his students, but the school only had one laptop. While trying to look for solutions online, he found a very easy option – (quick response) QR codes. In the years to come, he created QR codes and pasted them on the existing textbooks. These codes could be scanned with the help of mobile phones and additional resources on the topics would pop up. In 2015, the Maharashtra government had adopted Disale’s idea and made QR codes available in Balbharti textbooks. Subsequently in 2018, the then Union Human Resource Development minister Prakash Javadekar had announced that all National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks will have embedded QR codes. “I am happy that my work towards achieving bettering learning outcomes with the help of innovative methods such as QR codes in textbooks has been recognised by the stalwarts in education across the globe,” said an elated Disale. From 2017, Disale has been working on a unique project. With an intention of nurturing friendship between students in India and Pakistan, he has been conducting online video sessions with students from both countries. Disale also wants to ensure that each year, at least 5,000 students from the war-afflicted countries of the world are recruited into a ‘Peace Army’. “I would like to use the prize money for my project and to support innovation of teachers,” he said. Meanwhile, the award ceremony also included a special recognition for one teacher – a Covid hero – who has gone above and beyond to keep young people learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. The $ 45,000 Covid Hero Award, supported by CVC Capital Partners, was given to UK Maths teacher Jamie Frost, whose free DrFrostMaths became a lifeline for students shut out of classrooms all around the world. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the “creativity and ingenuity” of the winners and added: “Although I’m speaking to you in difficult and sometimes heart-breaking circumstances, it’s right that we take time to recognise the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the world’s teachers during this pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-zilla-parishad-educator-first-in-india-to-win-1-million-teacher-prize/story-X4tF9IzmEVNZFarOq9CW7I.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra proposes declaration of 11 conservation reserves to protect 1,076 sq km forest area||The Maharashtra forest department has proposed the declaration of 11 conservation reserves (CR) in western Maharashtra and Vidarbha. It has also requested allocation of Rs 20 crore annually for the conservation and management of CRs. The State Board of Wildlife (SWL), chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, will decide on these proposals n Friday. Among the 11 proposed CRs, eight are in western Maharashtra (five in Kolhapur, one in Sindhudurg and two at Satara) while two are in Nagpur and one is in Amravati. The total protected area is 1,076.19 sq. km, which is equivalent to 10 times the area of Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park (103 sq. km). Among new proposals, the department has proposed the Chandgad CR at Kolhapur across 225.24 sq.km with 23 villages connecting the Tillari CR with Bhimgad Sanctuary in Karnataka. At Sindhudurg, 56.92 sq.km with 13 villages has been proposed as the Dodamarg-Amboli CR, which connects Tillari with tiger breeding areas of Karnataka’s Bhimgad Sanctuary and Goa’s Mhadei Sanctuary. Another area in Kolhapur, where the iconic melanistic leopard was photographed, Ajra-Bhudargad has been proposed as a CR across 246.63 sq.km encompassing 37 villages. “The idea is to have forest connectivity along this Western Ghats landscape allowing tiger and other wildlife dispersal without the threat of development,” said Kakodkar. Other comparatively smaller CRs include Gaganbawda (105.48 sq. km), Panhalgad (72.9 sq. km), Vishalgad (92.24 sq. km), all at Kolhapur, Jor-Jambhali CR (65.11 sq. km) in Satara connecting with Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani areas, and the bird haven of Mayani CR (8.67 sq. km) at Satara.Three CRs in Vidarbha include Mogarkasa (37.7 sq. km) and Munia (97.37 sq. km) in Nagpur, and Mahendri (67.48 sq. km) in Amravati.“We are going one step further from them just having reserved forest status. The idea is to protect them under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, by declaring them as CRs. Any development projects proposed within these CRs will need clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 190, the SBWL and the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). To that extent, there will be control on developmental projects in these areas,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra.CRs are protected areas that act like buffer zones and migration corridors between national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserved and protected forests. Unlike sanctuaries and national parks, CRs don’t have their own buffer zones. Any developmental or agricultural activity within a CR must have the approval of state and Central wildlife boards.In addition to six national parks and 49 wildlife sanctuaries, Maharashtra has seven CRs. On June 23, the state had declared a 29.53 sq. km area as the Tillari CR, covering 10 villages in Sindhudurg district, making it the first in the Konkan belt. “The idea is to have forest connectivity along the Western Ghats, allowing tiger and other wildlife dispersal without the threat of development,” said Kakodkar. “A minimum of Rs.25 lakh is to be allotted to every CR or more based on the CR’s area or requirement.”Experts have questioned the state’s intention of declaring areas CRs rather than sanctuaries or national parks. “The department feels they can avoid headaches by issuing CR notification. Officers do not want to get involved in the tedious legal processes under WPA, and hear villagers’ problems. By doing so they deprive villagers of their rights and resettlement and ex-gratia packages from the state,,” said Kishor Rithe, a non-government member of the SBWL. However, Kakodkar said declaring an area a CR is a preliminary step. “It does not make sense to notify only the reserved forest as sanctuaries unless non-forest areas are also taken up and there, the settlement procedure has to be followed, which takes much longer to provide protection,” he said. Kakodkar also said the forest department has prepared an action plan regarding rising leopard deaths and kills, which will be discussed at today’s SWBL meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-proposes-declaration-of-11-conservation-reserves-to-protect-1-076-sq-km-forest-area/story-vkvDjXPpot74hOAPmqKnXK.html
04-12-2020||City||Winter session of Maharashtra legislature to be held on December 14, 15||Amid fears of a possible spike in the Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government has curtailed its winter session to two days from the usual duration of two weeks. The session will be held on December 14 and 15 and the government is also likely to conduct the budget session in February. Traditionally winter session of the state legislature is held in Nagpur every year. However, this year it will be held in Mumbai. In the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting attended by legislative Council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar, Assembly speaker Nana Patole, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar, leaders of the Opposition in Assembly and Council Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, the leaders decide to postpone the winter session, slated to begin on December 7, by a week. “Besides the supplementary demands, the two-day session will have condolence motion and debate on supplementary budget. Though the Opposition insisted to hold the session for two weeks, we [the government] decided to curtail it short in the wake of the pandemic,” said parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab. As for the monsoon session held on September 7 and 8, the entry to legislature for the winter session, too, will be restricted and it is mandatory to undergo reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Fadnavis has slammed the state government for curtailing the duration of the session. “There are many issues, including the Maratha reservation, farmers’ distress, and also the strictures against the state government by various courts that need to be discussed. The state government is trying to run away from debating on these issues by reducing the duration of the session,” he said. Meanwhile, Patole said the budget session will be held in Nagpur. “It has been in-principle decided that the budget session will be held in the second capital of the state as per the Nagpur Pact,” he said. The pact was signed when the Vidarbha region was included in Maharashtra at the time of the formation of the state. According to it, it is mandatory to hold one session of the legislature in a year at Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/winter-session-of-maharashtra-legislature-to-be-held-on-december-14-15/story-dyziOV9OTAYfX552MRKgpJ.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Congress set to pick Mumbai unit chief by December-end||The city unit of Congress is likely to get a new chief by the end of this month, with former state ministers Suresh Shetty and Arif Naseem Khan, and senior leaders Bhai Jagtap, Charan Singh Sapra and Amarjeet Singh Manhas being the frontrunners. The party’s Mumbai unit is currently headed by Eknath Gaikwad, who has been the acting president after Milind Deora quit more than a year ago.The Congress is looking at finalising a candidate soon as the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls are less than two years away. HK Patil, the party’s Maharashtra in-charge, confirmed on Thursday that the Mumbai Congress chief will be appointed by December-end and all necessary decisions related to the civic polls will be taken in January, putting the party in election mode. Patil has been meeting key leaders and office bearers from the Mumbai Congress over the past two months to take their views before an appointment is made. “It can’t be denied that two presidents resigning in a span of just a few months last year was unfortunate. We are in the process of appointing a new chief for the city unit and the name will be announced by the month-end. Instead of representing any cast, community or religion, the new chief will be a Congress face. We will also take necessary steps to strengthen the city unit by January as part of the preparations for BMC elections,” Patil told a select group of mediapersons at the party’s Colaba office on Thursday. Patil also met state ministers from the Congress and the party’s legislators on Thursday. He said ministers have been told to increase their visibility and work more aggressively in the interest of common people. “It is true that compared to the other two ruling parties [Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party], Congress ministers need to be more visible and aggressive. They have been asked to undertake welfare schemes, improve governance and deliver effectively,” he said. Patil also met a group of scheduled caste (SC) party leaders on Wednesday. The leaders have demanded a separate law for the full utilisation of the budgetary outlay meant for SCs. He also asked the state leadership to ensure that the appointments on statutory boards and corporations governed by the state government be made at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-set-to-pick-mumbai-unit-chief-by-december-end/story-pP2P70vUk74IBSbKIWeuoL.html

Surgery was performed on 933 patients during the pre-Covid period at an average of 337.2 patients per month, while 829 patients underwent surgery during the Covid-19 period averaging at 184.2 per month.During the Covid-19 phase, the neurosurgery department operated at 54.6% of the pre-Covid capacity (a drop of 45.4% cases), the study of one of the largest neurosurgical tertiary care departments, catering to an average of 115 in-patient cases at a time, stated.Acute cases dominateThe study concluded that the restrictions imposed by Covid-19 had resulted in a significant change in the pattern of neurosurgical procedures, with acute cases dominating over chronic benign disorders.The percentage of patients treated for a ruptured aneurysm or an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) rose nearly 1.7 times during the Covid-19 period (18%) compared to the percentage during the pre-Covid period (10.6%). Similarly, there was an increased percentage of surgeries performed for hydrocephalus, stroke, and cerebellar tumours during the Covid-19 period. There were reductions in the percentages of patients who were surgically treated for glioma, spinal disorders, meningioma, sellar-suprasellar tumours, and cerebral metastasis.The percentage of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar tumours have increased during the pandemic. Some of these illnesses, including subarachnoid haemorrhage and stroke, are also correlated with a sedentary lifestyle, dietary factors, and high-stress levels expected in the pandemic, the study stated.Prevalence among patientsAmong the Covid-19 asymptomatic patients who were admitted for surgery, four were found to be positive in the first Covid-19 test in the emergency wing area, and an additional five patients were found to be positive in the second test.Till August 15, Covid-19 had been detected 3.7 times more often in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients than in the local community even with a single test, while with double testing displayed an incremental value by disclosing Covid-19 overall in 1 in 100 inpatients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/neurological-surgeries-at-chandigarh-s-pgimer-dip-by-46-due-to-covid/story-vcVl8h6V3Wcxx1Vz0IvzDN.html

After learning about the FIR, Rashid and his brothers Jahid Ali, Javed Abdul Karim, Mohammed Salim and Faujulla Shaikh and others confronted Abdul in the market on Tuesday. The men then assaulted him and his cousin. The family of 10 members then slashed the victim with a sword. Siddheshwar Gove, senior police inspector of Trombay police station said that eight of the accused have been arrested. However, two of the accused are still absconding. “We have initiated MCOCA proceedings against the accused as there are more than 38 cases of threatening, assault, criminal intimidation and spreading terror in the locality and murder,” said Gove. Gove added that they have started a special drive to identify such local gangs and begin MCOCA proceedings against them, “We have identified 13 others and are in process to book them under MCOCA,” said Gove.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mcoca-invoked-against-10-persons-for-slashing-man-with-sword-in-mumbai/story-T25SMhEyP96EFmRpVm5yoI.html

The board has assured of following all the norms concerning safety.In a circular issued on Thursday, the board stated that it has requested states to allow schools to reopen partially from January 4. “With students physically attending schools, this time will be utilised for practical work, project work and doubt clearing sessions. This will be extremely beneficial to students who will now get the time to interact directly with the teachers,” stated the circular issued by Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board. The CISCE has also asked the election commission for the schedule of state-level elections to be able to plan Class 10 and 12 board exams better.According to the circular, if allowed to reopen, schools will have to follow directives issued by the respective state governments regarding Covid-19 and will have to adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed by states in this regard. Schools in the city said that the board’s move will help students from the higher standards. “Students want to come to school especially for solving doubts and it is important to give them that option. Especially students with learning difficulties are having a tough time in the online-only format and we hope that such students are allowed to come to school in small groups for a few physical sessions,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of the Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle. Officials from the Maharashtra state education department did not respond to calls and messages. Education minister Varsha Gaikwad also remained unavailable for comment.

04-12-2020||City||Blow to BJP, MVA candidates leading in polls for 4 Council seats in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising the ruling parties Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, had an edge over the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as alliance’s candidates were leading after a second round of votes counting in the graduates’ constituencies of Aurangbad, Pune and Nagpur and the teachers’ constituency of Pune. An independent candidate was leading in the teachers’ constituency of Amravati. The counting of votes for the five seats to Council is underway.The BJP was on the verge of defeat in Nagpur graduates’ constituency, which it had retained since its inception and was represented by Union minister Nitin Gadkari and the late Gangadharrao Fadnavis, father of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. In Nagpur graduates’ constituency, Abhijit Wanjari of the Congress was leading by more than 10,000 votes against his nearest rival, Sandip Joshi of BJP during the second round of votes counting. Interestingly, Joshi is a close aide of Devendra Fadnavis, who was camping in Nagpur for a week to campaign for the prestige seat. In the Pune graduates’ constituency, NCP candidate Arun Lad was leading by more than 10,000 votes against BJP’s Sangram Deshmukh. And in the Pune teachers’ constituency, Congress’s Anant Asgaonkar was leading against BJP’s Dattatrey Sawant, who is also a sitting member in the Council. NCP’s Satish Chavan was leading Shirish Boralkar of BJP in the Aurangabad graduates’ constituency after the second round of votes counting.In the Amravati teachers’ constituency, independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik of Washim was ahead of his nearest rivals, Shrikant Deshpande of Shiv Sena and Dr Nitin Dhande of BJP by a margin of around 4,500 votes. Sarnaik is likely to wrest the seat from Sena.Besides Nagpur, with candidates trailing in both the constituencies of Pune, where BJP had built its base over the past few years, the poll results assumed bad new for the party.Meanwhile, BJP’s Amrish Patel won the bypolls from Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies’ constituency by defeating MVA’s Abhijit Patil by 234 votes. Patel polled 332 votes, while Patil got 98 votes. Congress leaders expressed surprise over the defeat as MVA has 213 members in local bodies, while BJP’s strength is 199. Patel had switched sides and joined BJP after quitting Congress ahead of the Assembly polls last year.After forming the government in state last year, MVA was fighting the council elections together for the first time, and although the BJP was confident of its victory in three seats in Pune and Nagpur, the results seem to be a boost for the three parties in the ruling alliance.Discontent in Congress over nominations Discontent over party nominations to the legislative Council seats from the Governor quota emerged during Congress’s legislative meeting. Energy minister and party’s national SC/ST cell chief Nitin Raut expressed his concerns over the nomination of Aniruddha Wankar, a noted lyricist and writer from Vidarbha.Raut said the party should have preferred one of its own workers instead of Wankar, who had fought against the party in the Assembly elections last year, representing Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi.Raut and other leaders had also raised objections to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominee Yashwant Bhinge, a dhangar leader who polled sizable votes on a VBA ticket in the Lok Sabha polls from Nanded. It is believed that Cong’s Ashok Chavan had to face defeat because of Bhinge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blow-to-bjp-mva-candidates-leading-in-polls-for-4-council-seats-in-maharashtra/story-FfVISXdKFycJPacVaZ3JEM.html

In their letter, degree college teachers have which suggested that first-year exams be postponed to end of January 2021, and demanded that the university release an official circular at the earliest.This letter comes less than two weeks after the organisation, in their previous letter, highlighted that most colleges have not managed to teach the mandatory 90 days before exams due to delay in admissions to first-year courses, thereby making it impossible to hold exams in December.Through this letter, BUCTU members have expressed their shock at how the university has slowly started informing colleges about change in the exam schedule. “While some cluster colleges have been informed to start first year exams in the first and second week of January 2021, many colleges in Konkan have not received any intimation from the university. This casual manner of sharing crucial information is unacceptable,” said BUCTU.As per MU’s November 18 circular, affiliated colleges are supposed to hold online exams for the current batches of undergraduate courses by December 2020 while postgraduate exams should be conducted in January 2020. “Due to the Covid-19 situation, admissions to first-year courses were delayed by a couple of months this year, and regular classes for these batches started only in October. Many colleges have not yet managed to conduct practical classes as yet, so any form of examination in the month of December will be unfair to the students,” added the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-organisation-demands-postponement-of-first-year-mumbai-university-exams/story-Flsymx5Bsor5ULoxeSjeMN.html

The date was announced on Thursday by the state election commission.The results will be announced on December 30. The last MC polls were held in 2013 when Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia became the first mayor of Panchkula.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) will fight together, whereas Congress has announced to fight the elections on symbol.Apart from these, the members of resident welfare associations, who have been “disappointed” with the political leaders, have decided to contest for the post of councillor at least from five of the 20 wards.Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta said: “The BJP and JJP as an alliance will fight these elections together from all the 20 wards. The candidate name from each ward will be finalised by December 10.”The nominations have to be filed between December 11 and 16, and that’s why most of the parties will have finalised the names by then.BJP holds meetingThe BJP held a meeting with its workers on Thursday, which was attended by Captain Abhimanyu as well, who has been made the in-charge for Panchkula MC polls.“Ten senior leaders of BJP have been assigned the task to go to 20 wards and hold meetings.

Despite cinemas slashing ticket prices by 60%, rolling out offers on tickets and making calls to customers to apprise them of the said offers, the occupancy remains low at around 35-40%.The staff says that though all standard operating procedures are being followed, the footfall in theatres is at an all-time low due to no major new releases and fear of contracting the virus, which has left the establishments struggling to stay afloat.Almost all multiplexes in the city are showing three movies — Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari, Peninsula and Chaar Sahibzaade -2 : Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur. Only two to three viewings are slotted per day. With the martyrdom day of the sons of the 10th Sikh guru approaching, multiplex owners are hoping that the footfall will increase.A ticket counter employee at PVR Cinemas, Flamez Mall, Malhar road, who requested anonymity, said,”The ticket prices have been reduced drastically to attract more customers. During weekdays, the ticket price for a show before noon is just ₹59. Multiple schemes have been launched such as free vouchers on purchasing eatables at multiplexes. However, the occupancy remains low.”Wave cinemas, Westend Mall, has slashed ticket rates by a whopping 60% as the tickets that were earlier available for ₹200, now merely cost ₹80. “With a second wave of Covid sweeping through the district, people are afraid to venture out to watch a movie,” says an employee.PVR cinemas, Silver Arc Mallis is not faring any better despite slashing prices upto ₹60. Staff says only 40% occupancy has been witnessed over the last month as most people are unaware that cinemas are open.The managements, however, expect the situation to improve in the coming days as the footfall is consistently increasing after cinemas were initially allowed to open in November 1.PVR Cinemas regional manager (marketing) Rohit Sharma said, “The sector is recovering and the response will improve with new releases in the offing.”However, SRS Cinemas, Omaxe Mall, Ferozepur Road and Solitaire Cinemas at JMD Govardhan City Centre (near Jagraon bridge) are yet to raise their shutters.Many cinephiles say they would be willing to return to the multiplexes once some interesting movies release. A Shastri Nagar resident Gurpreet Kaur said, “I was planning to catch a movie with my husband this week, but no new movie has been released. Besides, our parents are advising us against visiting theatres amid the spurt in Covid cases.” No more night shows amid curfewAfter imposition of night curfew in the state till December 15, multiplexes are rescheduled shows so that visitors get free by 9 to 9:30pm. No show is being scheduled after 6:45pm.The staff said the imposition of night curfews was a pity as the night shows were very popular among theatre-goers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-upto-60-drop-in-prices-ludhiana-cinemas-report-low-occupancy/story-zODzBAuBJ6ESl5JqkOH67L.html
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Arnab Goswami seeks stay on probe into suicide abetment case||Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV and R Bharat news channels, has filed an application in his pending petition before the Bombay high court (HC) urging the court to stay any further investigation into Anvay Naik suicide abetment case registered against him at Alibag in Raigad district. Goswami has also sought an interim order to restrain Alibag police from filing a charge sheet in the case and to transfer the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or some other independent agency beyond the purview of Maharashtra government. In support of his claim for stay on further investigation and filing of the charge sheet, he has relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court while granting him interim bail. In its detailed order, SC has said that “a prima facie evaluation of the FIR does not establish the ingredients of the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.” Goswami taken a strong exception to the statement made by Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on November 28 that a “strong charge sheet” will “soon” be filed against the editor. “The said statement of the Maharashtra home minister is an open disregard and an unapologetic contravention of the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” states Goswami’s application. “This shocking premeditated political declaration by Mr Anil Deshmukh came at a news conference 12 hours after the Hon’ble Supreme Court delivered the said judgement dated 27th November 2020. The said statement and the corresponding investigation at the behest of the home department, state of Maharashtra, not only establishes the malicious and malafide intent guiding the overall investigation in the present case but also exposes the complete subversion of the Supreme Court order dated 27th November 2020,” it adds. “It is thus clear that the entire investigation in the case is being puppeteered by a political machinery and is tainted and prescripted by the executive powers at play of the respondents (state authorities),” it adds and presses on the need for an independent probe into the case. Goswami has termed the investigation into the FIR as “illegal and dehors the law” for, according to him, investigation into the case was closed and an A-Summary report was accepted by the chief judicial magistrate at Alibaug on April 16, 2019, but the reinvestigation started without a judicial order. “Thus, for a matter which is concluded with the filing of an A-summary report, which is valid till date, filing of a charge sheet would be completely illegal and bad in law,” he has said and urged the court to restrain Alibag police from carrying any further investigation and filing charge sheet. Architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, 53, died by suicide at his residence at Kaavir village in Alibag tehsil on May 5, 2018. His mother, Kumud, too, was found dead at their home at the time. His wife Akshata had lodged a complaint with the police alleging that her husband was forced to take the drastic step as he was under tremendous mental stress because of non-payment of dues collectively amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami and two others. Naik was the managing director of Concorde Designs Private Limited, which rendered services for Republic TV. Along with Republic, Naik had dues from two other companies namely Smartworks and IcastX/Skimedia. On the basis of Akshata’s complaint, Alibag police had on May 5, 2018 registered an offence booking Goswami, Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks for abetting suicides of her husband and mother-in-law. In his suicide note, Naik had alleged that Goswami owed him ₹83 lakh, Sarda ₹55 lakh and Shaikh ₹4 crore. On April 16, 2019, the then investigating officer of the case submitted an A-summary report and sought closure of the case for want of prosecutable evidence against any of the three accused. The jurisdictional magistrate had accepted the report on the same day. After his arrest on November 4, Goswami has filed the petition for his immediate release and also for quashing of the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-arnab-goswami-seeks-stay-on-probe-into-suicide-abetment-case/story-LR7wqQ1Mkcwb82mYJkxPiO.html

04-12-2020||Chandigarh||Auto driver, accomplice held for raping mentally-ill woman in Ludhiana||Nine days after a 30-year-old mentally ill woman was allegedly raped by an auto-rickshaw driver and his accomplice, the police arrested the two accused on Thursday. The accused are Rishi Raj, 37, of Bhagat Singh Colony, an auto-rickshaw driver and Gurmeet Singh, 35, of Sherpur, a mechanic. On November 23, the victim, who was returning to her maternal home from a shrine lost her way and was waylaid by the accused who took her to a rented accommodation in Sherpur and sexually assaulted her,” said joint commissioner of police (JCP, city) Bhagirath Singh Meena. The victim’s brother had lodged a complaint against the auto-rickshaw driver at the Division Number 4 Police Station on November 27. The police formed six teams under additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 1) Deepak Pareek and assistant commissioner of police (ACP, central) Waryam Singh to search for the driver. The teams scanned at least 300 CCTV cameras installed over 48 square kilometers in five days to identify the accused.Women police personnel, in particular, played a crucial role in solving the case. Meena said ferreting out the rickshaw driver was no mean feat: “Tracing a three-wheeler in the city that has at least 30,000 autos on the road was like looking for a needle in a haystack. However, we conducted a thorough investigation. We started scanning CCTVs on all major roads and crossroads. The suspects were arrested from a rented accommodation in Railway Colony of Sherpur,” said Meena said. “Raj confessed that he had found the victim on the roadside near Transport Nagar. He made the woman sit in his three-wheeler and took her to the rented accommodation of his friend Gurmeet Singh of Sherpur after roaming around the city for an hour. The men raped the victim and dropped her off near the Jalandhar Bypass the next morning,”police said.Raj said he thought he would not be identified as he had bought a second-hand rickshaw and had not transferred the ownership to his name. However, upon learning that an investigation had been initiated, the accused hid in a rented accommodation to evade arrest. The accused were remanded to three days in police custody. Victim had suffered domestic violence The complainant had told the police that his sister was a domestic abuse victim, which had led to the manifestation of a mental disorder. She had undergone treatment for it and after regaining fitness returned to her husband’s house in October, 2018. However, he sent her back after a year and she resumed psychiatric treatment.“On November 23, my sister lost her way while returning home from a shrine. The next day, we got a phone call saying she was in Ganna village, Phillaur, 20km away from Ludhiana. On November 27, she told us what had happened,” the victim’s brother told the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/auto-driver-accomplice-held-for-raping-mentally-ill-woman-in-ludhiana/story-dtoHl14iZ5hfiGKCVrumWK.html
04-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana teen duped of ₹45,000 cash in bank||Two fraudsters pretending to be bank customers duped a teenager who had gone to deposit cash of ₹45,000 on Wednesday. The 17-year-old victim’s father Pramod Kumar of Sarup Nagar, who owns a meat shop, had sent his son to the bank to deposit ₹45,000. However, when the Class-10 student was standing in queue to deposit the cash, two men sought his help in filling the deposit form. They then claimed that they were in a rush and requested him to deposit ₹20,000 cash in their account. The accused ostensibly handed the teen the cash that was wrapped in cloth and told him it was ₹65,000. They told him to deposit ₹20,000 in their account and the rest in his account. The victim handed them his ₹45,000 and after they left realised that the cloth contained bits of paper. The victim immediately cold his father who informed the police. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Surinder Singh, who is investigating the case, said a case had been registered under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

04-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: On road but right at home inside their trucks, tractors||A set of wooden planks have been tied together to form a two floor structure inside a large truck parked at the farmers’ protest site at Delhi’s Singhu Border. At night, at least 40 people sleep on the two decks and half a dozen under the vehicle. Some distance away, three sofas made of hay and placed strategically outside a truck are occupied by farmers discussing the ongoing situation. “We were being criticised for burning hay and causing pollution. So, I purchased a machine to turn them into sofa sets,” said Navtesh Singh, a farmer from Moga in Punjab. Most of these trucks are equipped with large batteries and charging points to keep the mobile phones of farmers active. Solar-powered lights are put out on the roads for charging. By evening, they’ll be ready to light up an entire truck. These are only some of the arrangements the protesting farmers have made to turn their trucks, tractors and trolleys into “homes”.“The trucks are our bedrooms. The road outside is our kitchen. We have also managed to set up temporary washrooms. The only facility we lack is air-conditioning,” said Navtesh.The farmers have insisted that they are in for a long haul and have food stocks to last them months. While their food stocks and kitchen are there for everyone to see, a lot more preparations are visible when you peep a little deeper. At both, Singhu and Tikri borders, there are tractors with two trolleys attached to them. Usually, one of these trolleys serve as a bedroom and the other as a storeroom for groceries. And every now and then, there are trolleys stuffed with wood and even cow dung cakes. “If we exhaust our cooking gas, the wood and cow dung cakes will come into use,” said Jasveer Singh, a farmer from Sangrur protesting at Singhu Border. The tractors and trucks have been specially designed by the farmers to ensure they provide as much comfort as is possible on the road. Two farmer friends, Ramandeep Singh and Gurpreet Singh covered dozens of trucks in and around their village in Patiala with tarpaulin sheets to ensure they were water and wind-resistant. Some vehicles were also covered with iron mesh for “extra safety”.“The floors of the trucks are first covered by hay. Then mattresses and bedsheets are laid atop them to ensure warmth. We have brought ample blankets and quilts to ensure no one is cold,” said Ramandeep.Since bathing and washing clothes is being done in the open, the farmers have fixed strings on their trucks or between two vehicles to serve as clothes hangers. The same mechanism of using two vehicles has also been used to set up tents outside by many farmers. Some have gone as far as having a separate section for storing footwear, stools for sitting and almost all trucks have wooden or metallic staircases for the elderly to hop into the vehicles with ease. Exclusive cabins have been made for women which have curtains hanging from strings to ensure privacy. “The hay below and mattresses above them in the truck ensures the sleep is as comfortable as in our bedrooms,” said Amarjeet Kaur, a 52-year-old farmer. While the farmers have brought in portable and battery-operated speakers to listen to music and hookahs to keep them busy, their day begins with Punjabi newspapers. “These newspapers land in our trucks by 7am every day,” said Ajeet Singh, a farmer from Moga who is protesting at Tikri Border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-protesters-their-trucks-tractors-are-their-new-homes/story-rQGv5EZ0XMsvfMvKCcKqcM.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Security deployment increased as number of protesters swell at Delhi borders||The number of protesters at Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana swelled up on Thursday as hundreds of other farmers and support groups joined the agitation against the farm laws even as their representatives held talks with the central government, prompting the police to almost double the deployment of security personnel.Around 10 am on Thursday, nearly 500 farmers, mostly from Uddam Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, sat on one carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut expressway towards Ghaziabad, forcing the police to close one side for vehicular traffic and divert vehicles to alternative routes. The farmers had food, held meetings and protests, and delivered speeches through loudspeakers on the carriageway throughout the day. UP police officials were seen requesting the protesters to shift to the NH-9 (formerly NH-24) service road where other farmers have been stationed since last Friday. Multiple negotiations failed and the protesters did not move from the carriageway, following which UP Police increased their deployment and stationed personnel armed with anti-riot gear.Brijender Singh, a farmer from Udham Singh Nagar, said, “Our leaders had been sitting in Burari to cooperate with the government but they weren’t called for talks on Thursday. This indicates the government isn’t taking us seriously. To make our presence visible, we have blocked the highway.”Nirdesh Singh, a female leader who had come from Moradabad with a group of 70-80 farmers, including 30-35 women, said they have come to express their solidarity and will stay here till their demands are met.Around 4 pm, another group of at least 500 farmers joined the agitation from Hapur and Bulandshahar in UP. The group carrying sticks and mounted on vehicles fitted with loudspeakers went past the barricades on the elevated Delhi-Meerut expressway but had to return as the carriageway was barricaded by Delhi Police.Around 4.30 pm, the group marched to the service lane, dismantled barricades placed by Delhi Police and tried to cross over. As armed paramilitary personnel and policemen took positions to stop them, farmer leaders intervened and calmed down the groups. The barricades were rearranged by the police and the farmers retreated.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said the situation remained peaceful but as the number of protesters increased, they had to almost double the number of security personnel. Singh said till Wednesday, only the service lane was blocked but on Thursday the protesters took over one carriageway on the elevated expressway. “This required more barricading and additional forces were called to ensure adequate arrangements,” he said.The Uttar Pradesh police also stepped up their arrangements at the Ghazipur border. Drones were used for surveillance as the gathering continued to swell and fire tenders were stationed.The farmers’ gathering at the Chilla border with Noida also doubled since Wednesday but was peaceful. One carriageway from Noida to Delhi remained blocked.At the Singhu border, which was relaxed for the last three-four days, police and paramilitary personnel geared up to handle any eventuality. Many of them were seen putting on anti-riot gear and taking positions near the two protest sites.While Gaurav Sharma, DCP (outer-north), said deployment remained as before, another senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified said additional companies of paramilitary personnel were reaching Delhi in the next couple of days in view of the swelling crowd and to prevent any possible deterioration of the situation in case the talks did not end up well.“Between Mukarba Chowk and Singhu Border, we have set up three points, which are blocked with mud-laden trucks to ensure there are multiple layers of barricades in case the protesters try to force their way into Delhi,” the officer said.Sharma said the three layers were set up due to inputs that farmers could use alternative routes to get to NH-44 to enter the city. “We’ll remove them soon,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/security-deployment-increased-as-number-of-protesters-swell-at-delhi-borders/story-P6AZFzop3sWTdFwmkAxpyO.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Despite huge crowd at protest sites, no Covid-19 testing||It has been a week since farmers from across the country launched their protests against the Centre’s farm bills along Delhi’s borders, but none of these protest sites had a single Covid-19 testing camp as on Thursday.The lone Covid-19 testing camp that was set up by the Delhi government at the Burari site on Saturday was also wrapped up in a day, farmers protesting at the site said. The sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, on the other hand, haven’t seen any Covid-19 testing camps or medical vans for swab collection from day one.Officials of the north district administration said the temporary camp at Burari’s designated protest site at the Sant Nirankari Samagam Ground had a medical team equipped with rapid antigen kits on Saturday.“But the antigen kits were not replenished at the site the next day. The facility was a voluntary one and found very few takers. Only around 40 tests were conducted on Day One at the Burari site using the antigen kits, but no farmer was found to be positive,” said a senior official of the north district administration, which is overseeing all the arrangements at Burari.While the Delhi government has built a mega tent covering around 4 lakh square feet of the ground with the capacity of sheltering over 50,000 protesters, only around 200 farmers were seen using the shelter on Thursday. The city administration has provided toilet and water facilities as well. Binder Singh, one of the many leaders of the ongoing protests and who was present at the Burari site, said that they have been demanding that the city administration administers Covid-19 tests for the agitators.“A wrong perception is being built that farmers do not want to get tested. But, what does one do when there is no access to Covid tests at all,” he said.At the protest site along the Singhu border, at least 4-5 health camps set up by private organisations — including those by NGOs, doctors’ association, religious committees and sometimes even political parties — could be spotted. But none of them had Covid-19 testing facility in them.“We are getting 2-3 farmers almost every day who have flu-like symptoms. Still, all we can do is suggest that they get tested for Covid at a government facility or at a private laboratory. But, most of them never leave the site. We can only hope that no one turns out to be a super spreader and that too will remain unknown because there is absolutely no Covid-19 testing happening here,” said Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti of the Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum, which has set up a health kiosk at Singhu border.He said the health camps set up privately at the protest sites cannot offer Covid-19 testing because of the national guidelines. “One has to be formally registered with the ICMR and the city administration to offer Covid-19 testing. We have been urging the government to set up Covid-19 testing camps at Singhu border and Ghazipur, but nothing has happened yet,” Bhatti said.When asked, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said he had discussed the matter with the district administration (north) and asked them to make the necessary arrangements.“The directions, including setting up of tents at Singhu border, were issued two days ago. We shall follow-up if it has not been done yet,” he said.At the protest sites, however, there are scores of farmers who are not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour - be it wearing masks, maintaining social distancing or frequently sanitising their hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/despite-huge-crowd-at-protest-sites-no-covid-testing/story-nolpodX8pM2fkxJu6c3ptJ.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Traffic crawls as farmers block highway in Ghaziabad||The traffic chaos in Delhi, triggered by the continuing border blockade by farmers protesting the new farm laws, worsened on Thursday with more farmers joining the agitation and blocking off another key highway -- the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. One carriageway of the elevated Delhi-Meerut Expressway (NH-24), which connects Delhi to Ghaziabad, was also closed around 10am Thursday, after nearly 600 farmers belonging to Uttarakhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh sat on the road, blocking the vehicles coming from Ghaziabad to Delhi. Since the blockade was sudden, and during the office hours, commuters going towards Delhi from Vasundhara, Vaishali, Indirapuram, Raj Nagar, and Ghaziabad had a harrowing time and were stuck in huge snarls even on the alternative routes suggested to them by the UP Police. The alternative border points -- Maharajpur, Kaushambi, and Surya Nagar -- are narrow as compared to the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, and there was bumper-to-bumper traffic at all those points throughout the day. Naresh Sharma, a resident of Vaishali driving to Delhi’s Nehru Place, said, “Usually it takes me 15-20 minutes to reach Sarai Kale Khan using the expressway. But today, it looks like it will take me more than an hour to reach there. I am stuck at Maharajpur border for nearly 25 minutes because of the slow moving traffic.”Vijay Joshi, a businessman who was also travelling to Delhi from Ghaziabad, said there was no prior information about the closure of the expressway and not enought police personnel were on roads to guide motorists. Farmers who had blocked the expressway carriageway said they had left “a 14 feet space” for ambulances and other emergency vehicles. “Our protest is not aimed at causing inconvenience to the public. We were sitting on the NH-24 service lane since Friday. But since the government is not listening to our demands, we had no choice but to extend our agitation to the expressway and block one carriageway. Our entire effort is to mount pressure on the government,” said Sardar Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer from Uttarakhand. The resulting chaos also slowed down vehicles on Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road and other routes. The Chilla border (Delhi-Noida Link Road), which was closed for nearly 22 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday, remained partially opened Thursday. One carriageway (from Delhi to Noida) remained open, while the opposite carriageway (from Noida to Delhi) was blocked by farmers. To ensure motorists entering Delhi from Noida do not face inconvenience due to the closure of the arterial road, the police diverted traffic on to the DND Flyway, the Dallupura border, the New Ashok Nagar border, and the Kondli border. Although heavy traffic was witnessed in the morning and evening hours on those routes, the situation was slightly better than what it was on Wednesday. Commuters said the Delhi traffic police’s Twitter handle was much helpful to make sense of all the disruptons and diversions. Since morning, police kept putting out alerts about closures and also listed alternative routes for travelling between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh cities.As far as the traffic situation at Singhu and Tikri borders were concerned, both remained shut on Thursday as well. The police closed several border roads and limited vehicular movement on a few others that anyway only see sparse traffic. The border points fully closed since Wednesday are Jharoda, Lampur, Auchandi, Safiabad, Piao Maniyari and Sabori. Until Wednesday, traffic on Jharoda border was being regulated and only the vehicles leaving Delhi were being allowed. But Santosh Meena, DCP (Dwarka), said that since the Rohtak Road -- which is just a few hundred metres from the border point -- has movement of farmers, it was decided to close this border point. “It would take people only a few minutes to breach this border had we not closed it,” Meena said. The Jhatikara border allowed only motorcyclists to ply; the DCP said there was information about farmers proceeding towards that side. The other border points closed by the police are mostly located around Singhu and Tikri borders. Many of them were used by farmers in the past three days to enter Delhi despite strong barricades at the two main points. The protesting farmers have threatened to block more borders if their demands were not met by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-disruptions-and-diversions-this-time-the-delhi-meerut-expressway/story-r0Qwqdrt2DqOMM8cQRGHFK.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers say hopeful of resolution but won’t settle for amendments||Asserting that they will not settle for anything but complete revocation of new laws that seek to open up farm trade, protesting farmers on Thursday said that they were hopeful of a resolution after talks with the Centre. Kulwant Singh Sandhu, 65, general secretary of Janmuri Kisan Sabha, who attended the meeting said, “Our movement has made a huge difference in the way the government used to treat us earlier. The government wants amendments in the three new laws, but we want complete repeal. The government has also offered us a few more things, including power subsidy, but our demand is different. We will hold a meeting with our fellow farmers on Friday before the next round of talks scheduled on Saturday.” Harjinder Singh Tanda of Azad Kisan Sangharsh Committee, said, “Thursday’s talks made little progress. We are hopeful. In the next meeting, we will now put more pressure on the government to revoke the new farm laws.”At Singhu border, as their leaders left for the meeting with the Centre at Vigyan Bhavan, farmers were seen sitting in groups and discussing about the outcome of the meeting and the future course for their agitation. Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi’s borders to protest against the three contentious laws. Several farmers said that they will try to move towards the Parliament in case their talks fail to reach a conclusion on Saturday. Karanweer Singh, a farmer from Kurushetra, who is protesting at Singhu border, said, “We will intensify the movement after December 5, and try to march towards the Parliament to make our voice heard. Thousands more from Punjab and Haryana are coming to support us.”Balwinder Singh Rana, president of Majja Kisan Sangarsh Committee, Punjab, said the government should consider their demand for conducting a special session of the Parliament to revoke the three laws. “We are not sitting on the roads leaving our homes for some amendments. We will not end the protest before the government revokes these new laws. Thursday’s meeting has inspired some hope, as the government had shown interest in solving the issue,” he said.Earlier in the day, farmers protesting at the Ghazipur border said the protests will only go up after Saturday, if the issue remains unresolved. “More farmers will join us if required. We will not give up unless the demands are met. Our further course of action will be decided soon after holding a meeting with other leaders,” said Natasha Tikait, a leader of Bhartiya Kisan Union. At Singhu border, groups of farmers from neighbouring Sonipat and Faridabad also visited the protest site to extend their solidarity. The youngsters were seen drawing graffiti on the walls with messages in support of the ongoing agitation.Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar Azad also visited the Singhu border on Thursday. “The government has so far tried to mislead the farmers. But now, the government knows that the farmers have decided to fight their own battles and that’s why it has initiated a dialogue. I have come here on my birthday today to extend my solidarity with my farmer brothers,” he said. Azad had also visited the protest site at Ghazipur border on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-say-hopeful-of-resolution-but-won-t-settle-for-amendments/story-xLqmnE0RmobQqZrDDfrnBN.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||From cleanest to worst, study shows how pollution in Delhi rose in a few months||The PM 2.5 levels this winter spiked by about 8-11 times from August (the cleanest month on record) to November across Delhi and its neighbouring towns, as per a fresh analysis of winter pollution levels by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) released on Thursday.According to the analysis, the relatively clean air gains made during the Covid-19 induced lockdown and a good monsoon were lost to opening up of the economy coinciding with poor weather, contributing to high winter pollution levels this year. Even though the overall average levels of PM 2.5 (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) for 11 months this year was considerably lower than the previous year, it went up to make the air from very poor to severe during October-November, it said. The analysis shows that from the cleanest August (the cleanest month since air quality records started to be maintained in May 2015), the PM2.5 levels rose dramatically to one of the dirtiest Novembers in recent years. “The rise varied from 9.5 times in Delhi to 11 times in Ghaziabad; followed by Noida (9.2 times), Gurugram (6.4 times) and Faridabad (6.2 times). This shows that the transient change of the lockdown phases could not be sustained without the systemic changes needed to control pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants, and waste,” the analysis read.This August recorded four good air days and the lowest AQI (41) since 2015, owing to widespread rainfall and good wind speed in Delhi. Another finding of the analysis shows a higher share of PM 2.5 (tinier, ultrafine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs) in the overall PM 10 (coarser dust particles) concentrations this year.“The share of the ultrafine particles in PM 10 levels determines the toxicity of the air. With the onset of winter, the percentage share of PM2.5 in the overall PM10 rose to over 70% during the smog episodes in early November, and remained high at 50-60% most of November. Its share was highest on Diwali, reaching over 80% at many locations,” it said.The CSE analysis also showed that the pollution levels were more fluid this year compared to the trends in previous years. This year, local pollution across the monitoring centres in Delhi shows wider variations. This is in contrast to the range noted last year, CSE said. For instance, even on the peak smog day in November this year, the PM2.5 levels in several stations varied from a lower bound 108 μg/m3 at NSIT, to 699μg/m3 at Mundka. But last year the variation was noted at a higher range —between 351μg/m3 at Shadipur to 725μg/m3 at Alipur— while the overall level stayed above 374μg/m3. “In fact, the standard deviation among the 36 stations of Delhi this November on an average is 60% higher compared to last year,” it said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE said that this winter, there is a change in the pollution pattern that shows in lesser number of smog episodes compared to last year, wider variation in location-wise concentration compared to last year with higher contribution from stubble burning, among other factors. There are also days when pollution levels dropped to moderate levels even without rains but better wind conditions.“This pattern points to the fact that the reforms and action in key sectors of pollution will have to be scaled up across the region to further bend the annual air pollution curve,” she said.The analysis shows that the share of stubble fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana in Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels were higher compared to the previous years. It shows that the smoke from crop stubble fires started impacting Delhi more discerningly from October 10 onwards this year, which was a week earlier than last year when it started on October 16.“There were seven days this year when the contribution of smoke in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration exceeded 30% in contrast to three days in 2019 and 2018. There were six days when the contribution was between 20-30%, up from four days in 2019, and 16 days of 10-20% contribution, which was also an increase from 15 days in 2019. There were 23 days with less than 10% contribution, down from 30 days in 2019,” the analysis read.It added, “This year Diwali pollution was also compounded by the heightened contribution (32%) of smoke from crop stubble fire.”Roychowdhury further said that while it needs to be seen how the pollution levels will play out during the rest of the winter, it is clear that the region cannot afford to lose gains it has made so far. “At the same time, we also need to raise the level of ambition to drive action across all key sectors. Enforce power plant standards, eliminate coal from the industry, scale up public transport and vehicle restraint measures and manage waste to have a zero waste and zero landfill strategy,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-cleanest-to-worst-study-shows-how-pollution-in-delhi-rose-in-a-few-months/story-5RtpkCUwuieyx1dJGrTOLN.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||SC seeks Facebook India chief’s response on Delhi assembly panel’s plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought the response of Facebook India chief Ajit Mohan on an application moved by Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee, through its chairman Raghav Chadha, seeking to be made a party to the proceedings of a case filed by Mohan before the apex court.On September 23, Mohan had filed a plea challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the committee seeking his presence before the panel, which is probing the Delhi riots and the role of the social media company in alleged hate speech.A three-judge bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked Mohan’s lawyer senior advocate Harish Salve to file a response within three weeks and posted the matter for further hearing to the third week of January.The apex court, in September, had ordered that no coercive action should be taken against Mohan in connection with the summons issued by the committee. Subsequently, the panel decided not to hold any meeting till the issue was resolved by the top court.Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, representing the committee, told the court that it was a necessary party to the proceedings as it had issued the summons to Mohan. “Since it is the action of the committee that is the subject matter of this writ petition, it is submitted that the applicant is a proper and necessary party to fully explain the circumstances under which the alleged cause of action took place and the impugned summons were issued,” the committee said.The committee had received the mandate to suggest measures to eliminate factors and situations having a potential to disturb communal harmony in the capital and to establish harmony among different religious or linguistic groups.Mohan had challenged before the top court the scope of such an inquiry and stated that “the very constitution of the committee of peace and harmony was unconstitutional”. The committee countered this by saying, “Since consideration of the aforesaid issues (resulting from riots) arose within the geographical area of the (Delhi) assembly, it was necessary to examine them and seek inputs, help, advice and submissions which would enrich and fulfil the purposes for which the committee was constituted.”Responding to the development, Salve said the committee’s application made for interesting reading. “The panel says it has an independent existence and is a juridical entity. It needs to be seen where it (panel) fits,” Salve said, while requesting time to file a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-seeks-facebook-india-chief-s-response-on-delhi-assembly-panel-s-plea/story-zahqfXerLAMVirSr5IvwmM.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Mohalla clinics short of hands as staffers test Covid-19 positive||Around 20 mohalla clinics in the national capital are functioning only intermittently owing to a short age of hands -- staff have either tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) or are unwilling to work at the clinics when the cases are surging -- officials of the health department said.In November, when Delhi battled a severe rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths, about four to five staffers of mohalla clinics had tested positive for Covid-19. The numbers are the same at any given time, officials said.Health experts said last month, when intensive care units in hospitals were filled to capacity with Covid-19 patients, these clinics had turned out to be a major boon in delivering health services.According to health officials, there are around 15 to 20 clinics — the official did not specify where these clinics are located — that have not been functioning for the past couple of months. A few of the doctors and nurses at these clinics had contracted Covid-19, while the other staffers are unwilling to join back duty given the surge in cases. Each clinic has three to four staff members — a doctor, a nurse, a pharmacist and a helper and treats about 100-200 patients a day.The doctors and staff at the mohalla clinics are paid on a per patient basis. Each mohalla clinic sees about 100 to 120 patients a day.“We have a running list of doctors who have already been selected for postings at mohalla clinics and are reaching out to them to join the clinics where there are staffing issues,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity.Two mohalla clinic doctors – a husband and wife -- were a part of the first cluster of cases reported from Delhi in March. A 38-year-old woman from Dilshad Garden had visited one of the doctors when she experienced symptoms after returning from Dubai. She had passed on the infection to her mother, two daughters, brother, and a friend.Another 65-year-old doctor from mohalla clinic in Najafgarh had contracted the infection and died in JuneThe officials are also looking at conducting fresh interviews to expand the list. Currently, there are over 465 such clinics in Delhi, with the government planning to expand the numbers to 1,000 -- one clinic in every 1km radius. During the lockdown, only about 360 of these clinics were functional. More clinics were opened up and operationalized as the restrictions were removed.“Having mohalla clinics at a time like this is beneficial as they ensure that people at least get primary care, which hospitals are currently unable to provide given the influx of patients. In many hospitals, routine clinics have been stopped or curtailed and mohalla clinics can help take on that load. Also, people are wary of bigger hospitals as there is a higher chance of contracting the disease from these big facilities,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The Delhi government has also removed the restriction of doctors or other staff members over the age of 60 years from working in clinics. “Initially, we had asked senior doctors to not work in mohalla clinics as there was a risk of exposure to patients who might have Covid-19. However, with the pandemic persisting for so long, many senior doctors are insisting on getting back to work,” the official said.“We cannot stop them from reporting to duty as there is already a community spread and people are contracting the infection even without stepping out of homes. But all mohalla clinic staff have been asked to ensure social distancing and to wear masks during duty hours to protect themselves against the infection,” the official said. The government is also planning to induct the senior doctors in their online consultation app, as per the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mohalla-clinics-short-of-hands-as-staffers-test-positive-or-stay-away-over-covid-fears/story-Nf3vdoIuUfMX0eoRtRP2dP.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid positivity rate dips below 5%, first time since October 6||Delhi on Thursday conducted over 75,000 tests for Covid-19, and reported 3,734 new cases of the virus. This brought the daily positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – to below 5% for the first time since October 6, when a positivity rate of 4.9% had been recorded. The city on Thursday also reported 82 more deaths, taking the total toll of the infection to 9,424, as per Thursday’s bulletin. Delhi’s positivity rate stood at 4.96% on Thursday, which is the lowest in 204 days — when the same positivity rate was reported on May 13. Experts state that the spread of the infection has been controlled when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for at least two weeks. Since the government started sharing daily testing data, Delhi has never seen a positivity rate of less than 5% for a period of two weeks. The positivity rate had remained between 5% and 6% for 17 days consecutively from September-end to mid-October. The numbers had started going up again leading to the “third wave” of cases in November. At its peak, the positivity rate in Delhi stood at 15.3% on November 15 during the current surge in cases. The highest ever positivity rate was almost 37% recorded on June 13, during the first surge of cases in the city. “Positivity declined to 5% today from 15.26% on Nov 7. Highest total tests 78949 and highest RTPCR test 36370 ever with lowest RTPCR positivity of 8.99%. Steadily corona cases and positivity coming down. Hope this will continue. Please observe all precautions,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had tweeted on Wednesday. Experts believe that the surge in cases seen in November was due to the festive season and the number of cases and positivity rate are likely to continue declining. “People were out, markets were flooded, and precautions were not being followed during the festive season due to which there had been an increase in the number of cases. Now, even though there is traffic on the road, get togethers are not happening and hence the transmission has gone down. And, now with so many people having been exposed to the infection, it is likely that Delhi will not have huge surge in cases. There would be fewer cases in those who have still not been exposed to the infection,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-covid-positivity-rate-dips-below-5-first-time-since-october-6/story-Bnuk9YPDApuD5mcASa05kJ.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||No night curfew in city, Delhi govt informs high court||The Delhi government on Thursday informed the Delhi high court that it would not impose a night curfew in the capital city -- as a whole or in parts -- and said it arrived at the decision after surveying the present Covid-19 situation. The court, on its part, asked the government to ramp up testing and contact tracing of Covid-19 patients.On the last date of hearing (November 26), the court had asked the government to review whether it wanted to impose a night curfew. The Delhi government counsel had replied that his government is actively considering such a measure.On Thursday, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sandeep Sethi and additional standing counsel of the Delhi government advocate Satyakam told a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad that after assessing the situation, the government said such a curfew was not called for. “The Delhi government has taken a considered view, after assessing the situation of Delhi, not to impose night curfew in Delhi or some parts of Delhi as of now,” the government said in a status report. A status quo will be maintained till December 31 or further with regard to restricted/permitted activities, the government said.The court was hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking an increase in the Covid-19 testing and speedier results. In response to another query, posed by the court on November 26, the government said the money collected as fines for not maintaining social distancing or not wearing masks will be deposited with the treasury, and that will not be directly used for any specific expenditure (Covid related) by the local administration or the government.“All Covid-19 related expenditures are being met by departments concerned out of the allocated funds,” the status report said.The government on Thursday said it has collected ₹17.93 crore in fines (till November 30) with the Delhi Police’s collection reaching ₹27 crores (till November 30).The court was told that the government, on November 28, had restricted 50% of the staff (below grade 1) for non-essential services, at government departments, corporations, public sector undertakings and local bodies from being physically present in offices. .“Private establishments have also been advised to stagger the office timings and to reduce the number of employees attending office,” the counsel said. The court sought to know whether the order was actually being implemented. “It is unclear from the status report as to how much impact this order would actually have on a real time basis as it does not cover central government employees and is only recommendatory in nature qua private establishments,” it said.The bench said testing and tracing are the only ways to contain the virus while observing that the number has come down of late. “So please focus on those aspects,” it added.The court also said the government has to ensure that people who are in home isolation stay indoors. It also said that the turnaround time for test reports is still 48 hours and patients are not receiving messages on their phones even after the court’s directions. The court asked the government to file a status report with updated information and posted the next hearing to December 14..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-night-curfew-in-city-delhi-govt-informs-high-court/story-V52rwFW3WimbvRHFyAmpmI.html
04-12-2020||Gurugram||Exam council asks states to allow schools to reopen ahead of boards||The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations, on Thursday said that it had requested chief ministers to allow its affiliated schools to reopen partially from January, specifically for students of classes 10 and 12 who will be appearing for these exams. Gerry Arathoon, chief executive of CISCE, said that most schools affiliated to it had continued teaching students in an online, offline or blended manner. “For the final run-up to the examinations, CISCE has requested the chief ministers of all state governments and UTs to allow schools to reopen partially, specifically for the students of classes 10 and 12 from January 4, 2021. With the students physically attending school, this time will be utilised for practical work, project work, SUPW work and for doubt clearing lessons. This will be extremely beneficial to the students who will now get the time to interact directly with their teachers,” said Arathoon in a statement released on Thursday. Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15 for academic guidance lessons. In Haryana, the state government had initiated regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. However, schools were closed once again as Covid-19 cases among school students started to spike, after the resumption of physical classroom sessions from November 2. Arathoon said that if allowed to reopen, schools will be asked to follow the directives of the state government regarding Covid-19 and to conform to the safety guidelines and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the health department to prevent the spread of coronavirus. District education officer Indu Boken said that both private and government schools in the state were closed at least till December 10 and further orders from the government were awaited. “Schools will remain closed till December 10. We will wait for the government to issue further directions on reopening,” said Boken. ICSE schools in the city said that practical work was a crucial component of the course and needed to be completed in schools. Schools said that they would seek the consent of parents if and when the state government gives a go-ahead. Sudha Goyal, principal of Scottish High International School, which offers ICSE among other curricula, said that while the school had been conducting practical sessions via zoom, students had not performed the experiments on their own till now due to Covid-19 concerns and school closure. “So far, our lab assistants or teachers have been visiting the school and conducting the experiments. The activity is streamed through Zoom for students at home. On their own, students are yet to conduct practical activities. For students in board classes, practical activities are crucial,” said Goyal. Before the Haryana government ordered the closure of schools in November, only a few students with appointments and parental consent had been visiting the school for doubt-clearing sessions. She said that if the government were to allow students to visit school, the school will be able to conduct practical sessions for students in class 10 and 12 with physical distancing norms in place. “The school is being sanitized on a daily basis. It’s a very safe space. Whenever the government reopens schools, we will reach out to parents and seek consent. If the parents don’t allow children, we will not force them,” said Goyal. An official from The Shri Ram School, another ICSE school in the city, said that the school would await directions from the state government before taking any call regarding the conduct of practical sessions in schools. “We will abide by the instructions of the government. Currently, schools have been asked to remain shut till December 10. If and when they allow, we will assess the situation before making any decision,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cisce-for-reopening-of-schools-in-january/story-p1LFi3kTXYFTNDAcgNv2wM.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 shadow over Delhi municipal budgets||Besides a massive financial crunch, the municipal corporations of Delhi are also facing an unprecedented administrative crisis this year because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The commissioners of all three corporations have been infected by the viral disease and officials are worried that their deputies will have to present the budget proposals for 2021-2022.The budget is important for the civic bodies this year as all of them are going through a crippling financial crisis so much so that North Delhi Municipal Corporation and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) have not been able to pay salaries to their staff for several months, triggering protests. In order to boost revenues, the municipalities may introduce new taxes such as betterment tax, professional tax, education cess along with proposals of hiking the property taxes. Officials in North DMC and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said most likely additional commissioners will present the budget this year. The commissioner of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) Dilraj Kaur was also infected but officials are hoping that she gets well and join office in a couple of days to present the annual budget.The budget for SDMC and North DMC are to be presented on December 7 and December 8 respectively while EDMC budget will be tabled on December 9.According to civic officials, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti, who also holds the additional charge of the north corporation, is infected with Covid-19 and is unlikely to present the budget in any of the two civic bodies this time. The north civic body is yet to get a new commissioner after Varsha Joshi was transferred in May this year. “The SDMC commissioner is handling the additional charge of the north corporation, and late last month he had tested Covid-19 positive. It will take some time for him to join the office so he is unlikely to present budget proposals in north and south civic bodies. This is an unprecedented situation that due to Covid this year’s budget will be presented by additional commissioners. This will be happening for the first time in recent past,” a senior official of the north corporation, who wished not to be named, said.EDMC officials said, “The EDMC commissioner had turned Covid-19 positive early last month. Though the commissioner is still recovering, she might join just before the budget day. In her absence, the additional commissioner will have to present the budget proposals,” a senior EDMC official said.According to civic officials, due to senior officers down with Covid-19, there were difficulties in preparing the budget. “Budget preparation begins two-three months in advance. Since the top officials were down with Covid-19, either meetings were delayed or conducted through video conferencing, which took time. Still, there are a few proposals on which commissioner’s nod is required. We are relying on virtual meetings,” said officials from east and north corporations.Senior civic officials said the budget for municipalities is prepared by the finance department and then approved by the commissioner, who presents it in the House. The proposals then are tabled for discussion among the elected representatives. Leader of the elected House, leader of the opposition and the mayor of the civic body present their views on the budget tabled by the commissioner and also have the power to make amends.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor SDMC, said, “It is unfortunate that the commissioner is unwell and is unlikely to present the budget this year. I pray for his speedy recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-shadow-over-delhi-municipal-budgets/story-Ds6CEM6CTcrQKm0a83U24L.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP lock horns over milk booth, fruit shops at public parks||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday protested against a proposal of the south Delhi municipal corporation (SDMC) that aimed at allowing milk booths and fruit shops at several parks across the city.While the AAP is at the helm of the government in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules the three municipal corporations.“The BJP-ruled SDMC has come up with a plan to open milk and fruit shops at the parks of Delhi. The AAP believes that the intention behind this is to loot people through land grabbing and, therefore, we oppose this proposal. Delhi has enough milk booths and vegetable or fruit shops across the city. The BJP-ruled MCD has realised that their time is getting over, therefore, they are trying to allot land to their supporters. The BJP-ruled MCD does not pay a penny for the maintenance of these parks,” said AAP’s spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.The BJP denied the allegations and hit back saying the AAP was making “frivolous” claims.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Saurabh Bhardwaj’s allegations on the proposal of small stalls in SDMC parks is frivolous. The proposal is related to small stalls in parks that will be operated only during park opening hours in mornings and evenings. It is a preliminary proposal which needs to be further deliberated on before a final decision is taken. At this stage, the proposal does not cover all parks but just one sample park in each of Delhi’s 272 municipal wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-bjp-lock-horns-over-milk-booth-fruit-shops-at-public-parks/story-NHP5DTZVrloAZjSlcm8kgN.html
04-12-2020||Delhi||N-E Delhi riots: HC orders shifting Tanha to Lajpat Nagar guest house for exams||The Delhi High Court Thursday directed Tihar jail authorities to “forthwith” take Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha — arrested in connection to the conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots — to a guest house in Lajpat Nagar in order to enable him to study and appear for his BA (Persian) examinations that begin from Friday.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri also asked the jail superintendent to permit the accused to take study material with him and provide him with other teaching material, if required. The court asked the authorities to take Tanha to the guest house as suggested by the police and agreed to by his counsel.The court said it would be the responsibility of the jail superintendent that from the guest house, the accused is taken to the examination centre at JMI university at 8:30am on December 4, 5 and 7 and brought back.Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was arrested in connection with the violence in Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.The court also allowed Tanha to make a phone call to his counsel for 10 minutes once a day during his stay at the guest house.Earlier, on November 26, a city court had granted him three-day custody parole to appear in compartment/ supplementary exams of BA Persian (Hons). However, not satisfied with this on the grounds that his entire day will be wasted and he will not be able to study, Tanha, through his counsel Showhanya Shankaran, moved the high court seeking interim bail.On Wednesday, ASG Raju had opposed the interim bail plea stating that no such relief ought to be granted to Tanha and suggested that he can be permitted to stay in a guest house, under judicial custody till his exams get over on December 7.The state, also represented through advocate Amit Mahajan, suggested four places which will be guarded by security officials and the petitioner’s counsel accepted the guest house at Lajpat Nagar.Tanha’s counsel told the court that they are ready to give an undertaking to surrender immediately after the exams and that he would not seek the benefit of full court’s Covid-19 orders in which interim bails were granted to prisoners and regularly extended.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February killing 53 people and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/n-e-delhi-riots-hc-orders-shifting-tanha-to-lajpat-nagar-guest-house-for-exams/story-vGutbvoQhVCkDGdBxOfyII.html
04-12-2020||City||Mohali murder: Police identify three suspects||Probing into the murder of a 35-year-old man, who was stabbed to death, following a scuffle at the Phase 6 market on November 29, police have identified three prime suspects.According to police, the victim, Kuljinder Singh Dhillon, a resident of Balongi, ran an illegal liquor business in Sector 56, Chandigarh. The suspects used to purchase liquor from him. On November 29, the suspects came on three bikes with the intention of robbing Dhillon. When one of them tried to stab him in the shoulder during a scuffle, the knife accidentally hit his stomach. After the attack, Dhillon was rushed to the civil hospital by an auto driver. Later, a case of murder was registered on the statement of the victim’s wife, Nisha, at the Phase 1 police station. DSP (city 1) Gursher Singh Sandhu said, “We have identified the suspects involved in the murder and their names will be revealed soon.” Efforts are on to arrest them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/phase-6-murder-police-identify-three-suspects/story-fikEPBmcZxGRr1msOpHu9K.html
04-12-2020||World||Pak rejects India’s assertion of pressurising Kulbhushan Jadhav’s lawyer||Pakistan has rejected as “incorrect and misleading” India’s assertion that its security establishment was putting pressure on a Pakistani lawyer engaged by the Indian High Commission to represent death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav during a court hearing.On Thursday, external Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan was linking up the Jadhav case with an unrelated case of another Indian prisoner, who had served his sentence but is still in Pakistan.“Pakistan is trying to link the case of Kulbhuashan Jadhav with another prisoner’s case. In routine consular practice, Shahnawaz Noon [the Pakistani lawyer] was selected by our High Commission to appear in the case for release and repatriation of an Indian prisoner, Mohammad Ismail, who has completed his sentence but continues to be in jail in Pakistan,” Srivastava said at a weekly briefing.“However, during the proceedings of the case regarding Ismail, Pakistan Attorney General raised the matter pertaining to Jadhav though the two cases are not connected in any way, and Noon is reported to have made those statements about our Charge d’Affaires which are not true, and they are in contravention of our stand in this case,” he added.Srivastava said Noon did this under pressure and has misrepresented the position of the High Commission.But in a statement issued on Friday, the Pakistan Foreign Office said that, by casting aspersions on the Indian High Commission’s own legal counsel, the Indian government “is looking for an escape from the legal proceedings” the Jadhav case.“The government of India is reminded that in pursuance of the judgment of International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan had invited the Indian High Commission to meet with Commander Jadhav and appoint a lawyer on his behalf so that proceedings to review and reconsider Commander Jadhav’s conviction could commence. “However, during the course of diplomatic exchanges, the Indian High Commission refused to instruct a lawyer itself, as in their view this would amount to a waiver of India’s sovereign immunity. Resultantly, the government of Pakistan was constrained to initiate proceedings for appointment of a state counsel for Commander Jadhav,” the statement said.It added: “During the course of the proceedings, to show the discrepancy in the Indian position,the Attorney-General for Pakistan cited the case of Mr Muhammad Ismail, an Indian national currently in custody in Pakistan, where the Indian High Commission had instructed Mr Noon as its lawyer.”No attempt was made to link the cases of Jadhav with Indian prisoner Ismail, Pakistan said, adding that the two cases are and remain entirely distinct. “Reference to the case of Mr Ismail was only for purpose of showing the discrepancy and inconsistency in the Indian position.”The statement reiterated that in line with the judgment of the ICJ, Pakistan has already provided consular access to the Indian High Commission twice and has taken all necessary steps for effective review and reconsideration in the case.The offer of a third consular access is still there.“The Indian side is once again urged to desist from the use of its usual diversionary and dilatory tactics and instead take practical steps so that legal proceedings could be duly concluded and full effect could be given to the judgment of ICJ,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-rejects-india-s-assertion-of-pressurising-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-lawyer/story-LS3fjpTsMlXo5Nt7NkEmIN.html

Gates said his charitable foundation was now using the couple’s experience to check the spread of Covid-19.Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who heads the South African government’s advisory team on Covid-19, has served on the Gates Foundation Scientific Advisory Board for 10 years. He also chairs the WHO Scientific Committee on HIV. “Drawing on their experiences from HIV and TB (tuberculosis), they are helping guide the Covid-19 response in South Africa and around the world,” Gates said. The Microsoft founder said the motto at Caprisa has impressed him. The motto is ‘Each day that you come to work, you should be looking for how today is going to be better than yesterday.’ Salim said one in every fifth person infected with HIV in the world is South African and that statistic motivated him and his wife to take up the mantle against HIV. “Very early on, we both realised that we could pioneer and find new ways to treat and prevent HIV. We’ve now been able to manufacture these broadly neutralising antibodies. “We will be injecting it into young women to test whether it’s safe and then we want to see if it does prevent HIV. If it can, it will change the course of the HIV epidemic in Africa,” he said. Quarraisha said she had learnt that epidemiology, a science, also has a social justice component to it. “Women bear about four times more infection compared to men. Our work as scientists is to try to find technologies that women can use to prevent HIV infection, especially those women who are unable to negotiate the traditional safer sex practices,” she said. “We’ve managed to reduce transmission, but there are still close to a million women dying of AIDS. That shouldn’t be happening,” said Salim, who in May this year was forced to take to social media to dismiss as fake news that he had received a grant of 944 million Rand in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “Because I am an adviser to the Gates Foundation, I do not have grant funding from Gates. Please convey the truth to help stop this fake news,” the professor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-hails-indian-origin-couple-for-pioneering-work-in-fight-against-hiv-covid-19/story-HvLO33jwtUByycGQVeCDuI.html

How to stimulate the economy and yet at the same time reduce our budget deficit? The only way we can have the fiscal space to maintain and revive growth is through access to additional liquidity,” the Pakistan prime minister said.Khan told his audience that rich countries have injected $13 trillion as fiscal stimulus to revive their economies but the developing countries did not have that much resources. Pakistan, he said, is also committed under an IMF programme to reduce the budget deficit.The Pakistan PM talked at length on the dangers developing countries faced and said that the effects of economies collapsing could be catastrophic. He also shared the losses the Pakistan economy has faced owing to the Covid pandemic.The Pakistan PM said that his government’s strategy had worked for the first wave as they had imposed smart lockdowns. Owing to this, the daily wagers had not suffered unnecessarily. At the same time the Pakistan PM warned that the second wave had started to paralyse life in parts of Pakistan.“Our efforts were aimed at ensuring that not only do we save people from the virus, but also prevent them from dying from hunger. We provided a relief package of around $8 billion – which was almost 3% of our GDP – to support the poor and to keep the economy afloat at the same time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-un-covid-meet-cash-strapped-pak-pm-seeks-debt-relief/story-7qli1NeooyE44dGxXbb21N.html
04-12-2020||World||EU police agency Europol warns of fake coronavirus vaccines||European Union police agency Europol issued a warning Friday highlighting the risk of organized crime scams linked to Covid-19 vaccines, including the possibility criminals will try to sell dangerous counterfeit vaccines or to hijack shipments of genuine shots.In an “early warning notification,” Europol said that crime gangs already have reacted to opportunities presented by the coronavirus pandemic.“Once a legitimate vaccine enters the market, counterfeited versions of the specific vaccine brand are expected to circulate rapidly,” the agency’s warning said, citing a phony flu vaccine that the World Health Organization discovered in Mexico in October.“Similar to the fake influenza vaccine encountered in Mexico, counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines may represent a significant public health threat if they are ineffective at best or toxic at worst, given their production in underground labs without hygiene standards,” Europol said. “Fake vaccines may even have a wider-reaching impact if new outbreaks emerge in communities assumed to be vaccinated.”The warning urged heightened vigilance by the EU’s 27 member nations and other countries to “the possible involvement of criminals in the vaccine development and distribution process.”Europol said the “expected arrival of a genuine Covid-19 vaccine has already inspired criminal activities and will likely be exacerbated once vaccines become available.”The statement came after Britain gave emergency approval Wednesday to a vaccine produced by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech, making Britain the first Western country to authorize a vaccine against the coronavirus.Europol, which is based in The Hague, said it was aware of criminals placing advertisements on dark web marketplaces “using the brands of genuine pharmaceutical companies that are already in the final stages of testing.”The police agency said criminal networks also could target the supply chain for genuine vaccines, such as by illegally refilling empty vials if they are not correctly disposed of or hijacking vehicles transporting shots.It urged EU members to share with Europol “any relevant information on criminal activities related to Covid-19 or flu vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-police-agency-europol-warns-of-fake-coronavirus-vaccines/story-tM6RWfMV8PqOvGoxDOYRcM.html
04-12-2020||World||First US delivery of Covid-19 vaccine will leave out many high-risk workers||The US government’s first shipment of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses to be divided among states and federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, will fall far short of protecting high priority groups such as healthcare workers, a Reuters analysis has found.Across the country, state health departments are preparing local hospitals for the first shipments of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine if the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes it, possibly as early as mid-December. The first shipment is expected to cover inoculations of 3.2 million people, nowhere near enough for the 21 million US healthcare workers. And government officials said initial shipments would also go to five government agencies including the Departments of Defense, State and the Veterans Health Administration.The subsequent two weekly vaccine distributions could cover 7 to 10 million people a week, provided a second vaccine - from Moderna Inc - is authorized early in the second half of December, and Pfizer meets its distribution estimates, according to data provided by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the companies. Federal officials have not disclosed exactly how many doses will be in later shipments. “For the time being, and the foreseeable future, the demand for vaccines is going to exceed the supply by a lot, even for the highest priority groups that are identified,” said Josh Michaud, Kaiser’s associate director of global health policy. States have the final word on how to distribute vaccines to their citizens, but federal officials have said that of some 330 million US residents, healthcare workers and those in nursing homes should be considered first for vaccines. Many states told Reuters that was their plan. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not respond to a request to comment. The Pentagon declined comment. HHS cited public comments from a Tuesday press call, in which officials said the first dose allocation will be the start of a steady stream of vaccine deliveries.SOME BETTER PROTECTED THAN OTHERS With early supplies limited, the federal government is allocating doses based on state populations, rather than the proportion of the populations at high risk. That means some states’ health workers will be better protected than others.Alabama for instance, will receive enough vaccine for around 17% of its healthcare workers, while Illinois could cover only 13%, according to data from state officials.The approach would initially leave out around 190,000 healthcare workers in Alabama and more than 570,000 in Illinois, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data on healthcare workers by state. More than 2 million healthcare workers in California will have to wait as early vaccine supplies are doled out, based on figures provided to Reuters by state officials. This first stage of the rollout illustrates the complexity of the government’s goal to vaccinate most Americans by mid-2021 to stall a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 273,000 US lives, with hundreds of thousands more deaths projected in the next few months.US officials maintain they will distribute 40 million doses by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people - with millions of shots shipping every week, assuming speedy approvals of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, told Reuters the United States will receive about half of the 50 million doses it will produce in 2020. Moderna’s vaccine could add at least another 12.5 million doses, federal officials have said.The CDC expects about 5 million to 10 million doses to be shipped per week in the first weeks of the US vaccine distribution effort.STATES PLAN FOR SHORTFALLStates meanwhile are preparing for the first distribution to fall short, as hospitals across the country grapple with record numbers of Covid-19 patients and staffing shortages. “Clinical staff are becoming infected, nurses and doctors. It’s creating a workforce crunch and the beds are filling up,” said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association, an advocacy group for rural hospitals. Arkansas’s state epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha said vaccines are urgently needed to keep up with the surge in patients. “We want to ensure our hospital capacity as much as possible through vaccination for those healthcare workers who are at highest risk for infection,” she said. More than half a dozen states including Alabama, California, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, told Reuters the first allocation estimates they have been given would not be near enough to cover all their healthcare workers, let alone other high-priority residents. The size of initial allocation figures shared with Reuters ranges widely, from around 330,000 in California - the most populous US state - to less than 7,000 in North Dakota, which has 50,000 healthcare workers, according to Kaiser data and figures provided to Reuters by state officials.That means both states can vaccinate less than 20% of their healthcare workforce with the first shots. New York state will receive 170,000 shots initially, enough for roughly 13% of its healthcare workers.The US government expects the number of available doses to increase in January to about 60 million to 70 million.It has made deals for 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for $1.95 billion and 100 million of Moderna’s for $1.5 billion, with options to buy more. It expects vaccines to be free to most Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-us-delivery-of-covid-19-vaccine-will-leave-out-many-high-risk-workers/story-xe2JRVSRbVMMLzV1weD2SK.html
04-12-2020||World||Covid-19: What side effects to expect from a vaccine shot? Will it be more painful than flu vaccine?||Researchers usually take years to develop a vaccine as they collate data over a period of time to ensure that there are no harmful side effects after taking the shot. However, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) turned into a pandemic within weeks and claimed thousands of lives, prompting scientists to develop a vaccine within record time. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already ordered mass immunisation against Covid-19 with Sputnik V vaccine to control the surge in virus-related deaths. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has also approved a Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, for emergency use. The government is expected to roll out the vaccine next week.US biotech firms Pfizer and Moderna have submitted applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorisation as the United States continues to witness huge spike the Covid-19 cases and related deaths. Both companies have used new mRNA technology to develop the vaccines and have reported efficacy rate of around 95 per cent.Also Read | At 1,600 mn, India biggest buyer of Covid-19 vaccine doses: ReportWhat side effects to expect from a Covid-19 vaccine shot?While the companies have said that the vaccines are safe, many people still remain concerned about their side effects. The Data Monitoring Committee for the study of phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s vaccine has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. It reported some cases of fatigue and headache after the volunteers received the second dose of the vaccine.“The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2,” Pfizer said in a statement.Moderna has also reported that the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The first dose of the vaccine caused injection site pain in some of the volunteers and the second dose caused fatigue, pain, and redness at the injection site. The company said that these solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US’ top infectious disease expert, on Monday told Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg that the vaccine induces response and some people may feel an ache in the arm or get a fever. Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that “almost all of this goes away within 24 or at the most, 48 hours.”“In some people, they don’t feel anything. Others feel an ache in the arm. Some may feel an ache in the arm and kind of a little chilly feeling, almost like you have a flu-like syndrome, and in a minority of people, they get a fever,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-side-effects-to-expect-from-a-vaccine-shot-will-it-be-more-painful-than-flu-vaccine/story-LddqC1531aJrM4tj0i0lIK.html

The capsule is to be released 220,000 kilometers (136,700 miles) away in space and land in a remote, sparsely populated area of Woomera, Australia, on Sunday.Hayabusa2 is flying smoothly according to plan, Yuichi Tsuda, project manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, said at a briefing ahead of the critical separation of the capsule from the spacecraft on Saturday.“We trained ourselves and now we are fully prepared. So I’m just praying that equipment that hasn’t been used yet will work well and that there will be good weather in Australia,” he said. “We are so excited.”In the early hours of Sunday, the capsule, protected by a heat shield, will briefly turn into a fireball as it reenters the atmosphere 120 kilometers (75 miles) above Earth. At about 10 kilometers (6 miles) above ground, a parachute will open to slow its fall and beacon signals will be transmitted to indicate its location.JAXA staff have set up satellite dishes at several locations in the target area to receive the signals, while also preparing marine radar, drones and helicopters to assist in the search and retrieval of the pan-shaped capsule, 40 centimeters (15 inches) in diameter.Scientists say they believe the samples, especially ones taken from under the asteroid’s surface, contain valuable data unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. They are particularly interested in analyzing organic materials in the samples.JAXA hopes to find clues to how the materials are distributed in the solar system and are related to life on Earth.For Hayabusa2, it’s not the end of the mission it started in 2014. After dropping the capsule, it will return to space and head to another distant small asteroid called 1998KY26 on a journey slated to take 10 years one way.So far, its mission has been fully successful. It touched down twice on Ryugu, despite its extremely rocky surface, and successfully collected data and samples during the 1½ years it spent near Ryugu after arriving there in June 2018.In its first touchdown in February 2019, it collected surface dust samples. In a more challenging mission in July that year, it collected underground samples from the asteroid for the first time in space history after landing in a crater that it created earlier by blasting the asteroid’s surface.Asteroids, which orbit the sun but are much smaller than planets, are among the oldest objects in the solar system and therefore may help explain how Earth evolved.Ryugu in Japanese means “Dragon Palace,” the name of a sea-bottom castle in a Japanese folk tale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-spacecraft-approaches-earth-to-drop-asteroid-samples/story-hszmHt7bzoI6h38DfJF5oI.html
04-12-2020||World||Lebanon’s Hezbollah suing those accusing it of Beirut port blast||Lebanon’s Hezbollah said Friday it is suing a former Christian lawmaker and a website affiliated with a Christian political party for defamation, after they accused the Shiite militant group of being responsible for the devastating explosion at Beirut’s port this summer.Hezbollah’s legal representative Ibrahim Mussawi said the accusations, leveled by Fares Souaid and the website of the right-wing Lebanese Forces party, were misleading.Mussawi, also a Hezbollah lawmaker, told a press conference outside the courts house that blaming the group threatens to disrupt social peace in Lebanon, at a time when the United States is exerting maximum pressure on his party and its allies. Washington considers Hezbollah a terrorist group and has been escalating sanctions against it and its political allies in Lebanon.The massive Aug. 4 blast was caused by nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrates, a fertilizer that was improperly stored at a port warehouse for six years. The blast killed more than 200 people and wounded over 6,000, and extensively damaged several neighborhoods in Beirut.Some of Hezbollah’s political opponents and civilians have since blamed the group for storing the explosive chemicals at the port. Hezbollah is the only group that kept its weapons after Lebanon’s civil war ended in 1990 and is believed to have ammunition warehouses around the country.The claim was dismissed by Hezbollah’s leader. No evidence has emerged to link the group to the explosive chemicals.But four months after the explosion, an investigation has yet to provide an explanation for what happened — or hold any senior official responsible. Families of the victims have asked for an international probe, in a country where violent attacks and assassinations are rarely brought to justice.Lebanon’s port authority, security agencies and political leadership were all aware of the stored explosive chemicals at the port, documents have shown. The port is one of the country’s facilities where rampant corruption has been reported.“When the US administration’s main concern and daily bread is to go after Hezbollah and attempt to pressure governments to put it on the terrorism list ... you’d gather that there are tools inside and outside that help with that,” Mussawi said.There was no immediate comment from Souaid or the Lebanese Forces party.Mussawi said he also plans to press charges against Bahaa Hariri, the son of late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who is living in exile. He is also the estranged brother of Prime-Minister designate Saad Hariri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-s-hezbollah-suing-those-accusing-it-of-beirut-port-blast/story-Jk7LqYUNBHnxYNyrdP75uK.html

Colorado-based Lunar Outpost has been awarded a contract to collect lunar rocks following the arrival of a lander to the moon’s south pole in 2023. The company said in a statement that the contract is symbolic of a new incentive that will “exponentially increase the potential of future missions.”The three other companies that won the bid to collect space resources and transfer ownership to NASA include Masten Space Systems of Mojave, ispace Europe of Luxembourg, and ispace Japan of Tokyo. The new contracts will cost $25,001 to the space agency. NASA said that the companies will receive 10% of their total proposed price upon award, 10% upon launch, and the remaining 80% upon successful completion.“The objective is twofold: There is important policy and precedent that’s being set, both relative to the utilisation of space resources, and the expansion of the public and private partnerships beyond Earth orbit to the moon,” NASA acting associate administrator Mike Gold told a news conference on Thursday.Also Read | China spacecraft collects moon samples to bring back to EarthThe firms will collect a small amount of lunar regolith, between 50g and 500g in weight, and provide imagery of the collection to NASA.

04-12-2020||World||First Rohingya refugees arrive at isolated Bangladesh island||Authorities in Bangladesh on Friday sent the first group of more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees to an isolated island despite calls by human rights groups for a halt to the process.The 1,642 refugees boarded seven Bangladeshi naval vessels in the port of Chittagong for the trip to Bhashan Char, according to an official who could not be named in accordance with local practice.After about a three-hour trip they arrived at the island, which was once regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.Located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland, the island surfaced only 20 years ago and was never inhabited.Saleh Noman, a Bangladeshi journalist who traveled with the refugees, said by phone from the island that the refugees were given rice, eggs, and chickens for lunch after their body temperatures were measured by health workers as a coronavirus precaution.Before they boarded the ships they were also given face masks to protect against Covid-19.The United Nations(UN) has voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate to the island in the Bay of Bengal.The island’s facilities are built to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district.On Thursday, 11 passenger buses carrying the refugees left Cox’s Bazar on the way to the island. They camped overnight in school buildings in the southeastern city of Chittagong.Authorities in Cox’s Bazar did not say how the refugees were selected for relocation.About 700,000 Rohingya fled to the camps in Cox’s Bazar after August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim group following an attack by insurgents. The crackdown included rapes, killings, and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the UN.Foreign media have not been permitted to visit the island.Contractors say its infrastructure is like a modern township, with multifamily concrete homes, schools, playgrounds and roads. It also has solar-power facilities, a water supply system, and cyclone shelters.International aid agencies and the UN have vehemently opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The UN said in a statement Wednesday that it has not been involved in preparations for the relocation or the selection of refugees and has limited information about the overall plan.“The United Nations takes this opportunity to highlight its longstanding position that Rohingya refugees must be able to make a free and informed decision about relocating to Bhasan Char based upon relevant, accurate and updated information,” it said.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on Thursday urged the government to cancel the relocation plan.The current refugee camps near the town of Cox’s Bazar are overcrowded and unhygienic. Disease and organized crime are rampant. Education is limited and refugees are not allowed to work.Still, most Rohingya are unwilling to return to Myanmar due to safety concerns. Government officials didn’t have an estimate of how many refugees would be willing to be relocated to the island.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly told the UN and other international partners that her administration would consult them before making a final decision on the relocation, and that no refugees would be forced to move.Bangladesh attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral framework last November, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other forms of state-sanctioned discrimination.A UN-sponsored investigation in 2018 recommended the prosecution of Myanmar’s top military commanders on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for the violence against the Rohingya.Myanmar is defending itself in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, after the West African nation of Gambia brought a case backed by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Canada, and the Netherlands over the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-rohingya-refugees-arrive-at-isolated-bangladesh-island/story-V4KpRBWzUZJXzyjLTi8HqJ.html
04-12-2020||World||UK PM sets ‘ambitious’ new emissions cut target for 2030||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday announced an “ambitious” new target to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030 compared to the levels in 1990. This is the first target set by the UK following its exit from the European Union (EU) and Johnson said it demonstrated Britain’s leadership in tackling climate change, having already cut carbon emissions more than any similar developed country and being the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050. The UK claims its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement is now among the highest in the world and commits the country to cutting emissions at the fastest rate of any major economy so far. “We have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process – uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change,” said Johnson. “Today, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030, faster than any major economy, with our Ten Point Plan helping us on our path to reach it. But this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders as part of next week’s Climate Ambition Summit to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets,” he said. As the co-host of the virtual summit on December 12, Johnson had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call last week to participate in the event, which will coincide with the fifth anniversary of the historic Paris Agreement. The summit calls on countries around the world to submit ambitious NDCs or other climate plans on the road to the UN COP26 climate talks, which the UK government is hosting in Glasgow next year. “Tackling climate change is the one of the most urgent shared endeavours of our lifetimes, demanding bold action from every nation to prevent catastrophic global warming,” said Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary and President of COP26. “The UK’s new emissions target is among the highest in the world and reflects the urgency and scale of the challenge our planet faces. I hope other countries join us and raise the bar at next week’s UN Climate Ambition Summit, and ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next year,” he said. Each party to the Paris Agreement – including countries and international blocs such as the EU – determines what domestic action it will take and communicates it in the form of NDCs. They are at the heart of the Paris Agreement goal, set at COP21 UN summit in 2015, to hold the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees and pursue best efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Many countries have now made net zero commitments and this round of NDCs, which set a 2030 emission reduction target, will need to be consistent with those longer term commitments. Downing Street said the latest announcement achieves that and reflects the independent Climate Change Committee’s advice on net zero. The UK government says its path to meeting this latest target is backed by the PM’s “Ten Point Plan” set out earlier for a so-called green revolution, which is aimed at creating and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs by 2030. The plan sets out ambitious policies and investment, with a stated potential to deliver over GBP 40 billion of private investment by 2030. The UK’s previous NDC target was 53 per cent and it says it will now communicate its full NDC to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in time for the Climate Ambition Summit next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-sets-ambitious-new-emissions-cut-target-for-2030/story-9RINrmNBjqcNsubbRms3lI.html

On the campaign trail, Trump warned that Biden would go easy on China, although the president-elect agrees that China is not abiding by international trade rules, is giving unfair subsidies to Chinese companies and stealing American innovation.The Trump administration, which once boasted of warm relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, also has been ramping up sanctions against China over Taiwan, Tibet, trade, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. It has moved against the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and sought restrictions on Chinese social media applications like TikTok and WeChat.Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who has been accused of politicizing the position, has been the nation’s top intelligence official since May. In his op-ed, he did not directly address the transition to a Biden administration. Trump has not acknowledged losing the election.Ratcliffe said he has shifted money within the $85 billion annual intelligence budget to address the threat from China. Beijing is preparing for an open-ended confrontation with the US, which must be addressed, he said.“This is our once-in-a-generation challenge. Americans have always risen to the moment, from defeating the scourge of fascism to bringing down the Iron Curtain,” Ratcliffe wrote in what appeared to be call for action to future intelligence officials.Biden has announced that he wants the Senate to confirm Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, to succeed Ratcliffe as the next national intelligence director.“This generation will be judged by its response to China’s effort to reshape the world in its own image and replace America as the dominant superpower,” Ratcliffe wrote.He cited several examples of Chinese aggression against the United States:The Justice Department has charged a rising number of US academics for transferring US taxpayer-funded intellectual property to China.He noted the theft of intellectual property from American businesses, citing the case of Sinoval, a China-based wind turbine maker, which was convicted and heavily fined for stealing trade secrets from AMSC, a US-based manufacturer formerly known as American Superconductor Inc. Rather than pay AMSC for more than $800 million in products and services it had agreed to purchase, Sinovel hatched a scheme to steal AMSC’s proprietary wind turbine technology, causing the loss of almost 700 jobs and more than $1 billion in shareholder equity, according to the Justice Department.Ratcliffe and other US officials have said that China has stolen sensitive US defense technology to fuel Xi’s aggressive military modernization plan and they allege that Beijing uses its access to Chinese tech firms, such as Huawei, to collect intelligence, disrupt communications and threaten the privacy of users worldwide.Ratcliffe said he has personally briefed members of Congress about how China is using intermediaries to lawmakers in an attempt to influence legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-top-threat-to-us-free-world-since-world-war-ii-says-outgoing-intelligence-director-ratcliffe/story-rnusAgsXCckgCjeIY764GK.html

Malaysia tries to find middle ground||Malaysia’s latest challenge from the coronavirus pandemic is to allay concern among local Muslims about vaccine shots which could contain substances forbidden by Islam.The Special Muzakarah Committee of the National Council for Malaysian Islamic Affairs met Thursday to discuss the use of the vaccine. The outcome is expected to be known next week after it is presented to the King for consent, state news agency Bernama reported Friday, citing Religious Affairs Minister Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri.Muslim religious authorities have previously exempted vaccines from the stringent halal labeling in cases when no alternative is available. Still, concerns about the shots containing items banned under Islamic law, such as porcine DNA, continue to linger in Muslim-majority nations including Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s virus hotspot.“Let’s not complicate the situation by taking a narrow jurisprudence opinion for the Muslim community,” Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, a mufti, or religious head, for the state of Perlis, said in a Facebook post after attending the Muzakarah Committee meeting. “If the jurisprudence is for the nation and the general public, it needs to be positioned toward making things easy.”‘Best Choice’Malaysia last week signed a deal with Pfizer Inc. to obtain its Covid-19 vaccine that will cover 6.4 million people, or 20% of its population, starting early next year. The country is also on the priority list to receive a vaccine from China, which has been the subject of controversy among Muslims who doubt its halal status. The community makes up 61% of the Malaysia’s population.Asri said vaccines made from halal ingredients would be the “best and primary choice.” Even vaccines produced by treating and transforming forbidden substances into clean compounds are permissible, he said.A growing cluster of infections that emerged in late September forced a partial lockdown across several states just as Malaysia’s $365 billion economy showed signs of recovering. New daily cases hit a record high of 2,188 on Nov. 24, of which more than half came from a cluster linked to the worker dormitories of Top Glove Corp., the world’s top maker of surgical gloves.New cases have stayed above the 1,100 mark on most day since, data from the health ministry show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-coronavirus-vaccines-halal-malaysia-tries-to-find-middle-ground/story-jH0WqHfukXmJfDqw8q5FdN.html

In an interview with CNN, aired on Thursday, Biden said it would be important only to demonstrate that there is a peaceful transfer of power between the competing parties by shaking hands and moving on.“No personal consequence to me but for the country,” said the Democrat, highlighting the importance of a demonstration of a peaceful transfer of power at his inauguration.Biden also raised concern about the “image” of the United States being presented to the rest of the world, saying such controversies around the transfer of power occurs in countries under a dictatorship.Also Read | Trump targets ‘hapless’ Georgia governor again, suggests ways to detect ‘voter fraud’Meanwhile, Trump has continued with his unproven claims of electoral fraud and has refused to concede defeat in the recently-concluded presidential elections. The US president has now claimed that people in Georgia were caught bringing in ballots and putting them in voting machines.“People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in “voting” machines. Great job @BrianKempGA!” tweeted Trump, as he continues to target Georgia governor for helping him over the result. The tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”. People in Georgia got caught cold bringing in massive numbers of ballots and putting them in "voting" machines. Great job @BrianKempGA!Trump had earlier asked why Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, didn’t use his “emergency powers” to overrule the decision of the secretary of state. He had also suggested officials check the number of envelopes against the number of ballots, claiming that they “may just find” more ballots than envelopes received. “Biden has received more than 81 million popular votes in the presidential elections, the highest ever in the US’ history, and is projected to win 306 electoral votes as against 232 to Trump. He has already started nominating key members of the Biden-Harris Administration as it faces immense challenges presented by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-personal-consequence-biden-on-importance-of-trump-attending-inauguration-ceremony/story-nHT0jSSpZviv9uofKJPIcP.html

And if you reject it, you would get a harsh punishment.”She is a medical physician and an educator living in Sweden. Recently, she published a book giving insight into her ordeal, including witnessing beatings.“I was feeling like I was a different person. All around me got dark. It was really difficult to accept,” Sautbay said.Another such victim is Uyghur businesswoman Zumret Dawut, who was picked up in March 2018 in Urumqi.For two months, Dawut said authorities questioned her links to Pakistan, her husband’s homeland. They questioned her as well about how many children she had, and whether or not they had studied religion and read the Quran, said Al Jazeera.She further said that once she had to beg the camp’s male officers to allow her to go to the washroom. She was allowed to go while being handcuffed and the male officers followed her into the washroom.Speaking on pork being served to the Uyghur Muslims in the camps, she said, “When you sit in a concentration camp, you do not decide whether to eat, or not to eat. To be alive, we had to eat the meat served to us.”As per the documents available to Al Jazeera, agricultural development has also become a part of what German anthropologist and Uyghur scholar, Adrian Zenz, says is a policy of “secularisation”.Citing documents and state-approved news articles, Zenz has reported that there is an “active” effort in the region to promote and expand pig farming.In 2019, Xinjiang’s top administrator, Shohrat Zakir, had said that the Xinjiang region will be turned into a “pig-raising hub”.The project is expected to occupy a 25,000-square-metre (82-square-foot) area in an industrial park in Kashgar’s Konaxahar county, renamed Shufu, according to the Chinese-language website, Sina, Al Jazeera reported.It further reported that the deal was formally signed on April 23 this year.“This is part of the attempt to completely eradicate the culture and religion of the people in Xinjiang,” Zenz told Al Jazeera.“It is part of the strategy of secularisation, of turning the Uighurs secular and indoctrinating them to follow the communist party and become agnostic or atheist,” he added.As the atrocities on the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region gain international attention, China has continued to defend its policies, claiming that the objective is to combat the “three evils of extremism, separatism and terrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uyghurs-in-re-education-camps-forced-to-eat-pork-on-fridays-as-china-pushes-to-expand-pig-farms-in-xinjiang/story-rhrWxEJZByEJz8qFYAZIZL.html

You go to Pakistan, India or any part of the world and you’ll find sculptures,” he said.“Many Islamic countries have sculptures.

04-12-2020||World||US Coronavirus expert Anthony Fauci apologises for casting doubt over UK’s approval of Pfizer vaccine||Top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologised on Thursday for casting doubt on the rigour of the British regulators who approved the Pfizer Inc vaccine against Covid-19, saying he had faith in the quality of their work.Britain announced the approval of the vaccine on Wednesday, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) saying it had rigorously assessed the vaccine data and had cut no corners.It gave the UK the jump in the race to begin mass inoculation against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy. US and European Union(EU) regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.In a CBS interview on Thursday, Fauci suggested the British regulators had failed to scrutinise the data carefully enough and had waved the vaccine through, comments that were prominently reported on the main British TV news channels.He later gave an interview to the BBC in which he said his earlier comments had come out wrong.“There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I’m sorry, and I apologise for that,” he said. “I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community in the UK,” Fauci said.“I did not mean to apply any sloppiness (to the UK regulatory process), even though it came out that way,” he added.Fauci said the point he had been trying to make was that in the US context, with widespread vaccine scepticism, it would not have been appropriate to conduct the process in the same way and at the same speed as what happened in Britain.“If we had for example approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society,” he said.“You know, at the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective, the people in the UK are going to receive it and they’re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it and we’re going to do pretty well,” Fauci said.In response to his earlier criticism, the MHRA issued a statement saying it had “rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible without compromising the thoroughness of our review”.The regulator also said its emergency approval had allowed “some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed, but it does not mean steps and the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been bypassed”.Fauci is the most high-profile member of the White House coronavirus task force and has often clashed with President Donald Trump on how to protect Americans from the virus, which has caused about 273,000 US deaths.President-elect Joe Biden said on Thursday he had asked Fauci to be the chief medical adviser on his Covid-19 team when he takes office on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-expert-anthony-fauci-apologises-for-casting-doubt-over-uk-s-approval-of-pfizer-vaccine/story-THC1rx1PtAfuDa4sm5i0yJ.html
04-12-2020||World||Even with vaccines, airport testing is here for the long haul||Even as the race to approve and distribute Covid-19 vaccines is entering its final stretch, parts of the travel industry are sprinting to a different finish line: airport testing.In hubs large and small, from JFK to Boston to Frankfurt, Germany, a variety of companies are figuring out how to scale preflight rapid and PCR Covid testing in hopes of facilitating safe air travel and lessening quarantine requirements for anyone who isn’t first in line for a shot.The leaders of that effort may come as a surprise.In the US, it’s XpressSpa, the purveyor of quickie mani-pedis and travel pillows. It’s currently operational in four major US airports, with more to come in December.In the UK, Collinson—the parent company of the Priority Pass airport lounge network—is the testing partner for London Heathrow and Virgin Atlantic, which recently began offering free tests for passengers on flights to select Caribbean destinations. This effort expanded to three additional UK airports this week. Collinson also announced a partnership in mid-November with American Airlines, British Airways, and the Oneworld airline alliance that will bring testing to select flights and hopefully lead to the creation of an “air bridge.”In other words: Momentum is building.“We went from concept to pilot in 75 days,” says XpressSpa Chief Executive Officer Doug Satzman of the effort’s early days; the company’s first Covid-19 testing facility opened at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in June. But expanding has been slow work. “Operating in airports is a difficult, highly complex, highly regulated environment—just getting an electrician in to fix something in your store is kind of a pain,” Satzman explains.“It’s been a tiring journey, I won’t deny it,” says David Evans, co-CEO of Collinson, whose company got into the testing game due to its knowledge of airport operations and its history as a purveyor of travel insurance. While its Heathrow effort has grown from testing 25,000 passengers per day to testing more than 1 million, some challenges to scaling up are hard to overcome.Difficulties have little to do with square footage or money. Creating airport testing sites, Evans says, is a low-cost proposition that can fill any empty or under-utilized space, of which there are many in airports today. It’s the lack of coordinated policy around testing requirements that has thwarted any type of global (or even country-wide) expansion.“If they rolled out a national testing mandate for air travel, we’d be there to support in as many airports as possible,” adds Evans, who has been lobbying vociferously for that exact approach to “get the world moving again.”Both Satzman and Evans think their efforts will pay off, whether they’re the turtle or the hare in a race with vaccines. After all, both executives are of the mindset that airport testing will be a long-term need, relevant for at least the next two years and possibly far longer.Mounting PressureFor both Satzman and Evans, providing airport testing is less a way to compensate for Covid-related losses than a means to get air travel—and therefore their core businesses—back on track. As Satzman puts it, “It’s not a big money thing, it’s a service you offer to let people back in so you can make money off your other businesses. ”The same could be said about Lufthansa, which in mid-November started to roll out free and rapid pre-flight testing for certain flights between Munich and Hamburg in collaboration with the German biotech firm Centogene. “Successful testing of entire flights can be the key to revitalizing international air traffic,” says Christina Foerster, Lufthansa Group’s executive board member for customer, IT, and corporate responsibility.There’s data to support the idea that testing could reestablish consumer confidence. In a study published by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) in October, 76% of respondents said that rapid testing prior to departure—with waived quarantining requirements for those who test negative—would be the best way to open up international travel.The barrier is a patchwork approach to entry requirements across state, regional, and international levels, and the lack of a unified system to verify results. In Hong Kong, for instance, travelers need to present a “physical, stamped, paper copy of results,” says Collinson’s Evans; travelers to other destinations need only log into a health portal for an agent to review.Satzman doesn’t see much of that changing. In the US, as in other countries, coordinated policy for airport testing would require unprecedented cooperation among agencies as wide-ranging as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and the Department of Health and Human Services. But with infections in the US reaching an all-time high, and Europe batting down its second wave, the need for testing has become more urgent. Add in the desire to make long-awaited holiday travels stick, and you have demand boiling over from passengers who are less concerned about quarantine requirements than keeping their relatives safe.Slow and SteadyAgainst all these odds, airport testing efforts are gaining lift-off, thanks to a few recent developments. First is the recent, increased availability of rapid tests, which have allowed companies such as XpressSpa to think a bit further outside the box. Reliability is a growing positive, too: Just this week the NFL announced that it has helped prove the concept of a rapid test that’s as reliable as PCR swabs.Then there’s interest from airlines, who are seeing wide adoption of a vaccine as too far-off to suit their financial hopes. “Airlines are the ones stringing together the air bridges,” says Satzman, referring to the joint participation of two destinations in a pre-approved testing requirement for entry. “They see us as a strategic partner because we’re the only ones that will be in various airports.”As a result, Satzman says XpressSpa is carrying out negotiations with nearly every major American carrier, from implementing a pilot program that one airline hopes to roll out across all of its busiest airports to bundling the price of a required pre-flight Covid test with airfares.The next steps, say both Satzman and Evans, involve creating digital passports via which results could be uploaded and accessed by airline agents and border control officials, as needed. (Imagine, for instance, not being able to board a plane unless you scanned your boarding pass and your digital health app at the gate.)Then, Satzman says, it can be time to look at the next chapter: administering vaccines in addition to tests, and providing additional services such as strep throat tests to help unwell passengers decide whether it’s prudent to board a plane.  “Whether we call this XCheck or something else—whatever this turns into, I do believe it will be bigger than the XpressSpa business,” Satzman adds. “There’s a lot to do in airports. And we’re going to do it, step by step by step.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-with-vaccines-airport-testing-is-here-for-the-long-haul/story-1SZGBhLqP3ocp7Z1G3AAcJ.html

The pain will remain forever,” Hasina said while speaking with Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, the Pakistani High Commissioner in Dhaka, at the Ganabhaban.Referring to the volumes of the book titled “Secret Documents of Intelligence Branch on Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman”, she said that all can learn many historical facts between the years 1948 and 1971 from the books, BDNews24 said.She further highlighted that the Urdu version of the book “Unfinished Memoirs” by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is a best-seller in Pakistan.“It’s well-read in Pakistan and other countries,” she said.BDNews24 further reported Pakistan High Commissioner said that his country wants to strengthen ties with Bangladesh.

04-12-2020||World||Mike Pompeo decries China’s ‘persecution’ of Hong Kong’s activists||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused Hong Kong of using the courts to engage in “political persecution” after prominent activists were detained and a former opposition lawmaker fled to Europe.Pompeo said in a statement Thursday that the decisions to sentence activists including Joshua Wong to jail while denying bail to billionaire media mogul Jimmy Lai violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the treaty allowing the former British colony’s return to China in 1997. He said the US would work with its allies to defend such freedoms, something the incoming administration of Joe Biden has also pledged to do.“The United States is appalled by the Hong Kong government’s political persecution of Hong Kong’s courageous pro-democracy advocates,” Pompeo said. “The use of courts to silence peaceful dissent is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes and underscores once again that the Chinese Communist Party’s greatest fear is the free speech and free thinking of its own people.”Meanwhile, former pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui announced Thursday he was going into exile in the UK after fleeing to Denmark earlier this week. Hui was among those arrested last month in connection with a disruptive protest in the legislative chamber in May and quit last month as part of a mass resignation by opposition legislators over the government’s ouster of four of their members.The developments illustrate the growing threat of jail hanging over pro-democracy activists as the Hong Kong government uses new and once-little-used laws to press criminal cases against them. Police have arrested more than 10,000 people since a wave of largely leaderless protests last year, including 26 under new national security legislation carrying sentences as long as life in prison.The US, which has already sanctioned Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and several other officials responsible for the city, is facing a mid-December deadline to identify banks for penalties under a law passed earlier this year to support the local democracy movement. Biden has vowed to “fully enforce” such Hong Kong-related legislation and said he would convene a “Summit for Democracy” to reach new commitments to fight corruption and authoritarianism and advance human rights.Activists FleeChina has repeatedly rejected such actions as meddling in its own domestic affairs and issued counter sanctions against US lawmakers among other figures. Lam and Chinese officials argue the arrests have been necessary to restore stability to the Asian financial center after last year’s sometimes violent unrest.Ten members of the city’s former opposition bloc are facing criminal charges related to scuffles in the legislative chamber or their appearance at unauthorized rallies. Wong, 24, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison Wednesday for participating in a June 2019 protest outside the police headquarters, faces two other similar criminal cases.Lai, 73, was denied bail in a fraud case Thursday, potentially keeping him behind bars for months as he battles more serious foreign collusion allegations under the security law. The judge presiding over the case deemed the Next Digital Ltd. founder to be a flight risk, Lai’s Apple Daily newspaper reported, although he had already surrendered his passport and said he had no intention to leave Hong Kong.Hui, the former lawmaker, was among several pro-democracy activists to exit the city since the move to enact the national security law in June. Twelve more have been detained in mainland China since August after being caught attempting to flee Hong Kong by boat. The trend has led to efforts in places like Australia, Canada and the UK to make it easier for city residents to relocate.The high-profile departures, however, may make it harder for others facing prosecution to leave or secure bail from courts. The security law also allows courts to deny bail before trial because defendants may “continue to commit acts endangering national security,” a power that rights lawyers say clashes with the presumption of innocence in the city’s Common Law tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-decries-china-s-persecution-of-hong-kong-s-activists/story-lws0ii1pZzgP8FpXdLfdvM.html
04-12-2020||World||Some damages in the Sino-US relations ‘beyond repair’, Chinese state media warns||Chinese state media warned that some damage to Sino-US ties are “beyond repair” amid a new wave of counter-China measures by the Trump administration, with an ugly Twitter spat between a US senator and Chinese reporter underlining the rising rancour.The government-backed newspaper China Daily said in an editorial it viewed Washington’s decision to limit visitor visas for Chinese Communist Party members and their families and a ban on Xinjiang cotton imports are “worrisome signs.”“Even if the incoming administration has any intention of easing the tensions that have been sown, and continue being sown, some damage is simply beyond repair, as the sitting US president intends,” the newspaper said. Relations between the world’s two largest economies have sunk to their lowest point in decades over issues such as trade, technology, security, human rights, and Covid-19. Bilateral ties are being shifted onto “a dangerous path”, according to the China Daily editorial.The Chinese ambassador to the United States became the latest of senior Beijing officials to signal a desire to reset the increasingly confrontational relationship as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in January. “There are always differences between the two countries. None of them justifies confrontation and war, cold or hot,” Cui said on Twitter Thursday. “With sufficient mutual respect and mutual understanding, we are capable of managing these differences so that they would not derail the entire relationship.”It is unclear whether a Biden administration will bring a dramatic shift, however. The Democrat told the New York Times this week that he would not remove existing tariffs set by the Trump administration against China for now. Legislation targeting China or Chinese officials over charges of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and crackdown against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have won broad bipartisan support in Congress, as well, further suggesting that current policies towards China have staying power. An exchange of insults on Thursday between US Senator Marsha Blackburn and China Daily journalist Chen Weihua underscored persistent animosity. Blackburn, a Republican and one of the more outspoken China critics, claimed without evidence on Twitter that China “has a 5,000 year history of cheating and stealing.” Chen replied to her tweet, accusing Blackburn of being the most “racist and ignorant” US senator he has seen and calling her a “lifetime bitch.”The senator responded by calling Chen a “puppet” in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “dream for global domination” and that the US won’t bow to “sexist communist thugs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-damages-in-the-sino-us-relations-beyond-repair-chinese-state-media-warns/story-zdfYWpHLOn4NXRfNpVS09N.html
04-12-2020||World||Moderna vaccine confers at least 3 months immunity, study claims||The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, which the company says was recently demonstrated to have 94 percent efficacy, causes the human immune system to produce potent antibodies that endure for at least three months, a study showed Thursday.Researchers at the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which co-developed the drug, studied the immune response of 34 adult participants, young and old, from the first stage of a clinical trial.Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, they said that the antibodies, which stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from invading human cells, “declined slightly over time, as expected, but they remained elevated in all participants 3 months after the booster vaccination.”The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, is administered in two injections given 28 days apart.Even though the number of antibodies in the study subjects faded over time, it is not necessarily a cause for concern.NIAID director Anthony Fauci and other experts have said it is very likely that the immune system will remember the virus if re-exposed later on, and then produce new antibodies.Encouragingly, the study showed that the vaccine activated a certain type of immune cell that should help out in the so-called memory response, but only longer term study will confirm if this will really be the case.“Positives from the study include evidence that a relatively strong antibody response remains 90 days after the second dose of the vaccine,” said virologist Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana.“The amount of vaccine-produced antibodies was higher in younger patients than in older patients, but reasonably strong immune responses were still seen even in patients up to 70 years of age.”The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed by an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 17, and could be green lit for emergency approval soon after.Like another vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, it is based on a new technology that uses genetic material in the form of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).The mRNA is encased in a lipid molecule and injected into the arm, where it causes cells inside our muscles to build a surface protein of the coronavirus.This tricks the immune system into believing it’s been infected with a microbe, and trains it to build the right kind of antibodies for when it encounters the real virus.ia/caw/||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-confers-at-least-3-months-immunity-study-claims/story-RRfGas43otNhUIzYaKXKEN.html
04-12-2020||World||New law may help ease Green Cards backlog||US Senate on Wednesday passed a legislation raising country limits on the annual grant of Green Cards — permanent residencies — that, when enacted, will stand to benefit hundreds of thousands of Indian-origin applicants who currently face a statistical possibility of waiting for decades for their turn.The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act was passed on Wednesday by unanimous consent. The House of Representatives had passed its own version of the legislation in 2019. The two bills will now go through a reconciliation process to iron out the differences, and a combined legislation must pass both chambers again before being sent to the White House for the president’s signature and enactment.“Ending nationality discrimination and levelling the playing field for high-skilled applicants, our legislation will keep families together while helping American companies retain top talent. I urge my colleagues and the President to take the final steps necessary to make these reforms a reality,” said Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American lawmaker who co-sponsored by the House bill.The US grants some 1 million Green Cards a year. But a country cap limits their numbers to 7% of the total for applicants from every specific country. The worst affected by this country limit are Indian applicants, with more than 300,000 primary applicants in the backlog. The bill passed by the Senate raises the limit to 15%. Immigration Voice, which advocates end to country caps, said the bill would clear the Green Card backlog a lot sooner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-law-may-help-ease-green-cards-backlog/story-p76roKQ7cJXwgGGdYpbA2N.html
04-12-2020||World||Ex-US presidents offer to take Covid-19 vaccine publicly||Three former US presidents have volunteered to take shots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine — when it is approved — publicly to persuade Americans who are sceptical about inoculations.Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama — three of the four living former presidents — conveyed their offer in public remarks to CNN and SiriusXM on Wednesday. There was no word on the fourth, President Jimmy Carter, who is the oldest among them and beat cancer in 2015.“First, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations. Then, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera,” Freddy Ford, Bush’s chief of staff told CNN, and added that the former president had asked him to reach out to Anthony Fauci and Deborah Brix, members of the White House task force on coronavirus, with his offer of whatever help he could extend.Clinton’s press secretary also told the news channel that the former president “will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same”.And Obama told SiriusXM that if Fauci, the top epidemiologist who has emerged as the most trusted voice in America on Covid-19 and the vaccines in the pipeline, “tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunise you from getting Covid, absolutely, I’m going to take it”.“I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don’t trust is getting Covid,” the Democrat added.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German BioNTech applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their vaccine candidate on November 22. Moderna, another US company, applied for the same on November 30. Their vaccines — which have an efficacy of 95% — are expected to become available in the country around mid-December after the FDA meets on December 10 and 17 to take a call on the same.Frontline workers such as health professionals and law enforcement personnel, and residents of nursing homes will be the first two groups of recipients, according to a recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control.Despite being hit the hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic — more than 271,000 fatalities and nearly 14 million confirmed infections — many Americans have been leery of any cure or therapeutics. Among several reasons for this distrust are also allegations that the Donald Trump administration — which has been criticised for not taking the public health crisis seriously enough — pushed agencies to approve vaccines in a rush to improve his chances of re-election ahead of the November 3 polls.The President has also spoken about the efficacy of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, which he forced the drug regulator to clear for emergency use despite studies suggesting it is not a Covid-19 cure, and went so far as to suggest the injection of household cleaning agents.More than two-thirds — 66% of respondents — told Gallup in a poll in July they would not agree to be vaccinated against Covid-19 if a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drug regulator, was available to them at the time, and at no cost. Only 34% said they would.More Americans have come around since. The latest Gallup poll, conducted in a period ending November 1, before the announcements by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna found that nearly six in 10 — 58% — respondents said they will take the shots, but 42% were still not convinced.A majority of those sceptical of the vaccines (37%) in the Gallup poll cited “rushed timeline for the development of the vaccine” as their reason.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have indeed come in record time, aided also by an all-in effort from the Trump administration under its Operation Warp Speed, which provided massive federal aid for their development. According to the latest poll, almost 26% of those distrustful of the vaccine said they would wait to see if the vaccine was safe; 12% were those who said they just didn’t trust vaccines, and 10% wanted to see how effective the vaccine was before agreeing to take the shots.Distrust of vaccines among African-Americans, who are among the hardest hit by Covid-19, too goes back in history. In the Tuskegee Experiment -- which began in 1932 and went on for years -- African-American men, many of whom suffered from latent syphilis, were administered placebos such as aspirin and mineral even after penicillin had made the disease curable. Many of the participants eventually lost their eye eyesight and died of the disease as the researchers studied long-term progression of the illness.“I understand you know historically -- everything dating back all the way to the Tuskegee experiments and so forth -- why the African American community, would have some scepticism,” Obama said in the SiriusXM interview. “But the fact of the matter is, is that vaccines are why we don’t have polio anymore, the reason why we don’t have a whole bunch of kids dying from measles and smallpox and diseases that used to decimate entire populations and communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-us-presidents-offer-to-take-covid-19-vaccine-publicly/story-36WNzlS5bfHmjjLTAHa5aM.html

Winners in various categories were announced by actor-writer Stephen Fry in an online ceremony from the Natural History Museum, London.The foundation said Disale made an “extraordinary announcement” in a speech after winning the prize that he will share half the prize money with his fellow finalists, resulting in the other nine receiving over $ 55,000 each.“This is the first time in the Global Teacher Prize’s six-year history that the overall winner has shared the prize money with other finalists,” the foundation said.Disale was selected from over 12,000 nominations and applications from over 140 countries around the world. The prize was set up to recognise one exceptional teacher making an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role that teachers play in society. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the “creativity and ingenuity” of the winners and said, “Although I’m speaking to you in difficult and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances, it’s right that we take time to recognise the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the world’s teachers during this pandemic.”The ceremony included a special recognition for one teacher - a Covid hero - who has gone above and beyond to keep young people learning during the Covid-19 pandemic.The $45,000 Covid Hero Award, supported by CVC Capital Partners, was given to UK Maths teacher Jamie Frost, whose free DrFrostMaths became a lifeline for students shut out of classrooms all around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-teacher-ranjitsinh-disale-wins-1-million-global-prize-shares-half-with-other-finalists/story-PdOdXBbeQWb8ISVYyY931I.html
04-12-2020||India||Farm laws unconstitutional, illegal: SC Bar association president||Senior lawyer and president of Supreme Court Bar Association Dushyant Dave on Friday said that the recently passed farm laws by the union government are “unconstitutional” and “illegal” and will eventually promote profiteering and legalise the exploitative money lending system in the villages. A meeting took place today between the president of Supreme Court Bar Association, Dushyant Dave, Sangharsh Committee member and farmer leader Baldev Singh Sirsa and senior lawyer Harvinder Singh Phoolka on the ongoing farmers’ protest in the national capital.After the meeting, Dave told ANI: “It is a matter of pride that Sangharsh Committee members met me regarding the farmers’ protest. I have told them that the recently passed farm laws are unconstitutional and illegal. These laws will legalise the exploitative money-lending system in the villages.“This will promote profiteering. There is no protection to the farmers as most of them are small and marginal. How will they enter into agreements with traders and understand the terms? The situation will become such that traders will destroy the farmers,” he added.Dave further said: “The government should think about these laws as it is their responsibility to hear the farmers, address the legal issues and bring an amendment to the law. The most important amendment should be that the trader should give in writing that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) will be ensured to the farmers.”“The government has also mentioned that they want to keep the judicial system outside of the purview of this law. The joint secretaries and district magistrates will not be able to dispense justice to the farmers. Our judiciary is capable to dispense justice to the farmers. The government should include the judiciary system. But it is also true that cases will increase in the courts and hence this law is not required,” he added.Dave further said: “This law also impacts the ‘democracy at the grassroots’. The farmers till now could do collective bargaining at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). It is true that all APMCs were not working fine. But that does not mean that the government should bring in an even more exploitative law.”“I am hopeful that the Prime Minister will address these issues and think about the welfare of the farmers, I will assist the farmers in their struggle in my personal capacity,” he added.HS Phoolka said that the government should reconsider these farm laws as a senior advocate like Dave is also not on its side. “We are thankful that Dushyant Dave will assist the farmers in their struggle. The government is saying that it has examined the law but it should think that if a senior lawyer like Dushyant Dave is also saying that these laws are not in the interest of the farmers then it must be considered by them,” Phoolka said.“The government’s legal advisors may be differing on this issue but they should contemplate on it. Delhi Bar Council also announced that they examined these laws and declared that they are not in the interest of the farmers or advocates. The government should not make it an ego issue,” he added.Phoolka further said, “India is a country of farmers. If all the farmers are uncomfortable, then how is our country a democracy? The government should sit with the farmers and advocates and then implement the amendments to these laws.”Farmer leader Baldev Singh Sirsa said: “We are very happy that Supreme Court lawyer Dushyant Dave is with us. The government should roll back these laws and make laws after consulting farmers. Dushyant Dave said that he will fight the cases for farmers free of cost. We are grateful to HS Phoolka who facilitated our meeting with Dave ji.”Thousands of farmers have gathered in and around Delhi to protest against the three farm laws.On Thursday, the farmers held the fourth round of talks with the Centre and said the government had talked of some amendments to farm laws.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said after the talks that the government has no ego and it was discussing the issues raised by farmers with an open mind.“The government will discuss points that emerged at the meeting on Friday and hopes that talks will move towards finality when the next round of discussions are held on Saturday,” the minister had said.The farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-unconstitutional-illegal-sc-bar-association-president/story-xGwYf5eND2jCDq6vwiErsL.html
04-12-2020||India||CBI books Delhi company in Rs 1,800-crore bank fraud case||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday raided three locations, three days after booking a petrochemical trading company - Jay Polychem India Ltd - for allegedly cheating a consortium of 13 banks led by State Bank of India of Rs 1,800 crore, people familiar with the development said. The agency has issued lookout circulars (LOC) against the owners of the company - Satinder Pal Madhok, Sandeep Madhok, Harneet Kaur and Sumohita Kaur so that they don’t flee the country, they said. It is alleged in an FIR, registered on December 1, that Jay Polychem India, having its office in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, engaged in wholesale import and trading of industrial chemicals, petrochemical products and agro commodities, took total loans of Rs 1,652 crore from 13 banks led by SBI before 2014 but failed to repay the same. The account was declared a non performing asset (NPA) in August 2014 due to non-payment of dues. A forensic audit carried out by Ernst and Young revealed massive diversion and siphoning off of bank funds, fictitious transactions, forgery etc. The CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, states that some of the companies associated with Jay Polychem did not exist at their registered addresses while there were common addresses between the vendors and customers. The accused company, CBI says, had issued Letters of Credit (LCs) to various companies abroad which didn’t exist. The income tax return documents of the company indicated that trade receivables amounting to Rs 679 crore were classified as doubtful debtors. It is suspected that receivables shown by the company may be fictitious. As of March 2018, the company owed Rs 1800.72 crore to 13 banks with SBI having maximum exposure of Rs 474.72 crore. Other banks which have been cheated by the company include – Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Central Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Union Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Bank of India and others. The company representatives could not be located by HT for their comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-delhi-company-in-rs-1-800-crore-bank-fraud-case/story-VnZcd2m7NYQz0goVCbTxzN.html

Dismissing any ‘BJP storm’, Owaisi said, “Where is the storm? Had there been a storm, BJP wouldn’t have lost in Maharashtra MLC election. BJP had said they would conduct surgical strike in old city. But they couldn’t do anything in my area. We did democratic strike. We contested in 51 seats and won 44. Think what would have happened, had AIMIM contested in 80 seats.” In 2016, the party had contested in 60 seats and won 44 seats, thus making this year’s strike rate better than 2016, Owaisi added.“We are confident that people of Telangana will stop the BJP from expanding its footprints in the state,” Owaisi said. Owaisi’s party, which is based in Telangana, was looking to make more gains in this year’s election as the party recently won five assembly seats in Bihar. However, the party maintained its stronghold and its 2016 tally — 44 seats. “We have won on 44 seats in Hyderabad GHMC elections. I have spoken to all newly elected corporators and asked them to begin their work from tomorrow itself,” Owaisi said.Talking about Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Owaisi said, “TRS in our opposition but in Telangana, it is a formidable political party, it has to be accepted. It represents the regional sentiment of Telangana. I am sure K Chandrashekar Rao will review the party’s performance in these elections. I am sure he will be a big challenge for the BJP.” The ruling TRS emerged as the single largest party winning 55 wards in the 150-ward GHMC election. The results of 149 were announced as counting of votes had to be stopped in a ward as per a High Court order. Counting had to be stopped in Neredmet ward as marks other than the standard Swastik symbol (crossed arrow mark) were in majority.AIMIM was crucial in the civic election as Owaisi was the target of several attacks the BJP made during the campaigning. The BJP also alleged that TRS and AIMIM have formed secret coalition. After Yogi Adityanath said the BJP might think of renaming Hyderabad as Bhagyanagar, Owaisi hit back saying that the generation of Uttar Pradesh CM may end but the city will always be called Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-begins-from-tomorrow-asaduddin-owaisi-reacts-to-hyderabad-civic-poll-results/story-hHu4fpUlGcr4NUeQlxxEEM.html
04-12-2020||India||As dissent rocks TMC, BJP rubs it in, says Abhishek Banerjee a bonus for it||Dissent among a section of Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders over the growing clout of Abhishek Banerjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and heir apparent, coupled with organizational changes made at the advice of election strategist Prashant Kishor is helping the the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the opposition party’s leaders feel.Some ruling party leaders share this view as well. Abhishek Banerjee has become the focal point of the BJP’s attack on the TMC in recent weeks after a number of leaders, starting from heavyweight former minister Suvendu Adhikari to senior legislator Mihir Goswami, have rebelled over decisions taken by him and Kishor.It is an open secret in the TMC that Banerjee and Kishor work in close coordination with each other and many instructions are often passed on to district leaders by executives of I-Pac, Kishor’s company, and not senior leaders. Talking to HT on condition of anonymity, a senior TMC state committee member said that at an important virtual meeting with district and state leaders Mamata Banerjee on Friday afternoon gave clear instructions that those raising their voice against the party should be removed from their posts. “The chief minister said this while addressing Sisir Adhikari, the father of Suvendu Adhikari. She also said those who are afraid of facing the BJP in the coming election may leave the TMC. She said she will not hold any grudge against them. Significantly, she also mentioned emphatically that there is no need to feel scared as the next generation of leadership is ready. There was a clear message in this,” the TMC leader said.Sisir Adhikari is the Lok Sabha member from Kanthi and president of the party’s East Midnapore district unit. Mamata Banerjee will address a mammoth rally in Midnapore on December7. Suvendu Adhikari, who has told the leadership that he cannot work with the TMC, will announce his next move on December 6. There are speculations that he may quit the TMC. “Many TMC leaders joined the BJP in recent years. But senior people such as Mukul Roy and former Kolkata mayor Sovon Chatterjee left us because of their differences with Abhishek Banerjee. Suvendu has the same issue,” said a senior TMC leader who did not want to be named. The BJP’s assaults on Abhishek Banerjee are not restricted to calling him bhaipo (nephew) or khokababu (kid) in public. The saffron camp wants to corner him politically as well. BJP national president J P Nadda will be holding an organisational meeting with BJP leaders from South 24 Parganas during a visit on December 8. The meeting will be held at Diamond Harbour, Abhishek Banerjee’s Lok Sabha constituency. Nadda will hold a second meeting in Kolkata on December 9. “What is happening in the TMC is a mirror image of what the Indian National Congress is going through. The Gandhi family is desperate to make Rahul Gandhi the head of the party although he lacks mission and vision. In Bengal, Abhishek Banerjee, who never led any mass movement or contributed to the TMC’s growth in its formative years, has been made the party’s second face,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice-president of the BJP’s Bengal unit. “In the districts, people worked for years to build the TMC’s organization because they were inspired by Mamata Banerjee’s struggle as an opposition leader. Many of these leaders are now being replaced by young people who owe their allegiance to Abhishek. The chief minister cannot force her old and sincere leaders to like and follow Abhishek. Only the opportunists will do that. The BJP is reaping the fruits of the TMC’s corruption and the government’s failures. Abhishek is an added bonus,” Majumdar added. While Mihir Goswami, the lawmaker from Cooch Behar South assembly seat in north Bengal, joined the BJP on November 27, Suvendu Adhikari, who headed three important departments, quit the cabinet the same day. A third lawmaker, Silbhadra Dutta from the Barrackpore seat in North 24 Parganas, has declared that he will not contest the assembly polls. “I don’t believe that political decisions can be taken by a hired commercial agency. The agency cannot lecture me on politics. I feel obsolete in the present situation,” Dutta had said on November 1, referring to I-Pac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-dissent-rocks-tmc-bjp-rubs-it-in-says-abhishek-banerjee-a-bonus-for-it/story-bUQ1bzjJ68OKcxCxNl4QtL.html
04-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Govt’s fifth round of talks with farm leaders to be held on Saturday||The government and farmer leaders are scheduled to meet again on Saturday for their fifth round of talks to end the deadlock over the new farm laws.     Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State of Commerce and Industry Som Parkash, who will be present in the meeting, will deliberate on the points that farmer leaders had raised and offer possible solutions.     According to sources, the government has worked out possible solutions to the provisions on which farm leaders have raised objections. It hopes to break the deadlock on Saturday so that the farmers’ protest ends at the earliest. In the previous meeting on Thursday, Tomar had assured 40 farmer union leaders that the government is open to considering ways to strengthen APMC mandis, create a level-playing field with proposed private markets, and provide a provision for approaching higher courts for dispute resolution, while asserting that procurement at minimum support price (MSP) will continue.      But the other side stuck to their demand of repealing the three “hastily-passed” farm laws, saying that the legislations with several loopholes and deficiencies cannot be amended.     It needs to be seen whether farmer leaders will accept solutions offered by the government and end the protest due to which Delhi’s border points remained choked as thousands of farmers from Haryana, Punjab, and other states held demonstrations for the ninth consecutive day.     Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait has threatened that the farmers’ agitation would intensify if the government fails to meet the demands.    “The government and the farmers did not reach any decision during the meeting held on Thursday. The government wants to make amendments to the three laws, but we want the laws to be completely repealed. If the government does not agree to our demands, we will continue to protest. We are looking to find out what happens in Saturday’s meeting,” Tikait told PTI.     The farmer community has expressed apprehension that the new laws are “anti-farmer”, and would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.  However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-govt-s-fifth-round-of-talks-with-farm-leaders-to-be-held-on-saturday/story-Jdvbdcc9h7SwptVK8jA4QK.html
04-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Amarinder Singh calls return of Padma award by Badal ‘theatrics’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday called the decision of Akali Dal stalwart Parkash Singh Badal to return his Padma Vibhushan theatrics and wondered why he was even given the country’s second-highest civilian honour. Badal had returned his Padma Vibhushan award on Thursday in protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, over which thousands of Punjab farmers are now protesting at Delhi’s borders. “I don’t know why Parkash Singh Badal got the Padma Vibhushan in the first place,” Singh said in a statement which also attacked AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, calling him a “slimy fellow.” The Punjab CM said Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh got the Padma Vibhushan for winning the 1965 war with Pakistan and mocked, “What war did Parkash Singh Badal fight or what sacrifice did he make for the community?” Singh claimed that the former CM is now saying he has made a big sacrifice by returning the award. “Stop politicking on this,” he said. “This ‘dramebaazi’ (theatrics) might have worked 40 years ago but it does not work now.” Earlier, the Aam Aadmi Party, the main opposition in Punjab, too had called Badal’s gesture a “drama”. Amarinder Singh said Badal has been claiming all his life that he represents the interests of the farmers. “Then why did his party support the central ordinances after initially opposing them, and then did an about-turn and started publicly criticising the legislations,” he said. He said as a member of the Union Cabinet Harsimrat Kaur Badal was very much a part of the meeting that passed the farm ordinances. “Is she illiterate that she can’t read,” he asked, referring to the former Union minister and Badal’s daughter-in-law who later quit the Narendra Modi Cabinet over the contentious farm laws. He also slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for allegedly twisting his statement on national security. The AAP had targeted Singh for linking the farmers’ agitation to national security, in remarks made after a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Singh on Friday said he had told Shah that the amendment bills passed in Punjab Vidhan Sabha were the solution to breaking the deadlock over the farmers’ issue. Describing Kejriwal as a “slimy fellow” who was in the “habit of lying”, Amarinder asked the Delhi chief minister to first explain why his government had notified one of the central farm laws. “When other Opposition-ruled states, including Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, have passed amendment bills to counter the central laws, why did he not call a session of the Delhi Assembly to reject the latter,” he asked. “Does Kejriwal not have villages around Delhi?” he said. He charged that while Kejriwal is in the habit of lying, his Haryana counterpart M L Khattar has the habit of thrashing people, an apparent reference to attempts by the police of that state to stop Punjab farmers from marching to Delhi. The Conngress leader said he is not scared of the Enforcement Directorate, reacting to the charge by rivals that he is under pressure from central agencies. “For 13 years, I have been going to courts because of the cases initiated against me by the Badals, I am not bothered about ED.

The minister also inaugurated the newly improved portion of NH-39 at the commercial city of Dimapur during a virtual launching event.The union minister in his address termed Nagaland as one of the most important states in northeast India and said his ministry is committed to developing the state for the greater development of the region. He highlighted that Nagaland, which had a total NH network of 880.68 km till 2014, has seen a 78 per cent growth over the past six years and now has 1547 km-long NH network.Gadkari said the newly sanctioned projects for which he laid the foundation would help not just the people of Nagaland but will improve the connectivity with neighbouring states of Manipur and Assam and towards the Myanmar border as well. They are expected to generate employment opportunities and boost socio-economic progress of the state while also providing easier access to healthcare and emergency services, he said.

After the results were announced which put BJP in the second position in Hyderabad’s local poll, ahead of local party AIMIM, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath took to Twitter and stoked the name row by saying, “The fate of Bhagyanagar is rising.” He mentioned Hyderabad as he referred to the election but referred to the people as “the people of Bhagyanagar” as he thanked them for showing confidence in PM Modi’s leadership. "भाग्यनगर" का भाग्योदय प्रारंभ हो रहा है...हैदराबाद के निकाय चुनावों में भाजपा एवं आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी के नेतृत्व पर अभूतपूर्व विश्वास जताने के लिए "भाग्यनगर" की जनता का कोटि-कोटि धन्यवाद।Adityanath was in Hyderabad as part of BJP’s star-studded campaign. “”Some people were asking me if Hyderabad can be renamed as Bhagyanagar. I said - why not? I told them we renamed Faizabad as Ayodhya and Allahabad as Prayagraj after BJP came into power. Why can’t Hyderabad be renamed as Bhagyanagar?” he said during the campaigning. The name comes from a small temple of Goddess Lakshmi, known as Bhagyalakshmi temple, adjacent to Charminar. Some BJP leaders have claimed the temple got its name from Bhagyanagar which was Hyderabad’s original name before it was changed to Hyderabad by Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah. The temple falls in the part of the city which is a stronghold of AIMIM. The temple was at the centre of this year’s civic election from the beginning. During the beginning of the poll campaign, the State Election Commission ordered the government to stop receiving applications from rain-affected people for Rs 10,000 relief for which the TRS blamed the BJP. State BJP chief B Sanjay Kumar challenged that the Chief Minister to come to the Bhagyalakshmi temple, saying he was ready to take oath in the name of goddess in the presence of the CM, and he went to the temple. Union home minister Amit Shah too visited the temple when he was in Hyderabad for campaigning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fate-of-bhagyanagar-rising-yogi-s-tweet-on-ghmc-election-results-stokes-name-row/story-1XDJpEYruZdbn270OO0PDK.html

The FIR is lodged under sections of IPC and Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. We are conducting investigations,” said Himangshu Das, ACP (Dispur). “The FIR has been filed under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (sedition) and 420 (cheating) of IPC read with Section 13 of FCRA,” said Das.Borah’s complaint is based on allegations levelled against Ajmal Foundation by an NGO called Legal Rights Observatory (LRO). In a series of tweets on Thursday, the NGO alleged that several Turkey and UK-based organizations have given Rs 69.55 crore to Ajmal Foundation for education. But only around Rs 2 crore of the total amount was reportedly spent on educational purposes. LRO also alleged that these funding agencies had links with Islamic terror groups such as Al Qaeda, Hamas and Hizbul Mujahideen. “Many people in Assam are of the opinion that Badruddin Ajmal spends money from his own pocket to run his foundation. But the truth is that he receives funds from abroad,” Assam health and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists. “There are now allegations that the funds came from groups with terror links and most of the amount received was misused. I hope the central agencies will conduct proper investigation into this,” he added. Set up in 2005 with headquarters in Hojai town of Assam, the foundation run by Ajmal, who has a flourishing perfume business, deals in education, healthcare, disaster relief, women empowerment etc. The Ajmal Foundation has rubbished the allegations and said it welcomed a thorough probe.“Most of our foreign funds come from UK under strict compliance of FCRA regulations and are used in social, education and relief works. A false impression about our foundation is being created based on incorrect information. We want the thorough investigation, so that the truth is revealed,” Khasrul Islam, director of Ajmal Foundation told a TV channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiudf-chief-s-foundation-booked-for-receiving-foreign-funds-with-alleged-terror-links/story-vuGUnP7iTpF5TTC6H72KGM.html

While the first one is reserved for women candidates, on the second seat there is a triangular contest between the Apni Party candidate former legislator, Shoiab Lone; PDP spokesman, Suhail Bukhari, who is an alliance candidate; and an independent candidate Irfan Hafiz. Polling for both the seats was held on Friday amid tight security and more than 30 per cent voters exercised their franchise on both DDC seats.On the Wagoora reserved seat, four women contestants are in the fight, including Safeena Baig, wife of former J&K deputy CM and former MP Baramulla, Muzaffar Baig. The Baramulla MP recently resigned from the PDP as its patron after his wife, who was also the head of PDP’s women wing, was denied ticket by the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). The seat was given to the NC candidate.Safeena contested as an independent candidate. Baig’s had an influence over two seats Baramulla and Sangrama, of late the influence got diminished after Baig’s nephew and former legislator, Javeed Baig, left the PDP and joined the Apni party. Baig’s another brother also joined the Apni party. A day before the polls, Baig’s son from his first wife, Zahid Baig also released a critical video against Safeena on the social media.Also read: TRS emerges largest party in GHMC polls as BJP puts up stellar show“This is a very important election for Baig, especially for Safeena and if she manages to win the DDC seat, they (Baigs) can start afresh from this place,” said young businessman Fayaz Ahmad after casting his vote at a polling station set up inside Government school Sultanpora.“More than 300 people voted in the first four hours and more people are coming and it’s going to be a triangular contest between Safeena, Apni Party candidate and the alliance candidate,” he said, adding that it could be a close contest but for senior Baig (Muzaffar Hussain) everything is at stake.At Kreeri village, the native village of former minister and NC leader, Basharat Bukhari, the voters came in small groups to cast their votes at three polling stations set up at local higher secondary school while polling agents were distributing voting slips among the voters.“This is a local election but it’s going to be very important for future of three leaders Muzaffar Baig, Bashaarat Bukhari and Shoaib Lone. Baig and Bukhari had been former ministers while Lone’s father was also a former minister. This time the enthusiasm of the past election is missing but the polls are important for all these political families,” said BDC chairman Kreeri, Ghulam Mohiuddin Sofi while asking his supporters to vote on the symbol of a particular candidate. Another voter Shabir Ahmad said that for the political families it is going to be a turf war. “It will be interesting to see which family will emerge victorious.”Lones are contesting on both the seats while Nasreena contested from Wagoora, Shoiab contested from Sangrama. He lost two previous assembly election with a thin margin and this time his win is crucial. He left Congress in March and joined Apni Party in March. Bashaarat Bukhari won the last assembly elections on the PDP ticket and was minister in the last BJP PDP government but resigned from the PDP and joined NC before August 5, 2019.At neighbouring Shrakawara village, very few people had turned towards the polling station compared to the previous polls. “We had powerful people representing us in the past when J&K was a full-fledged state. Now, these big leaders are fighting panchayat polls. They are doing it for their political survival,” said Nisar Ahmad who didn’t cast his vote terming it a futile exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-ddc-polls-north-kashmir-s-key-seats-likely-to-seal-fate-of-3-powerful-political-families/story-lDvGxhx9bO5qA31OTFOeEL.html

04-12-2020||India||Sweets, crackers: BJP celebrates ‘moral victory’ in GHMC election||With the counting of votes in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Council elections reaching its last leg on Friday, the BJP started celebrating what it called its ‘moral victory’ in a so far uncharted region. In 2016 civic elections, BJP had won four seats. The number in 2020 went to 48, four seats more than local party AIMIM. “Today’s results indicate that we have blessings of the people in our efforts to bring BJP govt in Telangana in 2023 elections. TRS has failed, people are against their dynasty rule & corruption. People have paved a way for a BJP govt in Telangana, in the days to come,” minister of state, home, G Kishan Reddy said as he started distributing sweets amid the counting.  #WATCH Telangana: BJP workers burst crackers in Hyderabad following the #GHMCElectionresults https://t.co/xihpiLV81t pic.twitter.com/JQa2eKO7kYBJP supporters too started bursting crackers in Hyderabad as the results were being declared.Like the high-octane campaign ahead of the election, BJP’s reaction to the result also stood out as top prty leaders including Amit Shah, JP Nadda congratulated the victory. “Historic result for BJP in Hyderabad GHMC elections shows that people of the country supports only & only development agenda. This result reflects people’s unequivocal support to Hon PM Shri @narendramodi ji’s development & governance model,” the BJP chief tweeted. GHMC results show rejection of Dynastic,Corrupt & Appeasement politics. I Congratulate State President @bandisajay & hardworking @BJP4Telangana Karyakartas for their spirited efforts that led to great success. Gratitude to people of Hyderabad for their faith & support.BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav termed BJP’s result — second in the race as it was ahead of AIMIM during counting — as “moral victory”. The BJP’s performance has confirmed the trend that it is replacing the Congress as the main challenger to the TRS, Yadav said. The party had won four seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and then its victory in the Assembly bypoll in Dubbaka came as a surprise.“The results are very encouraging and a moral booster for the BJP, and in a way, it is a moral victory of the party. The results reaffirms that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and his model of good governance has acceptability across regions,” Yadav, who was deputed as in-charge for the local elections in Hyderabad, told PTI.While the TRS fielded candidates in all 150 wards in the election, the BJP put up nominees in 149. The Congress, AIMIM and the TDP fielded candidates in 146, 51 and 106 wards respectively. The TRS won 55 seats and the Congress won only two seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghmc-election-results-2020-bjp-celebrates-moral-victory-with-crackers-sweets/story-BhBFEmLmRj9hJBU3ssimON.html
04-12-2020||India||BJP springs a surprise in Hyderabad civic polls, keeps TRS away from majority mark||The elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, threw up a hung house with no political party reaching the absolute majority mark of 76 in the 150-seat corporation after counting of votes concluded on Friday. Telangana Rashtra Samithi, the ruling party in Telangana, emerged as a single largest party in the GHMC but its numbers took a big hit. The TRS which had won 99 seats in 2016 GHMC elections, was reduced to 55 seats – a fall of nearly 43 seats. On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which had won just four seats in alliance with the Telugu Desam Party in 2016, put up a tremendous show in these elections winning 48 seats in a solo fight to emerge as the second largest party in the GHMC. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) headed by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, ended up in third position with 44 seats, which was one seat less than what it had won in 2016. The Congress managed to win only two seats, the same number it had in the last GHMC. Taking moral responsibility for the poor show of the party, Telangana PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy announced his resignation from the post. The result of one seat has been withheld.The hopes of TRS to retain the GHMC Mayor post at least with the help of co-opted members, including MLCs, MLAs and MPs from Hyderabad, have also been shattered. There are 52 co-opted members in the GHMC and including the 150 elected corporators, the overall strength of the GHMC elected body will 202. It requires at least 102 members to capture the Mayor’s post. However, the TRS has only 38 co-opted members. Now that it has won only 58 corporator seats, the overall strength of the TRS will be only 96 – six seats short of the number needed to bag the Mayor’s seat. This peculiar scenario has resulted in the AIMIM emerging as a king maker in the GHMC. Since it cannot support the BJP and the TRS has been its long-time friend, it is expected that the party will forge an alliance with the TRS to capture power in the GHMC. The biggest gainer in these GHMC elections is the BJP, which put up a remarkable show by winning 48 seats. The party pulled out all stops to win the elections by launching a high voltage campaign by deploying its top leaders including Union home minister Amit Shah, national president J P Nadda, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath and other senior leaders. The party successfully capitalised on the understanding between the TRS and the AIMIM and polarised the Hindu vote bank in Hyderabad, besides cashing in on the failure of the TRS government led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in attending to the people affected by recent heavy rains and floods. Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said the main reason for the failure of the TRS in the GHMC was its open friendship with the AIMIM. “It has naturally given a weapon to the BJP and an opportunity to emerge as a champion of Hindus,” he said. Moreover, in the last five years, KCR focused only on decimating the Congress, but failed to assess the threat from the BJP. “The TRS supported the Narendra Modi government in Parliament on several issues. So, how can people believe KCR?” he asked. Senior TRS leader and panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao said the people had reposed their faith in the TRS despite large scale conspiracy by the BJP which sought to exploit religious sentiments to win the seats. “They have voted for the development and rejected divisive forces,” he said. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay attributed the stupendous performance of the party in the GHMC elections to the hard work by the party workers. “Though election commission authorities and the police supported the TRS, the people reposed their faith in us,” he said. Karnataka minister and co-in-charge of BJP in Telangana K Sudhakar said people of Telangana were waiting for a credible alternative to the TRS. “Now there is no more a TINA factor in Telangana, but it’s BITA - BJP Is The Alternative,” he said. Senior Congress leader and former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir said his party was thoroughly disappointed with the results but expressed confidence that it would bounce back soon. “The TRS, BJP and MIM misled the voters with a false narrative and secured their votes by using all illegal means,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-emerges-largest-party-in-ghmc-polls-but-bjp-steals-thunder-with-stellar-show/story-zguknhrrRh1VTbHyK0BRDJ.html
04-12-2020||India||Oppn leaders hail India’s efforts to contain Covid, then a word of caution||Leaders cutting across political parties hailed India’s efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic but cautioned the government on the hurdles lying ahead at the all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.Even as many Opposition parties are up in arms against the Union government over the three new farm laws and are supporting the farmers’ protest in the national capital region, most political leaders stood by the government on the Covid issue.Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said the pandemic should be a part of India’s national security policy, given the devastating impact of Covid on the lives of millions of Indians and the economy. Azad said the political leadership must be ready to counter the possible misinformation campaign over vaccines in the near future, according to the people cited above.In the second all-party meeting with PM Modi since the pandemic, Azad mentioned how he took a jab of H1N1 vaccine along with Zydus scientists to dispel public fears and malicious rumours. While he maintained that India’s Covid management was “very good” in terms of the country’s size and population, he demanded that vaccines should be affordable and cold chains should be set up across the country.The Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay sought “the PM’s advice” to the states and read out from a paper on how West Bengal was taking innovative measures to combat the pandemic. He said the Union government should extend full support to all vaccine producers.The DMK’s TR Balu asked the Prime Minister to take “a serious note” of the fact that the virus spread from China but “their Covid tally remains lower than most of the country”. The DMK leader also sought uniform rates for RT-PCR tests and suggested mobilising public sector units, CSR (corporate social responsibility) and government funds to create a buffer stock of vaccines.At this point, Balu picked up the farmers’ protests and said they were suffering in the cold weather of Delhi. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi told him to stick to Covid. Balu hit back, saying the minister should not interrupt when he is talking to the PM.YSRCP leader Vijayasai Reddy asked for a financial package from the centre for Telangana as the state government spent a large amount on biosafety of hospitals.Lauding India’s fight against Covid, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar said it was clear there were huge differences between many advanced nations and India, which was in a far better position in tackling the outbreak. Pawar suggested that the government should have added focus on storage of vaccines as well as handling bio-medical waste and countering misinformation.While Pawar, a partner in Maharashtra’s coalition government, asked for the Centre’s help for the economic revival of states, RCP Singh of the JD(U) spoke about strengthening the cold chain to the last mile.The BJD’s Chandrasekhar Sahu spoke of assessing the effectiveness of various vaccines and Satish Chandra Mishra maintained there should be no compromise with regular immunisation and health services. Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav, chairman of Parliament’s health panel, asked the PM to expedite the goal of spending 2.2% of GDP on health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-leaders-hail-india-s-efforts-to-contain-covid-then-a-word-of-caution/story-7B5PXTCaR6Xq8FTVZriRoM.html

In an announcement from Singhu border which connects Delhi and Haryana, BKU General Secretary Harvinder Singh Lakhwal called for a Bharat Bandh on December 8 if the government does not withdraw contentious farm laws, enacted in September.“We have planned to block all roads leading to Delhi in the coming days if new farm laws are not scrapped,” said Lakhwal.“Yesterday (Thursday), we told the Government that the farm laws should be withdrawn. On December 5, effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be burnt across the country,” news agency ANI quoted Ladkhwal as saying. “We have given a call for Bharat Bandh on December 8,” he added.Also Read | Farmers blocking essential services, increasing Covid-19 threat: Petition filed in Supreme CourtThe call for Bharat Bandh has been supported by various other farmers’ organisations.

During the protests, farmers are camping in and around Delhi borders due to which several roads connecting Delhi with its neighbouring states have been blocked. As per the latest traffic advisory, vehicular movement is shut at Singhu (epicenter of protests) and Tikri borders as farmers remain firm to protest against the farm laws.Meanwhile, the farmers held the fourth round of talks with the Centre on Thursday. Though the talks were not able to break the logjam, the government moved a step forward by agreeing to review the three farm laws. The next round of talks will take place on December 5.After Thursday’s talks, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said that the government has no ego and it was discussing the issues raised by farmers with an open mind.“The government will discuss points that emerged at the meeting on Friday and hopes that talks will move towards finality when the next round of discussions is held on Saturday,” the minister had said.The farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/planning-to-block-remaining-roads-of-delhi-says-farmers-as-protests-intensify/story-jKfLbvFyYtKzdxLLVdtOiJ.html

In October this year, the UK government also had indicated that Mallya is unlikely to be extradited to India anytime soon, saying there is a legal issue that needed to be resolved before his extradition can be arranged.The extradition was ordered by the British court after Mallya exhausted all legal remedies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-seizes-vijay-mallya-s-asset-in-france-worth-1-6-million-euros/story-l7V8Y1oq3Al67fA2wN4MhP.html

The CSE shared the sample of fructose syrup, which is called “all-pass” in the market procured from a company in Jaspur. It also provided full correspondence with two Chinese companies from which CSE procured adulterant samples along with details of the consignment of adulterant sent by a company in China that CSE could not eventually receive because it did not have necessary permits.On Wednesday, CSE made public the findings of its investigation into honey adulteration. The probe found that 77% of samples from 13 top honey brands were adulterated with a modified sugar syrup to beat safety tests. CSE found that some Chinese companies developed a syrup containing fructose, or fruit sugar, that can go undetected in Indian tests for the purity of honey.A CSE statement said its representatives met FSSAI officials including chairperson Rita Teotia and CEO Arun Singhal. It added the authority has assured that they will send the adulterant sample for further testing and will also follow up on all the contacts and details CSE has provided to unravel the adulteration nexus. Based on its review, FSSAI has said it will take the necessary steps to amend the food standards and step-up surveillance.FSSAI on Thursday responded to the expose and said CSE found the adulterants by using the non-prescription Trace Marker for Rice (TMR) syrup test instead of a more sensitive Specific Marker for Rice (SMR) syrup test. “It is not clear as to why some tests like SMR have not been conducted on the samples spiked with adulterants by CSE. FSSAI has requested details of the samples and the tests conducted from CSE. As soon as details become available, they will be analysed by FSSAI to draw conclusions about the protocols followed and suggest any improvements that are required in the test methodology for future,” FSSAI said in a statement on Thursday.On Friday, FSSAI representatives inquired why CSE had not asked for SMR in the samples deliberately spiked by CSE to expose adulteration. CSE sent the spiked samples to National Dairy Development Board laboratory in Gujarat for testing. FSSAI officials said SMR was required to detect adulteration by rice syrup. CSE has explained that this was not the globally understood laboratory test practice.CSE has stressed that the ring of adulteration needed to be firmly dealt with and that FSSAI must take urgent steps to stop or break the nexus. “Our research has clearly established that samples adulterated even up to 50% can bypass our testing for C3 and C4 sugar [(cane or high fructose corn syrup],” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.“We will send samples for further investigations,” said an FSSAI spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cse-hands-over-honey-adulterant-fructose-syrup-sample-to-fssai/story-T34QP4BVvcKn0DazZTZmXO.html

The apex court took umbrage that the MP government wanted the violators not to face criminal prosecutions only because they had paid monetary fines. “We are of the opinion that the violators cannot be permitted to go scot free on payment of penalty only. There must be some stringent provisions which may have deterrent effect so that the violators may think twice before committing such offences and before causing damage to the earth and nature,” said a Supreme Court bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan.Authoring the judgment, Justice MR Shah reminded the State that they are the custodian of mines and minerals in the country, and said they should be more sensitive towards protecting the ecological balance by ensuring stern action against the violators. It pointed out that although provisions in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR Act) empowered the state to withdraw prosecution for illegal mining after imposing fines, they would do well to acknowledge the growing concern regarding environmental damages and its grave consequences.The observations came as the top court dismissed a clutch of appeals for quashing as many as 14 FIRs registered in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur district against illegal sand mining and their transportation. While the FIR was lodged on a directive from the judicial magistrate concerned, the violators proceeded to settle the charges under the MMDR Act by paying monetary fines. These petitions were dismissed by the high court. The state government, which had initially supported the magistrate’s order on FIRs, took a U-turn before the Supreme Court and said the prosecution under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for theft and abetting concealment of stolen properties cannot go on after these violators have already settled the case by coughing up fines.The bench called the state government’s support to the “violators” “very surprising”, and held that the criminal prosecution under the IPC is independent of the settlement proceedings under the MMDR Act.The court said that even if a state government decides to withdraw cases under the MMDR Act, investigation under the IPC shall go on in accordance with the law. The bench, therefore, allowed quashing of the charges under Section 23A of the MMDR Act but clarified the prosecution for theft etc will continue in all the 14 FIRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surprising-top-court-on-mp-govt-supporting-illegal-miners-who-paid-fine/story-jviJnycd9DbPQvdYPJJbAK.html

The farmers have so far held four rounds of talks with the government, but the impasse has not ended and the borders of Delhi, where the protest is going on, are choked. The protests were launched by farmers of Haryana and Punjab, but those from Uttar Pradesh later joined them.“Yesterday, we told the government that the farm laws should be withdrawn. On December 5, effigies of PM Modi will be burnt across the country. We have given a call for Bharat Bandh on December 8,” said HS Lokwal, the general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Lakhowal).Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at the borders of the national capital demanding that the bills passed by Parliament in September be withdrawn.“We need to take this protest forward. The government has to take back the farm laws,” said Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha.The farmers are protesting against The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Earlier, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said the farmers are hoping that the government will meet their demands during the fifth round of talks scheduled on December 5, failing which they will continue their protests against the new farm laws.“The government and the farmers did not reach any decision during the meeting held on Thursday. The government wants to make amendments to the three laws, but we want the laws to be completely repealed. “If the government does not agree to our demands, we will continue to protest. We are looking to find out what happens in Saturday’s meeting,” Tikait told news agency PTI.The government had invited the farm leaders for fourth round of talks on Thursday, but the it remaind inconclusive. The two sides are scheduled to meet on Saturday again.The farmer community has expressed apprehension that the new laws are “anti-farmer”, and would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-call-for-bharat-bandh-on-december-8-demand-immediate-withdrawal-of-farm-laws/story-rDOtMIWbwIDDXsVuqeJ3eK.html

She said the vaccines that are being developed indigenously are on different platforms and each has its own benefits and challenges.“It is important to have a large basket of vaccines as we move forward because we really don’t know which one is going to be the best. It is not necessary that the first one is the best, you may have one coming later which is going to be better but it is difficult to say right now,” she said at a webinar.There are 30 vaccine candidates which are being developed within the country.   Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting phase-3 trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine, while the indigenously developed vaccine by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR has already started the phase-3 clinical trial.  Another indigenously-developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has also completed phase -2 clinical trial in the country.   Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Tuesday announced the start of adaptive phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India.Also, Biological E. Ltd has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.        Swarup said a lot of effort has gone in the development of the vaccine like building capacity for clinical trials. Stressing that vaccine development is a complex process, she said a lot of science has gone in making it.She said the DBT has an expert committee to track the development related to Covid-19 vaccine. The panel, which also has experts from within the country and outside, meet every two weeks to discuss not just with the academic research groups but also the vaccine manufacturers and developers to understand what they need for its development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/important-to-have-large-basket-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-dbt-secy/story-Tc4FdzPEzQML1ADVQoULmI.html

The army chief is set to make a four-day visit to the two key West Asian powers from December 6 against the backdrop of the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan normalising relations with Israel. Commentators said this is possibly the first visit to Saudi Arabia by an Indian Army chief. India has welcomed the normalisation of ties between Arab states such as the UAE and Israel, saying such moves are in line with its efforts to back peace and development in West Asia, which is part of the country’s “extended neighbourhood”. Zikrur Rahman, a former envoy to Palestine who also served several stints in Saudi Arabia, described the upcoming visit as a “good beginning” that signals India’s desire to upgrade the security relationship with both West Asian states. It is in line with the decision by India and Saudi Arabia during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit last year to create a strategic partnership council to monitor ties. Also read | Revival of US navy formation focused on Indian Ocean, partnership with India: US Official“The Saudis are now acting to boost their own national interests and the visit will be an opportunity for India to convey our own narrative on matters such as the border situation with China. It could even help to ensure that China is sidelined,” Rahman said, referring to the Saudi leadership’s openness to economic ties with China. “The West was never in favour of ties with China and Saudi Arabia has remained in that bloc. Besides, this trip will allow India to focus on defence cooperation and ways to strengthen matters such as intelligence-sharing,” he said. Both Rahman and Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the Indian Army chief’s visit had to be seen in the context of Israel’s growing ties with Arab states and Iran’s efforts to position itself as a key player in West Asia. “The Saudis have concerns about Iran – such as Iran’s recent agreement with China – and feel their leadership is under threat because of recent developments related to Israel but they will insist on a solution for the Palestine issue. Such a visit from India could also be a way to mount pressure on Pakistan to not get closer to Iran,” Rahman said. “The regional dynamics are rapidly changing and even Pakistan has moved away from Saudi Arabia and the UAE and tried to form an alternative Islamic front with Malaysia and Turkey,” Patil said. “This visit sends multiple signals to multiple players.” Patil also pointed to reports of mediation by the Saudi and UAE leadership during last year’s India-Pakistan standoff triggered by the Pulwama suicide bombing and said New Delhi’s defence and security cooperation with Arab states has so far focused largely on counter-terrorism, including sharing of information on Pakistan-based terror groups. The upcoming visit could be seen as part of India’s efforts to broad-base security ties to include more military exchanges and exercises, Patil said. “An obvious outcome will be a reciprocal visit by the Saudi Army chief,” he added. India and Saudi Arabia signed an MoU on defence cooperation in 2014 and both sides are exploring the possibility of joint production and joint exercises, particularly joint naval drills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-s-visit-to-saudi-arabia-uae-signals-india-s-intention-to-boost-security-cooperation-say-experts/story-bzM01ddX0VINxEEbwasD9H.html

04-12-2020||India||In new policy, Jharkhand to tap private investment for boosting tourism||Jharkhand has drafted a new tourism policy focusing more on private investment, employment, tourism promotion and education.In a bid to attract investment to develop tourism, the policy has proposed a 30% subsidy on total capital investment for developing any tourism facilities in Jharkhand, officials said on Friday. Besides, the policy also aims to generate employment for around one lakh people in the sector through short-term and long-term planning.The draft policy was submitted to chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday evening and it got approval in-principle. After inclusion of CM’s suggestions in the draft policy, it will be forwarded to the state cabinet for final approval, said tourism director A Dodde.Jharkhand had announced its first ever tourism policy in 2015. However, it failed to attract investments. The Soren government which came to power last year, decided to revise the policy and make it more attractive.Dodde said, “We have offered 30% flat subsidy or Rs 10 crore, which is lower, on capital investment for developing tourism facilities such as hotels, parks, resorts or others in the state. The subsidy will be 35% for developing the same in tribal districts.”He said 2015 policy failed to fetch desired results, as it hardly drew investments. “So, we made it more attractive for private investors,” he said.The federation of Jharkhand chamber of commerce and industries (FJCCI) has welcomed the subsidy initiative of the government. “Investors basically want safety, security and incentive. I believe the subsidy initiative will attract the private investors in the tourism sector,” said Shailesh Agarwal, sub-committee (tourism) chairman of FJCCI.The tourism director said the policy was drafted after studying the tourism policies of various states including Gujarat, Rajasthan and Kerala. “This would be one of the best policies of the country,” he said.Even though tourists’ inflow has increased manifolds since the state’s inception in November 2000, safety and security of tourists have been a major issue in the state due to left wing extremism in some ports of the state.In 2000, when Jharkhand came into being, just 4.53 lakh tourists, including 3,111 foreigners, visited the state. But the number rose to 3.55 crore in 2018-19 including 1.76 lakh foreign tourists. Chief minister Soren asked the officials to develop a tourist tracking system and documentation of places of tourists’ interest. “The system will help monitor tourists’ safety and security and it will also guide them where to visit during their journey,” Dodde said.Geo-tagging and demarcation of tourism destinations are also being done. The demarcation of tourist places would help the people who want to conduct film shoots or events. The department is also working on a single window system for tourism so that people could get all the information or formalities from one spot, officials said.Dodde said the hospitality and tourism sectors have immense potential to generate employment. “We are targeting to create 75,000 to one lakh employments in the sectors in coming years,” he said.On the lines of the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), a Food Craft Institute at Deoghar has also been proposed in the draft policy, which will offer certificate, diploma and degree courses.The draft policy also mentions various tourism circuits such as religious, eco, cultural, rural, adventure, film and mining.Pradip Dasgupta, a tourist from West Bengal who visited Hundru falls in Ranchi on Friday, said, “Security, proper information and well managed tourist places are the basic things that attract tourists. In Jharkhand, there are very few places which provide all these. I think tourism department should work on this line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-new-policy-jharkhand-to-tap-private-investment-for-boosting-tourism/story-ljP9F02DcTcpCHKDiAiAbP.html

She was travelling on the train with her husband in a sleeper coach.Puja’s phone is switched off and her relatives have approached the railway GRP. The incident yet again raised questions on the security of passengers travelling in trains. “The family boarded the train from the Samastipur railway station on the evening of December 2 in a sleeper compartment. The husband says he was woken up by cries for help from his wife and kids but could not find them in the coach.The husband of the missing woman then filed a complaint with the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Tata Nagar railway station after a rigorous search was conducted for his wife and children, police said. Sandip Kumar Jha, a native of Madhubani district who works in a private company at Jugsalai (Tata) in Jharkhand, said he suspected his wife and children had been abducted because they went missing with two luggage bags containing cash, ATM cards, gold ornaments and cell phones.Sandip complaint filed with the Tata Nagar Railway station GRP was transferred to Asansol GRP. Officers of Tata Nagar GRP were not ready to comment on the possible reasons for the woman and her children’s disappearance.Also Read: Auto driver, accomplice held for raping mentally-ill woman in Ludhiana  According to Sandip, the family together had dinner at around 8.30 pm when the train was passing through Barauni Junction before they went to sleep.

I am sure she was abducted,” said Sandip.The couple were married on April 22, 2016. Asansol GRP officials said they had started a probe and were in touch with their counterparts in Jharkhand. They, however, didn’t rule out a possible theory that the woman could have deboarded with her children at Asansol Junction on her own.“The information with the photos of missing persons has already been sent to all the stations in the route. Our officers are exploring all possible angles but cannot say right now whether it is a case of abduction,” said Niladri Chakraborty, superintendent of rail police (Howrah).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-and-her-2-children-vanish-from-a-train-in-west-bengal-probe-begins/story-nr77NGJpFRbJN4BfUFz6FL.html

For uploading data a link has been provided on the website of the Delhi State Health Mission, according to a public notice published in a national daily.Hundreds of healthcare workers (HCWs) at government and private facilities in Delhi had contracted the novel coronavirus, and many more are still getting affected by it.“Delhi government is enrolling healthcare workers for Covid-19 vaccination. Many registered nursing homes and hospitals have already submitted data, along with many smaller unregistered clinics,” the notice said.The Delhi government invites all those remaining healthcare facilities to submit the names of healthcare workers in their institutions, nursing homes, clinics and OPDs, it said.Healthcare workers include medical and paramedical staff, supporting, security and administrative staff of all allopathic, dental, AYUSH, physiotherapy clinics, diagnostic laboratories, radiology centres and other healthcare settings, the notice said.According to Union Health Ministry officials, the anti-coronavirus vaccine, once available, would be distributed under a special Covid-19 inoculation programme, using processes, technology and network of the existing Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP).The government has initiated preparations for introduction of Covid-19 vaccine upon its availability and as part of it, one of the activities is creating a database of healthcare workers who will be prioritised for coronavirus vaccine.Also, the Centre in a letter to states and union territories has said MBBS and BDS doctors as well as interns, staff nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives and pharmacists would be considered as potential vaccinators, for carrying out the drive, provided that they are actively involved in day-to-day provision of clinical care and have experience in administering injections.Delhi recorded 3,734 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday with over 70,000 tests being conducted for the second consecutive day, even as the positivity rate dipped to 4.96 per cent, authorities said.The Thursday health bulletin said that the total number of cases has climbed to 5,82,058, while the recovery rate stood at over 93 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-tells-healthcare-facilities-to-submit-workers-data-for-covid-19-vaccination/story-vkxbxzHJKDYmM99fumBrCI.html

The firm is looking at setting up a plant in the country with its Indian partners to supply specialised refrigerated vaccine transportation boxes and freezers.The cold chain is counted among the biggest challenges in the logistics of reaching the coronavirus vaccine to people across the country.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine shots, the first vaccine cleared for use by any government, need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. Moderna’s vaccine has to be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius for shipping and longer-term storage of up to six months, but it can be kept at regular refrigeration temperatures for up to 10 days, according to a Reuters report.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has indicated that India may not go for the Pfizer vaccine but will wait a few weeks more for one that is made in the country. “The world is looking at a cheap but effective vaccine against Covid-19. The world is looking at India,” he said.Officials said price is one factor. Another is the logistics of delivery. PM Modi told the all party meeting that the government was looking into the storage and transportation logistics of the vaccine.Officials said the logistics challenge of the vaccine had figured in PM Modi’s conversation with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel last month who offered help to set up a vaccine cold chain via B Medical Systems.B Medical Systems chief executive officer Luc Provost and deputy chief executive officer Jesal Doshi are arriving in the country on Saturday and will hold meetings with top officials of NITI Aayog and the ministries of health and external affairs over the next two days beginning Sunday.They will then travel to Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad for meetings with the three companies that are working on India’s top candidates for the Covid vaccine; Hyderabad’s Bharat Biotech and Pune’s Serum Institute of India and Ahmedabad’s Zydus Biotech Park.B Medical Systems, which has the technology to store vaccines at minus 80 degree Celsius, intends to eventually build a plant in Gujarat. But this will take time and in the interim, the company is expected to import boxes that can be used to transport vaccines as soon as production starts.In September, the company website says, it had partnered with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to donate equipment for the storage of critical Covid-19 vaccines to a Mumbai hospital where clinical trials were being conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-talks-with-luxembourg-firm-on-cold-chain-for-covid-vaccine/story-rjwEPOQudBc9tjf6jeo43H.html

However, the Congress alleged that the government has no roadmap for the poor population of the country, or people who are not frontline workers. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the the government is reiterating that those who need vaccination will get vaccine. “But who’s going to decide this? No plan was discussed how the vaccine will be given to the poor,” Chowdhury said.This comes amid confusion over how many people the government plans to vaccinate. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has recently said that the government never spoke about vaccinating the entire country. Director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research Balram Bhargava also said that if a critical mass of people is identified and vaccinated that helps break the virus transmission, then there will be no need to vaccinate the entire population.According to centre’s plan, initially 30 crore frontline workers will be vaccinated against the Covid-19. “Priority in this (vaccination) will be given to the healthcare workers involved in treating Covid-19 patients, frontline workers and old people suffering from serious conditions,” PM Modi said during Friday’s meeting.“Our scientists are very confident of succeeding in their endeavour of developing a vaccine against Covid-19. There are names of vaccines from different countries doing the rounds in the market, but the world is keeping a watch on having the cheapest and safest vaccine. That is why, it is natural that the world is watching India,” PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-no-vaccine-roadmap-for-poor-says-congress-after-all-party-meet/story-P8J6baRNGm6SG12fOP1idK.html

Das before donning the hat of RBI Governor was a career bureaucrat and was directly involved in crafting of about 10 Budgets for the country including one in the aftermath of global financial meltdown in different capacities at the Finance Ministry. In view of unprecedented pandemic and its impact on the economy, he said the government has maintained fiscal prudence in the response to deal with the crisis. “Naturally when we are recovering from a massive damage which pandemic has brought on the Indian economic, the budget has to be growth oriented. And also, let us keep in mind that during this year also, all the fiscal measures which the government has announced, I think has been very well calibrated very well targeted, and they have been very prudently drawn out,” he said during interaction with the media after the policy announcement. In fact, at the beginning of the pandemic, there was worry that the government’s fiscal deficit will go haywire, he said, adding it has not gone beyond control.“I think the response of the government (so far) has been very calibrated and prudent. So, the budget next year also I expect to be very prudent but naturally, it has to be a growth oriented budget. That is something which is bound to happen. It’s a no-brainer. It has to be a good supporting budget,” he said. While unveiling fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review, Das said the economy is recuperating faster than anticipated and growth rate is likely to turn positive in the second half of the current financial year. In the year as whole, the economy is likely to contract by 7.5 per cent, which is an improvement over Reserve Bank’s previous projection of 9.5 per cent contraction, the Governor said. The economy contracted by 23.9 per cent in the first quarter and 7.5 per cent in the second quarter on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. Observing that the prospects of growth have brightened with the progress on the vaccine front, Das said, the economy was likely to record a growth of 0.1 per cent in Q3 and 0.7 per cent in Q4. “Data that have become available for Q3:2020-21 confirm that the economy is recuperating faster than anticipated and more sectors are joining the multi-speed upturn that I had highlighted in my statement in October,” Das added. The finance ministry has already started the exercise to prepare the annual Budget for 2021-22 from October 16. It will be the third budget of the Modi 2.0 government and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The budget will have to address critical issues pertaining to growth contraction and subdued revenue collection triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Budget 2021-22 is likely to be presented on February 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government scrapped a colonial-era tradition of presenting the Budget at the end of February. The then finance minister Arun Jaitley had for the first time presented the annual accounts on February 1, 2017. With the preponement of the Budget, ministries are now allocated their budgeted funds from the start of the financial year beginning April. This gives government departments more leeway to spend as well as allow companies time to adapt to business and taxation plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-year-budget-to-be-prudent-growth-oriented-says-rbi-governor/story-NLP0nyjrJsV5GoqSjJOIHJ.html

He said the agency should be allotted an alternative plot away from the sanctuary.In his letter, Choudhury cited communication by forest department officials indicating how construction activity by NDRF at the plot would hurt wildlife and lead to human-animal conflicts.“As evident from the correspondences of the Assam forest department, it is crystal clear that land allotted to NDRF is crucial for wildlife conservation as it is home to several species of wild animals including the Indian elephant,” Choudhury wrote.“The plot... is located next to the government land... [and is] to be a deemed forest with an average of 250 teak trees with girth class of 30-100 cm,” the local range officer wrote to Guwahati’s divisional forest officer last month and added the area falls under the eco-sensitive zone of the sanctuary.The All-Assam Students Union has also opposed the allotment of land to NDRF and urged the state government to reconsider the move.Assam forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said he was unaware of the exact nature of the issue.NDRF officials were unavailable for comments as they were reportedly busy in meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-over-land-allotment-to-ndrf-near-amchang-wildlife-sanctuary-in-assam/story-pqqx0IdLQLhKSmdwLYDZ5H.html

Cash-strapped Pakistan’s economic woes have further worsened due to the coronavirus pandemic and Khan’s government is arranging finances from world bodies, including the International Monetary Fund, to tide over the crisis.Presenting a 10-point agenda for urgent action before the UN General Assembly special session on Covid-19 on Thursday, Khan underlined the measures the international community needs to take to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic, the Dawn newspaper reported.The first item on his list is a request for debt suspension till the end of the pandemic for low-income and most affected countries. The second one is “cancellation of debt of least developed countries” that are no longer in a position to repay their loans, it said.Other items on the agenda include restructuring of the public sector debt of other developing countries under an agreed inclusive multilateral framework; a general allocation of special drawing rights of USD 500 billion; expanded concessional financing to lower income countries through multilateral development banks; and creation of a new ‘liquidity and sustainability facility’, which should provide short-term loans at lower costs.The novel coronavirus has so far infected 410,072 people and claimed 8,260 lives in Pakistan. Addressing the session, Khan said the coronavirus pandemic is the most serious global crisis since the Second World War. Nearly 100 world leaders and several dozen ministers are participating in the two-day virtual UNGA special session that began on Thursday. Pakistan’s agenda also includes a reminder to rich nations to fulfill 0.7 per cent of their official development assistance commitments and mobilising the required USD 1.5 trillion annual investment in sustainable infrastructure. The prime minister also urged the international community to help meet the agreed target of mobilising USD 100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries, the report said. Khan also called for immediate action to stop the massive illicit financial outflows from developing countries to rich countries, to offshore tax havens. He also suggested immediate return of assets stolen by corrupt politicians and criminals back to these countries. Earlier in his opening remarks at the special session, UNGA President Volkan Bozkir said, “Today marks an overdue and much-needed moment of reckoning. None of us could have imagined, this time last year, what was to come.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “it is time to reset” the global response to crises like this. “As we build a strong recovery, we must seize the opportunity for change,” he added. The deadly virus has infected nearly 65 million people across the world and killed close to 1.5 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-strapped-pakistan-seeks-debt-suspension-till-covid-19-crisis-gets-over/story-1BqlDphBPwWC6q3xtKumfP.html

It has claimed that the other two accused in the case were paying Sharma large amounts of money, routed through shell companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-journalist-rajeev-sharma-in-espionage-case/story-Zl7LuQtoTevW2Pzz08dgcK.html
04-12-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi’s leadership lacks consistency, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has said Rahul Gandhi’s leadership has a “few problems” and lacks consistency even though he is likely to be reappointed as his party’s next president since Congress leaders and workers still have faith in the Nehru-Gandhi family’s leadership. In an interview with Marathi newspaper Lokmat’s YouTube channel, Pawar maintained Congress is the only alternative to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Among Congress leaders, the Gandhi-Nehru family still has high respect and they would want Rahul to lead the party. The acceptability of the leadership by others within the party is important. I would not like to talk about the internal affairs of any other party,” said Pawar. He criticised the BJP over its policies while calling on the Congress to bring like-minded parties together to build up a strong alternative to the ruling party at the Centre.Pawar quit the Congress in 1999 to form the NCP. The NCP has since been the Congress’s key ally since and the two parties have shared power in Maharashtra and at the Centre. The two parties are currently part of the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government.Pawar said former US President Barack Obama has no business commenting upon the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, who stepped down as the Congress chief after the party dismal performance in the 2019 national elections. “I think Obama should have avoided such remarks. Any political leader should restrain from any comments about the leadership of other countries and the political outfits as a matter of political decency. Canada has issued a statement about the farmers’ protest in India and our central government has rightly given a reply to it.”In his memoir A Promised Land, Obama wrote Rahul Gandhi has “a nervous, unformed quality about him as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject”, according to a review in the New York Times.Pawar said it is high time for big parties like Congress to take the lead to bring other parties together to build an alternative to the BJP. “There are many parties that do not stand with the BJP’s policies and have been openly speaking against them. West Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee has been taking the BJP head-on consistently. In such a scenario, Congress and the Left parties should come forward and join hands with leaders like Mamta by keeping the differences aside.”He said it could not happen because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “But I think it can happen during the forthcoming parliament session [in February].”Pawar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government does not believe in dialogue with the opposition parties. “Except for the meetings on Covid-19 pandemic, the central government never attempted to have a dialogue with other parties. This has never happened in history,” he said. Pawar said the Modi government should have had an effective dialogue with the agitating farmers on the contentious issues related to the farm laws passed in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-leadership-lacks-consistency-says-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar/story-XjBSZrxSkMOqOOvVo6hpYN.html

It is not required,” the Chief Minister told reporters in Bengaluru.Yediyurappa said he is making every effort to take all the communities along.He underlined that he is doing everything to give prominence to Kannada language.“I have already given prominence to Kannada and I am ready to do whatever is required to be done to make Kannada prominent,” the Chief Minister said.Various pro-Kannada organisations are up in arms against the formation of the Maratha Development Authority, which the Chief Minister had announced on November 14 and earmarked Rs 50 crore for the ‘overall development of Maratha people’.These organisations on Friday reaffirmed their resolve to hold the bandh on Saturday demanding that the government give up its decision to form the MDA.Vatal Nagaraj, who is leading the agitation, said in Bengaluru the agitation is for Kannada pride.“I want to tell Yediyurappa -- You withdraw the ‘Authority’ (MDA), I will garland you at the Vidhana Soudha.But don’t threaten us. We will not get scared of it,” Nagaraj said.He alleged that the government threatened various organisations using police to withdraw support to the bandh but it will not work.Film producer Sa Ra Govindu, various factions of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike including Praveen Shetty and T A Narayana Gowda, Ola-Uber drivers association and a few auto rickshaw unions have extended their support to the Bandh.However, government offices, hotels, bus services and metro services will remain open.In view of the bandh call, the police have beefed up security across the state to prevent any untoward incident and forcible closure of shops and commercial establishments.In Bengaluru, about 14,000 policemen will be deployed.The move to set up the MDA was seen as an attempt to woo Marathas who are dominant in Basava Kalyan in Bidar district, bordering with Maharashtra.Assembly by-election is due in Basava Kalyan following the death of the sitting Congress MLA B Narayan Rao due to coronavirus a few months ago.The decision led to the growing clamour for various other development authorities and development corporations.The government further announced the formation of Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Corporation with a fund of Rs 500 crore.Basava Kalyan is an important pilgrimage for the people of Lingayat sect, as it was the ‘Karmabhoomi’ of the founder of the sect and 12th century social reformer Basaveshwara.Yet, these measures did not impress the pro-Kannada organisations.They want the government to withdraw the MDA for the reason that Marathis keep demanding secession of Belagavi district from Karnataka and merger with Maharashtra as the district has a sizeable Marathi population for being at the border of the two states.The Belagavi-based Maharasthra Ekikaran Samiti, which led the agitation for the merger of Belagavi with Maharashtra had even managed to send some of its members to the Karnataka Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yediyurappa-appeals-to-pro-kannada-outfits-to-give-up-karnataka-bandh-plans-on-saturday/story-FHxRdoAqvKtHnQhkBuInwL.html

The move signalled India’s ire over remarks by the Canadian leadership that have been perceived in New Delhi as interference in the country’s internal affairs. Trudeau triggered a diplomatic row on Tuesday when he told a Facebook video interaction organised to mark the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, that his government had conveyed its concerns over the farmers’ protest to New Delhi. In a swift reaction hours after Trudeau’s comments, the external affairs ministry had dismissed them as “unwarranted”. Also Watch Guru Nanak Jayanati: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Justin Trudeau extend wishes On Friday, the Canadian high commissioner was summoned to the external affairs ministry and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that said the “comments by the Canadian Prime Minister, some Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament on issues relating to Indian farmers constitute an unacceptable interference in our internal affairs”, according to an official statement. “Such actions, if continued, would have a seriously damaging impact on ties between India and Canada,” the statement said. The statement further said the comments by the Canadian leadership had “encouraged gatherings of extremist activities in front of our high commission and consulates in Canada that raise issues of safety and security”. “We expect the Canadian government to ensure the fullest security of Indian diplomatic personnel and its political leaders to refrain from pronouncements that legitimise extremist activism,” it added. During the Facebook interaction organised by Canadian MP Bardish Chagger, Trudeau had said, “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and we’re all very worried about family and friends. “I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” The virtual interaction was joined by Canadian ministers Navdeep Bains and Harjit Sajjan, lawmakers and prominent members of the Sikh community. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Trudeau’s comments were apparently aimed at Canada’s influential Indian-origin diaspora, particularly the Sikh community. Canada currently has 18 Sikh MPs, including 13 from Trudeau’s Liberal Party. Trudeau was the first world leader to comment on the protest by Indian farmers, which the government is trying to end through talks with farmers’ leaders. The protest is aimed against a set of laws to liberalise farm trade and open up agricultural markets. The comments weren’t viewed favourably in New Delhi because they came at a time when both India and Canada have been making efforts to restore normalcy to bilateral ties hit by Ottawa’s perceived softness on pro-Khalistan activists during Trudeau’s first term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mea-summons-canadian-envoy-over-pm-trudeau-s-remarks-on-farmers-protest/story-HrRuvW65KrzGUYduVJ918J.html

04-12-2020||India||Punjab farmers have brought ‘superman’ Modi government to its knees, says Shiv Sena||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Friday said the ongoing farmers’ protests against the three farm laws enacted in September have brought the Narendra Modi government to its knees. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, it added that the “superman” Modi government has not suffered such a blow and embarrassment over the last six years. The editorial said the farmers have belied the notion that Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah do not bend to anyone.Farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for over a week now against the farm laws. They say the legislation will allow big businesses to control prices and take away their minimum guaranteed earnings.“Even in the cold weather, the farmers from Punjab have made the Modi government sweat. The superman Modi government has not been in such trouble and never faced such embarrassment in the last six years,” the editorial said. It added the protests have put immense pressure on the Modi government.The editorial took a dig at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying its usual weapons such as the Central Bureau of Investigation cannot do anything about the protests. Also read | Farmers’ protest: On road but right at home inside their trucks, tractorsOpposition parties have accused the government of using the central agencies for political victimisation.The editorial said the farmers have “sent a notice to the Modi government to move back or leave the chair”. “Campaigns were launched to defame the farmers’ movement but tables instead turned on the IT [Information Technology] cell of the BJP.”The editorial lauded the solidarity Punjab’s artists and politicians have shown over the issue. It wondered when will Maharashtra show such unity. “We are talking about unity because it is the biggest success. Punjab’s artists, singers, sportspersons have decided to return their national awards.” It added by returning awards, they are supporting the farmers. The editorial said it is high time the Centre listens to the farmers. Shiv Sena ended its decades-long alliance with the BJP last year to form the government in Maharashtra with Nationalist Congress Party and Congress’s help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-farmers-have-brought-superman-modi-government-to-its-knees-says-shiv-sena/story-Lfk1qrzGEGcnNxVOdMAbXO.html

We will start the trial as soon as we get the vaccine from the government,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, hospital dean. In the last week of October, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) selected the hospital for the third phase, pan India trial, of Covaxin. As many as 1,000 volunteers between 18 and 60 years will be included in the trial. Of this, 20% volunteers with co-morbidities will be selected and 5% will comprise medical health workers.

04-12-2020||India||Maharashtra: Big blow to BJP as MVA seems set to bag four of six seats in legislative council||In a major setback to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has almost won four out of six seats in legislative council elections. Though the results for two seats of teachers’ constituencies are yet to be announced officially, the margin between the top two candidates is huge and unlikely to change.Three graduates’ constituencies from Aurangabad, Nagpur and Pune, two teachers’ constituencies from Pune and Amravati, and local bodies constituency in Dhule-Nandurbar went to polls on December 1. Out of the six seats, four have virtually been bagged by MVA comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress. Independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik, who is leading in Amravati teachers’ constituency, is also likely to support the ruling alliance in the Upper House.Abhijit Wanjari of Congress has defeated BJP’s Sandip Joshi with a huge margin from Nagpur graduate constituency. The BJP had retained the constituency since its inception and was represented by Union minister Nitin Gadkari five times and also by late Gangadharrao Fadnavis, father of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Similarly, in Pune, NCP’s Arun Lad has won in graduates’ constituency while and Congress’s Jayant Asgaonkar is leading with a heavy margin in teachers’ constituency. Both the seats have spelt failure for the BJP.NCP’s Satish Chavan has won from the Aurangabad graduates’ constituency for the third time in a row. His margin was more than 57,000 votes and he defeated BJP’s Shirish Boralkar.In Amravati teachers’ constituency, independent candidate Kiran Sarnaik was ahead of his nearest rivals Shrikant Deshpande of Shiv Sena with a comfortable majority.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Amrish Patel won bypolls from Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies constituency by defeating Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s Abhijit Patil by 234 votes. Patel polled 332 votes, while Patil got 98 votes. Congress leaders have expressed surprise over the defeat as MVA has 213 members in local bodies, while BJP’s strength is 199. Patel had changed sides to join BJP by quitting Congress ahead of the assembly polls last year.This is being seen as a big victory for the ruling MVA which has announced to contest all the elections, including that to the local bodies, together in the future. Ruling party leaders have said that it is a token of acceptance of the MVA leadership. “BJP has been decimated in 24 districts in the state during the council elections which were fought directly. This is ‘Maharashtra Express’ of MVA,” said former chief minister, public works department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan.“The results are not as per our expectations as we were expecting more seats to win. We miscalculated the combined power of the three ruling parties under MVA,” said Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-big-blow-to-bjp-as-mva-seems-set-to-bag-four-of-six-seats-in-legislative-council/story-z99J3fZeiRD6VFc9W3tMYP.html
04-12-2020||India||Revival of US navy formation focused on Indian Ocean, partnership with India: US Official||The US Navy’s move to revive a tactical formation focused on the Indian and Pacific Oceans is aimed at emphasising the growing importance of the region and the strategic partnership with India, a top American defence official has said. Kenneth Braithwaite, secretary of the US Navy or the senior-most civilian official in the department of the navy, made the remarks while testifying before the US Senate armed services subcommittee on Wednesday. Braithwaite had last month announced the US Navy’s plan to re-establish the First Fleet, one of the “numbered fleets” or major tactical units, and deploy it in the “crossroads between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans”. Asked by a senator during his appearance before the Senate subcommittee whether the move is meant to emphasise the Indo-Pacific’s growing importance and the strategic relationship the US has with countries such as India and members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, he replied: “That’s exactly right, senator.” Braithwaite said the First Fleet will be reconstituted to improve the US posture in the Indo-Pacific and the formation will be given the “primary responsibility for the Indo and South Asian region as an expeditionary fleet” with an “agile, mobile, at-sea command”. “This will reassure our allies and partners of our presence and commitment to this region, while ensuring any potential adversary knows we are committed to global presence to ensure rule of law and freedom of the seas,” he added. Also Read: China defends dam on Brahmaputra, India hits backThe US move assumes significance because of the current focus on China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, especially the South China Sea. The US and other members of the Quad – India, Australia and Japan – have said they are committed to freedom of navigation and a rules-based order in this region. The First Fleet, which functioned from January 1947 to February 1973, is being revived because the Japan-based 7th Fleet covers the maritime territories of 36 countries in the area between Hawaii and the India-Pakistan border. Braithwaite said this causes “formidable challenges” for the 7th Fleet in covering a massive expanse of water. Also Read: Army chief to visit Saudi Arabia, UAE from SundayThough Braithwaite had said last month that the revived First Fleet could be based in Singapore, he told the Senate subcommittee it would initially function without a land-based headquarters. “We are still determining...where that fleet would operate from. But its major focus would be on the Western Pacific and the Eastern Indian Ocean,” he added. The US Navy currently has seven active numbered fleets. Each numbered fleet has task forces and other units for specific operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revival-of-us-navy-formation-focused-on-indian-ocean-partnership-with-india-us-official/story-DtX0f3hNJ41DetJOAarn6N.html
04-12-2020||India||Covid vaccine could be ready in next few weeks, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi told an all-party meeting on Friday that in next few weeks, Indian manufacturers would be able to produce the much-awaited Covid-19 vaccines. He also gave enough indication that India will use indigenously made vaccines as he talked about cheap but effective vaccines. Both Moderna and Pfizer candidates are much higher priced than India’s potential immunisation candidates. Talking about India’s vaccine preparations, the Prime Minister said, “Experts believe we don’t have to wait for a long period to get a vaccine. It is understood that in next few weeks, Covid vaccines will be ready. The government is waiting for a go-ahead from the scientists.” While the steeply-priced Pfizer vaccine has already got emergency authorisation from UK and vaccination there is set to start next week, Prime Minister Modi indicated that his government is likely to wait for a vaccine that is made in India. “The world is looking at a cheap but effective vaccine against Covid-19. The world is looking at India. You can be assured our scientists are working hard. Eight Covid vaccines are at different stages of preparedness in India. This includes the three Indian vaccines that are at different stages of trials.” Also Watch | ‘Healthcare and frontline workers, elderly will be vaccinated first’: PM Modi Also read | India registers 36,595 Covid cases in last 24 hours, total recoveries exceed 9 millionThe Prime Minister also added that teams of Central and state governments are working together for vaccine distribution. The PM, for the first time, also laid down the principles of vaccine administration. “The first priority would be given to healthcare workers, frontline workers and old people with comorbidities.” He also told the parliamentary leaders of different parties that India has the best expertise and capacity in vaccine distribution—indicating the existing vaccine network of universal immunisation. “We have a large and experienced network in vaccination. We will fully use it.” The expansive network of India’s long-standing universal immunisation programme will provide the crucial logistical support for the government for administering Covid vaccines next year, HT had reported on Monday. Officials involved in the planning told HT that they expect the existing infrastructure and human resources would be sufficient to vaccinate the first 30 million Indians or the priority groups 1 and 2. But India might need to substantially beef up its capacities if it needs to give vaccines to the priority group of aged population.

04-12-2020||India||Petiton in SC challenges bigamy under Shariat law||Five Hindu women and a NGO have approached the Supreme Court challenging the practice of bigamy permitted under Muslim personal law.The petition claimed that while there exists a clear bar under law on polygamous relationships under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which makes it punishable, such personal laws make its provision discriminatory as other religions are unable to enjoy this benefit. The petition filed by advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain said, “In India, the irony is that bigamy has been made punishable under Section 494 of IPC, subject to applicability of personal law. The question is as to whether the State can make criminal law in such a manner which may create discrimination and same act may be punishable for someone but for others enjoyable.”Also read | PIL challenges UP ‘love jihad’ law in SC, says misuse likelyTwo of the petitioners are married women while the NGO petitioner is Jan Udghosh Sansthan based in Uttar Pradesh. The petition has sought striking down Section 2 of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 which recognises the system of bigamy or polygamy prevalent in Muslim community. It said, “The system of bigamy is the history of past and has no place in present day scenario at International level. There is unanimity between nations that such a practice is unscrupulous, discriminatory, exploitative and anti-women, and must come to an end.”Section 494 of IPC provides that “whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine”.The petition has said that there should be unanimity in the field of penal law relating to prohibition of bigamy. The petitioners have prayed that the words “in any case in which such marriage is void by reasons of its taking place” occurring in Section 494 of IPC be read down or struck down as the same is discriminatory and oppressive for women and will be hit by Article 14 (right to equality) and 15(1) (Right against discrimination) of the Constitution of India.The petition has even assailed the bigamy law under Shariat to be against a recommendation by United Nations Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) of October 30,2013, where the global rights body said, “State parties should take all legislative and policy measures needed to abolish polygamous marriages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petiton-in-sc-challenges-bigamy-under-shariat-law/story-jj8rGPTKxITgYQe3vj9QGM.html

He recalled how Gujral and his family were imprisoned during the Quit India Movement against the British colonialists in the 1940s.“He [Gujral] was a soft-spoken, gentle politician who never compromised on his values,” Naidu said. “He was courteous to a fault and made friends across the political spectrum. A multifaceted personality, [he] enjoyed reading and reciting poetry and authored many books,” Naidu said.He asked younger people to take inspiration from Gujral and work towards the country’s peace and development.Naidu highlighted the rise of state-sponsored terrorism in India and urged the South Asian nations to come together to fight the scourge. “The menace of terrorism can hinder the realisation of a prosperous future for all in South Asia,” he said. “The time has come for the nations to play a more proactive role and step-up efforts in isolating nations sponsoring terrorist activities and imposing sanctions against them to deter them.”Naidu called for the greater participation of women in public life and praised Tamil Nadu for being the state with the highest number of women high court judges--30. “There is a gross underrepresentation of women in the judiciary,” he said. “Leadership is not just about physical attributes. Women must be provided with the opportunity to take on leadership roles in politics, corporate governance, and civil society. History shows us that whenever women are given this opportunity, they excel.”He said the 17th Lok Sabha has the highest number of women, but they account for only 14% of its strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/venkaiah-naidu-launches-commemorative-stamp-in-former-pm-gujral-s-honour/story-np0sx5s4WVeCAtO9pBuG1O.html

It also formulated a CMP after its return to power in 2010.“The process [for fresh CMP] has started. It will be announced soon. All our alliance partners are working on it,” said Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), leader Bashistha Narain Singh.NDA functionaries said the CMP has been necessitated as all the four alliance partners have spelt out their priorities through their manifestos. The JD (U) talked about its seven resolves-part 2 while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised 1.9 million jobs. “All those works will be given priority which can propel development in the next five years and were promised during the polls,” said an NDA leader.Also read | Poor selection, parachuting leaders spelled Cong debacle in BiharAccording to NDA leaders, the emphasis would be given to the seven-point programme of chief minister Nitish Kumar and create more employment opportunities.Ahead of the October-November polls, Kumar said he has delivered on all the seven resolves for governance made in 2015. He said if voted back to power, he would implement the freshly laid out seven-point programme.Kumar has promised irrigation for every agricultural land parcel, promotion of higher education and mega skill centres and a skills department. He announced programmes to develop entrepreneurship among women with the special assistance of ₹10 lakh.

04-12-2020||India||Nirmala Sitharaman to attend Founding Day of DRI today||The Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) will have a discussion on trade-based money laundering with representatives of Australian Border Force, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs from the UK, Customs Administration of the Netherlands and Interpol through a video conferencing on Friday, people familiar with the development said. The discussions will take place on the 63rd Founding Day of DRI on Friday through video conferencing. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will attend the celebrations along with minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur. Trade-based money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value through the use of trade transactions by individuals, criminal networks, terrorists etc; in an attempt to legitimise its illicit origins. This is achieved through the misrepresentation of the price, quantity or quality of imports or exports. It has been a cause of concern for global money laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which has defined the basic techniques of trade based money laundering as over and under-invoicing of goods and services; multiple invoicing of goods and services; over and under-shipments of goods and services; and falsely described goods and services. The Centre has, for past few years, stressed on cracking down on shell companies used to transfer illegal money through international trade. Referring to the shell companies, Thakur had said in Parliament in September this year that more than 380,000 companies have been struck off the official records under companies law in the past three years. He had said that such companies are used for illegal purpose, such as tax evasion, money laundering, obscuring ownership and benami properties. DRI is an important enforcement agency under the ministry of finance that deals with countering organised crime groups engaged in smuggling of contraband goods such as arms, ammunitions and explosives, narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, gold and diamonds, counterfeit currency notes, wildlife items, hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials and antiques. The directorate also has expertise in unearthing commercial frauds, plugging leakage of government’s tax revenue and countering trade based money laundering and black money. It has Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements with over 60 countries, where thrust is on information exchange and learning from the best practices between customs administrations. In Financial Year 2019-20, the DRI detected 412 cases of smuggling resulting in seizure of contraband worth Rs1,949 crore. Also, it arrested 837 economic offenders in different cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmala-sitharaman-to-attend-founding-day-of-dri-today/story-bPo7f2J9QVjjcMpsbsmjOM.html

Additionally, state agencies need to hand over approximately 2,000 ha.Also read | Uran fishermen allege indiscriminate destruction of mangroves, oppose JNPT’s park proposalAgencies such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority have to demarcate, identify, and transfer mangrove areas under their jurisdiction first to the revenue department, which will then verify their submissions and transfer areas to the forest department.Thackeray said, “In some places, the revenue and forest department data does not match, and there have been isolated stretches, formerly identified as mangrove areas, which has been deleted since trees were not identified on them. So, to address this, we have decided that both departments (revenue and forest) should work in tandem and state agencies can hand over mangrove areas under joint supervision for speedy transfer and protection of such areas.” From next month onwards, the entire process would be expedited, he said.During Thursday’s meeting, data were presented for four districts - Mumbai suburban, Thane, Palghar, and Raigad. For Mumbai suburban, data showed total mangrove area notified, as per the forest department record, was 3,948.5 ha while the same according to the revenue department was 3,723.4 ha. The revenue department claimed the entire mangrove land had been handed over to the forest department but the latter said 242 ha was yet to be handed over. An area of 27.48 ha was proposed for deletion while an inquiry into land rights settlement claims was pending across 1,750 ha by the sub-divisional officer. State bodies such as Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation were yet to hand over mangroves under their jurisdiction. Similar discrepancies were identified for land transfer between forest and revenue department data for other districts.“The idea is to get the undeclared mangroves under protection,” said Thackeray. He added that the first intent was to ensure all mangrove forests are protected under the IFA. “The confusion as to how much area belongs to which state agency will be clarified when all state bodies jointly study and assess each forest patch,” he said.Thackeray added that it was decided on Thursday that the Mangrove Cell and the Mangrove Foundation should put together a mangrove protection plan. “Using environment compensation funds from various infrastructure projects... a plan must be formulated for expediting the process of declaration, checking the error margin of why deletion of mangrove area is taking place, and ensuring overall protection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-ease-expedite-procedure-for-mangrove-land-transfer-to-forest-department/story-xGMmdKJGg56zhJb3G5kLaM.html

04-12-2020||India||RBI keeps repo rate unchanged, stance ‘accommodative’||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday kept its key lending rate unchanged for the third time in a row as widely expected amid high inflation and said it will maintain an accommodative stance, implying there could be more rate cuts in the future if need arises to support the economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The repo rate was left unchanged at 4% while the reverse repo rate or the key borrowing rate stayed at 3.35%.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep the repo rate unchanged. He also said the economy was rebounding faster than expected from a coronavirus-pademic induced slump earlier in the year but warned signs of recovery were far from being broad based. “MPC decided to continue with accommodative stands of monetary policy as long as necessary, at least till current financial year and into next year to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target,” Das said. “MPC decided to continue with accommodative stands of monetary policy as long as necessary, at least till current financial year and into next year to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target,” Das said.Repo is the rate at which the central bank lends funds to commercial banks when needed and RBI uses it as a tool to control inflation. Reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks.RBI has slashed the repo rate by 115 basis points or bps since late March to cushion the shock from the coronavirus crisis and sweeping lockdowns to check its spread. However, inflation has remained consistently above the upper end of the RBI’s mandated 2%-6% target range every month barring March this year, with core inflation also remaining sticky.Das also said that the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate remained unchanged at 4.25%. The central bank also changed its FY21 real GDP target, sees economy contracting by 7.5% from an estimation of a 9.5% contraction earlier. “The real GDP growth for FY21 is projected at -7.5% vs -9.5% projected earlier and H2FY21 is expected to show positive GDP growth,” Das said.Indian economy that shrank 23.9% in the first quarter of 2020-21 mainly due a nationwide lockdown because of Covid-19 pandemic, saw some improvement in the second quarter as contraction reduced to 7.5%. However, the retail inflation continued its surging streak for the ninth month in a row to reach 7.61% in October, highest since May 2014.Das said on Friday that the MPC expects this trend to persist and that the outlook for inflation has turned “adverse.” The MPC sees inflation in the current quarter at 6.8% before cooling slightly to 5.8% in the Jan-March quarter. Das also noted that consumer confidence for the next year has turned positive. RBI had last revised its policy rate on May 22, in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting interest rate to a historic low. The 26th meeting of the rate-setting MPC with three external members - Ashima Goyal, Jayanth R Varma and Shashanka Bhide - began on December 2. This is the second meeting of the members, who are appointed for a term of four years.The government moved the interest rate setting role from the RBI governor to the six-member MPC in 2016. Half of the panel, which is headed by the governor, is made up of external independent members.MPC has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4% until March 31 next year with an upper tolerance of 6% and a lower tolerance of 2%.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-addresses-news-briefing/story-fG6Y2yHBsFQjXS9sc0aFNO.html

The study found antibodies were also present in asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Neutralising antibodies defend cells from the virus.“...to say anything conclusively about protection against re-infection needs to be studied further,” said one of the authors of the study, requesting not to be identified.A total of 343 blood samples, of which 89 were positive, 58 negative for Sars-Cov-2, 17 cross-reactive, and 179 serum from healthy individuals were collected and tested at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune from March to May.“Among 89 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR confirmed patients... 64 (71.9%) were found positive and the remaining 25 serum samples (28.1%) negative,” says the study. “Of the 89 COVID-19-positive patients, 59 (66.3%) were symptomatic and 30 (33.7%) were asymptomatic.”Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todaySerum samples from Covid-19 confirmed patients (n=89) using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Pune and Alappuzha in Kerala were taken for the study.The symptomatic patients had cough in 48 cases (81.4%), fever in 36 (61%), sore throat in 16 (7.1%), breathlessness in 11 (18.6%), body ache in 9 (15.3%), headache in 5 (8.5%), nasal discharge 2 (3.4%) and diarrhoea in 2 (3.4%).Of the 59 symptomatic patients, 42 (71.2%) showed the presence of antibodies. Among 30 asymptomatic patients, 22 showed them (73.3%). Among the 25 (28.1%) neutralising antibody negatives, 11 patients were positive (7 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic), according to the researchers.Samples were collected within 2 weeks after RT-PCR confirmation from 58 Sars-Cov-2 RT-PCR-negative patients.“Understanding NAb [neutralising antibody] response among Covid-19 patients is a crucial requirement because the presence of neutralizing antibodies would provide greater assurance of protection in the absence of approved and validated preventive and therapeutic options… The role of cellular immune responses (T cells or cytokines) in the recovery of such patients needs to be explored,” the study says.“More systematic studies with controlled follow up of patients and titration of NAb among the recovered patients will provide useful information for passive antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Further, it is pertinent to study the protective role of NAb during reinfection in recovered Covid-19 patients.”Experts say that merely detecting antibodies is not enough.“What is crucial is to know the quality of antibodies, and whether these offer immunity against the disease, and for how long,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable disease division, ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-antibodies-found-in-72-samples-says-icmr-study/story-7kMoOwK71ZTn1YimwS8GWP.html

The North Carolina-based university conducted research to identify Covid-19 vaccine candidates and status, ongoing negotiations of procurement and manufacturing, virus burden in a country along with allocation and distribution plans. “Countries with manufacturing capacity, such as India and Brazil, have been successful in negotiating large advance market commitments with leading vaccine candidates as part of the manufacturing agreements,” the study showed.Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom have purchased less than 400 million confirmed vaccine doses till now. Duke University pointed out that there will not be enough vaccines to cover the entire global population until 2023 or 2024. The study also revealed that high-income countries held 3.8 billion confirmed vaccine doses, middle income held 829 million doses while low-income countries held over 1.7 billion doses.“Most high-income countries have been able to negotiate purchases through the investment of large amounts of public funds into research and development of Covid-19 vaccines and leveraged purchasing power to make large-scale deals across a portfolio of vaccine candidates,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-1-600-mn-india-biggest-buyer-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-report/story-FJIRb979HhyWiSpVbMhVHM.html
04-12-2020||India||CPIM’s All India Kisan Sabha plays key role in building solidarity for farmers’ protest||The CPIM in India had long mastered the art of issue-based support. It’s farmer arm, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), increasingly widened the scope of such pacts to stage big-ticket protests such as the ongoing farmers’ agitation in the National Capital Region. For the AIKS, a key participant along with Punjab Kisan organisations’ coordination committee and several other organisations, in the ongoing protests, the experience of 2014 movement against the land bill and the 2018 long march in Maharashtra came handy this time. When the NDA government brought the land bill in 2014, the AIKS tried to form a broad-based movement joining hands with more than 300 organisations representing tribals, activits, forest right movement, Dalits and even fishermen. And after the Mandsaur incident, where farmers died during protests, the AIKS reached out to other organisers for an issue-based pact and formed All India Kisan Sangharsh coordination committee (AIKSCC). “AIKSCC brought together more than 250 organisations who might not agree with each other on all issues. But we formed an issue-based unity around two common agenda to fight together: assured remunerative price and freedom from debt. In the course of United struggles consensus on broader issues developed,” said Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of Kisan Sabha. It is the AIKSCC that held long negotiations with farm bodies in Punjab and Haryana and other solidarity groups to launch a massive protest against the new farm laws of the NDA government. The kisan long march in Maharashtra had proved the organising power of the AIKS but this time, in the rice bowl of India, they found the new laws as the perfect cause to expand their issue-based support and join hands with more farmer bodies. “The solidarity between farmers and workers, students, women, activists and even professionals such as lawyers and doctors is unprecedented,” adds Vijoo, “we also have plans to intensify and broaden the protests across the country. Efforts to portray it as a Punjab specific movement is far from the reality of consistent protests across India. Our organisations are focused on building solidarity for the ongoing farm agitation in Delhi.” The farm wing’s tactical line of issue-based help also comes when the CPIM and the Left parties have taken a fresh approach to issue-based pacts with outfits and parties outside the leftist periphery. The Left parties joined hands with the RJD and Congress after a long time in Bihar, clinching impressive results. It has already announced seat pacts—not alliances—with the Congress in Assam and West Bengal and with DMK in Tamil Nadu. When asked why it took such a long time to organise protests as the farm bills were cleared in August, Vijoo said, “You have to consider that there are partial lockdowns and Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. Our leaders had to negotiate with many organisations and held several online meetings as well as in villages. It was a meticulously built unity. I don’t think we are late.We had numerous protests across the country from June 5.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-s-all-india-kisan-sabha-plays-key-role-in-building-solidarity-for-farmers-protest/story-tqJdSAzEvrILDpm0OveiGP.html

Thereafter, two weeks is granted to the petitioner (Syed Saif Abbas Naqvi) for filing a rejoinder affidavit,” ordered the court.“In the meantime, no coercive action shall be taken against the petitioner,” the court said.The Yogi Adityanath government had issued an order on March 3, by which the petitioner and others were held jointly as well as separately responsible and liable for damages amounting to Rs 67 lakh. The court has fixed the next hearing for the case in January along with the bunch of other related writ petitions.The order was hailed by those accused of damaging public property during the anti-CAA protests in Lucknow in December last year. They alleged that the state government’s move of issuing recovery notices was illegal.In total, four recovery notices were issued against 57 protestors to realise an amount of Rs 1.55 crore.The accused also challenged the competence of additional district magistrates (ADMs), who had served notices for the violent anti-CAA protests in Lucknow.Also Read: Shivpal Yadav calls Akhilesh’s 1 seat offer a joke, seeks socialist front against BJP“We welcome the court’s stand. State government’s stand of sending recovery notices to the innocent people was an illegality,” said Saif Abbas.Similarly, retired IPS SR Darapuri, who was also one of the accused, also welcomed the order.“Additional district magistrates don’t have the power to send recovery notices. It’s an illegal act. I am sure justice will prevail,” said Darapuri, whose matter too is pending with the court.Deepak Kabir, a social activist who was also accused in the violence that swept the state capital last year, too, welcomed the development.“Since the beginning, we maintained that the government’s move of serving recovery notices is illegal.

04-12-2020||India||PM to chair all-party meeting on Covid-19 today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to interact with leaders of various political parties from both Houses of Parliament on Friday to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the country. Floor leaders of all parties from the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha have been invited for the virtual meeting to be held from 10.30am onwards. This will be the second all-party meeting called by the government to discuss the Covid-19 situation since the outbreak of the pandemic. The first meeting was held on April 20 amid a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, health minister Harsh Vardhan and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi will also attend today’s meeting. The floor leaders of different parties who are expected to attend the meeting include Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (Lok Sabha) and Ghulam Nabi Azad (Rajya Sabha) of the Congress, Sudip Bandyopadhyay (Lok Sabha) and Derek O’ Brien (Rajya Sabha) of the Trinamool Congress, Midhun Reddy (Lok Sabha) and Vijayasai Reddy (Rajya Sabha) of the YSR Congress Party. The government is likely to brief the leaders about steps taken to deal with the pandemic and the progress made in vaccine development and distribution. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted about the meeting, hoping that the PM will also clarify by when every Indian will be given Covid-19 vaccine. “In today’s all-party meeting, we hope the PM clarifies by when will every Indian get free Covid vaccine,” he wrote.Also read | Chhattisgarh CM writes to PM Modi, seeks priority Covid 19 vaccination for stateThe Prime Minister has held multiple meetings – the last one on November 24 – with chief ministers, laying special emphasis on states with high Covid-19 caseload to review the situation there and offer suggestions and also discussed the vaccine administration and distribution. On Monday, he held a virtual meeting with three teams working on developing and manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine. He had also visited pharmaceutical companies in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune on Saturday to review coronavirus vaccine development work there. India has recorded the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world after the United States but is one of the countries with the lowest deaths per million population globally, according to the Union health ministry. The meeting also comes a day after Chowdhury’s letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla urging him to convene a short winter session of the House to discuss several issues, including the farmers’ agitation and preparation of the Covid-19 vaccine. In his letter, Chowdhury said the winter session be convened with all the Covid-19 protocols in place to help the people understand the important issues the country is facing at present. “There are a number of very important issues that the nation is facing in present times. The most notable among them are the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the status/preparation of the Covid-19 vaccine,” the letter read. Chowdhury also listed issues such as economic slowdown, unemployment, continuous stand-off along the India-China border and unabated ceasefire violation along the India-Pakistan border for immediate discussion in Parliament. “There is a need for a thorough and transparent debate/discussion on all the above-mentioned important issues,” he said. Last month, Birla had said the Lok Sabha Secretariat is ready to hold the winter session but the dates will be decided by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs. Chowdhury’s demand was also supported by his party colleagues Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor. Tewari demanded that the winter session of Parliament be convened at the earliest to debate various pressing issues facing the country like the ongoing farmers’ protest against agriculture reform laws, Chinese aggression and the Covid-19 crisis. He said parliamentarians “owe it to the country to lead by example by not avoiding our duties” because of Covid-19. “It is all the more important to convene the Parliament for the winter session in view of the farmers’ uprising when tens of thousands of farmers from different parts of the country are protesting around Delhi to seek the repealing of three controversial agricultural laws,” the former union minister said. “And the Parliament is the best forum to debate and deliberate on these while keeping in view the concerns and demands of the farmers,” he added. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been camping at border points of Delhi for over a week now to protest the Centre’s three agriculture reform laws which were enacted in September. Tewari said various parliamentary panels such as the standing committees and joint parliamentary committees are already holding regular meetings. “There is no logic or reason to skip the winter session of the House. Skipping an entire session of Parliament will not only set a bad precedent but will send a wrong signal across the country,” he added. “The show must go on,” the Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-chair-all-party-meeting-on-covid-19-today/story-TQYctgU7rPwkkgON1FNzwN.html

She was found unconscious in a forest, the officials said.According to officials, the girl was kidnapped by the accused on Wednesday evening. “The girl was kidnapped by three men on Wednesday evening when she was alone at home while her parents were out for some work,” said revenue police sub-inspector Praveen Hyanki.“They then took her to the jungle where they took turns to rape her. The three men then left her there before threatening to kill her if she told anyone about the heinous act,” said Hyanki. The girl knows the three accused as they live in the same area, he said.The incident came to light when villagers found the girl lying unconscious in the jungle on Thursday morning, he said. “After identifying her, the villagers informed her parents who rushed to the spot and took her to a nearby hospital from where she was referred to a higher centre in Haldwani,” said Hyanki. The girl has sustained serious injuries, he added.The girl’s father has filed a complaint against the three men, officials said. “We have received the complaint and will soon register a case. The girl is at present undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Prateek Jain, sub-divisional magistrate of Koshyakutoli sub-division in Nainital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-year-old-abducted-gang-raped-by-three-men-in-nainital-police/story-DboXssJjrmVCGQgcC2UpsO.html
04-12-2020||India||Cyclone Burevi likely to emerge in Arabian Sea, may re-intensify||Cyclone Burevi had weakened into a deep depression over Gulf of Mannar close to Pamban by Thursday evening. It is likely to cross Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi districts in Tamil Nadu on Friday morning with wind speed of 50-60 kmph gusting to 70 kmph bringing heavy rain to south Tamil Nadu and parts of south Kerala.There is, however, a possibility that Burevi will emerge in the Arabian Sea and re-intensify, scientists said. With its weakening into a deep depression, concerns about widespread damage or disaster in south of the state or Kerala from a cyclone have been put to rest. “The wind speed has reduced so we are not expecting damage. But there are chances that the depression will merge in Arabian Sea. We cannot say right away what its track or intensity will be. Once it moves over the Arabian Sea we can make some projections. Burevi’s track (Bay of Bengal to Arabian Sea) is not common but it may not be the first case,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Also read | Thiruvananthapuram airport to remain closed on Friday as IMD issues red alert in five districtsScientists are also intrigued by Burevi’s track which made landfall over Sri Lanka close to north of Trincomalee between 10.30 and 11.30pm on Wednesday as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph. It crossed the narrow strip Palk Strait and the Pamban area and will cross Tamil Nadu as a deep depression. “I cannot say right away that this is the first time we are seeing this track of a cyclone moving over Sri Lanka and India but I have no memory of such a track. Also, some models are indicating that the depression will emerge in the Arabian Sea in a day or two. Its re-intensification from a depression cannot be ruled out,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.Burevi lay over Gulf of Mannar near Ramanathapuram district coast on Thursday night. The associated wind speed is about 55-65 kmph gusting to 75 kmph. The deep depression is likely to move west-southwestwards and cross Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi districts. It is very likely to weaken further into a depression (wind speed 40-50kmph gusting to 60 kmph) later on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-burevi-likely-to-emerge-in-arabian-sea-re-intensify/story-5A999VeRVfE5lAwUBhnOPN.html

Jharkhand is the lone state to hold out. Thirty members of the GST Council – 27 states and 3 Union territories -- have formally accepted the first borrowing option proposed by the Centre in August this year, an official in the Union government said, requesting anonymity.“Government of Chhattisgarh has communicated its acceptance of Option-1 to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation. The number of states who have favoured Option-1 has gone up to 27. All states except Jharkhand and all the three Union Territories (UTs) with legislative assembly have decided in favour of Option-1,” the Union finance ministry said in a statement on Thursday.At the 41st GST Council meeting on August 27, the Centre offered two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall in the current financial year. Two days later, it specified that under the first option, states would not have to pay either the principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97,000 crore (later raised to Rs 1.1 lakh crore) to meet the shortfall because of implementation issues. They would have to bear significant interest costs if they chose the larger borrowing option of Rs2.35 lakh crore that included revenue shortfall because the Covid-19 pandemic, which was described as “an act of God”.Initially 10 states – mostly administered by non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties -- objected and insisted that the Centre borrow the entire amount and reimburse them for the shortfall without imposing any direct interest burden on states. They were Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal.The Union government eventually agreed to do on and on October 23 set up a special borrowing window for the purpose. It has already borrowed Rs30,000 crore on behalf of the states and passed it on to them.“The funds borrowed through the special window were released to the States and UTs on 23rd October, 2020, 2nd November, 2020, 9th November, 2020, 23rd November, 2020 and 1st December, 2020. Now the State of Chhattisgarh will also receive funds raised through this window starting from the next round of borrowing,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-shortfall-chhattisgarh-opts-for-govt-s-borrowing-option/story-VeDQ9mC4loQrbOq7Ix9ceK.html
04-12-2020||India||GHMC election results today: A high-stakes battle for BJP, TRS||Votes in the bitterly-fought elections to the 150-ward Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will be counted on Friday. Poll officials have made elaborate arrangements for the process and set up centres at 30 places where more than 8,000 personnel will be engaged in the counting of votes. The counting process would be recorded on CCTV cameras installed at every counting table, officials have said. Ballot papers were used for the poll and consequently, the results are likely to be known only in the evening or in the night.The polls in the city assume political significance as 24 assembly segments fall under the GHMC limits. In the last GHMC elections in 2016, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the state had swept the election as it won 99 of the 150 wards. The municipal elections are also crucial for the BJP, party functionaries aware of the details said, as it has set itself the target of expanding its footprint in the state. “The party hopes to establish itself as a serious contender,” said a senior party functionary. Its recent win in the Dubbak assembly constituency by-poll has given the BJP a toehold to carve out space for itself in the TRS bastion.Also read | Hyderabadis remain lukewarm to GHMC polls, only 42% turn out to voteThe Telangana State Election Commission had decided to conduct the GHMC elections with ballot papers after obtaining the views of major political parties, the health department in view of the coronavirus pandemic and taking into consideration various relevant issues.Election campaignThe turnout of the voters on December 1 was an unimpressive 46.55 per cent or 34.50 lakh out of the total 74.67 lakh voters even though the run-up to the poll saw a high-pitched campaign by parties.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conducted a spirited campaign to win the GHMC polls to boost its chances in the assembly elections to be held in 2023. The party has drafted its general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who was its in-charge for the Bihar assembly elections, to supervise the poll preparations in Hyderabad.Union home minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union ministers Prakash Javadekar, Smriti Irani and minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, who is Lok Sabha member from Secunderabad, party MP and BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya were the leaders who participated in the campaign.The BJP highlighted the TRS’ “alliance” with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and sought votes to provide clean and transparent administration in the city. The TRS, however, denied any alliance with the AIMIM.Also read | GHMC polls: BJP only knows ‘jumla’ and ‘hamla’, says KTR on last day of campaignThe TRS’ campaign was led by its working president and state municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao, while party president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao addressed a public meeting.

However, the state election commission ordered repolling in all 69 polling stations of Ward Number 26 after it was found that the symbol of the CPI(M) was printed in the ballot paper instead of the CPI’s.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghmc-election-results-today-a-high-stakes-battle-for-bjp-trs/story-HKwmGdwkud6E7WpD1fcmJN.html

We will be holding a grand kumbh fair and mela administration is ensuring time-bound completion of works and their good quality,” said Rawat. Rawat’s inspection comes in the backdrop of Akhada Parishad representatives and many prominent saints expressing concern recently over the slow pace of Kumbh infrastructure works. Some seers have also complained of delay in allocation of land to Akhadas for the four-month-long Kumbh stay in Bairagi camp area. The chief minister also instructed for proper labelling of Mansa Devi and Chandi Devi shrine routes and ordered renovation of ashrams of saints and Akhadas before the Kumbh fair. Rawat offered prayers to deity Ganga and performed rituals at the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkumd at Har-Ki-Pauri.

Citing his government’s decision to repeal the Harish Rawat government’s 2016 order labelling the stretch of Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri as Ganga canal escape channel, Rawat said, “Our government is doing mass development works and also correcting the wrongdoings of previous Harish Rawat led Congress government,”.

But for the past three and a half years, the BJP-led government and CM Trivendra Singh Rawat didn’t act. I went to Akhadas and Ganga Sabha representatives, raised this issue and now after such a long time, when Assembly election neared and local priests started an indefinite agitation at Har-Ki-Pauri, the BJP government nullified the said order,” said Rawat, who is staging a silent protest at Kissan ghat against alleged atrocities on farmers protesting at Delhi-NCR border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-sets-deadline-for-mahakumbh-preparations-amid-credit-war-over-ganga-status/story-HDn5YpUxQYdkz1nn564snM.html

The polls are being seen as a three-way battle between the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP, in fact, went all out in its campaign for the December 1 polls, with prominent leaders like Union home minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, part president JP Nadda and youth wing chief Tejasvi Surya, among others, campaigning in the IT hub.Also Read | GHMC election results today: A high-stakes battle for BJP, TRSFollow all live updates here:8:26 pm: Results of 149 constituencies declared; TRS fails to reach magic numberAfter the results of 150 constituencies were released, there has been no clear winner.

04-12-2020||India||IB chief to J&K interlocutor: Dineshwar Sharma, the man who excelled in different roles||Dineshwar Sharma, the administrator of Lakshadweep and former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief, died at the age of 66 on Friday in a hospital in Chennai, from complications related to a lung ailment. Tributes poured in from political leaders across parties including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, and former J&K chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who all praised him for his knowledge and skills but most importantly his ability to connect with everyone. Sharma was slightly built and quiet but he was not averse to speak truth to power, and was always willing to invest time and effort on complex issues. That made him a natural choice for the Modi government which decided to appoint him special representative for Jammu & Kashmir on October 25, 2017. His post was equivalent to the post of Cabinet Secretary. Sharma, as J&K interlocutor, pursued dialogue with various stakeholders in J&K till the BJP-PDP coalition collapsed in 2017. It was he who recommended releasing first time stone pelters from jail. PM Modi tweeted on Friday after his death: “Administrator of Lakshadweep Shri Dineshwar Sharma Ji made long lasting contributions to India’s policing and security apparatus. He handled many sensitive counter terror and insurgency ops during his policing career. Anguished by his demise. Condolences to his family. Om Shanti”. Mehbooba Mufti said in her tweet as interlocutor Sharma tried his best to restore bridges of trust and goodwill between J&K and rest of the nation. Omar Abdulla said: “Dineshwar Sharma was a wise and sensible man who understood Kashmir. Unfortunately he was an interlocutor for a government that wasn’t interested in listening but that isn’t a reflection of either his efforts or his abilities. I’m sorry to hear of his untimely demise. May he RIP”. His batchmate and former CBI Director Anil Sinha said: “I have lost my brother, my friend and my family member.” Sharma was IB chief for a fixed two-year term from December 31, 2014. Sharma joined the Intelligence Bureau as Assistant Director in January 1991 in Kashmir when the insurgency was at its peak there. During his service, Sharma handled a number of assignments including counter insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ib-chief-to-j-k-interlocutor-dineshwar-sharma-the-man-who-excelled-in-different-roles/story-XETvKkh9XiKCQRBSIJSxnO.html
04-12-2020||India||Covid: SC seeks report from Himachal govt regarding treatment of patients||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought a status report from the Himachal Pradesh government regarding the treatment of Covid-19 patients in different hospitals, infrastructure and facilities available therein.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah issued notice to the Himachal Pradesh government and asked it to file a status report after an advocate apprised it that there are several issues like lack of oxygen, lack of beds in the state.The bench, while taking note that guidelines with regard to wearing of masks and keeping social distancing are not being followed in almost all of the states, asked the Centre and states to file suggestions in this regard so that it can issue appropriate directions to implement the guidelines and to ensure the compliance.“It has been pointed out that guidelines with regard to wearing of masks and keeping social distancing are not being followed in almost all of the states. It is submitted that even though there are stringent regulations including imposing of fine on non-wearing of masks, yet desired results have not been achieved,” the bench noted in its order.“It has also been submitted that there has been large public gathering including political, religious, ceremonial where the social distancing is given a go-bye and there are no appropriate mechanisms to check such social gatherings,” it added.The order said that the Solicitor General and other counsel appearing for different states have requested time to give appropriate suggestions so that appropriate directions may be issued by the court to implement the guidelines and to ensure the compliance.“The suggestions may be given by December 7, 2020,” it said.The bench was hearing a suo motu case pertaining to the management of Covid-19 crisis and mishandling of dead bodies.The court has posted the matter for hearing on December 9.During the hearing, the bench remarked that “many vegetable markets where social distancing is required but is not being followed, look into this from that angle - the issues of super spreader start from here. These are the most vulnerable spots.”Senior Advocate KV Vishwanathan appearing for Delhi government contended that ICU beds now stand at 5,010.Vishwanathan told the court that tests have gone up in Delhi.“Cases are going down. Being monitored at highest. We don’t want to be adversarial,” Vishwanathan said.After an advocate said prices for Covid-19 tests and treatment need to be regulated in the Assam, the bench said that under Article 32 it cannot regulate how much a hospital in the state charges.Later, the bench asked the Assam government to see into whether the issue of Covid-19 treatment charges can be looked into and what can be done about preventive measures to be taken during political rallies.The counsel also pointed out that Assam will see elections in the coming year and mechanisms need to be put in place in light of pandemic. The bench said it will pass an order in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-sc-seeks-report-from-himachal-govt-regarding-treatment-of-patients/story-3A3buEWssAaOaVgvYCD77M.html
04-12-2020||India||China defends dam on Brahmaputra, India hits back||India on Thursday said China must ensure its hydropower projects don’t infringe on the water rights of lower riparian states, even as Beijing asserted its right to build a dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). China’s plans to build a “super” dam on Yarlung Zangbo in Medog county of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) have triggered fears about far-reaching consequences for water security in India’s northeastern states. The trans-border Yarlung Zangbo, which originates in TAR, flows into Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, where it is known as the Brahmaputra and plays a crucial role in the local economy. “As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of trans-border rivers, the government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to Chinese authorities and urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. The development, coming against the backdrop of the dragging border standoff in the Ladakh sector of the LAC, has the potential to further complicate bilateral relations. India has noted reports of China’s plans to build a super dam and the government carefully monitors all developments on the Brahmaputra river, Srivastava said. The Chinese side has informed India on several occasions it is “only undertaking run-of-the-river hydropower projects which do not involve diversion of waters of the Brahmaputra”, he said. “We intend to remain engaged with China on the issue of trans-border rivers to safeguard our interests,” Srivastava said. Issues concerning trans-border rivers are discussed with China through an expert-level mechanism, set up in 2006, and diplomatic channels. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying brushed aside apprehensions about the project while asserting China’s “legitimate right” to build projects on the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo. She held out the assurance that any project will account for the interests of downstream states such as India and Bangladesh. “When it comes to use and development of cross-border rivers, China always acts responsibly. We have a policy featuring development and conservation, and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment with due consideration for its impact downstream and taking into account interests of upstream and downstream regions,” she said when asked about the project. “The development of lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo is in early stages of planning and assessment. There is no need to read too much into that,” she said. China, India and Bangladesh have for long had “good cooperation” in sharing hydrological information, flood reduction and contingency management, and Beijing will continue communications through existing channels, Hua said. International experts said that although details about the massive project are not publicly available, it could impact lower riparian states and the environment of TAR once completed. Ameya Pratap Singh, a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, who has written on India-China relations, said India needs to be on alert. From India’s perspective, the risks are flooding, water scarcity, diversion of water and consequent unrest in the North-east, he said. Liu Xiaoxue of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government-affiliated think tank, said the dam was an opportunity for China and India to cooperate but New Delhi’s apprehensions will remain.“My opinion is that it will surely benefit both sides, leading to mutual prosperity. But given the huge deficit of political mutual trust between India and China, there is no doubt it will result in a strong resistance from the Indian side,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-defends-dam-on-brahmaputra-india-hits-back/story-Z9fTogaquykvrYVXhgxbfK.html
04-12-2020||India||Govt announces 2 new army posts with focus on reforms||The government on Thursday announced the post of a Deputy Chief of the Army Staff, or DCOAS, (Strategy) with an aim to bring about structural reforms in the army, about two years after the plan was envisaged.The government also announced another new post of Director General (Information Warfare) at the army headquarters, confirmed an official, who is from the security establishment and is aware of the developments.This official, who requested anonymity, denied that the developments were connected with the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Border tensions between India and China have reached new heights in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. The clash resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers. The current Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh, is set to become the first DCOAS (Strategy), the official said. He added that the need for this particular post had been highlighted in several surveys and studies done as part of the army’s restructuring efforts.Officials said the post of DCOAS (Strategy) was created to deal with military operations, military intelligence, strategic planning and operational logistics. The process for this began in 2018 and was finally cleared by the government on Thursday, the official said. It was not immediately clear who the new Director General (Information Warfare) would be.The move according to officials in the know, will have its advantages as it will reduce the burden of work of the Vice Chief of Army staff. “The Vice Chief already sees all of the Chief’s files...so, with this, one task will be reduced. The DCOAS will oversee the work of the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) and that of the Director General Military Intelligence (DGMI),” said a second official.At present, the DGMO and the DGMI report to the Vice Chief. In the new structure, they are expected to report to the DCOAS (Strategy).Lt Gen (retired) Deependra Singh Hooda said the move will ensure that there is just one person (the DCOAS) in charge of military operations and intelligence. “So you get a comprehensive picture,” he said. “It’s a good idea as it will enable better operational planning.” The creation of the Director General (Information Warfare) post is being seen as recognition of the emerging trends in warfare. “Earlier there was just an ADGPI (Additional Directorate General of Public Information) who looked at things with the lens of the media,” said Lt Gen Hooda. “Now, this new officer will work at how to deal with fake narratives and all kinds of current challenges that it poses.”But there was criticism in some quarters as well. “When you don’t even have a formal security strategy, what is the point of the new post (DCOAS)?” said Lt Gen (retired) HS Panag. “There will be someone handling strategy in army, someone in navy and someone in air force. And they will all be rudderless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-announces-2-new-army-posts-with-focus-on-reforms/story-xFxDBjwEBz5fre6SpDWjxN.html
04-12-2020||India||Can’t bar convicted leaders from polls for life: Govt to SC||Convicted lawmakers cannot be debarred from contesting elections for life, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday in response to a petition that sought convicted legislators to be treated on par with convicted bureaucrats, who are debarred for life from government service.Making a distinction between bureaucrats and members of Parliament or state legislatures who are convicted of serious offences under the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, an affidavit filed by the ministry of law and justice said that while public servants were governed by”‘service conditions,” such conditions do not exist for lawmakers. Instead, MPs and MLAs are governed by the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), which prescribes a six-year disqualification from contesting polls for an offence that is punishable with a prison sentence of two years and above.The affidavit came in response to an application moved in a pending PIL filed by lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. In his main petition, Upadhyay had sought debarment of convicted lawmakers for life. However, in the application, he added a subsequent prayer, challenging the validity of Sections 8(1), 8(2), 8(3) and 9(1) of RP Act, 1951, which disqualifies a convicted legislator for a period of six years and five years (under Section 9(1)).Upadhyay questioned the different standards of punishment for convicted lawmakers on one hand and convicted public servants on the other and demanded that the same rule of debarment must be applied to MLAs/MPs on contesting elections or for heading a political party.The affidavit said: “There are no specific service conditions laid down in respect of elected representatives albeit, the fact that the people’s representatives are public servants. The elected representatives are ordinarily bound by the oath that they have taken to serve the citizens of their constituency in particular and the country in general. Their conduct is bound by propriety, good conscience and they are expected to generally work in the interest of the nation.”The affidavit said that while the issue of debarment for life was pending in the main petition filed by Upadhyay, there was no need to entertain the amended application, which challenged the RPA provisions with regard to disqualification of MPs/MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-bar-convicted-leaders-from-polls-for-life-govt-to-sc/story-3mULA5y2I5Wl8Jc0mJJjyJ.html
04-12-2020||India||FIR against 14 under new law on conversion||A case was registered on Thursday against 14 people under a recently introduced Uttar Pradesh law to punish forced religious conversions of women after interfaith marriage, the police said .Superintendent of police Sushil Ghule said the case was registered on the basis of a complaint under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance-2020 at Chiraiyakot police station in Mau district. The police said the complainant alleged that his 30-year-old daughter was kidnapped by a person he identified as Shabab Khan aka Rahul for religious conversion. He filed the complaint against Shabab Khan and 13 of his acquaintances, stating that the wedding of his daughter had been scheduled for November 30 but on the eve of the marriage Khan kidnapped her with the intent of converting her religion. “Three teams have been deployed to arrest all the accused and recover the woman. We will soon get a breakthrough as we have some important clues,” Ghule, the superintendent of police of Mau, said.Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel approved the ordinance promulgated by the state against forced and dishonest religious conversions on November 28. The first case under the new law was registered within hours against a Muslim man d in Bareilly the same night. He was arrested later. The ordinance has provisions to check religious conversions carried out by “allurement, coercion, force, fraud, or marriage.”The state cabinet cleared the law earlier in November, targeting what many right-wing outfits term “love jihad”, which involves Muslim men marrying Hindu women with the aim of changing the latter’s religion after marriage. According to the ordinance, marriages with the intention of changing the woman’s religion will be declared null and void.Under the provisions of the new law, the violation has been made a cognizable and non-bailable offence. The new law provides for a jail term of up to 10 years in some cases for violators and treats forced conversions as a non-bailable offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-14-under-new-law-on-conversion/story-BHCRVeOnDGBCdmuGCT7rkI.html
04-12-2020||India||PIL challenges UP ‘love jihad’ law in SC, says misuse likely||Two lawyers and a legal researcher have filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging an ordinance promulgated by the Uttar Pradesh government outlawing religious conversions by way of marriage, arguing that the law could be misused to falsely implicate couples belonging to different faiths who marry out of their free will.The petition, filed on November 30, also challenged the validity of a 2018 Uttarakhand law that prohibits conversion of religion by way of marriage.Terming the UP ordinance, promulgated last month and signed by governor Anandiben Patel, and the Uttarakhand law to be against public policy and the society at large, the petition demanded that they be scrapped by the top court for violating the fundamental rights of citizens who decide to marry people who belong to other faiths.The Uttar Pradesh ordinance outlaws religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement. The law was promulgated about a month after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to end “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women but one that has been rejected by courts and experts. “This ordinance can become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to... falsely implicate anyone...there are probabilities to falsely implicate persons who are not involved in any such acts and it will be a grave injustice if this ordinance is passed,” said the petition.The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020” was promulgated on November 24. The law prescribes a jail term varying between one to five years, in addition to fines of up to Rs 15,000 for those convicted under the law. The jail term goes up to 10 years and fine up to Rs 25,000 for conversions of women belonging to scheduled caste or scheduled tribe communities or who are minors.Criticizing this law, former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur in a recent online lecture on November 29 said: “Giving a backseat to freedom of choice, dignity and human rights, a stringent ordinance related to marriage and forcible conversion has recently been passed in Uttar Pradesh.” He cited the SC’s 2018 verdict upholding the freedom of choice of an adult woman to marry a person of her choice in the Shafin Jahan v Ashokan KM case of 2018, popularly referred to as the Hadiya case. The persons behind the petition are advocates Vishal Thakre and Abhay Singh Yadav and law researcher Pranvesh, who is based in Allahabad. This is the first petition to challenge a law on this subject. “The Ordinance passed by the State of Uttar Pradesh and law passed by Uttarakhand are against the public policy and society at large and violates basic structure of the Constitution,” the petition said.Similar laws are being contemplated by BJP-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-challenges-up-love-jihad-law-in-sc-says-misuse-likely/story-7OzNMkWSQpnITQ8lFlqCYM.html
04-12-2020||India||India’s masala king, founder and face of MDH, dies at 97||Mahashay Dharampal Gulati, who died on Thursday at the age of 97 after a cardiac arrest, earned several sobriquets over the years: MDH Uncle, Dadaji and Masala King. It was the last that most aptly described the man behind the New Delhi-based masala maker MDH Private Limited, who single-handedly made the packaged, ready-to-use, spices popular across the country. Dressed in a red turban, white sherwani (long coat) and a pearl necklace, the moustached, bespectacled, ever-smiling Gulati was the face of his brand, featuring in almost all its ads over the decades. MDH is short for Mahashian Di Hatti, which is Punjabi for the “shop of a respectable man”.Gulati’s was one of the remarkable post-partition refugee success stories. Born in 1923 in Sialkot, Pakistan, Gulati came to Delhi in September 1947. Starting as a tangewala (horse-cart puller) in Delhi, he built MDH, started by his father Chuni Lal Gulati as a small shop in Sialkot in 1919, into a ₹2,500- crore brand. After selling his horse cart in 1948, he bought a small wooden khokha (makeshift shop) at Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bagh, where he started grinding and selling spices under the brand name Mahashian Di Hatti. The packaged masala was among MDH’s first innovation. The cardboard box pack launched in the late 1940s carried Gulati’s image. As the business picked up, in 1954, he set up a spice store in Karol Bagh, and in 1958, handed it over to his brother Satpal Gulati. Today, it is famous as Roopak Stores. Gulati always believed in the power of adverting, and MDH was one of the first companies to launch an aggressive print ad campaign in 1948, placing advertisements in Pratap, a popular newspaper among Punjabi refugees those days. In 1984, when the company launched its first TV ad, he was once again its brand ambassador. “People ask me why I don’t get Shah Rukh Khan or Amitabh Bachchan to promote my masalas. Why should I ride on their success to promote my brand? I am the man behind the success of my product, so shouldn’t I be promoting it,” he told HT 2009. MDH was formally incorporated as Mahashian Di Hatti Private Limited in 1965 and today has 19 factories. Beginning in the 1980s, new rivals kept entering the market, but MDH products — today there are about 45 — remained popular as ever. “The secret of his success was his passion and indefatigable energy. He brought a personal touch to whatever he did. He was very punctual, disciplined and visited his factories every day. For the past 50 years, he worked almost 18 hours a day and was in his office from 9am to 6pm every day,” said Rajinder Kumar, executive vice president of MDH. “He used to say that he knew about his brand and consumers and so liked to promote it himself...” added Kumar. Gulati became the highest-paid CEO in the packaged consumer goods business in 2017, drawing a salary of ₹21 crore — most of which went to charity. Conferred Padma Bhushan for his contribution, he also ran a number of educational institutes and a super-specialty hospital, Mata Chanan Devi Hospital, in Delhi. In 2012, he published his autobiography, Tangewala Kaise Bana Masalo ka Shahenshah, which translates as “how a tangewala became the masala emperor” .  President Ram Nath Kovind, Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Piyush Goyal, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra mourned the passing of Gulati. “Dharm Pal ji was very inspiring personality. He dedicated his life for the society. God bless his soul,” Kejriwal tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-masala-king-founder-and-face-of-mdh-dies-at-97/story-1hCbIbRcdE2xIrLEjMoQkL.html
04-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The US registered 2,760 deaths on Wednesday, according to the New York Times. This is the highest daily death toll in the country since the beginning of the pandemic (caveat: just like the death toll on any other day, this does not mean 2,760 people died from Covid-19 on Wednesday, just that their deaths were recorded on that day). There’s a high probability that this number will increase in the coming days. According to the New York Times, hospitalisations in the US have now exceeded 100,000. On Wednesday, the US had 5.57 million infections, according to worldometers.info -- a staggeringly high number, it’s almost 40% of the total of 14.3 million cases the country has seen thus far. US’S DEADLIEST WAVEThe third wave of infections in the US, the rush of hospitalisations and the spate of deaths can be attributed to opening up, the onset of winter and the holiday season. Experts are also dreading the impact of Thanksgiving, which they expect to start showing up by late this week.The country has seen a little less than 14 million cases, according to the NYT database (there has always been some divergence between the two readings). In the week to December 2, the US saw 164,024 daily cases on average (according to the NYT database). Last week it crossed the 200,000 mark in terms of daily cases for the first time. The third wave of infections, the rush of hospitalisations, and the spate of deaths, can be attributed to opening up, the onset of winter, the holiday season – experts are dreading the impact of Thanksgiving, which they expect to start showing up by late this week – and, of course, the stupidity of people. Show me a superspreader event and I will show you one idiot, perhaps more. It’s going to be a long, dark winter for the US.HOPE AHEADSometime before December 15, though, the US Food and Drug Administration is almost certain to approve the country’s first Covid-19 vaccine. And before Christmas, it could approve the second. The agency is expected to take a decision on the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on December 10, and on the one developed by Moderna on December 17.Sometime before December 15, though, the US Food and Drug Administration is almost certain to approve the country’s first Covid-19 vaccine. And before Christmas, it could approve the second. The agency is expected to take a decision (or at least critical steps towards taking an eventual decision) on the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on December 10, and on the one developed by Moderna on December 17. Given what we know of the results of the trials for both vaccines, regulatory approval for both is almost a certainty. The UK has already approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (this happened on Wednesday), and media reports in the US point to some level of angst that FDA is taking its time. A report in AFP quoted Moncef Slaoui, the scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the US government programme that has ploughed billions of dollars into vaccine developers – it is probably the Trump administration’s biggest success – as saying that vaccinations in the country could start in the middle of December and that by the “end of February, we will have potentially immunised 100 million people”. Excluding those below the age of 18 years, who will not be administered the vaccine till much later in the year (and this is not just in the US, but everywhere; Dispatch 217 on Thursday explained why), this will cover around 40% of those who need vaccines. Earlier this week, the executive in charge of supply and distribution for Operation Warp Speed told MSNBC that all Americans who want vaccines will have it by June.In both the UK and the US, which will be the first countries to start vaccinating people with shots that have cleared Phase 3 trials – Russia and China are also vaccinating people under emergency use, but the final results of trials are still awaited in the case of the two vaccines approved by the former, and the three by the latter – the challenge for administrators and health officials is to convince everyone to get vaccinated. Both countries have a significant population of anti-vaxxers.With the UK, the US, and other rich countries hogging much of vaccine supply though, 2021 is likely to result in a new kind of inequality – and because vaccines are relevant from the perspective of both lives and livelihoods, this will only accentuate existing fractures between the global north and the global south.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-jGRphTmop1e8iZYxyXyAxL.html
04-12-2020||India||‘No mask violates the right to life of others’, says Supreme Court||People not wearing masks in public spaces are violating the fundamental right to life of everyone else, the Supreme Court said on Thursday as it implored all states to enforce the guidelines on wearing masks and social distancing scrupulously in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.At the same time, the apex court stayed a Gujarat high court order that sought to punish those not wearing masks in public by assigning them to Covid-19 centres to perform non-medical duties, terming the punishment “disproportionate”. A bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan regretted that people have been recently showing a lack of will to follow the guidelines meant to prevent the spread of the virus, and the authorities were apathetic in implementing the norms on masks and social distancing.“Those who are not wearing masks are affecting fundamental rights of others. They may hamper health of other people,” remarked the bench, which also included justices RS Reddy and MR Shah.When solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Gujarat government, said there was nothing to show that the police could be encouraging the trend, the bench retorted: “Truth can easily be seen. And we are not talking only about one state but the problem across the nation.”The court added that these guidelines and standard operating procedures had been issued by the Union health ministry and states too, but the major hurdle was of their implementation.“There is a lack of will everywhere. There is no implementation. Everybody is moving without masks in markets, malls, marriages and all kinds of ceremonies. There are more than 1,000 people in a marriage ceremony? How is this happening? What is police doing,” the bench asked Mehta.It also took a dim view of large gatherings in marriages and processions, observing that some states had even done away with the necessity of seeking prior approval from the authorities for organising such congregations.Mehta accepted that it was a pan-India problem, and that certain urgent measures, including imposition of a higher fine on violators, can be ordered by the apex court.At this, the bench reiterated that enhancing the fine may not suffice until there is proper implementation.Mehta, on behalf of the Gujarat government, had sought a stay of the high court order to send those not wearing masks in public to perform non-medical duties in Covid-19 centres as punishment.The bench concurred with the solicitor general that such punishment may pose serious health risks even to non-Covid-19 persons, and stayed this part of the order. But at the same time, the court underlined that the stay order cannot be construed as encouraging people to not wear masks.Thus, the bench directed Gujarat’s additional secretary, home, to ensure the requirement of wearing mask and social distancing were rigorously implemented. It also directed the state police to make certain all guidelines are implemented in the state.It further asked all state governments to submit suggestions by Monday on how to control public gatherings and ensure compliance with the requirement of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.The bench said it will consider issuing directions for all states after the responses are received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-mask-violates-the-right-to-life-of-others-says-supreme-court/story-XMLlKDyaj9itnReh61rLTO.html
04-12-2020||India||Govt agrees to review farmers’ key demands||A make-or-mar round of talks between the Union government and farmers protesting three farm laws moved a step forward on Thursday after being repeatedly deadlocked, with the government agreeing to review the recently enacted legislation and “bring amendments” if required to address demands of farm unions. The farmers, however, stuck to their stand that the government should roll back all three laws. The negotiations on Thursday were the fourth round of meeting between three Union ministers and farmers’ representatives, as protests by thousands of agriculturalists on Delhi’s borders simmered for the seventh straight day. Agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Prakash, a lawmaker from Punjab, led the government side, while representatives of some of the biggest farmers unions in the country, mainly from Punjab, spoke for the farmers. “The government has no ego issues. The talks were with an open heart. Farmers’ leaders raised several issues and gave us their views on them. We have assured them that each of the points raised by them will be reviewed by the government and we will meet again on December 5,” Tomar said after the discussions. While the farmers want the three farm laws approved by Parliament in September to be revoked, the government has leaned on its new reform agenda to raise farm incomes and spur investments in the sector. The recent laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers.The government enlarged the group of farmers’ representatives from 35 to 40 for Thursday’s meeting in response to the farmers’ demand. The farmers’ side for the first time included a women’s representative, Kavitha Kuruganti of the Forum for Women Farmers’ Rights. “The farm minister said the government may bring amendments. We pointed out that if a law goes wrong on its very objective, then its various provisions are bound to go wrong. That is what happened here. That farmers have been left to fend for themselves in their market interfaces,” said Kuruganti. In the last meeting on December 1, which was inconclusive, the agriculture minister had suggested that farm leaders identify specific issues related to the farm-reform Acts. The farmers’ delegation spoke at length about what they saw as threats to their interests because of the reforms. These included the danger of existing notified government-controlled markets collapsing because a proposal to set up free markets in competition with traditional ones that give farmers assured prices for staples. A new contract-farming law could imperil the landholding rights of farmers, the farmers said. They also demanded the government reverse all penalties on farmers for crop-residue burning under a new anti-pollution ordinance promulgated in October. The farmers also sought a review of a bill that provides for direct cash payments to farmers to offset costs of electricity for farming in lieu of the existing practice of providing subsidised power supply. “We will go back review each of these provisions. We will see how we can bring parity between existing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (regulated markets) and free markets. We may bring new measures to strengthen APMC markets,” Tomar said. The farm minister also said the government would review the impact of a power supply amendment bill pending in Parliament on farmers and review a recent law, which provides for settlement of disputes between farmers and traders at the magistrate level. Farmers have demanded that they be free to approach civil courts to settle such disputes. The farmers also sought a legal guarantee to federally fixed MSPs so that no private buyer can purchase any major farm produce below state-set threshold prices. The government assured the farmers that the MSP system, under which it buys staples at profitable rates, will continue but did not commit to a law prohibiting sale of any major farm produce below state-set support prices, as sought by farmers. The farmers concluded by saying that the issue is not about “any one particular clause”, but about the “direction in which the government is pushing farming in India”, said Avik Saha, secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKCC). Jagmohan Singh, a farm leader who was part of the talks, said farmers unanimously demanded a repeal of the “three black laws”. “All our objections and fear will go if the three laws are taken back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-agrees-to-review-farmers-key-demands/story-VxKFdGZDsIKiab2SbEzb8I.html
04-12-2020||India||Naga body cautions against short-term gains after Governor’s controversial remarks||The Forum for Naga Reconciliation (FNR), an assemblage of Naga people from diverse backgrounds focused on reconciliation and peace building through dialogue, on Thursday urged Naga leaders and Government of India to avoid politicking for short-term gains amid a massive row triggered by Nagaland governor RN Ravi.Ravi, who is also the Centre’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks, in a recent message had hailed the controversial 16 Point Agreement signed between the Naga People’s Convention (NPC) and the government of India which led to the formation of the state of Nagaland in 1963. H ealso unveiled a memorial to commemorate the contributions of the “founding fathers” of the state at the Raj Bhavan in Kohima on December 1.Both his remarks and the memorial are being seen as attempts to create fissures in the Naga society and continue to draw flak.The FNR in a statement asserted that the 16 Point Agreement was one of the historical events seen to have decisively fragmented the Naga political movement and induced situations for division and disunity.“The failure of the 16 Point Agreement led the Government of India to sign the ‘Framework Agreement’ with NSCN (IM) in 2015 and the ‘Agreed Position’ with NNPGs in 2017. Yet, the recent public display to idolize the 16 Point Agreement reveals the true hand behind the gestures of peace. If the intention was to win the hearts of the Nagas, this policy and approach demonstrates lack of acumen and prudence,” the FNR said. It pointed out that while the majority of Naga people across Nagaland rejected the 16 Point Agreement of 1960 and Shillong Accord of 1975 which were signed with the government of India, the consequences of these events led to bitterness, loss of human life, suspicion, distrust, fragmentation of Naga land and division.The FNR said that honest discussion, healing, forgiveness and reconciliation are required around those historical events, but the trauma and wounds are still raw and sensitive, provoking the worst out of one another.“It, therefore, is not surprising that the Indian State and its agencies with guile and statecraft have actively steered the statehood narrative intensifying division and simultaneously normalising complacency and conformity among the Naga populace. But to what end? A divided Naga house is in nobody’s long term interest,” the FNR stated.Maintaining that Nagas are united in their historical and political rights even if their opinions and approaches were divided, the forum said Nagas are learning to use their differences to heal and it would be beneficial for all, including the government of India and Naga neighbours, to encourage and support a “reconciled and healed Naga people”.“To meet the transforming needs of our contemporary realities both Naga leaders and Government of India need to avoid politicking for short-term gains,” the FNR said while calling for the need to be political with statesman-like character and diplomatic qualities that are based on sincerity and respect.Earlier, the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM), the Naga Students’ Federation and apex tribal body, the Naga Hoho, had condemned the governor’s statement with similar sentiments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-body-cautions-against-short-term-gains-after-governor-s-controversial-remarks/story-djla004AM4e2OU2Cu7VC5M.html
04-12-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee speaks to protesting farmers; sends emissary to meet them at Singhu border||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee spoke to the representatives of the farmers protesting against contentious farm laws and sent an emissary to meet them at the Delhi-Haryana border on Friday. This comes a day after she threatened a nationwide protest if the Centre did not scrap the laws that allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions.“The CM [chief minister] made at least four calls to different farmers’ groups from Haryana and Punjab. They shared their demands with the chief minister and thanked her for her solidarity. They also expressed their gratitude for all her support to farmers and the land movement in the past,” Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, a lawmaker of Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) said. “[Derek] O’Brien, TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader, spent four hours meeting various groups of farmers who have parked their tractors and other vehicles on the highway at the [Delhi-Haryana] Sighu border.”The TMC’s top leadership was expected to meet later on Friday to chalk out their future course of action against the farm laws including the Essential Commodities Act. “...We will discuss how the Essential Commodities Act is impacting common people and resulting in skyrocketing prices. The central government must withdraw this anti-people law,” Banerjee tweeted on Thursday.Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the three laws, saying they will hurt their incomes even as the government has maintained they will enhance them. They say the laws are a precursor to the withdrawal of government support for farming and will replace existing middlemen with more powerful corporate entities.Fourteen years ago, on this day (December 4), Banerjee started her 26-day hunger strike while intensifying the Singur movement in West Bengal against forcible land acquisition.“14 years ago on 4 Dec 2006, I began my 26 day hunger strike in Kolkata demanding that agricultural land cannot be forcefully acquired. I express my solidarity with all farmers who are protesting against draconian farm bills passed without consultation by Centre. #StandWithFarmers,” Banerjee tweeted on Friday.The BJP responded to the CM’s move later. “Kisan mandis in West Bengal exist only on paper while farmers in the state are not getting the minimum price and selling their produce at distress rates. Potatoes are selling at double the normal rates. But what rates are the farmers getting? The TMC is merely trying to divert the attention away from the state,” said BJP leader Samik Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-speaks-to-protesting-farmers-sends-emissary-to-meet-them-at-singhu-border/story-Js94pYm5hVZGKMelWzxuHM.html
04-12-2020||India||Expelled BJD MLA arrested in Tata Motors job scam||Four days after he was expelled from Odisha’s ruling Biju Janata Dal, three-time MLA and former minister Pradeep Panigrahy was arrested by the CID in a cybercrime case in which he allegedly defrauded several youths promising them jobs in Tata Motors.CID officials who had picked Panigrahy this evening from his official residence in Bhubaneswar arrested him under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act 2000 accusing him of collecting money on behalf of Akash Pathak , falsely promising jobs in Tata Motors. The sub divisional magistrate’s court in Bhubaneswar remanded him judicial custody for 14 days. Akash Pathak, son of senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Abhay Pathak is already in jail since last week in a disproportionate assets case filed by the vigilance department. Over the last few days several youths in Gopalpur, the constituency of Panigrahy, had accused Pathak of promising them jobs in Tata Motors posing as managing director of Tata Motors passenger car division.Tata Motors too had accused Pathak of impersonation and forgery and had lodged a complaint with the CID after it was revealed that Pathak conned many people by introducing himself as MD (in-charge) of Tata Motors passenger car division. Panigrahy’s wife Sujata said the case was an attempt to frame her husband. “Several persons identifying themselves as CID officials came to our residence at Unit-6 and took my husband with them in a vehicle informing me that they were taking him to the Economic Offence Wing office. If anything happens to my husband, I will drag everyone to the court and chief minister Naveen Patnaik alone will be responsible for this,” she said.Vigilance and CID officials said they are further probing huge deposits into Panigrahy’s accounts. There were at least four instances when around Rs 2 crore was deposited into his bank account by 5 different people. Similarly, Rs 50 lakh was transferred from the account of Panigrahy to Akash Pathak.Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate on Thursday began a probe into money laundering charges and financial affairs of suspended IFS officer Abhay Kant Pathak and his son Akash who had made 20 trips to different cities of the country during lockdown using chartered flights. Joint Director (ED), Madhav Chandra Mishra said the agency would probe all the allegations of money laundering and other deposits and investments made by the father-son duo. The vigilance department which is interrogating the father-son duo has so far found Rs 16.05 crore including cash deposit of Rs 10.76 crore in their bank accounts raising suspicion of benami transaction and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expelled-bjd-mla-arrested-in-tata-motors-job-scam/story-RBzOrkH5t27obMmE115juI.html
04-12-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan led to $14 billion economic losses, says global report||Super cyclone Amphan, which made landfall in the Sunderbans near the India-Bangladesh border in May this year, is estimated to be the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean with economic losses amounting to about $14 billion, according to the World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) provisional report on the State of Global Climate released on Wednesday. The cyclone caused large-scale evacuation of residents of coastal areas in India and Bangladesh where 129 lives were lost in the cyclone. Amphan reached the category 5 equivalent intensity (a wind speed greater than 156 mph, according to the UK Met Office) while over the Bay of Bengal and weakened before landfall to a category 2 storm but led to extensive damage in Kolkata and surrounding areas. Around 2.4 million people were displaced in India, mainly in West Bengal and Odisha, and 2.5 million in Bangladesh. While many returned soon afterwards, damage to more than 2.8 million homes resulted in displacement of thousands, the WMO statement added.This year is also very likely to be one of the three warmest years on record globally since temperature record-keeping began in 1850, according to the WMO report.The global mean temperature for January to October 2020 was around 1.2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to breaching the 1.5°C threshold that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet. Data sets used by WMO suggest that 2020 is the second warmest year on record, preceded only by 2016 and followed by 2019. The exact rankings for each data set could change once data for the entire year are available.A 1.5°C rise in average temperature over pre-industrial times is the threshold beyond which many regions, including India, will record extreme temperatures; increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy rainfall and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions, IPCC warned last year in a special report titled Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees.At a global mean temperature of 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels in the first 10 months, this year has already been dominated by extreme climate events, including excessive heat, wildfires and floods and a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season, which added to the crisis posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Heavy rain and flooding affected the Sahel, the Greater Horn of Africa, India and neighbouring areas, China, Korea and Japan, and parts of south-east Asia at various times of the year, the report said. Over 2,000 deaths were reported during the monsoon in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Myanmar. India experienced one of the two wettest monsoon seasons since 1994. August was the wettest month on record for PakistanThe warmest region this year was northern Asia, particularly the Siberian Arctic, where temperatures were more than 5°C above average. Siberian heat was at its peak in June, when it reached 38°C at Verkhoyansk on June 20, the highest known temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. This fuelled the worst wildfire season in an 18-year-long data record, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions released by fires, according to the WMO. The number of tropical cyclones globally was above average in 2020, with 96 cyclones as of November 17 in the northern hemisphere and the 2019-2020 southern hemisphere seasons. “Only 4% of the global tropical cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal. These cyclones do not usually grow as intense as the cyclones in the Pacific or Atlantic but the damage is larger because of the vulnerability and exposure. These 4% cyclones cost about 80% of the global fatalities and a huge economic loss,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-led-to-14-billion-economic-losses-says-global-report/story-FWbYlDCccVSgIDNna93W5L.html
04-12-2020||India||India orders Wikipedia to delete map that shows Aksai Chin in China||The Union government has asked Wikipedia to take down a map that shows Aksai Chin as a part of China, issuing a strongly-worded letter to the United States-based nonprofit, according to officials familiar with the matter.Wikipedia is one of the most popular repositories of information online, and works on a volunteer-based model to compile the information, distinct from social media platforms that have recently been pulled up over similar issues.The contentious Wikipedia page, which links the incorrect map, is on Bhutan-India relations and talks about the ties between the two countries.The secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Ajay Sawhney issued the order to Wikipedia on November 27. A senior government official said he had invoked section 69A of the Information Technology Act that empowers the government to order intermediaries to block public access of any information.“The secretary further adds that it violates the territorial integrity of the country, and it is well within the power of the ministry under section 69A to order it to be taken down,” said one of the officials, asking not to be named.“The secretary has satisfied himself that the map has been wrongly depicted,” this person said. In the order, this person added, the secretary states that the content posted on the website is done with the intent to “defame” the country and has the “potential to disturb the sovereignty and harmony of the nation”.“As can be seen from its public talk page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors are in fact currently reviewing and working to ensure that the Bhutan-India Relations article and image meet Wikipedia’s quality standards,” Wikipedia told HT via email. This, however, is not the first time the government has taken up the misrepresentation of the map of India this year. In September this year, the government served Twitter with a notice over a similar map issue — the geotag for Leh showed it as a part of China. The government had asked Twitter to provide an explanation on why action should not be taken against the micro-blogging website. Twitter has since resolved the issue.The use of an incorrect map in Wikipedia was brought to the notice of the ministry when a Twitter user tagged the Union home ministry and asked them to take strict action against the website. The contentious Wikipedia page is titled Bhutan-India relations and talks about the bilateral ties between the two countries. It talks about the military cooperation between the two countries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bhutan in 2014.Although the ministry has not specified a time frame within which to remove the map, it has been monitoring the website to see when action would be taken. As of Wednesday evening, HT could access the incorrect map.If Wikipedia fails to respond in a timely fashion, officials said, then two legal options are available to the ministry. It can either initiate action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which can result in the imprisonment of the parties concerned, or invoke section 69A to block access to the website in India.The latter has been invoked to ban over 250 mobile applications, mostly with links to China, including popular short video platform TikTok and multiplayer game PUBG since the standoff between the two countries at the Line of Actual Control in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delete-map-that-shows-aksai-chin-as-part-of-china-india-tells-wikipedia/story-TCT6rUz89TU2wrN8k7HwOL.html
04-12-2020||Editorials||On the climate, a new warning | HT Editorial||2020 is on track to be the second warmest year on record globally since temperature record-keeping began in 1850, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)’s State of the Global Climate 2020 report released on Wednesday. It is preceded by 2016 and followed by 2019. Despite a global halt in economic activities due to Covid-19 and the cooling effect of La Nina, the global mean temperature for January to October 2020 was around 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to breaching the 1.5-degree threshold above which scientists warn of catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. The results of high global mean temperature have been evident across the world. These 10 months were dominated by extreme climate events, including excessive heat, wildfires and floods.For India, high temperatures have had a devastating impact on communities, the economy, and biodiversity. According to the Lancet Countdown On Health And Climate Change report, released on Thursday, the country recorded the highest loss in work hours (118.3 billion work hours) or productivity because of extreme heat in 2019 — the year saw a record number of above-baseline days of heat wave exposure affecting its elderly population. June’s super cyclone, Amphan, led to an economic loss amounting to about $14 billion, says the WMO report.The two reports serve as yet another round of warning and reminder that the defining task for the 21st century for the world and India will be to use the recovery from the pandemic as an opportunity to build a climate-resilient future. That the Centre has formed a panel to implement India’s targets under the Paris Climate Agreement, which completes five years this month, is good news. While India is on target to achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution — efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impact of the climate crisis — it needs to be more proactive in moving away from coal and stop investing in projects that erode its natural resource base; invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, green mobility, renewable energy; and ensure that planning, implementing and monitoring process is climate-resilient. For all of this, India needs global support for green technology and resources up to $2.5 trillion in the 15-year period till 2030 for climate action. Building a climate-resilient future is not just a policy test; for every country, it’s now a moral test as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-the-climate-a-new-warning-ht-editorial/story-5dHr2Xx4e2XO7S7ikt6h3H.html
04-12-2020||Editorials||Why MSP is not a solution||A key debate after the enactment of three farm-reform laws and the subsequent protests is around the issue of federally-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), a system guaranteeing farmers assured prices for their produce through procurement. MSP is an obligatory, not a statutory exercise. Farmers have demanded a legislation to prohibit sale of any farm produce below these minimum prices. If the government agrees to this, it is likely they will end their protests against the three new farm reforms. But a law making MSPs the legal floor price defies economic logic. The government sets MSPs for 23 crops, but it is effective only in case of rice and wheat because it buys only these two commodities in sufficiently large quantities. MSPs are an assurance that the government will intervene if market rates fall below that threshold, thereby helping avoid distress sale. This policy was salutary when India faced acute food shortages. Farm policies to deal with surpluses will fundamentally have to be different from measures adopted to overcome a previous era of scarcity. A law barring purchases of the other 21 crops below MSPs by any private trader will also, immediately, fuel high inflation. Every one percentage point increase in MSPs leads to a 15-basis point increase in inflation. Higher MSPs could also upend the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation targets, hurting economic growth. An MSP mechanism that ignores demand and global prices creates market distort-ions. If it is not profitable for traders to buy at MSPs, then the private sector will exit the markets. In such a scenario, the government cannot be a monopoly buyer. Mandatory MSPs will render India’s agri- exports non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices. MSPs have also incentivised foodgrains over other crops, giving rise to imbalances of water and land resources and shifting land away from crops such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating costly imports. Surplus cereals can’t be exported without a subsidy, which invites the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s objections. WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidised food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms. There is no argument that farmers need support, but policies that are less distortionary are in the interest of both farmers and consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-msp-is-not-a-solution/story-drNBDx2fYTL1JTWh5ye27K.html
04-12-2020||Editorials||The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu polls||After years of flirting with politics and dropping hints about his own political ambitions, Rajinikanth, Tamil cinema’s biggest living icon – he remains that, although he has competition from some of the younger actors -- has finally announced that he will launch his own political party in January. Timed with the state assembly elections scheduled for next summer, his entry will create a new dynamic in a state where the line between art, stardom and politics has always been blurred. The Dravidian political movement saw a range of figures — CN Annadurai and M Karunanidhi, both established writers; MG Ramachandran, the tallest Tamil actor of his time; Jayalalithaa, the Karnataka-born Brahmin actor who built on MGR’s legacy — who straddled these diverse worlds. In recent times, Kamal Haasan and Vijayakanth have made unsuccessful forays into the political theatre. But, Rajnikanth’s cult following places him in a different category. The issue, however, for the new entrant is that that there are certain entrenched patterns and players within state politics, hard to challenge and harder to displace. How he navigates the cross currents of deep identity-based resentment against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state with his own perceived proximity to the party with which he is widely expected to ally; how he builds a new party organisation to take on the well-oiled machines of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam; how he distinguishes himself in what is already a crowded political landscape with a range of smaller players catering to diverse sub-castes; and how he delivers a message of bringing change will be the key determinants of his political future. But there is little doubt that irrespective of whether he succeeds or not, Rajinikanth’s entry will shape the nature of politics in an important state that sends 39 MPs to the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-rajinikanth-factor-in-tamil-nadu-polls/story-Tu3OG8n1G7dqtcrxqW31HP.html
