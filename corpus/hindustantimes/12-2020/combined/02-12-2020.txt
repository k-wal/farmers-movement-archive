02-12-2020||News||Corporate-owned banks pose a risk||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the sentinel of our banking system having occasionally faltered as the supreme banking regulator, is often seen to be working in tandem with the government. Perhaps that is the reason why some suspect that its recent recommendation that pave the way for industrial houses to own and control banks may well have originated from a government which realises that public sector banks lack the capacity to provide credit to meet the growing needs of industry; that the supply of credit is unlikely to match its demand.Public sector banks with the baggage of non-performing assets (NPAs) have limited space to lend. Consequently, more banking and financial institutions are needed to serve the demands of industrial enterprises.Ever since demonetisation in 2016, the economy’s steep downturn has been a cause for concern. With the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, its crippling effect is being felt in almost every sector of the economy other than those that use technology and digital platforms for providing goods and services. Several sectors of the economy are in dire need of credit. Public sector banks are reluctant to advance them credit for obvious reasons. Apart from the norms of RBI, the Kamath Committee’s parameters for restructuring of loans will lead to large sections of business enterprises being deprived of credit. Given these parameters, the State Bank of India, the largest lender among public sector banks, may restructure barely 5% of distressed borrowers. Public sector banks are averse to risk-lending. Bank officers, being easy targets, are concerned about becoming victims in future at the hands of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). No bank is likely to extend credit unless the loan is fully secured by collateral, the value of which gives absolute comfort to the bank. There is hardly any sector of the economy which has assets, in the midst of the pandemic, to provide enough security for advancing credit. The most badly-hit sectors are road construction, real estate, housing and hospitality, manufacturing and tourism, among others. These sectors provide maximum employment opportunities for the less privileged. Ironically, these are also the sectors that are starved of credit.A few large corporate houses control a substantial part of our national assets. We are seeing the rise of economic oligarchs in key sectors of the economy. The perception gaining ground is that a few close to this government are patronised by public sector banks which provide them the much-needed capital in the form of credit to acquire assets critical for our future needs. If industrial houses are licensed to set up banks, they will ensure that a large part of the credit goes to their “relative subsidiaries and other connected enterprises”. RBI does not have the wherewithal to oversee every such banking transaction. Experiments in other countries allowing industrial houses to set up banks have failed miserably. The United States (US) does not allow corporate houses to set up banks. It violates the principle of conflict of interest and can, on no account, be justified.Given the fact that industrial houses already control critical assets in our economy, to allow them to set up banks will make them even more powerful. A democratic country cannot afford to have its economy being controlled by a few powerful industrial houses which also have a huge stake in the banking system.Of deeper concern is the public perception that these industrial houses are close to the ruling establishment. The electoral bonds which have been issued are seen to be contributions by such corporate houses to the political party in power. This gives rise to the suspicion that in the event they are allowed to set up banks, lending too will be targeted to benefit businesses and individual borrowers associated with or close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Inherent in such a situation is rampant discrimination in the flow of credit which, in turn, will build compliant businesses and destroy non-compliant enterprises.We have seen in the past how scams have occurred within the banking system. The scandals emerging from suspect banking practices in Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS), Dewan Housing Financial Corporation Limited (DHFL) and many others, including individuals being investigated, have discredited both the banking system and the manner in which it is regulated. RBI’s oversight mechanisms are clearly not effective enough. The practices within the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also left much to be desired. It is imperative for RBI to consider other mechanisms to expand lending to businesses. The expansion of NBFCs under strict regulatory mechanisms is one option, but the heart of the problems lies in the direct and indirect influences that operate within our banking structure which need course correction. Unless the banking system adheres to strict parameters guided by best practices, the possibility of the banking system turning around and providing for much-needed credit to the industry is bleak. That RBI has made such a recommendation despite the contrary opinion of the expert committee, is disturbing. RBI must justify its decision with unequivocal logic before it embarks upon this enterprise. Otherwise, it will not only compromise its own dignity and independence, but will also be charged with being a dependent, rather than an independent, banking regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/corporate-owned-banks-pose-a-risk/story-irwwGFQfy57MXVWbeIxYKL.html
02-12-2020||News||In higher education, it is time to prioritise Indian languages||Indian languages have never got the importance they deserve in the higher education system. Teaching and learning have largely been in a foreign language. But a change is in the offing, with the advent of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi recently tweeted: “Taking inspiration from the National Education Policy, it will now be tried to teach all technical courses including medical, engineering in mother tongue.”It is time we focused on the use of the mother tongue or regional language as a medium of instruction in higher education. The discussion on the use of the mother tongue in education goes back to the time of Lord Macaulay. This debate continued in post-independent India with the release of the Radhakrishnan Committee report of 1948-49, known as the Report of the University Education Commission. It recommended that English be replaced by an Indian language as the medium of instruction for higher education as early as practicable. This was followed by the Official Language Commission, Emotional Integration Committee, NEP (1968), NEP (1986/1992) and NEP 2020.Each report also pronounced that Indian languages are a sine qua non for educational and cultural development since they strengthened equity in education.The current NEP recommends that higher education institutions should use the mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer bilingual programmes. This will help provide quality teaching to more students and thus increase Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education. It will also promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages. This way, private institutions too will be motivated to use Indian languages as a medium of instruction and/or offer bilingual programmes. This will ensure that there is no difference between government and private institutions.The teachers’ training programme, the four-year Bachelor of Education dual degree, will also be bilingual. This will facilitate the training of cadres of teachers across subjects. Science and math teachers will also adopt the bilingual approach to teaching.To translate recommendations into action, high-quality learning and print material in Indian languages, including textbooks, workbooks, videos, plays, poems, novels and magazines, will be developed. This will be done by creating quality programmes in translation and interpretation. To this end, an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI) will be established. This will employ numerous scholars in Indian languages, subject experts as well as experts in translation and interpretation. Technology will be used to aid in these translation and interpretation efforts.Teaching in the mother tongue/ regional language will help in building an equitable education system. The ministry of education will work to develop an equitable system based on the principles of fairness and inclusion. For the system to be fair, we should ensure that the personal and social circumstances of students should in no way be obstacles to realising their full academic potential. At the same time, to ensure inclusion through the use of the mother tongue/ regional language, we should set up a basic minimum standard of education which eliminates all disparity.While it is necessary to strengthen Indian languages as medium of instruction while enhancing the principle of equity in education to improve educational standards, it is equally imperative for students to have a good command over the English language since they are global natives in the 21st century. But this cannot be at the cost of Indian languages as a medium of instruction. Indian languages must be supplemented by English. It is heartening to note that institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Kharagpur and Roorkee, and Banaras Hindu University, among others, have come forward to promote the use of Indian languages. These initiatives will prepare students to live in a local, national and global society utilising a harmonious blend of Indian languages and English as recommended by NEP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-higher-education-it-is-time-to-prioritise-indian-languages/story-G9qRgxvZHqrJsRcI2b1kWN.html
02-12-2020||News||Strive for a sustainable ocean economy||Global warming, along with the impact of other negative human activities, is devastating our oceans. This has led to an alarming rise in sea levels that could displace millions of people. The ocean is turning warmer, less predictable, and more acidic, causing a decline in fish stocks and the death of coral reefs.The millions of tonnes of plastics dumped into the oceans every year contaminate at least 700 species of marine life. Unregulated overfishing has already driven many marine species to extinction and this could eventually threaten global food security. Oceans produce half the planet’s oxygen and absorb more than 90% of the anthropogenic heat. The ocean-led economy is estimated to be contributing more than $1.5 trillion a year to the global economy, with millions employed in related sectors.We must understand that if the resources of the ocean are sustainably harnessed, it could multiply economic benefits while protecting the natural ecosystem. The solution lies in collaboration among stakeholders, governments, businesses and coastal communities.The High Level Panel for A Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), launched in 2018 by 14 world leaders, is leading the initiative for a sustainable ocean economy. It comprises leaders from Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal. It has proposed the ocean as a solution to a more resilient world and has committed to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters.The Covid-19 pandemic and the economic loss caused by it have increased the need for governments to find opportunities for sustainable growth. The Ocean Panel lays emphasis on the fact that the ocean economy will be more important than ever for a post-Covid-19 recovery. A report commissioned by the panel — Ocean Solutions That Benefit People, Nature and the Economy — spells out the new contours of the relationship between the ocean and humanity.Investing $2.8 trillion today in four ocean-based solutions — offshore wind production, sustainable ocean-based food production, decarbonisation of international shipping, and conservation and restoration of mangroves — will yield a net benefit of $15.5 trillion by 2050, the report says. It also delineates the path for policymakers to achieve a sustainable ocean economy by focusing on five building blocks: Using science and data to drive decision-making; engaging in goal-oriented ocean planning; de-risking finance and using innovation to mobilise investment; stopping land-based pollution; and changing ocean accounting so that it reflects the true value of the ocean.All this will be key in achieving what the report calls the three Ps of effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity. The incentives for governments to undertake this are powerful in terms of net benefits in the long-run.India, with its coastline of 7,500 km, has a lot to gain if it aligns itself with the objective of a sustainable ocean economy. We have coast harbours, rich ecosystems with extensive mangroves, seaweed beds, salt marshes and coral reefs. About 250 million people live within 50km of the coast, many of whom depend on the sea for their livelihood.India has to do a lot in the management of maritime litter, especially plastics. Around 80% of all marine pollution originates on land. The most effective way of stopping ocean pollution is to tackle pollution on land. Shifting to a circular economy will yield enormous benefits.The responsibility for tackling plastic pollution lies not just with the government, but also corporates. Corporates must play a major part in reducing plastic pollution. Hindustan Unilever Limited, as the biggest consumer products company in India, aims to keep plastics within the circular economy. Unilever has committed to ensuring that 100% of plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. Over the last two years in India, we have facilitated the safe disposal of more than 1,00,000 tonnes of post-consumer use plastic waste. We have partnered with United Nations Development Programme and Xynteo’s India 2022 coalition to establish holistic solutions for managing end-to-end dry waste management and achieve circular economy for plastics including through behavioural change.The development of a sustainable ocean economy is essential for India in its quest to become a $10-trillion economy in the next decade-and-a-half. With wide-scale collaboration, the help of data-driven decision-making, goal-oriented ocean planning, mobilising of investment under innovative models and reducing the land pollution, we can achieve economic goals sustainably.The ocean holds answers to several challenges that humanity is facing. We must protect what we are left with. As the report says, “The ocean is not too big to fail, and it is not too big to fix. But it is too big to ignore.” We owe a sustainable ocean economy to our next generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/strive-for-a-sustainable-ocean-economy/story-XKesEve1bFdzYYlAhGRHSM.html
02-12-2020||News||On farm laws, how the Centre faltered||The farmers’ agitation at Delhi’s doorstep exposes deep fault lines and new possibilities in the politics of representation, the politics of reforms and the politics of Centre-state relations. These have significant consequences not only for the future of agriculture, but also for the future of negotiating economic reforms and federal relations in India.First, on the politics of representation. Yogendra Yadav’s repeated reference to the Mahendra Singh Tikait-led farmers’ protest of 1988 to emphasise the “historic” nature of the current protests is a reminder of the deep vacuum of agrarian interests in contemporary party politics. This was the result of an economic consensus that sought to push agriculture to the margins — the best way to improve agricultural productivity is to get people out of agriculture was the well-accepted policy mantra. Agrarian interests were depoliticised and farmers treated as a constituency to be managed. However, in recent years, growing agricultural distress has led to a resurgence of farmer agitations — for instance, the long march in Mumbai in 2018 — which pushed agriculture into the mainstream discourse of the 2019 election and highlighted the return of farmers as a political constituency. The post-Green Revolution mobilisation coalesced around the interests of landed farmers. However, deepening agrarian distress led to a broadening of solidarities, as documented by the scholar Shreya Sinha in the specific instance of Punjab, that cut across traditional class, caste and gender lines. In the long march of 2018, Adivasi and landless farmers walked alongside the landed, demanding political recognition. The current protests, although dominated by landed farmers, also include small farmers and farm labourers. Regardless of their economic rationale, the new farm laws have amplified uncertainties for all those whose livelihoods are intertwined with agriculture, and it is these collective anxieties that are finding political expression today. The Centre’s refusal to address these anxieties, and instead clamp down hard and discredit protests as voices of vested interests or worse, is a great disservice to the genuine fears that are seeking expression. But, in its hubris, the government is also opening up new sites of mobilisation that have the potential to shift the current status quo in agrarian politics.Second, the entire chain of events from the promulgation of the ordinances to their passage as Acts exposes the deep failures of our politics of reforms. India’s reform narrative has repeatedly pitted politics against “good economics”, demonstrating impatience with the often endless negotiations and compromises that politics necessitates. It is this impatience that has legitimised bypassing political and institutional processes in the name of reforms. The three farm laws are a textbook example of this approach. Choosing to introduce central legislation on state subjects without any debate, refusing to consult farmers or even to give their anxieties a hearing, and pushing the bills through Parliament without debate are, at one level, typical of the modus operandi of this government. But, at another level, they also have deep legitimacy in a policy discourse that is impatient with the pulls and pressures of realpolitik. By riding roughshod over processes and bypassing politics, reforms, especially those that seek to bring about far-reaching changes in the existing status quo as the current farm laws seek to do, fail to overcome resistance and push poor policy design. There is no question that India’s agriculture markets are in urgent need of reform, but to assume this can be done without responding to the anxieties of those impacted — farmers, middlemen and labourers — and without assurances of protection and finding a middle ground, is a recipe for failure. Worse, we are now locked in a politics of distrust where arriving at a consensus for reforming the subsidy regime, price support system and procurement will be near-impossible. Reforming agriculture needs a politics and institutional process where farmers have a stake in reforms and an assurance that their concerns will be responded to. Finally, the federal question looms large in the entire reform approach. On the one hand, it risks weak implementation. By centralising agriculture reforms, the laws leave unaddressed the question of ownership of state-specific functions — from taxation to dispute resolution and building physical markets, vital to effective implementation. States can easily pass the buck to the Centre, leaving in its wake a vicious cycle of reform failure, not unfamiliar to India. Successful reforms need Centre-state coordination, and not centralisation. But the greater challenge is political. By introducing legislation on state subjects, the farm laws set a dangerous precedent that risks reopening the federal consensus. Moreover, Haryana’s response to protesters from Punjab also points to new emergent tensions in inter-state dynamics.Now that the process of negotiations has begun, will the current impasse break? The laws are unlikely to be repealed and the farm leaders probably know this. But it is for the Centre to show political statesmanship and use this opportunity to rebuild trust with farmers and bring the states to the negotiation table. A renewed politics of trust is the only way India can set about the task of reforming agriculture.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, Centre for Policy Research.

02-12-2020||News||Don’t create a world of immunity haves and have-nots||On November 23, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline is considering a rule requiring passengers to get a coronavirus vaccine before they can board its planes. Joyce added the idea was being discussed in a broader conversation among his peers, although the International Air Transport Association called the idea “a bit premature”. Premature as it may be, similar ideas — such as what has been referred to as immunity passport — have been spoken of in the context of the pandemic, and as vaccines begin shipping, it is likely to take centre-stage soon.There are legal and practical precedents for what Joyce suggested, known as vaccination certificates recognised by the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (IHR). At present, the sole universal disease recognised is the Yellow Fever — passengers arriving from affected regions (mostly African and South America nations) or travelling to them may be required to produce them. Covid-19 vaccination certificates could be included in WHO recommendations under its “public health emergency of international concern” guidelines or any of 196 member-states could ask for an inclusion of it under IHR. But mandating these certificates at any level, international or domestic, comes with ethical and economic implications till vaccines become affordable, accessible and are in adequate supply for all. Assessments of vaccine supply deals suggest high-income countries have secured the bulk of the supply available till the end of the next year — some have enough commitments to cover their populations twice over. Once they do receive a vaccine, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are likely to take longer to inoculate their large populations.The lack of adequate supply chain infrastructure and electricity can compound these challenges, as can typically endemic issues of corruption and domestic inequity that often afflict the Global South. WHO’s state of inequality report in 2019 found that full childhood immunisation — possibly the closest example of vaccines that are a must — coverage varies wildly in LMICs. In the 67 LMICs surveyed (excluding India and China), the median coverage varied from 51% to 83% for children under the age of one. In 16 countries, less than one in four children got full immunisation. In 11 of these countries, children in the richest quintile were twice as likely to be immunised as children in the poorest.Pharmaceutical powerhouses such as India and China are likely to be able to minimise their disadvantage, but — at least in the case of India — estimates by experts suggest only about 30-40% of the country is likely to be vaccinated till the end of 2021. For populations that do not have widespread coverage, this could translate into lopsided restrictions on even essential travel. The difference between the immunity haves and have-nots will not just impact lives but also livelihoods. Covid-19 has exacerbated inequities. People who have had the most capital have had access to better health care at a time when most public utilities have been overwhelmed. People in white collar jobs have been able to quarantine, isolate and earn while working from home, while others have lost pay and employment as their workplaces shut. Children who have the means continued studying online, while millions of others without phones or internet face a lost academic year.Governments and businesses must chart a path out of this pandemic that minimises inequities. These conversations have begun in some of the richest countries, such as the United States where President Donald Trump had access to potentially life-saving coronavirus treatment that is out of reach for ordinary Americans. It is a conversation that has been reignited by the high prices of the most effective vaccine candidates, which cost up to 10 times as much as the cheapest. Bioethicists and philanthropists had indeed flagged the issue as poorer countries struggled with lack of political or economic leverage. India must evaluate any decision that could lead us to prioritise those with immunocapital because the ones without it will likely be the victims of choices they did not make.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-create-a-world-of-immunity-haves-and-have-nots/story-qNMgeIpS44rffy4sTV5jcL.html
02-12-2020||News||Stewards, not bystanders: Civil society creates new opportunity to co-design cities||This year, I have been from Bengaluru to Kabini and back several times. Every time I return from the forest and the rural countryside, my eyes and senses hit refresh, and I see my home city with a new perspective.The overwhelming impression is of a metro undergoing a painful renewal. Masses of threatening concrete overhead, piles of rubble underneath. And through this grey canvas, dots of colour as hapless citizens weave through the traffic, without proper visibility or signposts, navigating past trucks and haulers, moody traffic signals and perplexing roundabouts.It feels as if Bengaluru, like so many other cities in India, is testing its residents. The unfinished infrastructure is a poster promise of a better future. The city demands patience, demands faith, demands hope. The residents experience resignation, weariness, and a lasting numbness.When I finally get home, I enter an urban version of the forest I left behind – my neighbourhood has a dense canopy of trees. Yet Bengaluru is not homogenous, and my sylvan surroundings are an anomaly now in the erstwhile garden city. It has a criss-cross of diverse identities and designs. It has layers and layers of privilege on top and tiers of disenfranchisement below. Yet, the dysfunctionality of the city creates a perverse equaliser. It brings an end to the secession of the elite. Our bubble breaks with the chaos of the traffic, the pervasive pollution and limitations on personal spaces.But there are now new opportunities to engage with the city’s future.All over India, there are efforts inviting citizens to re-imagine belonging. To make the city their own. The discourse has firmly shifted from whether the city should grow to how it should grow and change, and who should participate in the change-making.Today’s technologies enable mass participation in civic design. In metropolitan areas and beyond, digital age civil society organisations (CSOs), often helmed by creative young leaders, use tech-enabled design to challenge the supremacy of the State in urban futures. Thriving Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) and dynamic CSOs seem determined to take back their city.For example, during the lockdown, Yugantar filed a Right to Information (RTI) petition to find the total number of slums and their population in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. This data was then shared with local NGOs to better target relief work. Haiyya, through a local campaign called Health over Stigma, helped hold service providers accountable for providing safe, non-judgmental sexual and reproductive health services, especially for unmarried women. Reap Benefit in Bengaluru has developed an open civic platform that comprises a WhatsApp chatbot, a web app and a civic forum. The chatbot guides users with simplified steps through a variety of civic challenges that are engaging and fun. If you see a pothole on the road, you can send photos, but go beyond reporting to next steps. A friendly technology helps convert agitation into action and turn bystanders into stewards.Civis understands that technical environmental legislation can sometimes bypass civil society, even though we are all heavily impacted by environmental degradation. In March 2020, a draft notification with radical new rules was put up by the environment ministry for public consultation. Civis put up a simplified version and more people were able to directly participate in the consultation.We must encourage these and many other samaaj-based efforts. More importantly, we must each find our own way to participate in these ventures. Democracy cannot be a spectator sport. Good governance must be co-created, not just consumed. No matter who you are, you are first a citizen. Even if you head a government department or a successful business — you remain a citizen first, a part of your community. And I believe it is only the samaaj and institutions of the samaaj that can hold the State accountable to the larger public interest of making our cities more livable for all.Luckily, today’s new technologies allow us to participate more effectively with relative ease. I am not talking about simple clicktivism, but how a tech-enabled, societal ecosystem can distribute the ability to solve; can democratise civic engagement; and can help people co-create their city’s future.However, there is an important caution here. We need civil society itself to get more digital in the digital age. Especially because only an engaged digital samaaj can keep tech corporations more accountable and prevent them from unleashing tools that distort the political and democratic process or reduce individual and collective agency. Urban movements are critical for this cause.The pandemic has forced us to speed up our thinking on what cities should look like in the future. Citizens now have more opportunities to take active part in building urban resilience. Young leaders are creating more options for empowered citizens to co-create more humane environments. When we return to the city from the forest, we should feel a buzz, not a burn.Rohini Nilekani is chairperson, Arghyam.

Are they going to be dacoits? Mumbai is the commercial capital of the country and no one can take Bollywood away from Mumbai.”Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday met several members of the film fraternity over the film city which will be built over 1,000 acres of land in Gautam Budh Nagar district by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA).The UP CM while addressing a press conference said, “We are not taking anything anywhere. Mumbai Film City will work in Mumbai itself, new Film City in UP is being developed in a new environment according to new requirements.”The UP government’s move to build the film city has led to arguments and criticism among the Shiv Sena and the BJP.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said that Mumbai’s film industry has been developed with a lot of hard work and it will be a hard task to shift the film city elsewhere. He told news agency ANI, “It is not easy to shift Mumbai’s film city to another place. It has a long history and it is developed with a lot of hard work over the years.”Raut also asked UP CM Adityanath to make similar efforts in shifting other film cities to Gautam Budh Nagar. He questioned Yogi Adityanath if he is only trying to shift the film city from Mumbai. He said, “The film industry in south India is also big, there’re film cities in West Bengal and Punjab too. Will Yogi Ji also visit these places and talk to directors/artists there or is he going to do so only in Mumbai?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-minister-says-bollywood-can-t-be-shifted-away-from-mumbai/story-U8EKtFE97hRTqOv6OkFHKN.html

Also, meetings were held with in-charges of every police station and police post to ensure there is enough police patrolling in their respective beats.Similarly, there has been a decline in cases of murder and snatching, he added.The number of theft cases registered dropped from 134 in 2019 to 100 in 2020. In 2019, 243 cases of vehicular thefts were reported, which dropped to 171 this year.As many as 51 snatchings were reported from Panchkula in 2019, which dropped to 47 this year. Ten murder cases were reported this year compared to 19 in 2019. Last year, 39 people were arrested in 19 murder cases; whereas, in 2020, police have already arrested 18 people in 10 cases.ACP holds meeting under women’s awareness campaign As part of the women’s awareness campaign, a meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Noopur Bishnoi, assistant commissioner of police, at Morni.

02-12-2020||Mumbai||BMC to procure deep freezers to store Covid-19 vaccine at storage facility in Kanjurmarg near Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to procure multi-purpose deep freezers for its proposed vaccine storage centre in Kanjurmarg to store Covid-19 vaccines, once they are available. The multi-purpose deep freezers, according to BMC officials, will be suitable for all under-trial vaccines, which require temperatures between -80 and 8 degrees Celsius. “We have sought opinion from certain experts on procurement of deep freezers, and after getting it, we will be in a position to float bids any time this week or next. The plan is to float bids for setting up of a cold storage centre in Kanjurmarg. The location was chosen considering it is central located. For now, we are going to occupy one floor in a five-storey building owned by BMC, and further on as need arises, we will use more space,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.According to BMC officials, the civic body’s six medical institutions currently have deep freezers of all types of configuration to store vaccines, but they plan to set up a dedicated cold storage centre for Covid-19 vaccines. “The primary target for vaccine distribution is going to be the 1.25 lakh frontline workers. They will be given a vaccine first, and this preparedness at Kanjurmarg is being done for that. After them, it will be senior citizens, but the Central and state governments will issue guidelines on this. Also, participation by private health institutions will be required if we are talking about vaccinating complete cities, but again the government will issue guidelines on all this. The priority for now is frontline workers,” said Kakani.The Central government, two months ago, has already formed an expert committee comprising representatives from all relevant ministries and institutions, and the state government has also announced formation of a task force to oversee all aspects of its Covid-19 vaccine plan – from identification of the vaccine to buying to financing the purchase to distribution and administration.The BMC, on its part, already has devised a vaccine distribution strategy for around 40% population of the city that has been tagged as vulnerable.Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of Microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “Making availability of deep freezers is the right step for now. It is very clear that the first focus will be frontline workers followed by senior citizens… Also, once we start vaccination of vulnerable population, the risk and positivity will start falling down, and the spread will be restricted. Fortunately we have excellent systems in place for mass vaccination due to a well-planned health delivery system.

02-12-2020||Chandigarh||Amid surging cases, Chandigarh decides against night curfew for now||In contrast to the neighbouring states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, the UT administration has decided against imposing night curfew and changing shops’ timings in Chandigarh for the time being.The call was taken at the Covid-19 review meeting, chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, on Wednesday.While a night curfew is in place in Punjab and some districts of Himachal Pradesh in the wake of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases, UT has only increased the penalty for not wearing masks from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. “Night curfew has limited impact on containing the spread of infection. Besides, the Covid-19 situation is under control in Chandigarh,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.The administration’s decision also comes in the wake of the November-30 meeting with the cabinet secretary. In the meeting, the Centre had advised against imposing fresh lockdown restrictions and sought focus on enforcing social distancing norms and ensuring wearing of masks.Following Wednesday’s meeting, Badnore appealed to patients, who were in home isolation to approach hospitals for medical treatment, without waiting for their condition to become critical.NO BEND IN CURVENotably, Chandigarh saw a 20% surge in Covid cases in November as compared to October, though the fatalities dropped by 20% in the same period. With 2,991 cases, November accounted for around 17% of total infections reported in the city so far, while October had 2,480 cases, while the deaths decreased from 64 to 51 between the two months.In Mohali, the cases jumped by 58% between October and November, from 1990 in October to 3,140 in November, which accounts for 20% of the total cases reported so far. Similarly, the number of deaths, too, increased from 29 in October to 41 in November.Here, the curfew from 10pm to 5am was imposed from December 1 for two weeks. The movement of individuals for all non-essential activities is prohibited during these hours. Besides, the fine for not wearing masks has also been increased from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. Hotels, other hospitality units, restaurants and marriage palaces have to shut down by 9.30 pm. However, essential activities, including operation of multiple shifts in industry and offices, movement of persons and goods on national and state highways, and unloading of cargo and travel of persons to their destinations after disembarking from buses, trains and aeroplanes, are permitted. While no fresh restrictions have been imposed in Panchkula, the cases here also saw a 34% spike between October and November. While there were 1,158 cases in October, these rose to 1,547 in November, which is 17.7% of the total caseload till date.As far as deaths are concerned, November witnessed a dip in fatalities with Panchkula logging 14 deaths, while 27 deaths were reported in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-surging-cases-chandigarh-decides-against-night-curfew-for-now/story-4eomSIydZtoshQ9ghm1ERL.html
02-12-2020||Mumbai||Over 1,500 treated for post-Covid ailments at BMC hospitals, jumbo centres in Mumbai||More than 1,500 patients with post-Covid complications have sought treatment at the Outpatient Departments (OPDs) of civic-run hospitals and jumbo centres across Mumbai, with most suffering from lung fibrosis, kidney problems and diabetes, among other ailments. Although there is no cumulative data available of such patients, doctors said around 10% cases turn serious. “We have so far got around 500 recovered patients and most of them have been diagnosed with lung fibrosis, kidney ailments, breathlessness and uncontrolled diabetes,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean, BYL Nair hospital. “But only 10% develop serious illnesses, which require admission to the hospital.”Nair Hospital along with the other two civic-run facilities – Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital) and King Edward Memorial (KEM) – have provided treatment to around 1,000 patients with post-Covid complications. The BMC’s jumbo Covid care centre at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) has treated around 500 patients and the Nesco centre in Gorergaon, which opened on Monday, has got five cases so far. Apart from the residual lung damage, which could be a consequence of Covid pneumonitis leading to shortness of breath and chronic cough, post-Covid complications range from neuropsychiatric symptoms – extreme fatigue, memory loss, loss of concentration and insomnia – to cardiovascular complications – heart attacks and strokes – and gastrointestinal disturbances.Along with physical complications, patients also develop mental disorders. “This phenomenon has been common all over the world. Undergoing treatment in an isolation ward for days does have an impact on patients’ minds. We are observing depression and anxiety post recovery even among younger patients,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital. Doctors have raised the need to conduct more research to understand the implications of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, on the health of people even after they have recovered. “Individuals often report body temperature irregularities and irregularities of heart rates resulting in palpitations, all which could be the result of an autonomic dysfunction (dysfunction in the neural systems that regulate body functions). We are likely to see more and more individuals report these, and research needs to be carried out towards helping such individuals cope better,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, consultant pulmonologist, PD Hinduja Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-1-500-treated-for-post-covid-ailments-at-bmc-hospitals-jumbo-centres-in-mumbai/story-W7YYiehYo6O7oGEFDgEBwO.html
02-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad’s 65% case load concentrated in nine residential segments, Indirapuram tops the list for third consecutive month||Ghaziabad: Although Ghaziabad as a whole witnessed only a minor spike in Covid-19 cases in November, certain residential areas such as Indirapuram and Carte suffered a sharper increase.According to the records of the health department, the two localities had the highest case load in the district at 2,827 (Indirapuram) and 2,527 (Carte). In October, Indirapuram had 2,131cases and Carte had 1,960 cases. Nine residential segments in Ghaziabad had aggregate individual cases over 1000 cases each and together accounting for 65% of the total 23,114 cases (till November 30) in the district. Both Indirapuram and Carte have been figuring on the top-2 most infected spots since September. Dr. Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association-Ghaziabad said that a different strategy was required in these segments. According to official records, daily testing in the district was around 4000 tests per day in November when compared to 4065 in October and about 3928 in September. “Against the present testing of about 4,000 per day in the district, the health department needs to increase testing to about 10,000. This will require lot of staff and there will be initial surge in cases. But overall, cases will be contained. Further, more testing camps are needed to be put up in such areas and effective surveillance is also needed,” said Dr. Agarwal. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the testing and surveillance has been beefed up in high-risk areas. “We are doing aggressive testing and soon focussed testing will also start in these areas besides enhanced surveillance. Further, contact tracing and regular monitoring is being taken up on daily basis,” he said. According to a senior officer from the district health department, increased testing is limited by the availability of equipment.“The state government had said that 40% of our tests must be through RT-PCR and the rest could be rapid antigen testing,” said the officer. “At present we are conducting about 2500 antigen tests and 1500 RT-PCR tests. Testing teams have increased their efficiency but the major issue is the availability of rapid antigen kits and the viral transport media kits for transporting RT-PCR samples. We need more of these to test more.” UP’s additional chief secretary Amit Mohan Prasad, said that from December 4 to December 10 another round of focussed testing -- where certain groups of people who come in contact with many people are tested-- and surveillance in the state. “This will be done in areas with high cases are mapped by respective districts. It is aimed to filter people with symptoms and also those who came in contact with positive cases. This will immensely help us in breaking the chain of infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-s-65-case-load-concentrated-in-nine-residential-segments-indirapuram-tops-the-list-for-third-consecutive-month/story-soliqbWNYIaiHH8QDHnckK.html

Releasing the figures, UP additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that the overall case fatality rate in UP was about 1.4%, while the recovery rate is about 94.40%. “Senior citizens and people with co-morbidity need to take all precautions and are advised not to move out unnecessarily besides they should avoid crowded places. Even if there are talks about a second wave, we can say that spread of infection in UP is under control at present and we must take precautions for at least next two months,” Prasad said.Ghaziabad district administration said they were taking extra precautions.“We have different wings which are setup at our Covid control and command centre in Ghaziabad. These wings monitor health status of senior citizens and pregnant women besides people having co-morbidity and also others. With the strategy of early testing and speedy referrals we have been able to keep control over the fatalities,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to state control room figures, Ghaziabad till December 2 had 93 fatalities which account for about 0.4% of the total 23321 cases in the district.The officials of the health department said that a similar pattern of increase in fatalities with increase in age group was also witnessed in Ghaziabad.Of the 93 deaths, there were two of the age group 0-15, nine betweeen 16-30 years, 16 between 31-45 years and 33 each between 46-60 years and those over 60 years old.“It becomes vital that old aged people and especially those having co-morbid conditions stay indoors. During treatment it is also observed that older people take longer to recover. The young have recovered faster,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/age-group-over-60-years-has-highest-fatality-rate-of-45-38-in-up-ghaziabad-trend-similar/story-MknyBwfGz2GJiwPeUfWMvJ.html

A farmer from Kasganj, Nagpal used his tractor trolley for sleeping on Tuesday night while being camped at the Chilla border with Delhi. Over 200 farmers from western Uttar Pradesh were stopped at the Delhi border on Tuesday while they were on their way to Burari in Delhi to join those from Punjab and Haryana protesting against the Centre’s farm laws. “If they won’t let us go to Delhi, we will stay here only for as long as it is needed to let our brothers know that they aren’t alone in their struggles. I am used to sleeping in the open in our fields. The only difference here is that there are no stars visible,” said Nagpal. The Noida side of the border is lined with tractors and carts which are acting as makeshift beds for these farmers. Some of them have piled mattresses on roadside while others are using blankets, quilts and shawls as temporary bedding. “When we came here, we didn’t know that we would not be allowed to go. We had brought some provisions (ration and water) with us. But we had thought that once we reached Delhi, we would be able to procure more. But now we are sharing utensils and food, and taking help from local contacts,” said Mahendra Singh, a farmer from Mainpuri. The farmers are camped at the border with no idea of when they would be able to move ahead. They believe that going back is not an option. “The government policies are not in our favour. If we don’t speak up now, we will never be able to express our plight in which we are. Some of us are barely keeping their families fed. We will not move from here unless some changes are made,” said Singh. With no facilities being provided to them, the farmers are braving the cold weather conditions to spend another night near the Chilla border. Small groups could be seen throughout the day sitting, talking, cooking and trying to pass their time in hopes that the border will open and they will be allowed to go. While some of them want to join others at Burari, others feel that they would be better off highlighting their concerns at Jantar Mantar. “They (police personnel) want us to camp out elsewhere to free up the road. Our intent is not to inconvenience people, but if we move now, we will simply be dispersed and no one will listen to us,” said Satveer Bhanu, another farmer from Kasganj. A senior Noida police official said that if the farmers had only gone to Burari, they would have been let go. But just before the border it was found that they were going to Jantar Mantar and that is why they were stopped by the Delhi police. “We even offered to provide them with portable washrooms and drinking water facilities if they move to a designated area near Pari Chowk. But they refused to negotiate,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/makeshift-beds-bitter-cold-lack-of-amenities-200-farmers-spent-night-under-open-sky-at-chilla-border/story-si0pxncDGexGsScfAgjqoM.html
02-12-2020||Noida||At UP Gate, protesters find solace in hukkah and music||Ghaziabad To beat the blues of a protest, farmers who are part of the “Dilli Chalo Andolan” and camping below the UP Gate have found solace in their hukkahs and Ragini, a popular genre of music in the hinterlands of western Uttar Pradesh. Wednesday was their fifth day of protesting the Centre’s new farm laws, which they say are against their interests.Their day starts early with an attempt to bring down the Delhi Police barricades and although they manage to pull down the some of them, they refrain from crossing the border. The exercise was to energise the protesters, they said.Chants of “Takht badal do taj badal do, beimano ka raaj baadal do (change the rule of cheaters),” “Hamari mange puri karo, kisan ekta zindbad (Fulfil our demands, long live farmers’ unity)” and “Abhi to ye angdai hai, agey aur ladai hai (the fight has just begins)” fill the air.“However, the protests cannot go on for the entire day even as we remain on streets,” said Deshpal Singh, a farmer who has joined the protest from Umarpur village in Sharanpur. “At such time, a discussion over the hukkah helps. It is a favourite pastime for many and especially for older farmers.” Groups of people huddle together around a hukkah and share a smoke while reviewing newspapers and discussing strategies. Adding to the discussion would be views on social media, supplied by the younger and more tech savvy protesters. Others would be reading under the shade of the flyover while still others played their harmonium and played cards. On a usual day, they would be visiting friends and neighbours after a day’s work on the field. “In the evening, Ragini songs devoted to folk tales, patriotism and even desi folk are sung and this goes on till late night. Farmers here remember Baba Tikait (Mahendra Singh Tikait, who founded the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) that is leading the protest) ,” Singh said, adding that he has been a member of the group since 1987. Tikait is remembered for bringing Delhi to a standstill in 1988 and forced the then Rajiv Gandhi central government to agree to their many demands. Many of the vehicles at the UP Gate protest site on Wednesday had his photographs. At night, the farmers retire to under the flyover where the beds they had brought in their tractor trolleys protect them from the cold road and blankets keep away the winter chill.“Puaal (haystacks) serve well as beds for some of us. While most sleep, others keep vigil against any theft or any breaking development on the protest,” said Sandeep Chaudhary, a farmer from Lalpur village in Hapur. For cooking meals, the protesters have made wood-fired stoves on the roadsides.“We have brought potatoes, pulses and rice that can be stored easily for long. People offer us food but we try to cook our own. Fellow farmers from villages in Ghaziabad and Greater Noida send stocks of fresh vegetable,” said Chaudhary.“A group of farmers from Uttarakhand have also put up langar where they serve food all day long. It is heartening to see that many media persons also join us for food and tea at the site,” said Rajvir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU. “Talks are scheduled with the government on Thursday. So, we are expecting lot of people from states like UP, Uttarakhand and even from Madhya Pradesh to arrive. We will be holding a Mahapanchayat to discuss further strategy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-up-gate-protesters-find-solace-in-hukkah-and-music/story-AeOKQfJrLdKXVunP09e7QL.html
02-12-2020||Noida||Congestion on DND Flyway as farmers protest at Chilla border||Noida: There was heavy traffic on the DND Flyway, which connects Delhi to Noida, on Wednesday as many farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws blocked the road between the two cities at the Chilla border. The protesters had arrived on Tuesday afternoon and blocked both routes. On Wednesday, authorities and farmers combined to allow traffic from Delhi through, reducing some of the pressure on the DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj road between the two cities.The Delhi Police on Tuesday had barricaded the Chilla border on Tuesday to keep the farmers from crossing the border. “Normally, I use the Chilla border to go to Delhi but today I had to use the DND where traffic was slow. Due to the diversion at the Chilla border, many vehicles were taking U-turns that created confusion,” said Sadhna Gupta, a Noida resident.Noida Traffic department kept updating commuters about the situation on social media.“The traffic did not come to a standstill. It was moving steadily through Kalindi Kunj and the DND. We kept sharing updates with the through Twitter,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.Around 3.30 pm, Delhi Police opened up a section of Chilla border allowing traffic to move from Delhi to Noida. The protesters gathered at the other section without crossing the border.Meanwhile, Noida Police detained a group of nearly 45 farmers in the afternoon who were camped at the Mahamaya flyover.“They wanted to go to DND but were stopped at Mahamaya. Traffic was not affected as they kept on the side of the road. But when they refused to leave, the group was taken in police detention and will be challaned,” said DCP (zone 1) Rajesh S.Another smaller group found moving towards the DND Flyway border was asked by Noida Police to move to the Dalit Prerna Sthal, which they agreed.Nearly 160 Noida Police personnel, including one company of the PAC, several SHOs, ACPs etc were deployed to monitor the situation at the Chilla border, DND flyway, Mahamaya flyover and Dalit Prerna Sthal.A senior police officer said that as soon as Delhi Police allowed farmers in, they would let them move ahead. He also said that the groups in Noida will probably disperse on December 3 when farmers’ representatives in Delhi and the central government arrive at an agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/congestion-on-dnd-flyway-as-farmers-protest-at-chilla-border/story-XSOi0DWiZwWhUDYE7CY3NP.html

02-12-2020||Noida||After intervention by minister, discom calls off disconnection drive||Following the recent instructions by state energy minister Shrikant Sharma, officials of Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) have decided to approach power defaulters, instead of disconnecting their lines for not clearing their outstanding dues for the past three months. Calling off the disconnection drive will benefit as many as 65,000 defaulting consumers, said the discom officials said. PVVNL chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that the relief has been given to these consumers, taking cognisance of Covid-induced economic impact. “We have 3.25 lakh consumers in Gautam Budh Nagar district. The total outstanding dues of these consumers stand at ₹3.25 crore. We had earlier decided to carry out a massive disconnection drive in the district. But, ever since the minister gave the instructions, we have decided not to launch the disconnection drive anymore,” he said. He added that these consumers have also been given the option of clearing the dues in instalments. “To avail the instalment scheme, the defaulting consumer will have to clear at least 60% of their outstanding dues in the first instalment,” he said. When contacted, Uttar Pradesh energy minister Shrikant Sharma said that disconnection is never a solution to make debt-ridden companies self-reliant. “I’ve appealed to the public to clear their power dues in time. “If consumers clear their dues in time, not only will this help the debt-ridden discoms in overcoming their losses, but it will also ensure electricity at cheaper rates,” he said. He added that after launching the initiative called, “No Disconnection, Knock the Door”, he has asked the power officials not to disconnect electricity connections of consumers, who have not cleared their outstanding dues for the last three months. “Not only that, I’ve also asked the power corporation officials, to ensure no tripping in the National Capital Region (NCR) by next summer. The PVVNL officials have also been instructed to provide correct bills to all the consumers on time,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-intervention-by-minister-discom-calls-off-disconnection-drive/story-Gvquid8XiVXKtgpKdLFoBK.html

02-12-2020||Noida||Greater Noida authority begins process to finalise locations for street vendors||GREATER NOIDA: To regulate street vendors and ensure smooth flow of traffic on city roads, the Greater Noida authority has decided to finalise the locations for them and issue vending licences. The vendors will also be given licences for moving carts on some city roads, said officials.The officials said that the authority will get rid of all squatters after issuance of licence and offering possession at the designated site. The authority’s chief executive officer, Narendra Bhooshan, along with other officials, on Tuesday conducted an inspection in various sectors, including Alpha 1 and 2, and Beta 1 and 2 to finalise vending zones. Notably, the authority has started the process to identify street vending zones more than two years after the state government issued an order in this regard. In February 2018, the Uttar Pradesh government had approved livelihood protection and street vendor settlement guidelines, 2018, under Section 36 of the Street Vendors (livelihood protection and street vendor settlement) Act, 2014. The purpose was to identify vending zones to regulate street vendors and also issue licence to them.“We have inspected some residential areas to identify the locations for the vending zones. We have instructed the staff to identify the locations in a manner so that the vending zones do not cause hindrances to smooth flow of traffic and also benefit the residents,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.However, the Greater Noida authority has not fixed any deadline as to when they will identify these locations. The authority has decided to allow vends at a distance of 800 metres and in some areas the distance between two vending zones will be 2,000 metres depending upon the area’s population and vehicular pressure, said the officials. According to the officials, there will be three categories of vending zones -- vending zones along city roads, zones for moving vendors and zones meant for the weekly markets in each locality. The authority CEO has directed the circle officials and others to conduct a survey, talk to residents’ welfare associations or market welfare associations and others before finalizing the vending zones, the officials said. Alok Singh, founder member of Active Citizen Team, a social group, said, “The vending zone should be approved in a manner so that it does not cause traffic jams and nuisance in residential areas. Also, vends should be regulated in markets so that they do not cause sanitation issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-authority-begins-process-to-finalise-locations-for-street-vendors/story-1b3AkD49glTF0c1KR9G7NJ.html
02-12-2020||Noida||After Lucknow Municipal Corporation floats bond, Ghaziabad civic body to follow suit||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation will soon bring its bond at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). CM Yogi was addressing a gathering in Mumbai at the occasion of the listing of Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s bond at the BSE. It was in July 2019 when the UP cabinet approved the proposal of floating government bonds by the municipal corporations of Lucknow and Ghaziabad to fund their infrastructure projects. Bonds amounting to ₹350 crore, including ₹200 crore for Lucknow and ₹150 crore for Ghaziabad, were proposed to be floated. “Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of municipal bodies in the country. Nearly 80 million people live in urban areas. In a bid to provide better infrastructure and facilities, we have listed bond for Lucknow Municipal Corporation — the first civic body in north India to do so. After Lucknow, we will ask the civic body of Ghaziabad to do the same. This move will help in bringing in transparency and financial discipline in their workings, along with creating healthy competition,” UP CM said during the event in Mumbai. CM Yogi participated in the traditional ‘bell-ringing ceremony’ to release the bond in Heritage Hall of BSE on Wednesday and described the listing of the bond as “the starting of a new era” in the history of the state. “This step is important to change the fundamental work culture of municipal corporations in the state and will help not only Lucknow in augmenting infrastructural facilities and funding but also motivate other corporations t do the same. To work in such a direction, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation will soon bring its bond in BSE,” the CM said in the presence of entrepreneurs, investors, and BSE officials at Mumbai. For Ghaziabad, bonds worth ₹150 crore are proposed to be floated for the purpose of a project, which is intended to supply treated water to industrial units at a price. “The project is estimated at about ₹236 crore and rest of the funds will be roped in through the fourteenth and fifteenth finance commissions. The supply of water will also help in generating revenue and it will be sold at a price to industrial units,” said an officer of the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation, who wished not to be named. According to the initial project report, the corporation’s sewage treatment plant (STP) at Indirapuram has a net output of 40 MLD. The project is estimated to generate a net return of ₹325.43 crore after 15 years of commissioning. The officials said that the last detailed project report was prepared in November 2019. “There are several steps which we are taking up and the balance sheet for the current fiscal is getting finalised. We already have A+ rating while other documentation is being processed as per the guidelines. The detailed project report has some cost escalation and only the revised costing needs to be incorporated. With all these steps, it is likely that we finish the pending works in February,” the officer, said. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said that the work for the bond got slowed down a bit but it is being expedited. “We have now initiated the process once again and we are expediting all works for the purpose of floating the bond,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-lucknow-municipal-corporation-floats-bond-ghaziabad-civic-body-to-follow-suit/story-H2qLRijiz20r1IxuywIGLP.html
02-12-2020||Noida||Greater Noida’s air turns ‘severe’, Noida’s worsens||The air quality in the city worsened once again on Thursday due to the unfavourable weather conditions. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad continued to remain the top polluted city of the country with “severe” air quality level. Same was the case with Greater Noida, while Noida continued to suffer from “very poor” air. According to the weather analysts, the slowing down of the northwesterly winds during the morning and night hours, leaves a smaller window during the afternoon for the dispersal of pollutants. Further, the winds are also carrying in smoke from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, where stubble burning is still raging.“On Thursday, the maximum wind speed was 10kmph. However it was not enough to disperse the pollutants given the current weather conditions. The wind speed may slightly increase on Thursday, but will drop again on Friday due to an approaching western disturbance,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet. According to the central pollution control board’s (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI), Noida recorded a reading of 394 as against 387 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 406 as against 388 a day earlier. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad continued to be under the ‘severe’ category with an AQI of 421 as against 424 a day earlier. The quantity of fine particles or pollutants in the air also spiked with PM2.5 levels touching three to five times higher than the safe limit. PM2.5 for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 255.66 micrograms per cubic metres as against 183.99 micrograms per cubic metres a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 269.52 units as against 243.24 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 302.79 units as against 309.17 units a day earlier. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), air quality in the city is likely to fluctuate over the next three days with a slight improvement on Thursday, followed by a slight deterioration two days later. “Air quality is likely to marginally improve with in the ‘very poor’ for tomorrow (Thursday) owing to slightly better ventilation condition. By December 4, ventilation conditions are likely to slow down again and deterioration in AQI is expected. The higher end of the very poor category is forecasted for December 5,” read the SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-s-air-turns-severe-noida-s-worsens/story-kklKSTlr6ryzYuHttaY5DJ.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||Toxic air to persist till Friday||Air quality in the city remained in the ”very poor” category for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, with a reading of 324 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. Wednesday’s reading is a marginal deterioration from the previous day’s AQI reading of 311, also in the “very poor” category. Experts attributed the deterioration in air quality to meteorological conditions unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. An AQI reading between 301 and 400 is categorised “very poor” and can cause breathing discomfort and respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure, as per air quality experts. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 292.88 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³)on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve marginally on Thursday and deteriorate on Friday, but remain in the “very poor” category throughout. As per the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), further deterioration in AQI is expected on Friday on account of poor ventilation conditions. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the head of regional weather forecasting centre, said while stubble burning impact had depleted, the air quality was being affected due to slow wind speed. “The wind speed will further reduce from December 4 or 5 and the direction is likely to change to easterly, from the north-westerly at present. The change in direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants,” said Srivastava. Gurugram’s minimum temperature settled at 8.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Wednesday. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 26.7 degrees Celsius. While the maximum temperature was two degrees below the normal, the minimum temperature was a degree below the normal temperature for this time of the year. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover in a similar range on Thursday. As per the weekly IMD forecast, fog and mist are expected to prevail in the morning hours followed by a clear sky later during the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/toxic-air-to-persist-till-friday/story-m1uXRceOomk1jaH5bEnDiM.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||Grap fines down by 67%, officials cite strategy change||Data obtained from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) shows that the number of fines issued for violations of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) has decreased by around 67% this year.For greater supervision this year, the MCG had introduced several new measures — forming civil defence teams to monitor Grap violations, starting an air lab for analysing data of the city’s 24 air quality monitors to identify and concentrate enforcement measures on areas where Grap violations are suspected to be the highest, and setting deadlines for its officials to address citizen complaints.However, MCG officials attributed the decline in the number of fines to a change in strategy. They said that instead of focusing solely on enforcement, as has been the case in previous years, they have introduced several other new measures that, in the long-term, would prove to be far more beneficial.From October 15 to December 1 this year, the MCG has issued 267 fines for Grap violations. In the same time period last year, the MCG had issued 750 fines.“We realised that enforcement alone cannot curb air pollution. Hence, this year, we have taken a different approach. We have built an air lab, increased mechanised road sweeping activities, as well as sprinkling of water through water tankers at high dust accumulation stretches. Further, through the incorporation of citizen volunteers into civil defence teams for checking Grap violations, we are anticipating that the overall supervision and enforcement measures would be much higher than in the past,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.On October 15, MCG opened an air lab at its Sector 42 office to constantly monitor air quality data from its 24 monitors, which has helped officials check for localised pollution based on hourly readings, said officials.On October 17, MCG had set a four-hour deadline for its officials to address complaints related to garbage burning and a 12-hour deadline for any construction and demolition (C&D) waste-related issues.On October 28, the MCG deployed civil defence teams, comprising around 60 resident volunteers, to travel across the city to identify Grap violations and alert the civic body for action.Of the 267 fines, 27 were for garbage burning, 23 related to C&D waste, 195 pertaining to dust mitigation, 17 for illegal dumping of waste and five for ferrying construction materials in vehicles without proper covering.The MCG has recovered fines worth around Rs 57 lakh so far, whereas it had recovered Rs 2.49 crore from the 750 violations in the same period last year.Abhishek Srivastava, a Gurugram-based environmental engineer, who worked as an air pollution consultant with the MCG, said that due to the coronavirus outbreak, field visits by the civic body officials may have been much lower this year and could be one of the main reasons why the number of violations is much lower than last year.“Enforcement of Grap measures is extremely crucial in generating awareness among residents that certain activities such as waste burning, leaving construction materials uncovered, and C&D dumping are exceedingly harmful to the environment. A large number of citizens, especially those living in rural areas, are completely unaware of this. Further, through the issuance of fines, it will discourage them from repeating the violation again. Unless enforcement is done on a large scale, eliminating factors that lead to pollution at the source can never be achieved,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/grap-fines-down-by-67-officials-cite-strategy-change/story-CbuZ7H74Tvj2HMouYcmXqN.html
02-12-2020||City||Congress tells south Haryana farmers to support protest||The Haryana Congress on Wednesday exhorted farmers from south Haryana to come out and support the protest, after the Congress came out in support of the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agriculture laws. Party leaders said that they would offer both moral and material support. Party leader and former Haryana minister Captain (retd) Ajay Singh Yadav said that the state government violated human rights when it prevented farmers from entering Delhi. “Farmers across the country are participating against the anti-people laws and it is time their counterparts in south Haryana come out in support of their brethren. The party will fully support them morally and give material support in this agitation if that is needed,” said Yadav, t a press conference in the the district party headquarters at Kaman Sarai. Yadav alleged that the three farm laws were backed by corporates and would destroy small farmers and agricultural markets, which were the backbone of the industry. “The mandis were eliminated in Bihar and some other states and the condition of farmers there are bad. The regime of contract farming, which the BJP wants to introduce will allow large private companies and business houses to take over and monopolise agriculture,” he said. Congress also questioned the farm law, whereby the farmers are allowed only to approach the district administration for arbitration of contracts. “Why are the farmers not allowed to approach the courts. Why should they be denied fundamental rights,” asked Yadav, adding that minimum support price (MSP), which many alleged would be nullified with the new laws, was a fundamental right of farmers. BJP, however, said that Congress leadership was misleading the farmers despite the fact that same proposals were introduced by it in parliament in 2012 and included by it in election manifesto of 2019. “The Congress held discussions on the same proposals in parliament when it was in power. We are not dismantling the mandis but providing an alternative to the farmers. The MSP system remains unchanged. Congress is trying to take political mileage,” said BJP spokesperson Raman Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-tells-south-haryana-farmers-to-support-protest/story-qRjrzlGlRT0nqp68s0RUgI.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||Central team inspects sites for Science City||A central government team on Wednesday inspected four sites in Sohna for setting up the country’s fourth Science City.The team consisting of officials from the department of science and technology, the Haryana government, Union ministry of culture, and the Haryana space application centre (Harsac) visited Ghamroj, Rahaka, Nimoth and Patli Hajipura. They were accompanied by Sohna sub-divisional magistrate Chinar Chahal. The project requires at least 25 to 30 acres and will initially require Rs 500 crore investment shared equally between the central and state governments. Gurugram was selected for the proposed project in January this year. The other three cities with a Science City are Kolkata, Jalandhar and Ahmedabad. In a statement released on Wednesday, the district administration said that the Science City will serve as a centre for disseminating practical knowledge of science and mathematics in an engaging manner. “It will have thematic galleries covering physics, chemistry and other branches of science and would benefit children and students from various educational institutions, by providing them with a resource centre to satiate their inquisitiveness,” said Dr Sultan Singh, principal scientist, Harsac.Additionally, a science museum with galleries demonstrating different scientific principles will be set up to help inculcate a scientific temper in people by informing them about science through interesting practical activities. The team coordinator also shared there were plans to develop scientific facilities of Indian space research organisation (Isro) in the city. He said that the state government was keen on developing the Science City in the district so that children from neighbouring cities could also benefit from knowledge sharing. Once the site for the project is identified, its detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/central-team-inspects-sites-for-science-city/story-AWiKsqsCNOrkvfYNu3Ls8O.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||Fake call centre duping US citizens busted; two held||The chief minister’s Flying Squad on Tuesday night busted a fake call centre, which had been operating out of an house in Sector 27 for the past two months. The employees had been allegedly duping US citizens by posing as officials of US law enforcement agencies, threatening to cancel their social security numbers if they failed to pay a fine, said the police. According to the police, the call centre was duping people of hundreds of dollars. The police said that at least 1,000 US citizens are suspected to have been targeted by the call centre. A case was registered on Wednesday at the Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act, after which two of the owners of the fake call centre were arrested from the spot. The suspects were identified as Anurag Tiwari and Kirti Kumar Keshav of Jind. The police said three people were running the call centre.All three had worked in call centres in Gurugram a few years ago. The kingpin, identified as Lokendra of Ahmedabad, fled from the spot and teams are tracking his location for his arrest, said the police. The suspects were paying ₹2.5 lakh monthly rent for the house, the police said, adding that they recovered seven hard disks, the script meant to dupe US citizens, and computers from the spot. The suspects were produced before the district and sessions court on Wednesday. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department, said they received a tip-off on Tuesday that a group in the city was running a fake call centre. It took them a few hours to locate the place. “We had conducted an internal investigation and our teams raided the house on Tuesday night. We will get the recovered hard disks scanned, along with their systems, to get the exact number of people who have been targeted since the call centre began functioning,” he said. The police said the confiscated hardware will be sent to a laboratory in Madhuban, Karnal, for forensic examination. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that there were 22 men and four women working as tele-callers at the call centre. The executives were given US citizens’ data, which the call centre procured from Ahmedabad.The executives used to make random calls to unsuspecting US citizens, informing them that their social security numbers are at the risk of being cancelled as they are “offenders” and they needed to pay a fine to ensure its continuation . “This call centre had a total of 30 workstations. The tele-callers underwent a week’s training to make calls to the US and a script was shared with them. They had also set up a toll-free number, which was shared with the victims,” he said. The police said the payment was generally through virtual payment gateways, credit and debit cards, gift cards, iTunes cards. The police said the exact number of victims and the total amount of money siphoned may be higher than what they anticipate. “We are also getting a forensic audit of the seized property. The same group were running call centres in Sushant Lok-1 and Sector 29; they were earlier arrested the same offence ,” said Budhiraja. The suspects used to provide pick and drop facilities to all the employees and were paying ₹20,000 a month as salary and nearly ₹35,000 as an incentive for duping US citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fake-call-centre-duping-us-citizens-busted-two-held/story-6jSWk2fTI8FQl3z3r4ZuNN.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||Harley rider death: Car owner, juvenile co-passenger held||The police on Tuesday night arrested the owner of a car involved in a collision with a motorcycle that left the rider, a 49-year-old chief financial officer (CFO) of a private company, dead on August 23 in Cyber City. The car was allegedly driven by a minor, who was inebriated at the time of the incident.On Wednesday, the police also apprehended a juvenile who was a co-passenger in the car, under Section 304 (2) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Juvenile Justice Act. The police said he will undergo a test to determine his age and was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board. The car owner, identified as Dheeraj Taneja, has been booked under Section 109 (punishment for the offence for which there is no express provision made and the act is in consequence of the abetment by conspiracy) of the IPC and Section 77 (giving intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug or psychotropic substance to a child) of Juvenile Justice Act and was sent to judicial custody. On August 23, the victim, Alok Gupta, was on his way to Noida on his Harley Davidson motorcycle around 6am, when a Ford Figo, in which the two juveniles were allegedly travelling, rammed into the divider and hit his motorcycle across the carriageway. Gupta had succumbed to his injuries and the police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, a friend of the driver’s father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of the IPC. According to the police, the juveniles had attended a party at Taneja’s house and had allegedly consumed alcohol, after which they went out for a drive. The juvenile driving the car was apprehended earlier. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said Taneja was arrested under non-bailable sections and the juvenile was sent to an observation home in Faridabad. “As per the earlier sections, the suspects were released on bail but after the investigation was reopened, the sections were added and they were arrested. We have taken legal opinion and all relevant sections have been added and all arrests have been made,” he said. Mihika Wahi Gupta, the victim’s wife, said she wants justice and also to spread awareness, to curb underage driving. “This accident is an eye-opener and the police should start booking parents and juvenile for underage driving. I am fighting for justice and will make sure the persons responsible for my husband’s death are behind bars,” she said. Earlier, the victim’s family had approached the police commissioner over alleged negligence in the investigation and sought more stringent sections of the IPC. Gupta’s family wanted the teenager who was at the wheel booked under Section 304(II) (rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) of the IPC instead of Section 304(a) which is ‘negligence causing death’. Also, they wanted the owner of the car to be booked, following which sections 309 and 304(II) of the IPC and sections of JJ Act were added. On November 9, Rao suspended two policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of DLF Phase 2 police station.The accident and the subsequent handling of the case by the police evoked widespread protests by the family and friends of the victim. On September 26, at least 400 people, including family members, friends and cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot, near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against those responsible. Similar protests were also held in Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/harley-rider-death-car-owner-juvenile-co-passenger-held/story-yTOHowzE3oZSgIBNaWpxJJ.html
02-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to takeover maintenance of Aravalli Biodiversity Park||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will take over maintenance of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park from a city-based non-governmental organisation, IAmGurgaon, on December 15. Officials confirmed that the park will continue to be maintained as a green space under the care of a new concessionaire, who is yet to be selected.The non-governmental organisation (NGO), IAmGurgaon, which has helmed the park’s restoration from an abandoned mining site to an urban forest since 2012, is currently in talks with the MCG’s horticulture department to ensure a smooth handover. IAmGurgaon’s memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the MCG, first signed in 2012 to facilitate the park’s restoration, was extended for a period of eight years in 2014. “Our agreement with the NGO lapsed in March this year. However, due to constraints imposed by the coronavirus lockdown, we requested IAmGurgaon to continue maintaining the park in the interim. Going forward, we have decided to appoint a new concessionaire to maintain the site using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. We are still finalising this,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.In a letter to IAmGurgaon on November 19 (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times), Singh wrote, “It is a matter of great pride for Municipal Corporation, Gurugram, that it has been able to restore an ecologically degraded land into a beautiful city forest in collaboration with IAmGurgaon. We truly appreciate the efforts and hard work put in by your organisation.”The letter also informs IAmGurgaon to continue maintaining the park until December 15, after which the MCG would take over as the primary custodian.Singh’s communique comes on the heels of prolonged discussions between IAmGurgaon and the MCG about the park’s upkeep. “We are not entirely certain why the MCG is choosing to discontinue our agreement. In our discussions with them, it had been proposed that another corporate sponsor come on board as the primary caretaker and that we would continue to work with them as a secondary caretaker. However, we felt this was not in the best interest of the park and our vision for it,” said Swanzal Kak Kapoor, co-founder, IAmGurgaon.When asked about the MCG’s reasons for discontinuing its agreement with IAmGurgaon, Singh said, “The park is now a mature forest and plantation work has been completed. We would like to leverage the NGO’s experience toward other projects, such as restoration of bundhs and water bodies in the city.”In September this year, IAmGurgaon released a report — Making of a City Forest — chronicling the 10-year journey of the ecological restoration of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park — highlighting the scientific importance of the park, which experts regard as a valuable repository of native Aravalli flora and fauna. The report also seeks that the park be declared as a biodiversity heritage site (BHS) under the ownership of the MCG.Inaugurated by the then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in June 2010, the park has since revived over 380 acres of Aravalli vegetation near Nathupur village, which had been denuded after around four decades of mining that left the land barren and infested with invasive species. Since then, the park has come to foster multiple ecosystems, including dense woodlands, grasslands, rocky outcrops and water bodies.However, with no formal legal protection for the site, IAmGurgaon’s report expresses concern over the park’s future. “The park still does not have legal sanctity. In our opinion, it has to be declared as a biodiversity heritage site under the Biological Diversity Act. By declaring the park a heritage site, we shall be able to add value to Gurugram’s heritage,” IAmGurgaon’s report states in its concluding chapter.Singh did not comment on whether such a move is under consideration.An MCG official privy to the matter, seeking anonymity, said, “The park will first be maintained by our horticulture division until a new concessionaire is appointed. There is no proposal to convert in into a biodiversity heritage site yet.”While IAmGurgaon will cease to be the primary custodian of the park from December 15, representatives said they remain committed to protecting the space. “We will continue to facilitate education and research endeavours, and will keep monitoring the growth of the forest, which has been a labour of love for us,” said Kapoor.In 2019, a proposal to create twin roads through the park — from Ambience Mall to Aya Nagar on Gurgaon-Mehrauli Road (NH 236) and another from Vasant Kunj to Aya Nagar on Gurgaon-Mehrauli road — had met with widespread disapproval from citizens and subsequently, shelved by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).However, this proposal has since been retained in a draft of the city’s upcoming comprehensive mobility plan.Speaking about the future of the project in December 2019, the then CEO of the GMDA, V Umashankar, had said, “Sooner or later, the demand for an alternative link between Gurugram and south Delhi will arise, as that is the only way to decongest traffic at Sirhaul. There is no other viable route.” GMDA officials did not respond to queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-takeover-maintenance-of-aravalli-biodiversity-park/story-wiut94Gm052IAVFtgTAi9J.html

Many people ventured out on Tuesday during the night curfew from 10 pm to 5 am and police toiled to keep them indoors.Looking at the rising Covid-19 cases, the Punjab government had imposed a night curfew in the state from December 1. Apart from the night curfew, the state government had also doubled the fine from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 for not wearing masks.Police have also issued challans to violators for not wearing masks on Tuesday night.Many residents were found roaming around the city and gave a common excuse that they were not aware that a night curfew has been imposed again. While some said that they were going to buy medicines.As it was Day 1 of the night curfew, police let the violators go with a warning.Through patrolling, police made shopkeepers close down the shops, restaurants and liquor vends at around 9.30 pm. Some shopkeepers were found operating beyond permissible hours near Division Number 3 chowk, Shingar Cinema road, Chaura Bazaar, Ghumar Mandi and Model Town areas. Police made them close down shutters and issued a warning for lodging FIRs in case of violation.Special checkpoints were installed at each major point and crossroads of the city.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that people with medical emergencies, delivery vehicles were allowed to move. The reason behind the curfew is to discourage social gatherings at night, amid the second wave of the virus.Those violating the curfew will invite FIRs.An eatery owner at Kalgidhar road was made to close down as he was operating beyond permissible hours. Another shopkeeper near Division Number 3 chowk accused police of harassing him when he was asked to shut the shop at 9.30 pm.However, police allowed people to go to railway stations and bus stands to pick/drop their relatives. Three-wheelers ferrying passengers to their destinations were also allowed to move.People negotiate with police over finePeople who were issued challans for not wearing masks were seen negotiating with the police to charge Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,000. Even as the government had increased the fine to Rs 1,000 from Rs 500 for not wearing masks, people were not ready to shell out money from their pockets.Sensing the resentment, the police officials collected Rs 500 from violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-day-1-of-night-curfew-in-ludhiana-police-have-hard-time-keeping-residents-indoors/story-U6OT0ld8S7rvWOWvQcMurK.html
02-12-2020||Chandigarh||HC quashes defamation complaint against former Kurukshetra MP Saini||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed a defamation complaint against former Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini. The complaint was filed by one Sant Kanwar of Rohtak in April 2018. Acting on the same, a Rohtak court had summoned Saini to face the trial in June 2018. Subsquently, Saini had moved the high court in July 2019. Kanwar, a follower of late Chaudhary Matu Ram Hooda, an Arya Samajist, had alleged that in April 2018 Saini made several defamatory statements against Hooda. Saini in high court had claimed that Kanwar had no “locus standi” as he was not an “aggrieved person” as per law. Kanwar, despite notices, failed to appear before high court. The court observed that a ‘person aggrieved’ must have an element of personal interest, being either the person defamed himself or in the case of a deceased person, his family member or other near relative. However, in this case, Kanwar does not claim to be a member of the family or his near relative. The court said Kanwar, who is not a ‘family member’ or ‘near relative’ of late Hooda, cannot unilaterally assume unto himself the status of an ‘aggrieved person’ under Section 199 CrPC, whereby he can assert that his feelings were hurt and maintain the subject complaint against Saini. Kanwar’s claim seems to have been based more on ideological considerations rather than any actual ‘relationship’. There was no averment in the complaint itself indicative of any familial relationship, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-quashes-defamation-complaint-against-former-kurukshetra-mp-saini/story-ujJ2nowNRjOus9GRKUQR3H.html
02-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC stops tree felling at Chandigarh school||Taking note of a resident’s petition, the Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained the Chandigarh administration from cutting anymore trees at Government Model High School, Sector 36. The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli acted on the plea of Sudeep Mahajan, a lawyer and resident of the sector. The administration had admitted before the court that 10 to 15 trees have already been axed at the school. Mahajan had told the court that in the seventies, a large number of eucalyptus trees were planted on the school premises to provide green, cool, shady and healthy environment for the students and residents living in the schools’ vicinity. However, authorities suddenly started axing the trees for no compelling reason. He claimed that when enquiries about the exercise were made, it came to light that the trees were being felled under pressure from some influential residents, who feared the trees may fall on their houses or cars. The petitioner argued that the tall, elegant, green, healthy, salubrious and environment-protecting trees cannot be allowed to be axed on the vague, hypothetical, unsubstantiated and idle fears of some residents, and thereby allow degradation of the environment for the rest of the residents of the city. Hence, he sought that the authorities be directed to immediately stop indiscriminate felling and plant thrice the number of trees already felled. The administration has been told to respond by the next date of hearing on March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-stops-tree-felling-at-chandigarh-school/story-AkrpZvh48DHfim7IOzlH6H.html

Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs, said, “The AAP demands that the BJP-ruled MCDs release the salaries of the last four months to their employees immediately. The AAP demands that the BJP stop playing dirty politics and pay the pending salaries without further delay. Due to the continuous protest by the AAP and the MCD employees, the BJP was forced to release the salary for two months and but now the remaining amount should be released as well.” The Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The AAP should stop misleading people on the MCD staff salary issue. The municipal employees know very well that it is the non-release of statutory municipal grants by the Delhi government which is responsible for the economic crisis in civic bodies. Three quarters of current financial year have gone by and the Delhi government is yet to release even 25% of this year’s allocated funds to the MCDs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-asks-bjp-to-pay-municipal-employees-their-pending-salaries-immediately/story-LarvHuH4GVJErga64oTxAJ.html

Many volunteers of nearby gurudwaras and madarsas were seen distributing food, water, tea, snacks, and fruits to the farmers throughout the day.Nitin Atri, who runs a milk products shop in Sahibabad in Ghaziabad, said, “I may not be a farmer but my forefathers were and that is the reason I can connect with the cause of farmers who have gathered here to protest against the farm laws. I won’t sleep in peace if farmers sleep hungry near my house.”Atri and his relatives and friends distributed food and bottled water during the lunch hour. Atri and his friends said they pooled in money and will continue their service till the protest continues.Among the volunteers were five children aged between 3 and 16 years from a family living in Vasundhara in Ghaziabad. They had come with their grandmother and other family members to distribute food and water. While the elder ones took charge of food distribution, the children were enthusiastically offering water bottles not only to the farmers but also to the police personnel deployed there.The children said their grandfather Surender Singh joined the farmers ever since the agitation began. “I came to the protest venue on Monday to meet my grandfather and felt bad when I saw the farmers were arranging meals for themselves. I asked my family if we can contribute. They agreed and arranged ration and packed water,” said 16-year-old Kajal, a Class 12 student.After the lunch, around 4 pm, a five-member volunteer group from a madarasa in Mayur Vihar arrived in a tempo with apples and oranges.Some Congress workers were seen offering tea and snacks to the farmers. As all of them were wearing scarves with the logo and symbol of the party, many farmers asked them either to remove their scarves or leave the venue. After a brief discussion, the party workers removed the scarves and continued the distribution of tea and snacks.Overall, the situation at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border remained peaceful on Wednesday. The farmers were seen resting in makeshift tents made on their tractors and on the road as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-ghaziabad-border-locals-help-protesting-farmers-with-food-and-water/story-DGfXGRyyb4y9cpAXFWf9kO.html

He made the confession just two days ago. Instead of hiding his son’s crime, the father informed the police about his crime. We apprehended the teenager in the case,” said DCP Thakur.According to the DCP, the apprehended teenager told the police that he had given R2,500 to his friend a few months ago. He had been demanding the money back but the friend was not returning it.On November 7 night, the two boys met in the forested area where two more boys were present. They all partied there till late night. After the two boys left, the two friends entered into an argument over the money. Their altercation turned violent and the 17-year-old boy who was demanding the money back hit his friend’s head with a stone multiple times, a police officer associated with the case said.“After killing his friend, the teenager returned home and did not tell anyone about it. A couple of days after, he went to his native village in Uttar Pradesh with his family members. They returned to Delhi on Monday and learnt about the murder of their son’s friend. The teenager panicked and told his father that he had killed his friend. The father informed the police and the boy was apprehended,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-year-old-boy-kills-friend-for-not-returning-money-in-delhi-s-maidangarhi/story-9ZynaI8zZoWpQuq5xjgd3H.html

02-12-2020||Delhi||DU students new to OBE look to recent graduates for assistance||Following concerns and queries over the online open-book examination (OBE) beginning next week at Delhi University, students appearing for the exams are looking to their recently graduated alumni for assistance.Last week, Delhi University had issued guidelines for the online open-book semester examination, for second and third-year undergraduate students, slated to begin from December 12.Several colleges are planning to organise online sessions with recent graduates who appeared for the first-ever OBEs at the university in August. The varsity decision to conduct OBE as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic had been met with staunch opposition from several students and faculty members, but it went ahead with the process nevertheless. Several glitches were reported during the exams, including students receiving the wrong question paper or being unable to submit their answer scripts on time.Divyanshika Pandey, a final-year student of economics at Miranda House, said, “We have asked students to send their queries as a Google form and those will be sent to our graduates. The graduates will circulate it among their groups so that anyone can respond. A virtual session is also likely to be held towards the weekend.”The queries posed by students include doubts about the paper pattern, time management, how to upload answer scripts on the portal and possible glitches that may arise.“Our teachers have also been helping us but it is always better to hear from former students on how to structure answers and understand how these answers are then graded. The logistical queries are also there -- like how to upload scripts and what to do in case of an error. We have been interacting with some graduates over the semester but a last-minute session would help,” she said.Similar attempts are made at Hindu College and Lady Shri Ram College as well. Hindu principal Anju Shrivastava said graduates proposed the idea to the college to help out their departments and encourage those appearing for their papers. She said that these interactions are organised by department societies in the college.Anupam Varshney Sharma, who teaches zoology at the college, said, “We had a meeting with teachers in charge of other departments and the principal as students were facing problems. We thought it would be better if students could connect with recent graduates as the latter would be able to give valuable inputs.”Unlike August, when students were allowed to email answer scripts, the university has issued strict guidelines this time -- undergraduate students will only be allowed to submit answer scripts through the examination portal. Dean (examinations) DS Rawat said the glitches that came up during the last OBE were addressed by the varsity’s computer centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-students-new-to-obe-look-to-recent-graduates-for-assistance/story-hjU26XSRSePpPbJy92b9aP.html

The decision of the high court was based on the recommendation of the high-powered committee (HPC) constituted on the direction of the Supreme Court to decongest jails to contain the pandemic.A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh passed the order in view of the HPC’s recommendation and extended by 45 days the interim bail granted to 3,499 under-trial prisoners so that their surrender does not overwhelm prisons in the national capital, which are already filled beyond capacity.The committee in its meeting of November 28 had said the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Delhi shows that there is no clear timeline as to when the pandemic will abate and if the interim bails of these prisoners are not extended, they may end up bringing the infection to the jails. Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, appearing for the prison authorities, confirmed that the interim bails have been extended by 45 days by the bench headed by justice Mridul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/interim-bails-of-3-499-prisoners-extended-in-view-of-covid-19-spike-in-capital/story-LkigbKLBpNswmjIidW4kcJ.html

The protesting traders said that in the last week of October, the state government had announced that the policy will be notified in a week. But, it has still not been done. State general secretary of the beopar mandal, Sunil Mehra, and district president, Arvinder Singh Makkar, said traders are already reeling under losses and the government and sales tax department are further harassing them during this time of crisis.Mehra said around 70,000 notices have been served to VAT assesses in Punjab, of which 23,000 are in Ludhiana. “A state-level meeting of the beopar mandal will be held in Amritsar on December 13. If the government fails to notify the policy by then, state-level protests will be held.

02-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers camped at Chilla border suffer for want of water, toilets||Lack of basic amenities such as water and access to toilets is causing problems for protesting farmers as they remained positioned at Chilla border (Delhi-Noida Link Road) on Wednesday and continued their agitation against the three new farm laws passed by parliament. The Chilla border was closed on Tuesday evening by the police after more than 300 farmers from Uttar Pradesh and belonging to Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) group blocked both the carriageways of the arterial road connecting Delhi and Noida using their tractors. This had prompted the police to place barricades to stop the farmers from entering Delhi Although the agitating farmers said they have brought along rations that will allow them to continue their protest for weeks, no arrangement for water or toilets had been made either by the Noida administration or Delhi administration. Apart from buying water cans, the farmers said they brought water from nearby houses of people known to them.“Many of our acquaintances live in Noida and east Delhi. They supplied water in cans from their houses. Some unknown individuals also contributed packed water glasses and bottles. We requested the officials of the Noida administration for water tankers and portable toilets but nothing has been done so far. We are using the nearby forested areas for relieving ourselves. Things are being managed somehow,” said Master Manoj, national general secretary of Bhanu said.When officials in Noida and Delhi Police were asked about this, they said their negotiations with the farmers were on to convince them to shift their protest either to the Burari ground in Delhi or near the zero point at Pari Chowk in Greater Noida.“We even offered to provide them with portable washrooms and drinking water facilities if they move to a designated area near zero point, Pari Chowk but they refused,” said a senior Noida police officer, not wishing to be named. As far as the arrangements for food are concerned, farmers have hired a six-member team of confectioners from Delhi’s Karol Bagh to cook meals. Though the confectioners were being paid for their services, lack of water and other food items such as salt and spices made their work difficult.The confectioners and fed nearly 700 people on Wednesday. Head confectioner Vikram Kumar said he got a call around 8am on Wednesday and the caller sought to know if he and his team could cook food for 700-800 protesting farmers at Chilla border.“I agreed but when we came here, there were no arrangements -- no gas stoves or utensils. We have used concrete tiles and bricks to make a stove. Some utensils were arranged by us. But that’s not enough to feed such a large number of people. The main problem is water. The farmers are using empty cooking oil jars to bring water for cooking and drinking,” said Kumar. On Wednesday, around 2pm, one of the carriageways -- from Delhi to Noida -- was opened to traffic after senior police officers convinced protesting farmers to shift their agitation to the Noida to Delhi side of the road.The police officers told us that ambulances as well as private vehicles carrying patients were stuck in jams. Although it was the police who had blocked it, and not us, we shifted ourselves to the carriageway from Noida to Delhi on the instructions of the police. We are here for a peaceful protest and not to cause problems to the public,” said Bhanu Pratap Singh, national president, Bhanu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-camped-at-chilla-border-suffer-for-want-of-water-toilets/story-RHYlAoUCXXM3Sm4eEFGo3L.html

02-12-2020||Chandigarh||‘Sneaky little fellow’: Amarinder Singh lashes out at Delhi CM over notifying farm bill||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh called his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal “this sneaky little fellow” as the two traded charges over the notification of one of the three new central farm laws in the national capital. A day earlier the Punjab chief minister had slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader over the November 23 notification in Delhi, accusing the party of just “pretending” to support the farmers’ cause. At a press briefing in Delhi Wednesday Kejriwal hit back, but that triggered the release of another press statement by the Congress veteran in Chandigarh. Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition in Congress-run Punjab, farmers from where are now camped outside Delhi in a huge protest against the Centre’s agri-marketing laws. Amarinder Singh trashed Kejriwal’s assertion that states are “helpless” against central legislation, and said it was clear that the AAP leader did not even want to try to fight the “draconian” laws. He accused Kejriwal of “undermining” the farmers’ fight by notifying one of the laws and reminded that the Punjab Assembly had passed its own Bills in an attempt to “negate” them. “Instead of meekly just notifying the central laws, Kejriwal could have tried to make some effort to counter them and protect the rights of the farmers,” the Punjab chief minister said. He alleged it is evident that “this sneaky little fellow, whose double standards have been exposed time and again, is now completely cornered on the issue.” In his briefing earlier, Kejriwal had accused the Punjab CM of playing “dirty politics”, and suggested that he was under pressure from Central agencies. “I want to ask Captain saheb, are you under the pressure of these very same people because of which you are making these false allegations against me, abusing me. I know that the reason may be that your family is charged with cases and receiving notices from the ED,” he said. The three farm laws were implemented across the country with the signature of the president and no state can stop them, he said. “If the implementation of the laws depended on the states, why would farmers from across the nation reach Delhi to talk to the Centre and put their demands forward? They would have put their demands in front of their chief ministers,” he said. He accused the Punjab CM of not trying to stop the farm bills when he had the chance. “Captain saheb had many chances to stop the farm bills. Why did he not act against these bills being a member of the central government’s committee formulating and deliberating on these bills?” Kejriwal asked. “Is this Captain saheb’s friendship with the BJP or is he under pressure, because of which he is making false allegations against me?” he asked. Kejriwal also said his AAP government had angered the BJP government at the Centre by refusing to give permission for turning city stadiums into temporary jails for protesting farmers. Singh hit back, saying it was apparent that Kejriwal, whose survival depended on the central government, was more worried about angering it than about the farmers’ plight. He dubbed Kejriwal’s latest comments – including an appeal to the Centre to address the farmers’ concerns -- as “mere hogwash” and said the AAP leader’s actions had “exposed the hollowness” of his remarks. It is evident that Kejriwal is only playing to the sentiments of the farmers now because his party has completely lost the political narrative in Punjab, he charged. The Delhi government notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 on November 23. Thousands of farmers, most of them from Punjab, are camping at Delhi’s border demanding a repeal of the central laws. Farmer union’s claim that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which the Centre denies. The Narendra Modi government says the laws give more options to farmers to sell their crops, fetching better prices for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sneaky-little-fellow-amarinder-singh-lashes-out-at-delhi-cm-over-notifying-farm-bill/story-cIQCjphRpKiCIzfJ7OJHFO.html

As per the orders issued under the Air (Prevention and control of pollution) Act 1981, the CPCB has directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to allow only those new industrial units in the NCR districts of the state which are using cleaner fuels including natural gas (PNG and CNG, liquefied petroleum gas, biogass, propane and butane. The HSPCB has been told to submit an action taken report in this regard to the CPCB within 30 days.The CPCB has expressed concerns over industries located in 24 districts of NCR from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, which are discharging environmental pollutants directly or indirectly into the air and pose constant threat to the air quality. “This is the quality of air that we are providing to the people living in NCR-Delhi. It is clear violation of their fundamental rights,” the order reads.The CPCB order mentioned that in spite of availability of PNG in the region, a large number of industries did not switch their operations to PNG. However, officials of these industries had given their representations which are under examination and at this stage coercive action may not be initiated against the industrial units in NCR. However, the order made it clear that following the deteriorating air quality in NCR-Delhi and considering that directions have been issued to all the existing industries in the region to switch over to cleaner fuels, it is decided that only those new industrial units will be allowed to be set up in NCR-Delhi which use cleaner fuels. S Naryanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board said, “We have received the orders and it is being implemented with proper monitoring. Around 30% of the existing industries in NCR region of the state have been shifted to cleaner fuels and the HSPCB is working to achieve 100% target as per the orders of CPCB.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/use-of-cleaner-fuels-mandatory-for-new-industrial-units-in-haryana-s-ncr-districts/story-mbbgV9tqjUZ7gAILayr6pJ.html

Modi filed his nomination papers at the office of divisional commissioner in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, the two deputy CMs and leaders of NDA allies. After filing the nomination, Modi thanked BJP’s central leadership and also NDA allies for their support. Nitish Kumar said that he had come to congratulate Modi. “He is my former colleague. He had been a member of Lok Sabha, Bihar Assembly and legislative council. Now, he will be going to Rajya Sabha and it is a rare distinction to represent both houses of Parliament and the state legislature,” Kumar said. Kumar did not hide his liking for Modi as his deputy and said, “Now that they want to take him to the Centre, we are hopeful that in his new capacity he will continue to serve the State.” Modi has been one of the key architects of the NDA government in Bihar. The opposition Grand Alliance was yet to declare the name of its RS candidate after LJP rejected its offer of support to late Paswan’s wife Reena Paswan, if she contested the polls.

02-12-2020||City||Tyre blowouts have led to many fatal accidents in UP||LUCKNOW Worn out tyres, over-speeding, improper air pressure, high temperatures and rampant overloading are believed to be causing an increased number of tyre blowout incidents resulting in fatal accidents in Uttar Pradesh —the state that tops the chart in the number of deaths due to traffic crashes in the country every year.Sample these:*Seven people were charred to death when a truck and a van collided near a toll plaza along the Lucknow-Agra Expressway on February 15, 2020. The van’s tyre burst and its impact pushed it to the wrong side of the road, causing the mishap.*Three migrant labourers were killed and more than 12 injured after a vehicle carrying them overturned on a highway late on May 18, 2020. The vehicle, which was ferrying the people from Delhi, overturned after a tyre burst.*A bus with 64 migrants on board overturned after a tyre burst on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway resulting in injuries to 18 people on June 14, 2020.These are just a few examples of reported major road accidents due to tyre blowouts during the last six months in UP. Eight people were killed when a sand-laden truck overturned and fell over a parked SUV in Kaushambi after one of its tyres burst. The incident is a chilling reminder of the same problem that is often best ignored by authorities.“The tragic crash in Kaushambi sheds light on how overloaded trucks are a hazard to all other vehicles on the road. Fatal mishaps can occur due to tyre bursts from excessive weight or worn out brakes due to friction,” SaveLife Foundation head, Piyush Tewari, said commenting on the hazard.According to him, though there were many other reasons for tyre blowouts, the main among them was overloading of passenger and goods vehicles.“In 2019, overloaded vehicles with improperly secured loads, accounted for about 10% of the total deaths and 8% of total crashes in the country killing 14,320 people,” said Tewari.UP ranks first, both in terms of overloading related crashes and overloading related deaths in the country, he added.A transport department official said apart from people’s ignorance with regard to air pressure etc, enforcement agencies, including police and transport department, were also responsible as they often turned a blind eye to the plying of overloaded vehicles.A large number of accidents on the Yamuna Expressway are attributed to tyre blowouts because of excessive friction on the road that allegedly has design faults.Some five years ago, the union ministry of road transport and highways also raised a question mark over the quality of tyres produced in India after frequent accidents were attributed to tyre burst. “The ministry then wrote a letter to the Bureau of Indian Standards to modify rules for the production of tyres as per global standards. But nothing much has changed since,” the transport official said.“All this makes it important to stringently enforce Section 194A of the amended MV Act, which prohibits the use of overloaded vehicles and rationalises fines to Rs 20,000, apart from manufacturing high-quality tyres and making people aware of precautions like checking the air pressure in tyres before movement,” suggested Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tyre-blowouts-have-led-to-many-fatal-accidents-in-up/story-r8ucFbQjOPW112u2Q802ZN.html

There were about 30 passengers in the bus. Lal lost control of the vehicle as he reached near Cheli Khuther village and it fell into a 250-metre-deep gorge,” the parents contended.Their son died in the accident that also claimed the life of the driver.Following the accident, a case under Sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Nurpur police station in Kangra district.The school authorities responded that no such accident took place as alleged, so the claim petition was not maintainable and the amount claimed (Rs 75 lakh) was highly exaggerated.The insurer stated that neither this court had the jurisdiction to try the petition nor had the cause of action accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. Also, the driver didn’t have a valid licence.After hearing the arguments, the tribunal, on Wednesday, directed both respondents to pay a compensation of Rs 5.05 lakh, along with 7.5% interest per annum from the date of filing of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/5-lakh-relief-for-parents-of-boy-killed-in-kangra-school-bus-accident/story-kWPDL8ZcTdXWFQbTTkAU2M.html

He has been shifted to the directorate of social welfare department in Haldwani. The transfer order by director, social welfare department, came nine days after the controversy erupted, leading to chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat ordering an enquiry headed by state chief secretary to find out the ‘circumstances’ necessitating the press release. The transfer order was issued Tuesday late evening. HT has seen a copy of the same. “District social welfare officer of Tehri Garhwal, Dipankar Ghildiyal has been transferred to directorate, social welfare department in Haldwani with immediate effect,” states the transfer order, issued by director social welfare Vinod Goswami. The order instructs Ghildiyal to take up his new charge ‘immediately’.Ghildiyal had issued the press release on November 19, mentioning an existing government scheme promising Rs 50,000 incentive for interfaith and inter caste unions ‘to promote social unity and harmony’. However, on November 21, the press release started making rounds on social media with many accusing BJP-led Uttarakhand government of promoting love-jihad by offering money to interfaith couples.

The incident has once again put a spotlight on the vulnerability of senior citizens on roads. The victim Shalini Sharad Tisgaonkar, (71), a resident of Lokesh Society in Bibvewadi has lodged a complaint against an unidentified chain snatcher in this regard. According to the complaint, the incident took place around 8pm on Sunday when Tisgaonkar was taking an evening stroll in the area. A motorcyclist with his face covered came from behind and asked for an address. While answering his question, the accused tried to snatch her gold chain. Being alert, the victim pushed the thief aside and offered stiff resistance. She also held the gold chain tightly making it difficult for the thief to snatch and escape. Tisgaonkar also raised an alarm after which a young boy came to her rescue and tried to catch the chain snatcher. The thief fell down from his bike and fled the spot. He was joined by three others who gave the accused a hot chase. However, the thief escaped under the cover of darkness but before that, he had thrown his helmet in their direction. PSI Kiran Deshmukh said “A case under relevant sections of the IPC has been filed and the motorcycle has been seized. We will check the CCTV footage and investigation is on. The accused will be arrested soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/71-year-old-fights-off-chain-snatcher-in-bibvewadi/story-lXV4rqLvu9NG0eEljL9L0H.html
02-12-2020||Pune||Weakness, breathlessness most common symptoms among Covid patients in Pune||Pune: A study on the data of 6,631 critical patients uploaded to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) app found weakness and breathlessness to be the most common symptom present in 3,657 Covid-19 patients. A loss of smell and taste was reported in 10% of the patients. The study also showed that of all the admitted patients who turned critical, 69% did not have any comorbidity. The study is based on data uploaded to the PMC’s iHealWell app for critical patients from 70 hospitals across the city. The patients were admitted between July 25 and October 28. Data of 6,631 patients admitted to hospitals was entered into the database, of which 4,535 (68.5%) were male and 2,096 (31.5%) were female. The average age of patients was 53.73 years. The study also revealed that of these critical patients, 37.5% were admitted to oxygen beds, while 15.9% required a ventilator in ICU. Diabetes (20%) and hypertension (20.8%) were the most common comorbidities among these critical patients. The most common symptoms were weakness and breathlessness with close to 63% and 60% patients reporting these symptoms, while only 24% reported fever and 10% reported loss of smell or taste. Some of the other symptoms reported were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and body ache. This data was analysed with an intent to reduce the case fatality ratio (CFR).Dr Sanjay Pathare, medical director, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We report symptoms, including breathlessness and weakness which were most common. However, fever was the third most common symptom in critical Covid patient. The data from the app cannot be considered as factual as most private hospitals, including ours, were reluctant to update data on it since it was time consuming and tiring at the time when we were witnessing the peak in cases.”Additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “The data helps us understand that patient management system of critical patients in the city hospitals. However, it is also true that most hospitals refused to update information on the portal. The quantity may be low, but the conclusion is right based on the data uploaded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/weakness-breathlessness-most-common-symptoms-among-covid-patients-in-pune/story-U81SsE2mupFFtAtSst0vuN.html

Stating that the statement of the Janayak Janata Party (JJP) regarding the agriculture laws was just a show-off, Selja said the JJP, which had won 10 seats by seeking votes against the BJP before the election, had betrayed the people of the state by extending support to the saffron party. “Now, the JJP has an opportunity to withdraw its support to the Haryana government and stand in favour of the people of Haryana,” Selja said in a statement, appealing the Independent MLAs and BJP MLAs to leave the state government and join the farmers.She said the BJP government at the Centre and the state is immersed in arrogance and that it only thinks about benefiting capitalist friends. “Today, entire Haryana stands with the farmers and against the BJP government,” she added. Selja said the “annadata” is agitating on the open roads in this fierce cold, enduring all the atrocities of the BJP government. She added that the Congress has stood firmly with the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/withdraw-support-to-haryana-govt-state-congress-chief-selja-to-jjp-independents/story-GZQF4fRcD4X73Xyf1C2sHK.html
02-12-2020||Pune||Vaccine candidate safe and immunogenic: SII||Pune: Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) said on Tuesday that its vaccine candidate for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is “safe and immunogenic”.SII has said the principal investigator, data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) and the ethics committee, an internal mechanism, have independently reckoned that the issue raised by the Chennai volunteer, who alleged neurological breakdown after participating in Covishield trial, was not related to the vaccine trial. DSMC is a monitoring body comprising independent experts, with task to evaluate study data of participants during trial. The statement issued by SII on Tuesday states that the vaccine would not be released for mass use unless it is proven “immunogenic and safe”. The statement comes after a volunteer from Chennai alleged that he faced a virtual neurological breakdown and impairment of cognitive functions after he took part in the “Covishield” vaccine trial. The volunteer sent a legal notice to multiple parties, including SII, which is currently mass producing Oxford University’s “Covishield” vaccine. The 40-year-old volunteer had sought to cancel approval for its testing and also sought a Rs five crore compensation. In response, the institute defended its vaccine and stated to seek damages in excess of Rs 100 crore for the same and will defend such malicious claims. The man had alleged that he suffered from acute encephalopathy, damage or disease that affected the brain after he was administered the vaccine and that all the tests he underwent confirmed that the setback in his health was due to the test vaccine. Defending its product, SII said that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic. “The incident with the Chennai volunteer, though highly unfortunate, was in no way induced by the vaccine and the institute is sympathetic with the volunteer’s medical condition. However, we would like to clarify that all the requisite regulatory and ethical processes and guidelines were followed diligently and strictly. The authorities concerned were informed and the principal investigator, DSMB and the ethics committee independently cleared and reckoned it as a non-related issue to the vaccine trial,” the SII statement read. The institute has submitted all the reports and data related to the incident to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). The institute said that the vaccine would not be released for mass use unless it is proven immunogenic and safe. Taking into consideration the complexities and existing misnomers about vaccination and immunisation, the legal notice, seeking defamation amounting to Rs 100 crore, was sent therefore to safeguard the reputation of the company which is being unfairly maligned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sii-says-its-vaccine-candidate-covishield-safe-and-immunogenic-incident-with-volunteer-no-way-induced-by-it/story-ybX5Ro5cJDVEGUiZH5jP9H.html

The trust, however, did not describe any clothes that it’d like the devotees to wear. While the decision was welcomed by many in the local town, there were reactions questioning the move. Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust’s chief executive officer Kanhuraj Bagate while clarifying the trust’s stand on Tuesday said that it is just an appeal, and the trust has not imposed any dress code on devotees. According to Bagate, the appeal was made after devotees complained that some people come to the shrine, located at Shirdi in Ahmednagar district, in “objectionable” attire. “We have only made an appeal after we received complaints from many devotees and local residents. There is no intention to make it as a diktat,” said Bagate. Akash Satave, a local resident, said, “Many come here with costumes which are not “very decent” while forgetting that they have come to the temple. We welcome the step taken by trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/saibaba-temple-appeals-devotees-to-wear-civilised-attire/story-NvLciBh6lRqvy8gsXSl4cM.html

Mulik said, “During BJP’s tenure, the party had approved funds from the standing committee for this project. The party even conducted various meetings to ensure that the project work is completed.”Immediately after Mulik’s statement, Tingre released a press statement. Tingre said, “The project was approved by the Congress and NCP. The central government approved funds for the project under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal mission in 2014. It was decided at that time that the local self government would incur some cost for the project. The BJP is unnecessarily trying to take credit for the project.”Tingre alleged that the BJP was ruling at the Pune corporation level, state government level and at the Centre, yet the project was stuck in limbo for almost two to three years. “Despite conducting a meeting by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and guardian minister Girish Bapat, the project work had not been started,” he added.Areas which would benefit due to the completion of the project include, Wadgaon Sheri, Kharadi, Kalyaninagar and Ahmednagar road, hence, both the BJP and NCP leaders from this constituency are trying to seek credit for the project as it would end the water crisis in these areas.PMC is currently drawing water from 50km away from the Bhama Askhed dam which is near Chakan MIDC. The project work is completed and trials are going on for the same. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) initiated the Bhama Askhed water pipeline project in 2014. It was designed to meet the drinking water needs of 14.5 lakh residents of eastern Pune. As per the plan, a 42-km pipeline will be laid from the Bhama-Askhed dam to Pune||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-ncp-locked-in-a-tussle-to-seek-credit-for-completion-of-bhama-askhed-project/story-HER7dSapHMIPLbBYlwzoeN.html
02-12-2020||Pune||State recommends 18K Covid tests daily, Pune logs 6K||The state government has issued a letter to all districts to ramp up testing for Covid-19. While the target recommended is over 18,000 tests daily, as of Monday (November 30), Pune district carried out only 6,340 Covid tests covering Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies, rural Pune, councils and three cantonment boards. The state has recommended that the ratio between reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) and rapid antigen test (RAT) tests should be 75-25 before February 2021. The letter issued by principal secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas on Monday (a copy of which is with HT) specifies the daily test target for every district and civic body in the state. “Given the population and positivity rate in the state, Maharashtra is conducting least number of Covid tests in the country. To control the Covid pandemic the district administration must ramp up testing,” states the letter. It has been recommended that the state must conduct at least 1.58 lakh Covid tests daily. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We have gone through the letter. We will gear up the testing accordingly and also the testing capacity at BJ Medical has been increased. Even at the peak of the first wave, rural administration tested only close to 5,000, and now we have a target of about 8,600 according to our population. We will target SARI, ILI and comorbid patients who could be tested at regular intervals so that the case fatality remains in control due to early detection and early treatment.” The administration must survey all influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) cases in the district who must be tested regularly for Covid. During the contact tracing of every confirmed Covid, all the high-risk contacts must be tested, 100% of SARI and ILI patients in containment zones must be tested, superspreaders, including vendors, hawkers, public servants and others who come in contact with a large number of people and others, must be tested as per the district’s requirements.The state has also recommended increasing the proportion of RT-PCR in comparison to RAT which are often known to report false negatives. The RT-PCR testing proportion must be increased gradually from 65% as of December to 75% as of February 2021. To ramp up the testing, administration has to also ensure that the current testing facilities have enough manpower so that they work to their full potential and that the reports are submitted as soon as possible. Also, the RT-PCR kits and consumables must be provided. To cover the expenses, the administration may use CSR funds or local administrative funds, as per the letter issued by the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-recommends-18k-covid-tests-daily-pune-logs-6k/story-cG2nxdYyCraVryClYmSZVM.html
02-12-2020||Pune||After Pune civic body notice, road work on hill slope halts at Vetal Tekdi||Following the notice from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the road work at hill slope at Vetal tekdi (hill) was stopped on Tuesday in Kothrud. Earlier on November 19, the PMC served a stop-work notice to the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) citing unauthorised work on the hill slope at survey no 123 in Kothrud. HT has a copy of the notice PMC has served. The MIT denied reports that any norms are being flouted while carrying out the work. Mahesh Chopade, registrar at MIT said, “The said hill slope and survey number 123 belongs to MIT. We have 12 to 15 acres of land with some of it being part of the hill. These are baseless allegations that we are excavating in forest land, instead we are making an internal road for the use of the students in the future. Besides our students plant trees atop the hill which is part of MIT, during summer, there is not ample water, hence we were in the process of making a ‘kaccha’ road to help provide water on top through tankers. We are not constructing any road but making an internal road for which we don’t think we need any kind of permission.” This was brought to the cognizance of PMC ward officers by local citizens who shared video clips and photographs of excavation work carried out during Diwali. “We live near the MIT campus and we were surprised to see a major part of excavation carried out during the Diwali days, causing irreparable damage to the hill. This being a hill slope, we were worried about concretization taking place on the site,” said Pankaj Modi, a resident of Kothrud. Yuvraj Deshmukh, deputy engineer at PMC building permission department said, “MIT had begun dumping rubble, sand and stones to create the base of the road and had excavated part of the slope. MIT did not seek any permission and hence it is an unauthorized construction activity for which we have served them a notice thus bringing the work to a halt.” According to Sushma Date, member of Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti, “Survey 123 is a part of the hill top-hill slope zone and hence as per DC rules 2017; all construction activity is banned here.” Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted: “Citizens have approached me with concerns about the private road planned on #Vetal Tekdi. Understandably they are worried about the ecological impact. I will be talking with the authorities and concerned institution to ascertain repercussions and work towards an amicable solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-pune-civic-body-notice-road-work-on-hill-slope-halts-at-vetal-tekdi/story-h7aZxn3eujYMuL33n5l8qJ.html
02-12-2020||Chandigarh||HPCC issues notice to 12 Mandi Congress leaders for indiscipline||The Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee has issued notice to 12 party leaders of Mandi over their unfavourable statements in the media about the party. Among those who have been asked to reply in 15 days are Champa Thakur, the daughter of former minister Kaul Singh Thakur and the Congress candidate in the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections, and two former MLAs Sohan Lal and Mansa Ram. A party leader, requesting anonymity, said the state Congress chief had issued notice to district and block Congress members but not to those from the state party committee. The notice has also been sent to Deepak Sharma, Pawan Sharma, Jagdish Reddy, Jeevan Lal Thakur, Lal Singh Kaushal, Suman Chaudhary, Sanjeev Guleria, Vijay Pal Thakur and Veena Sharma. DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE TO DECIDE ON FATE These leaders have been asked for a response for issuing statements to the media and writing to the party high command against Himachal Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore. After receiving the reply of the leaders, it will be placed before the disciplinary committee of the state Congress. The committee, headed by Solan legislator Dhani Ram Shandil, will decide on their fate. Other members of the committee are Pawan Kajal, Sharmila Patial and Chet Ram. The meeting of the disciplinary committee, which was to be held in the first week of December, was deferred after a member, Virender Sood, died of Covid-19. WERE ONLY TRYING TO STRENGTHEN PARTY: DETRACTORS Rathore detractors say that they wrote to the high command to strengthen the party. “The high command should tell what’s wrong in writing to it or organising a meeting that aims to strengthen the party,” one of the detractors said. Congress leaders in Mandi, who owe allegiance to former HPCC president Kaul Singh Thakur and former state party chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, have been feeling slighted. In the letter, they alleged that Rathore did not consult them while constituting the block and district units. In October, Sukhu spearheaded a closed-door meeting with a group of former legislators from Shimla district, which has eight assembly segments, to chalk out their strategy. Former Jubbal-Kotkhai legislator Rohit Thakur, former Chopal legislator Subash Manglait, former Shimla legislator Harbhajjan Singh Bhajji, former Kasumpti legislator Sohan Lal and Deepak Rathore, who unsuccessfully contested the election from Theog during the last assembly elections, attended the meeting. It’s likely that the party is also contemplating disciplinary action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hpcc-issues-notice-to-12-mandi-congress-leaders-for-indiscipline/story-WjvYEiSKPnEvfJCbXEl7lO.html
02-12-2020||Pune||Pune graduates’ and teachers’ constituency polls: Higher turnout despite Covid pandemic||Despite elections in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the turnout for Pune graduates’ and teachers’ constituency on Tuesday was very high.Until 4 PM, the administration had recorded 49.52 % turnout for graduates’ constituency and 67.36 % voting for teachers’ constituency. Pune constituency consists of five districts including Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur. The total numbers of voters in the graduate constituency are 4.26 lakh and for teachers’ constituency, the total voters are 72,545.Solapur registered a voter turnout of 62.06 per cent for the graduates’ constituency and 85.37 per cent for the teachers’ constituency. On the other hand, Kolhapur registered a voter turnout of 68.09 per cent for the graduates’ constituency and 86.77 per cent for the teachers’ constituency. Counting of votes will take place on Thursday, December 3.With higher polling percentage, both BJP and Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders claimed that outcome will be in their favour. Chandrakant Patil, BJP state unit chief said, “The higher turnout will ensure the victory of BJP nominees as the party workers had ensured higher registration for these polls.” As there were a total of 62 candidates for graduates’ constituency and 35 candidates for the teachers’ constituency, it was a big challenge in front of the administration to conduct the voting, which was carried out through ballot paper instead of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM). For the graduates’ constituency, BJP’s Sangram Deshmukh was locked in a direct fight with NCP nominee Arun Lad with backing from MVA. For Pune teachers’ constituency, the NCP pitted Jayant Asgaonkar against an independent Jitendra Pawar, whom the BJP has supported. The administration made enough arrangements and voting centres and ensured that there is enough social distancing while performing the votes.Keeping the Covid pandemic in mind, the administration had made ample arrangements. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We’ve made the necessary arrangements at all polling centres. Sanitisers, use of masks and social distancing was maintained in all the five districts. Despite all the restrictions, the voter turnout was good.” On the background of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was expected that there would be less voting but until evening, the voter turnout was good. Given that the electorate from five districts participated for each constituency polls, the BJP had made the polls important enough to make it a verdict on the MVA as also Uddhav Thackeray’s governance. For Pune graduates’ and teachers’ constituency polls, voters from five districts – Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur –cast their votes. The BJP believes that a favourable outcome in these polls will send a message that people are not supporting tripartite MVA government while the defeat of the saffron party candidates would stave off the threat to the coalition in the immediate future, feel political observers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-graduates-and-teachers-constituency-polls-higher-turnout-despite-covid-pandemic/story-1Zm6xrnf9BTtiSHKW0MU9H.html

02-12-2020||Lucknow||After Lucknow, Ghaziabad to raise money through municipal bonds: Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said Ghaziabad will be the next local body in the state which will be raising money through the issuance of municipal bonds. Lucknow has become the first city in Uttar Pradesh and seventh nationally to raise money through this route. The Chief Minister was speaking at the listing ceremony of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) bonds. LMC had raised Rs 200 crore through the bond issue last month. Adityanath called the listing a historic moment and added that other cities including Ghaziabad, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi will be using this route for raising resources. “I am confident that very soon, we will be present here with Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation’s bonds,” he said, speaking at Asia’s oldest stock bourse BSE. Adityanath said raising resources through the bond issue improves the accounting practices and other systems at a municipal body, and also helps deliver services for the citizens of the city as the required resources get raised. The Chief Minister also said that the 10-year issue, which happens when borrowing rates are the lowest in over a decade, comes at the second lowest coupon ever of 8.5 per cent. The 4.5x subscription to the bond issue is representative of investors’ desire to participate in Uttar Pradesh’s growth, he said. He also seemed to appreciate the financial capital’s role in resource mobilization, saying the “Mahalaxmi Temple” is aiding in the economic progress of the country for over a century. Adityanath said there are 700 urban bodies in the most populous Indian state that support a population of over 8 crore people. Seventeen of these are municipal corporations, and ten of them have been selected under the Smart Cities mission, he said. The Chief Minister was accompanied by his cabinet colleagues Ashutosh Tandon, Satish Mahana and Siddharth Nath Singh, Lucknow Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia, and other officials at the event. He met actor Akshay Kumar on arrival from Lucknow late last evening and is scheduled to meet other Bollywood personalities and industrialists including Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran later in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-lucknow-ghaziabad-to-raise-money-through-municipal-bonds-adityanath/story-qLSoRrmiqqSC4fXkBahECN.html

This will help evaluate the economic impact of women working in the hills,” Pokhriyal said. He asked vice-chancellors of the Himalayan universities to undertake research in Hill Agriculture, Horticulture, Herb Production, Floriculture, Organic Agriculture, Eco-tourism, and Technology. This would produce the sources of livelihood in Himalaya. Hemvati Nandan Garhwal University in Pauri Garhwal celebrated its 8th convocation on Tuesday. Pokhriyal was the chief guest at the event. This year, 155 students registered for online convocation of which 72 students were awarded Ph.D., 59 gold medals were awarded to the toppers in various subjects. Vice-chancellor Prof Annapurna Nautiyal said, “This year, the university decided to have the convocation through an online medium to promote an academic spirit despite the Covid-19 global epidemic. Despite various geographical disparities and resource shortages, the university has successfully converted the challenges arising out of Covid-19 into an opportunity by using online mediums.” Talking about research and educational activities, the vice-chancellor said establishment of the Indian Himalayan Central Universities’ Consortium (IHCUC) in 2020 under the coordinator-ship of the HNB Garhwal University to conduct five multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional thematic studies sponsored by NITI Aayog, New Delhi, is a great leap to promote the idea of ‘One Himalaya’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/initiative-at-garhwal-varsity-to-evaluate-economic-impact-of-women-working-in-hills-pokhriyal/story-cis5yKqmPhi5Of4dlSatqN.html

02-12-2020||Delhi||With AQI at 381, Delhi’s air quality stays in very poor category||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the very poor category on Wednesday, with the air quality index (AQI) at 7am being recorded at 381.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) it is likely to remain very poor throughout the week owing to slow wind speed and a change in the wind patterns in the coming days.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI on Tuesday was 367, even worse than Monday’s 318, though both are in the very poor category. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and that above 400 is considered severe.According to IMD scientists, the average wind speed on Tuesday reduced to 7-8 kmph from 10-12 kmph on Monday. “The wind speed will further reduce from December 4 or 5 and the direction is likely to change to easterly, from the present north-westerly. The change in direction is due to a western disturbance that will affect Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh from the night of December 3, which will also have an impact on Delhi. Whenever there is a change in wind pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Also read | Pollution in November 2020 up from last year, shows CPCB dataHe said easterly winds are also likely to bring in moisture, which, when combined with calm winds, allow pollutants to accumulate. There is also a forecast of shallow fog on December 4 or 5.“Besides, the change in wind pattern will also lead to a rise in minimum temperature between December 4 and 7, when it is likely to remain around 10-12 degrees Celsius. Thereafter, north-westerly winds are likely to return, resulting in a drop in temperature,” Srivastava added.On Tuesday, the Safdarjung Observatory -- the official marker for the city’s weather -- recorded a minimum temperature of 8.1 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The maximum settled at 27.2 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-aqi-at-381-delhi-s-air-quality-stays-in-very-poor-category/story-WlzxJ45jAhGP81CvQ3Q0jO.html

02-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A citizen’s monument||The plastic banner clings to the roadside fence. Bhure Khan Baraf Depot supplies ice in great quantity for wedding banquets—though any customer could also buy individual ice slabs directly from the stall, here on a pavement near Gurugram’s Sector 14 market. One wonders how many people, while driving down the road, notice the banner. It has no photo, and displays Bhure Khan’s name (and that of one of his sons), his trade, his mobile numbers, and the number 786, considered sacred in Islam.Bhure Khan himself no longer exists.“He died in February last year,” says Allah Pyari, his wife, on the phone. A conversation with her makes it possible to draw a sketch of his life.A native of Etah, in UP, Bhure Khan left his village for Gurugram about 20 years ago. He started modestly and ended modestly as an ice seller, his wife says, but through sheer doggedness he firmly entrenched his new roots in NCR by building a house in Sheetla Colony. A father to seven, Bhure Khan hoped to make a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia after “completing the responsibilities of marrying off all his children.” Last year, however, while visiting a relative in Kasganj, UP, he succumbed to a heart attack. “I got to know of the attack only after he was no more,” his wife says.Two of Bhure Khan’s five sons have strayed into other professions—one is an auto driver, another is into “boring” (a process in machining), while the rest are carrying on with their father’s legacy of trading in ice. “Their work situation is growing very bad because of corona,” says Allah Pyari, referring to the pandemic.Despite breathing his last close to his native district, Bhure Khan was buried in Gurugram, in a graveyard near the bus stand. “My husband considered Gurgawa (sic) as our home, not Etah.”Bhure Khan lived to 55. He isn’t famous but the continuous existence of the roadside banner bearing his name is like a monument, discreetly commemorating the lives of all those like him who move to big cities and dream on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-citizen-s-monument/story-MmGFvG7xOqy5YAMyKk90RN.html

This time we have top names of the country playing here,” said Jeev at a media briefing at Chandigarh Golf Club on Tuesday.“Earlier the tournament used to be held in October or the first week of November, but this time as it is taking place in December, an early tee off will be a challenge because of the cold weather in the North. I am expecting a score of 15-20 under in four rounds for the winner,” he added.‘Follow Covid protocols’Jeev has the rare distinction of being the only Indian to have won the Asian Tour Order of Merit twice (2006 and 2008). He has won multiple titles on the European Tour, Japan Golf Tour and Asian Tour and has 14 major appearances to his name. Jeev has also achieved a career-high world ranking of 28, an Indian record.“We are going through tough times being in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic so I would like to request everyone to kindly follow all the safety protocols during the event in order to stay safe and healthy. The PGTI (Professional Golf Tour of India) has done a great job with the smooth conduct of two events in the Chandigarh tricity region last month. I’m sure that they will conduct this tournament with equal efficiency,” says Jeev.Uttam Singh Mundy, CEO, PGTI, said, “The event is our tribute to Jeev Milkha Singh for his unparalleled achievements on the international stage which brought glory to India and inspired a whole generation of Indian golfers.”“This tournament is one of the most prestigious events on the PGTI and we at Chandigarh Golf Club are proud to host it. The golf course is playing in its prime condition and as a testimony of it we had a 10-under-62 score by Sunit Chowrasia in the recently concluded PGTI event which was a new course record,” added Sandeep Singh Sandhu, president, Chandigarh Golf Club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/top-names-to-feature-in-four-day-jeev-invitational-golf-tourney-in-chandigarh/story-0ILYzPvovXotKx2jhG3QUL.html
02-12-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University student bodies urge V-C to reopen varsity||The student bodies of Panjab University (PU) on Tuesday urged the authorities to reopen the varsity for students.The student bodies also demanded that the varsity should open a library and hostels for MPhil students. The members of students organisations including All India Students’ Association (AISA), Punjab Students’ Union (PSU-Lalkaar), Students For Society (SFS) and Students Organisation of India (SOI) wrote to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar in this regard. In their representation, the student bodies reminded the authorities that the final-year MPhil students have to submit their thesis by December 31, 2020. The students also insisted on reopening for final year students.Aman, who is a member of PSU-Lalkaar, said, “I think that there seems to be no reason for keeping the university shut. We have given a deadline to the authorities after which we will be forced to open the university on our own.”Earlier this month, PU announced that the varsity will continue online teaching in its teaching departments and affiliated colleges for the current semester even though the University Grants Commission (UGC) allowed the higher educational institutions to reopen. Even the Chandigarh administration has allowed colleges to reopen for final-year students.The student bodies also claimed that the varsity has stopped releasing fellowships for PU toppers, and demanded their immediate and regular release.The student representation further read, “PU authorities are irresponsibly denying hostels to PhD scholars who have completed five years on a guest basis. This is seriously hampering their research work at the verge of thesis submission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-student-bodies-urge-v-c-to-reopen-varsity/story-vuCIW6NhABTZTWU5QIIPjJ.html

Later, we found some made-in-Pakistan biscuit wrappers inside,” said the IGP.He added that the make and design of the tunnel was similar to those detected in the past. “But in tunnels detected earlier, rainwater used to inundate them in monsoon. I think this tunnel was a fresh one, dug in dry season after monsoon,” he said.A man with an average height of five to six feet could have easily walked in with a bending posture inside the tunnel which was detected by the Border Security Force (BSF) on November 22 in Samba sector, said a top official.The tunnel, which was around 160m inside the Indian territory was detected near Regal post in Samba sector on November 22. It had originated from Chak Bhura post of Pak Rangers and was strengthened by small wooden planks. It was dug 20-feet deep beneath the ground and had a diameter of three feet.The four Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists, who used the tunnel to infiltrate, were killed in an operation at Ban Toll Plaza near Nagrota, Jammu, on November 19.They were in constant touch with their handlers in Pakistan via digital mobile radio. “Kahan pahunche? kya soorat-e-haal hai? Koi mushkil toh nahi?” texts were sent to the terrorists by their handlers in Shakargarh area of Punjab’s Narowal district in Pakistan. The recovered digital mobile radio was manufactured by a Pakistani company ‘Micro Electronics’ and QMobile Smartphone. In addition, a wireless set and a GPS device were also recovered.The four Jaish terrorists had sneaked into India along with a huge consignment of arms and ammunition including six AK-56 rifles, five AK-47 rifles, three pistols, 16 AK magazines, a packet of RDX, 20 Chinese hand grenades, six UBGL grenades and 20 kgs of explosive.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bsf-team-went-200m-inside-pak-territory-to-find-mouth-of-tunnel/story-0mbdm26wj4xDTCWvxnD9kJ.html

But they don’t know that the magnetic strength [of Maharashtra] is so powerful that instead of people going from here to there [UP], it may so happen that somebody from there comes here,” Thackeray said while referring to Adityanath indirectly.The Maharashtra CM said that their relations with the chamber have been through generations and they have collectively thought about the industrial progress and development of Mumbai and Maharashtra. He said, “Today we have the power to fulfil dreams for Mumbai and Maharashtra. Our relations are through generations and will not be broken.”“We are not jealous if someone progresses. We don’t have any problem if one competes. But if you are going to forcibly take anything away, then of course, I won’t let it happen and I think even you [industrialists] will not be willing to go,” he added, urging the chamber to become the brand ambassador of the state to attract investment into Maharashtra. He also promised complete support from his government.Thackeray said that Maharashtra has signed investment tie-ups worth Rs50,000 crore during the pandemic and will go on to fetch over Rs1 lakh-crore investment in the state. He said that unlike demonetisation where the money “disappeared”, the industrial activities will start chugging once again.In a day-long visit, Adityanath will go to Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) to ring the bell to list Lucknow Municipal Corporation bonds.Adityanath, who has already unveiled a plan to set up a film city in Noida, will meet prominent people from film industry in Mumbai and extend an invitation to come to his state for filmmaking. The UP CM is also scheduled to meet top business leaders and head honchos to invite them to invest in his state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/day-before-yogi-adityanath-s-visit-to-mumbai-uddhav-thackeray-says-won-t-let-anyone-forcibly-take-business-away-from-maharashtra/story-cmru0Qv3Jk7Hc5JVIkEoEK.html

02-12-2020||City||DDC polls: Kupwara hamlets cast votes with hope of development, statehood restoration||Residents from Kupwara’s fringe villages on Tuesday braved the morning chill and lined up early outside a polling station on Chowkibal-Tanghdar road in Marsari to cast their votes for development and strengthening the leaders fighting for the restoration of Article 370 and J&K’s statehood.Government High School, Marsari, houses the single polling station for residents of Marsari and Rangwar — the last two villages before the serpentine roads lead to the mountains of Tangdhar.“We believe in democratic institutions but the government should respect what people want from the Centre. We want respect, jobs and development,” said former sarpanch of Marsari, adding, “Today we are voting for the future of Kashmir. Everything was taken away from us on August 5, 2019. Now, leaders have joined hands for the restoration of Article 370 and statehood. By voting for the joint leadership, we want to make them strong,” he said.Other villagers echoed that by revoking J&K’s special status, the Centre complicated the situation in the Valley. “Article 370 and statehood are our rights which we should get back,” said villager Arif Ahmad.The polling was held in Chowkibal, a remote area in Kupwara district, as part of the second phase of the district development council (DDC) elections across J&K.“We are facing a series of problems here and development has never reached our villages. We have cast votes in the hope that our elected representatives will try to solve these problems,” said the head of Rangwar village, Ghulam Nabi.Marsari and Rangwar villages have around 900 registered voters and by afternoon, half of them had exercised their franchise.“We are either working as labourers or porters. For us, life is miserable and whenever there is snowfall we have to live without electricity for weeks. This time our only hope is that our representative will be close to us,” said Yaqub Khan, an elderly villager.Rangwar is a picturesque village surrounded by forests currently covered in heavy snow. However, villagers say their miseries swell once winter sets in. “Our village receives four to five feet of snow in winter and there is dearth of everything here. Only a few people in the villages are employed in government services or the private sector. So, the youths here are sitting idle,” said Saleema Begum of Rangwar.Shaheen Ahmad Khan, a student of Class XII who had come to vote from Rangwar along with his family, said that all 13 candidates came to their village to seek support. “We want a good and educated person to get elected so that he/she could at least highlight the issues of the villages. People here are voting for different candidates.”After coming out of the polling station, Saleem Khan wished that his vote would bring about a change for the youth. “We have a lot of problems here, especially unemployment. I hope that the administration keeps its promise of giving jobs to people.”In the neighbouring Manzgam, the villagers said they will prefer a candidate who will be honest and work for people. “This time, 15 candidates are in the fray, and people are voting for those who will work for rural development,” said Saif-u-din Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ddc-polls-kupwara-hamlets-cast-votes-with-hope-of-development-statehood-restoration/story-7wKNycXA4ZrNRbH3XdMXKO.html

The decision was taken on Tuesday morning in a meeting of the Maharashtra cadre of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the umbrella organisation of over 500 farmer organisations across the country. More than 80 organisations representing farmers, farm labourers, tribals and labour class organisations across the state will participate in the peaceful protest around 11am and submit letters to tehsildars and collectors across Maharashtra. In an online meeting with AIKS, an alliance of 48 organisations, trade unions of labourers and bank employees – Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti – participated to chalk out an action plan for Thursday’s protest organised on December 3. Ajit Navale, Maharashtra general secretary of AIKS, said, “On Tuesday morning, seven organisations representing farmers conducted a meeting and decided to hold the peaceful protest march on December 3. This meeting was followed by another online meeting, in which 80 organisations representing farmers, labourers and tribals of Maharashtra decided to join the protest march.” Farmers in the state had also participated in the nation-wide protest call by AIKS on November 25 and 26. Protestors had resorted to roadblocks and sit-in protests in 21 districts of the state, including Palghar, Thane, Nashik and Ahmednagar. Meanwhile, Maharashtra’s minister of state for labour Bacchu Kadu tweeted on Tuesday, “If the central government does not initiate satisfactory dialogue with farmers protesting in Delhi by December 3, then the farmers of Maharashtra will organise a mass protest called ‘Chalo Delhi’ and travel to the national capital on two-wheelers and four-wheelers.” Vishwas Utagi, convener of Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti, said, “We are trying to build a support system for what is going on in Delhi. For the first time in Maharashtra, so many mass organisations have come together to build up mass pressure on the government. On December 3, members of Jan Andolananchi Sangharsha Samiti will submit letters to tehsildars in all 400 tehsils, and to collectors in all 36 districts in the state, in support of the farmers’ protests.” Presently, AIKS has asked farmers not to hold any sit-in protests in the state, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-farmers-to-hold-mass-protest-in-state-on-thursday-to-show-solidarity-with-those-protesting-in-delhi/story-4kva32IpG50zUurbnv6FWP.html

02-12-2020||City||Viral audio clip: BJP demands Mumbai civic body panel chairman’s resignation||An audio clip, in which Shiv Sena corporator and standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav is allegedly asking a civic contractor to withdraw the latter’s bid for works under the corporator’s fund in E-Ward (Byculla and Mazagaon), has gone viral. In the clip Jadhav is heard saying, “You know the system or not? You withdraw the work and I will tell them to not issue you a challan.” After getting shortlisted in the tendering process, every contractor is issued a challan as an acknowledgement of appointment. The bid in the audio clip refers to civic works such as toilet, footpath and pathway repairs along with drainage work etc. In the audio clip, the contractor, Surajpratap Singh Deora, is heard saying, “It will be difficult for me to withdraw the bid as it will have impact on my company. We will not bid for any works in the future.” To this, Jadhav replies, “You do not understand that you need to withdraw the bid. When will you or your representative come to the ward office? I’ll meet you there. Or where do you stay? I will come there and explain it to you.” When contacted, Jadhav said, “I accept that the voice in the audio is mine. But if you listen to the recording, there is nothing wrong in what I said. I got to know that the contractor has not done proper work in the past. I will ask administration to order an inquiry into the matter. This is all is being done for politics. I very well know who has done this and I’ll come out in open with proof in the next few days to expose everything.” Deora’s firm Yash Corporation won the contract. He said, “I am a contractor and I have nothing to with politics or BMC elections. There is an allegation that I offered a percentage to Mr Jadhav. But I demand that this allegation be proved. I have written to the BMC chief and Mumbai Police commissioner stating that I was asked to withdraw my bid and there is possibility of threat to my life.” Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded Jadhav’s resignation. BJP’s group leader in BMC and corporator, Prabhakar Shinde, said, “Jadhav has confessed that it was his voice. All this is a disgrace to the functioning of the corporation. Jadhav should accept moral responsibility and immediately resign as the chairman and a high-level inquiry should be initiated into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/viral-audio-clip-bjp-demands-mumbai-civic-body-panel-chairman-s-resignation/story-CNHB35ukbRVCMtWwQ43LyM.html
02-12-2020||City||Maharashtra appoints 4-member panel to initiate probe into Jalyukt Shivar works undertaken by Devendra Fadnavis govt||Six weeks after state cabinet decided to probe the alleged irregularities in Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan (JSA), a flagship water conservation project by the previous Devendra Fadnavis regime, the Maharashra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has appointed a four-member panel to conduct an open investigation. The committee has been given six months to review the cases mentioned in Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report, examine the complaints received by the government and decide if there is need of an open inquiry into those complaints. The panel will have to submit the progress report about the probe in the cases handed over to it every month. The departments concerned have been directed to commence inquiry recommended by the probe panel immediately. The cabinet in its meeting on October 14 had decided to conduct the probe into the alleged irregularities in the Rs9,634 crore scheme, which was implemented in 22,589 villages between December 2014 and March this year. The CAG found holes after inspecting 1,128 works allotted under the scheme failed to achieve its aim. The report was tabled in the state legislature on September 8. The current government, too, had received more than 600 complaints about the irregularities and corruption related to the scheme, following which the state decided to initiate the probe. According to the government resolution issued on Tuesday, the probe panel will be headed by retired additional chief secretary Bijay Kumar, and will comprise additional director general of anti-corruption bureau (ACB); chief engineer of water resources department Sanjay Belsare and director of soil conservation and watershed management. In its 3-point terms of reference (or scope of inquiry), the panel has been directed to examine 1,128 works examined by CAG in 120 villages in two districts and decide in how many of them an open probe is required and how many works can be handed over for administrative action or divisional inquiry. The panel has also been directed to examine 600 complaints received by the government and decide how many of them required an open probe and which of them need administrative action or divisional inquiry. It has also been told to look into other works undertaken under JSA and decide whether any of them require open, divisional inquiry or administrative action. The CAG report tabled in the state legislature on September 8 slammed the Fadnavis government for its failure in implementation of JSA, envisaged to make villages in Maharashtra drought-free. Besides the deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of works, JSA failed to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase the ground-water level as intended, CAG’s report stated. Despite spending ₹9,634 crore, drought-hit areas ended up deploying more tankers than in the past, the report said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has termed the probe an insult to the people’s movement under which the JSA was implemented. “The most inefficient MVA government has initiated another probe but only truth will come out of it. In the first place, CAG had examined only 1,128 of total 6.42 lakh works allotted under the drive. This means the remaining 99.83% works were not examined. The report has not found any scam or corruption, while on the contrary it has accepted the fact that many villages became tanker-free and it helped farmers to take second crop,” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye. He added that when CAG suggested a course correction, the MVA government scrapped the entire scheme out of vendetta. Upadhye said the probe will find nothing, similar to the report by the committee constituted to find out the alternative land for the Metro car shed at Aarey Colony. The Congress has welcomed the probe and said that the BJP affiliated contractors benefited from the project. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that he had exposed the failure of the project way back in 2018. Sawant, citing a report by Groundwater Survey and Development Agency, had said that number of tankers increased in the villages where the project was implemented. The report had also stated that the groundwater level dipped after implementation of the project. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-appoints-4-member-panel-to-initiate-probe-into-jalyukt-shivar-works-undertaken-by-devendra-fadnavis-govt/story-SVBEmLYmU1J8Hmxujl9nJN.html

However, crop diversification brought hope for them.Under this project, about 9.58-hectare farming land was brought under irrigation at a cost of Rs 46 lakh in the village. Besides this, 35 farmers were provided power tillers, power weeders, garlic planters and other modern agricultural implements through JICA and trained by agricultural experts.Farmers including Raj Kumar, Saravan Kumar and Nikkaram, Sanjeev Kumar have set an example in vegetable production with the help of the JICA project. They are now planting cucumber, bitter gourd, okra, tomatoes and other vegetables along with traditional crops during the kharif season, while peas, radishes, potatoes, cabbage and other vegetables are sown during the rabi season.JICA project director Dr Vinod Kumar Sharma said that due to the diversification, the production of food crops has increased to 28 quintals per hectare and vegetable production to 190 quintals per hectare in the kharif season in Chaleli village.Similarly, for the rabi season, the yield of food grains is 26 quintals per hectare while the vegetable production is 160 quintals per hectare. Sharma said that the annual income per hectare of Chaleli farmers has increased from Rs 74,500 to over Rs 3 lakh, nearly a five-time rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-of-hamirpur-s-chaleli-village-cash-in-on-crop-diversification/story-XoTBXe7jHgZbsyfKmBLPML.html

One of the plots has a defunct petrol pump, registered in the name of Dawood’s late sister, Haseena Parkar. The total reserve price for the three plots was ₹1.09 crore.Two bidders participated in the auction, but one eventually withdrew from the bidding process. Kate won the bid for ₹1.10 crore. Last month, on November 10, six properties belonging to Ibrahim’s family were auctioned. In April 2019, a flat in Nagpada, belonging to Parkar and admeasuring 600sqft, was auctioned for ₹1.80 crore. Prior to that, in 2018, Safema officials had auctioned Dawood’s property in Mumbai’s Pakmodia Street. The reserved price of the property was ₹79.43 lakh, and was bought by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) for ₹3.51 crore.

But, even after he was cured in May this year, Kang forcibly retained him at the centre and asked for another Rs 30,000 for treatment. But, she brought her husband home 15 days ago.She alleged that on Monday night, the accused, along with his 12 unidentified accomplices, turned up at their house and took away her husband.Sub-Inspector Labh Singh, SHO, City 2 police station, Khanna, said a case under Sections 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code had been registered against Kang and his 12 accomplices.Notably, Kang had staged protests seeking action against inspector Baljinder Singh, former SHO at of Khanna Sadar police station, who was accused of torturing a man and his son at the police station and making them strip.Kang, along with another LIP leader, Manwinder Singh Giaspura, had removed their clothes outside the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in protest when the special investigation team (SIT) formed by DGP Dinkar Gupta had visited Khanna to investigate the matter on May 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khanna-lip-in-charge-booked-for-abducting-man/story-azPKyhxgiin2u7J6Q4lGhJ.html
02-12-2020||Chandigarh||Drop in Covid-19 cases in Haryana after three-week spike||After three weeks of big surge in Covid-19 infections, Haryana saw a decline in virus cases last week with the state reporting about 2,200 less cases as compared to the week before.The drop in infections is significant in view of the ramped up sampling by health authorities. The health department had tested a record 2.81 lakh persons last week.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, said the downward trend is seen after spike during the festival season. “We are witnessing lesser number of sick patients now. So evidently there is a gradual decline as was witnessed in the last week of September. However, we have to remain guarded and not become complacent,” he said.According to health department statistics, the state reported 15,222 fresh infections last week (November 23-29) as compared to 17,426 reported a week before.Health officials said the infection rate had already started stabilising two weeks ago when the infection rate had slowed down. A slight increase of 356 infections was recorded from November 16 to 22 (17,426 cases as against 17,070 between November 9-15). This was in contrast to over 3,100 more cases reported in the weeks before.Significant increase in samplingThe health authorities created a record by testing 2,81,079 persons last week as compared to 1,79,255 a week before. The sampling, thus, increased by over a lakh last week. “More than 80% samples tested last week were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests considered the gold standard test for Covid-19,” said additional chief secretary (ACS), health Rajeev Arora. As per the data, 77,948 more RT-PCR tests were conducted last week compared to the week before. The positivity rate from RT-PCR testing is 7.7% and 4.3% from the rapid antigen tests. Eight districts have critical positivity rate As per the statistics, eight of the 22 districts have critical positivity rate (more than 6%). They are Faridabad, Gurugram, Rewari, Hisar, Panchkula, Panipat, Ambala and Karnal. Sirsa and Mahendergarh, which showed critical positivity rate two weeks ago, have seen a drop in infections. Only two districts—Charkhi Dadri (1.6%) and Nuh (1.3%)— have desirable positivity rate of less than 2 %. The overall positivity rate of the state is 6.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/drop-in-covid-19-cases-in-haryana-after-three-week-spike/story-uvsCbGWW1ZUkzmrerHeNUM.html
02-12-2020||City||Jalandhar MC renames BMC Chowk as Samvidhan Chowk||In a significant move to woo Dalit voters ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the Jalandhar municipal corporation (MC) passed a resolution to rename BMC Chowk as Samvidhan Chowk and Rama Mandi Chowk as 108 Sant Ramanand Ji Chowk.While the name Samvidhan Chowk is being seen as tribute to BR Ambedkar, the Dalit icon and father of the Indian constitution, the latter is in memory of Ravidassia leader and Dera Sach Khand deputy head Ramanand Dass, who was shot dead in Austria in 2009. In the proposal, MC officials stated that BMC Chowk stands for British Motor Car Company, which has long been shifted from here. In view of this, and considering the fact that the Chowk is close proximity to several government offices, it should be rechristened the Samvidhan Chowk, the proposal stated.The Doaba region of Punjab, comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts, is home to a major chunk of the state’s Scheduled Caste (SC) population. The civic body also passed a resolution to extend full support to farmers protesting the new farm laws, besides clearing around 70 agendas, including the hiring of contractual staff, repair of roads, sterilisation of animals.The House also proposed to charge ₹2, 000 from those applying for NOC to register their land. Mayor Jagdish Raja proposed construction of elevated road from PAP Chowk to Football Chowk to HMV Chowk for solving the traffic problem.Opposition leaders, meanwhile, created a ruckus alleging that some proposals were passed without consulting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-mc-renames-bmc-chowk-as-samvidhan-chowk/story-KrzQ838i0JvVfqRhG43ouO.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||With farmers blocking Singhu border, many truckers stranded on Kundli highway||It has been five days since Jaan Mohammad, 24, a truck driver, was stranded on the Kundli Highway near the Singhu border (connecting Haryana with Delhi) as thousands of farmers continued to camp on the road demanding the withdrawal of the Centre’s new farm laws.“I am the son of a farmer. I understand why farmers are protesting and I support them. But being stranded on the highway has become an ordeal for drivers like me,” he said, even as at least a dozen others gathered around him nodded in agreement.A resident of Dahej in Gujarat, Mohammad had travelled around 1,153km to his destination -- a plastic factory in the Kundli Industrial Area . He was scheduled to reach by November 27, but then the farmers’ protest started and the Singhu border got blocked; his truck now stands parked merely two kilometres from its destination, unable to move an inch forward for the past five days.Dozens of other drivers are similarly stranded on the Kundli Highway with no place to go as they wait for the road blockade to end. Since they cannot abandon their trucks laden with wares, the truckers are forced to live, eat, and sleep at the spot with the farmers. With nothing to do, groups of them could be spotted playing cards or watching protest videos on their phones on Tuesday.Sadashiv Pandey, 48, who was to deliver thread spools to the Kundli Industrial Area on Friday, said, “While the farmers have been kind enough to feed us langar (community kitchen), it is at a little distance from where we are and so we rely on food from nearby hotels. This is increasing our daily expenses,” he said. The protest area spreads to more than four to five kilometres on the Kundli highway at the SInghu border while the queue of stuck vehicles and trucks stretches far beyond that.Increasing daily expenses are not the only issue, say truckers. Karan Singh, 37, who was driving from Chandigarh to deliver chemicals at a factory in south-east Delhi’s Okhla area, said the transport and logistics business would be hit if these trucks aren’t able to make enough trips.“A lot of truck owners have to pay EMIs. The lockdown had hit their business hard and they are already cash-strapped. How will they pay their loans if the vehicle remains stationary for days and aren’t able to make trips? Although we are salaried employees, it will affect our earning as well. If the boss doesn’t have money, how will he pay us?” he said. “The government should listen to these farmers and solve their problems. Nobody would choose to live on the road unless they were forced to,” he said.Naveen Gupta, general secretary of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said the queue of trucks awaiting entry into Delhi at the Singhu border alone is as long as around 5 kilometres now. “Entry of trucks into Delhi has almost come to a complete halt because of the ongoing protest. Though we do not have an exact number of trucks stuck at the borders, but it is safe to say that more than 1,500 trucks are stuck. Per day, the losses being faced by truck owners is around Rs 2,500 per truck, including taxes, cost of the driver and the loss in the number of trips. The problem is that because of the delay the clients are also likely to deduct money from their total payment,” he said. SP Singh of the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT), an independent research body which tracks the road transport industry along 75 trunk routes across the country, however, said the impact has been minimal so far. “This is because most of the truckers are taking a detour to reach their destinations. Had there been any serious adverse impact on the trucking business so far, there would already have been an outcry by the transporters associations by now. However, if the agitation continues for longer, then fruits and vegetables will soon be costlier in Delhi-NCR,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-farmers-blocking-singhu-border-many-truckers-stranded-on-kundli-highway/story-rCZ4nU9xjCR70GZ4OqyJNP.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Protesting farmers occupy one more border point, supplies running short in Capital||The traffic police had to close the Delhi-Noida border at Chilla on Tuesday after more than 300 farmers blocked both carriageways of the Delhi-Noida Link Road even as the ongoing agitation stayed peaceful at both Singhu border and UP Gate with the police ramping up security in view of the talks between the farmers and the government. The farmers are demanding the Centre to revoke three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets. At Chilla border, the farmers used nearly 15 tractors to block both the carriageways and sat on the road, prompting the Delhi as well as Noida police to place barricades and deploy personnel in large number on both sides to prevent the farmers from entering Delhi. Since the protest began during the evening rush hour, it led to massive traffic jam on the key route connecting Uttar Pradesh with Delhi.Officials, however, said that the traffic in other parts of the city, including DND was normal. “The traffic at the other roads is being managed. We will keep updating the commuters about the situation at the Chilla border,” said Ganesh Saha, DCP Traffic, Noida. The Delhi traffic police also tweeted advisories, alerting commuters about the traffic snarls.This is the fourth border point that has been closed due to the farmers’ agitation. While vehicular traffic has been completely halted at Singhu and Tikri borders, traffic movement is being allowed towards Ghaziabad on one carriageway at Ghazipur-UP Gate.“Between 5pm and 5.30 pm, the protesting farmers assembled at the Chilla border and blocked the two carriageways using tractors. The border has been closed for vehicular traffic movement. We have deployed our personnel in adequate numbers. Also, talks with the farmers in coordination with Noida police are on,” said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (eastern range).Earlier in the day, a group of farmer leaders left Singhu border for Vigyan Bhawan under heavy police escort to hold talks with the Centre. A senior police officer said while the farmers continued with their peaceful protest, number of paramilitary and Delhi police personnel deployed was adequately stepped up just as a precautionary measure. At UP Gate, the police added another layer of barricades to prevent the entry of farmers in Delhi after a group of protesters dismantle barricades by tugging them to a tractor. Heavy police and paramilitary were deployed at the border point, with senior police officers being present at the spot. Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Bihar’s Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) president Pappu Yadav joined the protesters at UP Gate to extended their support. “Farmers are protesting not only at UP Gate but in every corner of the country. They are agitating today as they are feeling helpless. They have been forced to accept the (farm) laws that they do not want,” Chandrashekhar told reporters. “About 500-700 people had gathered there as Bhim Army supporters had also arrived. However, they returned after meeting farmers. The traffic diversions were already in place and there was no untoward incident. We already have police personnel deployed at the spot,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (City 2).Supplies hitDrop in arrivals of fruits and vegetables in Delhi’s agriculture markets have forced traders to cater only to local supplies for now.Several traders across wholesale mandis in Delhi told HT on Tuesday that they have stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states for now in the light of the shortage and that they were focussing on local supply which has kept wholesale and retail prices stable in the capital.However, they apprehended that another 4-5 days of short supply due to blockade could lead to shooting up of both wholesale and retail prices.In Azadpur mandi, which accounts for a large share of fruits and vegetable supplies across the city and several other states, 6,062 trucks had arrived on Tuesday, as against an average of 11,000 truck for this time of the year, said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) in Azadpur, adding: “The central government must engage with farmers at the earliest and resolve the issue.”Green peas, tomatoes, potatoes and several varieties of apples and oranges have been in short supply for the past 3-4 days. “Right now, traders in Azadpur have temporarily stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states – from Madhya Pradesh to Karnataka. They are only focussing on local supplies and that is the reason why wholesale and retail prices have not witnessed steep increase in Delhi-NCR so far. However, they are running out of stock. If supply continues to be low, there will be a shortage in Delhi-NCR too and prices will go up,” said Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader based in Azadpur.Green peas from Punjab, the Himachal variety of oranges and apples from Jammu and Kashmir -- which largely arrive from the northern states through the border points that are blocked -- are some of the items that have witnessed the sharpest dip in arrivals, said Rajesh Yadav, a wholesale trader based in Delhi’s Ghazipur mandi.As on Tuesday, in the three agriculture markets, green peas were sold between Rs 30-40 per Kg and Jammu apples at around Rs 750 per crate, which the traders said were stable wholesale rates for this time of the year but things would have been different if they had been exporting to other states.AAP youth wing protestMeanwhile, the youth wing of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday staged a demonstration in Connaught Place in solidarity with the groups of farmers protesting against the three farm laws.While there were around 100 protesters who had gathered between blocks A and B of Connaught Place around noon, the police briefly detained 15 of them, including the party’s Punjab in charge Jarnail Singh. The others had dispersed when the police arrived, said the police.“We told the protesters to take the demonstration to the designated location in Burari, in the light of legal prohibitions against large gatherings applicable in the concerned area,” said deputy commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/protesting-farmers-occupy-one-more-border-point-supplies-running-short-in-capital/story-nu0yrSYMN9Mlw5PSZSvfWK.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ children protest in the day, study at night||Eleven-year-old Gursimrat Kaur, a resident of Mangat village in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district and a Class 6 student, has her exams later this month. So, while packing essentials for the farmers protest march to Delhi in November, the young girl picked up all her books.“I study whenever I get time,” she said, now camped at Singhu border with her parents and living in a bus. “We had been protesting against the farm bills in Punjab as well. But that doesn’t mean we have to miss out on studies. Like all times, I will score an A+ this term as well.”Kaur, who works with her mother Sukhbir in the fields and identifies herself as a farmer, read the translated version of the three farm bills in Punjabi before coming to the protest and felt the new reform that did away with a network of government-controlled agricultural markets hurt her prospects. “We are all farmers and want to protect our livelihood and that is why we are here,” said Kaur.She gets lessons on WhatsApp. The tests are mostly conducted online.Sukhbir Kaur said the parents didn’t force the children to attend the protests but that younger people got wind of the protests and planning from social media. “They know what’s happening and want to protest on their own. We have been protesting ever since the laws were passed in our village and our daughter has always joined us.”Kaur is among many children who have accompanied their parents from different parts of Punjab to the borders of Delhi. They are spending their nights on highways, in tents and on tracker trolleys, supporting the stir against the three farm bills, but also finding time to revise their lessons, catch up on syllabus and coordinate with teachers on WhatsApp.Like Kaur, Harman Singh has been at Singhu border since Friday. His day begins with sloganeering with the farmers at 7am and ends with his poring on the screen of his smartphone, going through the assignments or notes sent throughout the day.“We can continue our studies and fight for our rights. It is not an either-or situation. I wake up early in the morning, join the protests during the day, and study for a couple of hours at night on our smartphone,” said the 14-year-old from Sangha village in Punjab’s Mansa district.“This is not just a fight for our elders. Our families will be affected by this and so all of us need to agitate while maintaining education as our priority,” said Singh, who has completed two chapters from his Class 9 Punjabi textbook and one from his Science textbook in the past five days.Singh, who is at Singhu with his relatives while his parents are in Hisar, said his classes had moved online earlier this year when the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools to shut down. “Since our learning is mostly happening online, we can be anywhere and continue our studies. Our teachers send study material on WhatsApp that we can revise at any time,” he said.Other children at the protest site also said that they could travel for the protests because there was no stipulation to attend physical classes. Punjab opened government schools for students of classes 9 to 12 last month, but attendance is voluntary and only to seek guidance from teachers.Mehek Preet Khatkar, a Class 7 student from Mangowal village in SBS Nagar district of Punjab, said she decided to join the protests because online classes were anyway not helpful and she wouldn’t be missing out on physical teaching. “Since the Covid-19 crisis struck, we only learnt through the online mode, which did not help us a lot. So, we won’t miss out on studies if we are here to protest. Also, what use will our marksheet be if we lose our livelihood?”Sucha Singh, one of the organisers of the protest and a member of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the children at the protest had grown up aware of their surroundings. “They have seen the hardships that their families face and understand what these farm bills would mean for them. The children want to come to protest because they know that their future will be in crisis if they are not here to protect their lands now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-children-protest-in-the-day-study-at-night/story-Hq07N4q3Fcnz9zBiHlLcgK.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||As farmers protest, Good Samaritans at borders open their hearts and homes||For years, Siddharth Rathee has run a local business in Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, but has turned a philanthropist for farmers in the past week. The 26-year-old has been marshalling funds from his father and uncle, both in the United States, and marshaled about two dozen friends with one purpose: feed the thousands of farmers camped on the outer fringes of the Capital for five days to push the Centre to scrap three farm laws. Rathee and his friends have even put up posters announcing their free services or ‘langar seva’ along a 15-km stretch of Bahadurgarh Road. The Hindi posters, stuck on metro pillars, walls and outside shops, promise “farmer brothers” any essential item they need -- from food to water and medicines. “They (farmers) have been feeding us all our lives and now it is our turn, “ said Rathee. “The posters will ensure that farmers anywhere along the stretch are able to reach us for help.” Rathee is not alone. Scores of local residents, organisations and establishments at Delhi’s three borders –Tikri, Singhu and Chilla – have coalesced into an unlikely army of volunteers to help farmers tide over hunger, disease and the chilly weather. They have organised community kitchens, opened their homes, drawn water from their local supply and offered their washrooms to the agitating farmers. Others travelled from Delhi and local markets to supply the protesters with fresh fruit and milk. When the supply of household items such as sugar depleted, many pitched into replenish stocks. Jagtar Singh is one of them. A businessman from Rohini in Delhi, Singh travelled to Singhu border on Monday with battery operated lights to help the farmers celebrate Gurpurab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. “My work doesn’t allow me to join their protest in person, but this is the least I can do for my farmer brothers,” he said. A pressing problem for the farmers – some of whom are old and ailing – is the chronic lack of toilets. To resolve this, Bharat Sharma, who lives near the Singhu border, opened his homes to farmers, used a motor pump to fill his overhead tank multiple times a day so that the farmers did not lack facilities or water. “If I were protesting for my rights, I would have wanted toilet facility,” Sharma said. Other residents in the locality offered to launder clothes, loan toothbrush and paste, shoes and shared their phone numbers in case of an emergency. Restrooms have also been thrown open by fuel stations and a private hospital. Jarnail Singh, Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Tilak Nagar, said the absence of toilets was felt by his party and they set up portable toilets at the Singhu border, as the site falls within the jurisdiction of the Delhi government. “We have also opened langars at the two borders. But our aim is to ensure that farmers keep receiving their supply of tea leaves, sugar and paper cups as these are fast depleting. Mosquito nets are another essential item urgently needed and we are trying to provide as many as possible,” Jarnail Singh said. Many gurdwaras are also running community kitchens. “We are capable of feeding even one lakh farmers for six whole months. For now, we are organising langars at all three border points,” said Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. Farmers say they are overwhelmed by the response from local residents. “The people here have made us their family so much that we don’t miss our families back home. They have gone to the extent of offering to wash our clothes. One family said that we didn’t even have to bring our own soap while visiting their home for toilet,” said Harjinder Singh, a farmer from Ropar .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-farmers-protest-good-samaritans-at-borders-open-their-hearts-and-homes/story-5D8VYSs3FgsXvC8kOwscwI.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC wants to know if any guidelines in place for disposal of testing kits||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought to know from the AAP government as to what guidelines or protocols were in place for the disposal of used Covid-19 testing kits and whether these rules were being followed by hospitals, clinics and doctors under its jurisdiction.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, to find out the guidelines or protocols in place, which authority issued them and if these were being implemented.“Come with instructions,” the bench said while hearing a plea by a lawyer who alleged improper disposal of used swabs from rapid antigen testing at the district magistrate’s (South East Delhi) office in Lajpat Nagar.The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to queries. The petitioner, Pankaj Mehta, said used swabs were “thrown out in public” and “tests were being carried out over a pile of used swabs for Covid-19” at the DM’s office.“Upon complaining about the risk of widespread infection and the irregularity behind disposing of the swabs in this manner, the doctor concerned at the counter said the swabs were of negative patients and thus it was safe to stand over them and get yourself tested,” Mehta said.Refuting the allegations, Ghose said he was informed that the swabs being referred to in the plea were unused or defective. He said he will nevertheless take instructions on the correct position and inform the court.During the hearing, the Delhi government counsels told the court that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had issued guidelines on the disposal of medical waste.Mehta, in his petition, said the Union Health Ministry came out with the Clinical Management Protocol notification on July 3, which laid emphasis on safe waste management and cleaning of the environment at health care facilities, but the Delhi government was allegedly not enforcing it.The matter would be now heard on December 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-wants-to-know-if-any-guidelines-in-place-for-disposal-of-testing-kits/story-D4Enj3zbMy5KVNHlvHzHXI.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt has notified one farm law, examining the other two||Even before the farmer’s protest began along the city’s borders, the Delhi government had already notified one of the three controversial central farm laws to implement it in the national capital.Senior officials said the Delhi government notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 on November 23. The state development department is currently examining the remaining two farm laws. The law allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce beyond the physical premises of agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) markets.A senior official in the development department said the sale of vegetables and fruits was deregulated in Delhi in 2014, enabling trading beyond APMC-managed mandis. The latest notified law only adds foodgrains and poultry to the list of produce that can be so traded, he said, requesting anonymity.The notification by the Delhi government drew flak from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led government and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of “doublespeak,” saying it “quietly notified” the “so-called anti-farm laws” for Delhi while supporting the farmers protesting against the laws at the city’s borders. “The notification exposes duplicacy of AAP and the Kejriwal government. They want to share the benefits of the new farm laws while misguiding the farmers,” said Manoj Tiwari, BJP MP and former Delhi unit president of the party. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said that every state government was bound to notify these laws as they are enforced by the central government. “The farm bills have already been passed in the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and have also been signed by the President. These are now laws for the entire country. It is enshrined in the Constitution that no state has the power to independently implement or reject these laws. Even the resolution passed in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha cannot do anything about these laws. The only way these can be tweaked or revoked is if the Central government does it,” the official said on condition of anonymity. In its response to the BJP, the Delhi government said that the matter was “not an issue at all”.“Selling of fruits and vegetables was already deregulated in Delhi many years ago. With the latest notification now farmers will be able to do the same for grains as well. The mandis have not been dismantled and they are continuing. The demand of the protesting farmers is that they should get MSP (minimum support price) whether inside or outside mandi, which AAP supports,” the party said in a statement. It added that the BJP was clueless about how to handle the protests by farmers and was trying to divert attention of the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-has-notified-one-farm-law-examining-the-other-two/story-rUWEuPbcj0jK2Ft0fgXZyL.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||More than half of tests with RT-PCR, positivity rate 6.85%||More than 30,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted in Delhi on Monday, with share of the more accurate RT PCR and other molecular tests accounting for more than 50% of the total tests conducted for the second day in a row. On both occasions, fewer number of rapid antigen tests had been conducted because of a government holiday. On Monday, the city reported 4,006 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and added 86 new deaths to its tally. Despite the higher number of RT PCR test – which is more accurate and had a positivity rate of 30% as on November 7 — the positivity rate of Delhi went down further on Tuesday to 6.85%, which is the lowest since October 23. A positivity rate of 5% or less, if maintained over two weeks, shows that the spread of the infection is under control. Even as Delhi has managed to scale up the number of RT-PCR tests —from below 15,000 to the current 30,000 tests a day — Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that a proposal will be sent to the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research to allow city labs to conduct 10% fewer tests than their capacity to ensure reports are made available within 24 hours. To increase the number of more accurate RT-PCR tests, the Delhi government has pushed the labs to full capacity, resulting in delays in turn-around time, he said. “Delhi has been utilising the full capacity of both the government and private labs to conduct more RT PCR tests. However, there have been some delays in getting test reports. If a lab says their capacity is 10,000 tests a day and they are given as many samples, the reports get delayed. We will take the issue up with ICMR and the Centre to allow the labs to conduct 10% less tests than their capacity to ensure that the reports are available within 24 hours,” said Jain. He said that the government had been collecting up to 40,000 samples, but the labs weren’t able to give the reports within a day. He also said that the Centre needed to extend support to help Delhi in scaling up RT-PCR tests to 60,000 a day. In a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in mid-November, the government had decided to double Covid-19 testing to between 100,000 and 120,000 a day, with half of the tests being the more accurate molecular ones. “There is a need for additional support in terms of labs as promised by Central government to ensure that the reports are issued within 24 hours,” said Jain. The Union health ministry has said that it will increase the testing capacity under its labs by 10,000 and add another 1,000 in scientific institutes. Ten mobile labs were to be deployed in the city to scale up molecular testing further. Private labs in the city however said that they either had capacity to test more samples or they would be able to scale up on government assurance of receiving more samples. “We have the capacity in case there is a need to scale up testing further,” Dr Arvind Lal, chairman of Dr Lal Pathlabs said. Dr Deepak Sadwani from Prognosis Labs said, “When we had started we could process about 200 samples, now we do 2,000 samples a day. Yes, we have reached capacity with our current machines and manpower, but it can be scaled up further.” Delhi has reported 2,663 deaths in November alone, with 91 deaths being reported on an average each day in the last seven days and 115 deaths reported on an average the week before. The 10-day case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – stood at 1.93% on Tuesday. “We have to see the moving average and not take into consideration the daily statistics. At present, 1.61% is the death ratio. During winters, pollution levels in Delhi due to stubble burning in neighbouring states was the reason behind the declining health of citizens. Due to that very reason we saw an increase in hospital admissions. However, we anticipate that in 2-3 weeks, the situation will get better,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-than-half-of-covid-tests-in-delhi-with-rt-pcr/story-wWEXFlErNS5bvaV0L8h3XI.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Work delayed further, chaos at Ashram to persist for 3-4 months||The construction of the underpass at the Ashram intersection will miss its December deadline and require at least three to four months more, Public Works Department (PWD) officials involved in the project said, confirming a delay that will prolong the miseries of thousands of commuters who rely on the stretch and residents who live nearby.Ever since work began in December last year, the area has turned into a nightmare with the road reduced to widths barely wide enough for a bus, forcing people to navigate crumbling, cratered and often flooded roads amid plumes of dust, which also fills into nearby homes. The work has been on to create a 750-metre underpass on the Mathura Road, which allow traffic under the busy Ashram intersection with the Ring Road. “After initial hiccups, work resumed in May this year, but it was slow because of a shortage of labour since most migrated to their villages during Covid. Now the pace of construction has again slowed down due to pollution curbs and labour shortage since workers again went back home due to Diwali and for the harvest season,” said a PWD official, asking not to be named.“At present there are nearly 50-60 labourers at the site. Construction restrictions because of the pollution season have also slowed things down,” said this person. A senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official said that all construction agencies have been asked to follow required protocols for reducing dust pollution in their area. However, the pollution control agency had not put any restriction on construction work.Regular commuters of the stretch, however, said that more than the construction activity, it is the poor planning and management of the site that is creating an everyday problem. This stretch is an important link between central and south Delhi with the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. “I have been travelling regularly on this road for more than 10 years now and this has continued to be a commuter’s nightmare from day one. First it was the metro construction, then the closure of the Kalindi Kunj border because of the Shaheen Bagh protest and now this construction. This intersection is an arterial passage and mismanage this area is to bring the city to a standstill,” said Roshan Giri, who said that he had been stuck in the traffic jam on Mathura Road for around 25 minutes. The Delhi government did not respond despite repeated calls and texts.Commuters also said that even at peak rush hours in the morning and evening, no traffic police official was stationed to manage congestion. HT visited the spot on Friday, Monday and on Tuesday, at peak and non-peak rush hours, and did not spot any police official. The traffic police said they regularly deploy personnel as per the need and also issue advisories to commuters on their social media handles.The PWD said the underpass is being constructed through “cut and cover” method due to space crunch at the site and they have left maximum space on the surface for traffic movement so that there is minimum disruption. “The construction work of ramps of the underpass is nearing completion. After construction of ramps, we will begin the digging process underneath the Ring Road portion, which will take one-two months to complete because work is winters generally remains slow,” he said.The Delhi traffic police said that the department was conducting regular review meetings with the PWD to assess the any change in diversion plan. The department said that they have put out the required signage and have stationed traffic policemen to manage traffic here. “We are putting out regular advisories asking commuters to avoid the stretch, if possible, because of the construction situation there, but ultimately, it is an arterial road and we cannot stop traffic completely,” the traffic police response to HT’s query read. S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said that seeing traffic load on the Mathura Road and the Ring Road, the Ashram underpass is very much required project as it will improve connectivity between south and central Delhi.“When such important projects get delayed it not only result in traffic snarls but the cost of the project also escalated which may hamper the progress of the project. Authorities should have fast tracked the project to complete it on time so that the public doesn’t have to go though traffic logjams,” he said.The Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) — the apex body for approving infrastructure projects in the city — had approved the underpass in January 2016, which was to be completed by March 2018 but the project was delayed for want of financial approval. It was given financial nod by the expenditure finance committee (EFC) of the Delhi government in November 2018. On December 24, 2019, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had laid foundation stone of the project with a deadline to complete it by December 2020, which is set to be missed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-respite-from-traffic-jams-as-ashram-underpass-set-to-miss-deadline/story-FjDiQ4yGInYAyiI4S48X7N.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Max hospital conducts Delhi’s first lung transplant in Covid-19 patient||Doctors from a private hospital in the city conducted Delhi’s first lung transplant and that too in a patient who has recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The 31-year-old man had developed fibrosis, a condition where the lung tissues harden after healing from an injury making it difficult to breathe. The patient already had lung silicosis – a condition caused by inhaling silica dust – and the Covid-19 infection made the situation worse. Lung fibrosis is one of the known sequallae – a condition following a disease – of Covid-19. So far, there have been at least two instances of lung transplant in Covid-19 patients reported from India one in 48-year-old businessman from Gurugram who was operated upon in Chennai and a 32-year-old from Chandigarh who underwent the surgery in Hyderabad. A team of 15 doctors from Max hospital, Saket operated upon the recipient from Hardoi on November 28. The donor was a 49-year-old woman from Jaipur who had suffered fatal head injuries in a road traffic accident. The lungs were flown into Delhi airport from where a green corridor was created, making it possible for the lungs to cover 18.3 km journey in just 18 minutes. A lung remains viable outside the body only for 8 hours. “Among all the solid organ transplants, lungs are the most fragile organs. Since most donors are road traffic accident victims, the trauma triggers vomiting in some donors that can go to the lungs and damage them. Lungs being rich in lymphoid tissue are more prone to rejection as well,” said Dr Rahul Chandola, one of the doctors who performed the surgery. He is the associate director of adult cardio-thoracic and vascular surgery and a heart and lung transplant specialist at Max Smart Super Speciality hospital, Saket. Dr Gurpreet Singh, V P operations, Max Hospital, Saket Complex said, “It is indeed a matter of great pride for us to be conducting the first ever lung transplant in North India on a critically ill, Covid impacted patient. I would also like to commend the initiative taken by the donor family who decided to donate organs even in their time of loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/max-hospital-conducts-delhi-s-first-lung-transplant-in-covid-19-patient/story-GHdQ0V5n0TtdwPKmfD5EEL.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||On Day 1, only few comply with new govt work from home policy||The Delhi government’s recent decision to have only 50% employees physically present in offices, as a precaution against the spread of Covid-19, is turning out to be a case of “easier said than done”, with several departments yet to adopt the policy and others unsure as to how to proceed given that they are indirectly involved in Covid-19 activities. On Tuesday, the first day of the order being in force, only a few government departments could shift to the work from home (WFH) roster while the others continued to function as usual.Departments such as services, general administration and vigilance started the WFH roster from Monday with most employees deciding to report to work on alternate days. On Saturday, the Delhi government had issued the order to implement a work from home policy from the week starting December 1, for at least 50% of the total staff, excluding bureaucrats, in government offices and departments that are not on the front line of Covid-19 management. The decision was taken in light of the Covid-19 situation.The capital currently is going through a third surge of Covid-19. While the highest number of cases a day (8,593) was recorded on November 11, the highest deaths a day (131) was recorded on November 18. The case positivity rate had touched 15.26% on November 7.The government has maintained that both cases and positivity rate are gradually coming down.While the WFH policy is not applicable to departments such as health, district administrations, home guards, civil defence, prison staff and water department, senior officials said it will still hamper delivery of public services.“Services such as issuance of driving licences, income and caste, certificates or sub-registrar functions will continue as usual. But, because of the WFH policy, the waiting time is likely to increase. For example, the time to get a driving licence is already around one to two months and the wait may now be longer. Also, we are thinking of having staggered timings at road transport offices,” said a senior transport official, on condition of anonymity. Delhi government has around 150 departments and a working strength of around 250,000. The latest order also does not include Grade I officers – IAS officers, DANICS officers and those promoted to equivalent ranks. “Departments such as education, labour and food and civil supplies have a lot of employees indirectly engaged in Covid-19 activities. The education department has called for a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss how WFH can be implemented,” said Umesh Batra, general secretary of the Delhi Government Employees’ Welfare Association (DGEWA).Delhi government had implemented a similar policy during the nationwide lockdown and most departments continued working with only 50% of staff physically present in office till June 30. When restrictions were scaled down from July, the order was relaxed in a phased manner.HT had earlier reported that a total of 2,487 employees of the Delhi government contracted Covid-19 between March and October 13, of whom 89 succumbed to the virus, reveals the reply to an RTI query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/for-delhi-govt-staff-work-from-home-is-easier-said-than-done/story-55hqa9hpGTJVu5ygeyi9rI.html
02-12-2020||Delhi||Panel endorses extension of bails to 3,499 prisoners||The high-powered committee, constituted to decongest Delhi prisons, has recommended the extension of interim bails granted to 3,499 under-trial prisoners (UTPs) while stating that it was hopeful that the situation of Covid-19 would improve soon.The committee, headed by justice Hima Kohli of the Delhi high court, said the sudden spurt of Covid-19 cases in Delhi shows that there is no certainty as to when the pandemic shall abate. It said if the interim bails of these 3,499 prisoners are not extended, then there is a risk that a “dangerous proposition” of them may end up bringing the infection into jails.The committee said the Covid-19 situation has worsened during November, as compared to October, and though there was a slight reduction in new cases since November 11, the number of daily active cases is still very high.“The committee is, therefore, of the considered opinion that no such chance/risk can be taken and thus resolved that interim bail granted to 3,499 UTPs needs to be further extended for a period of 45 days,” the minutes of the meeting held on November 28 said.The committee also said a judicial order would be required for extension of bail while directing the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to place the recommendations before the high court registrar.During the meeting, director general (Prisons) Sandeep Goel informed the committee that if the 3,499 UTPs and 1,183 convicts who have been granted “interim bail/emergency parole” are asked to surrender, then the total population of Delhi prisons is likely to reach 20,500, and it may become unmanageable owing to the present situation.He said it would be appropriate if “interim bail/emergency parole” granted to 3,499 UTPs and 1,183 convicts is extended for a further 45 days.The committee also extended the emergency parole of 1,183 convicts by six weeks, which was going to expire on or before January 9. Goel said there is one active Covid-19 case in the Mandoli jail -- a minor child of a woman inmate. He said she has been admitted in GTB Hospital along with her mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/committee-recommends-extension-of-interim-bails-to-prisoners-in-view-of-covid-19/story-tn53f2mbMgk2s4OGnxOnVJ.html
02-12-2020||World||Donald Trump openly floats idea of 2024 White House run||Donald Trump -- who finds himself more and more isolated, with his quixotic quest to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory squashed at every turn -- is openly musing about a second run at the US presidency in 2024.“It’s been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years,” he told guests at a White House Christmas party on Tuesday.The event, attended by several Republican Party power brokers, was closed to the media, but a video of the outgoing president’s speech quickly went public.Nearly a month after the November 3 election the 74-year-old Trump still refuses to acknowledge that he lost and has not conceded to his Democratic rival, who is busy building his incoming administration.Shuttered in the White House, Trump has limited his public appearances to the bare minimum but has not shied away from spewing furious tweets about alleged election fraud -- which his own attorney general says is not evident.“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Bill Barr told the Associated Press on Tuesday.Barr’s statement was all the more powerful because he is a staunch Trump ally.Given the curious political climate, in which the president-elect is busy introducing his cabinet nominees while the current president spreads conspiracy theories, speculation in the nation’s capital is running wild.According to NBC News, Trump has discussed the possibility with his close aides of launching his 2024 campaign on January 20 -- Inauguration Day for Biden, which clearly the Republican does not plan to attend.As he has admitted publicly in the past, the Manhattan real estate mogul-turned-president is a bit superstitious. In 2017, he filed the paperwork for his 2020 campaign on January 20, the same day he took the oath of office.Trump loves nothing better than being a provocateur, and should he stage a rally to rival the pomp and circumstance of the inauguration, he would embrace one of his favorite political maneuvers: counter-programming.Several times during his term, he boycotted the annual dinner hosted by the White House Correspondents Association -- only to show up at a campaign rally the same night.Obstacle course The formal launch of a Trump 2024 campaign would allow him to stay center stage, at least in the short term. But his path to victory would be strewn with obstacles, to say the least.From January 20, he will be the former president, and the political calculus will change dramatically.The sway he holds over Republican lawmakers and the round-the-clock media attention he commands (and on which he thrives) will both taper off considerably.All eyes will turn to his successor, but also to various senators and state governors within his own party who harbor White House ambitions.As he has repeatedly said on Twitter, Trump did not suffer the collapse at the polls that some predicted, and can certainly boast of a significant political base.The recounts roll on, but one thing is for sure: the 2020 election saw record turnout. Biden won more than 81 million votes, but Trump passed the 74 million mark -- -- the top two totals ever for presidential candidates.On a nationwide basis by percentage, Trump -- who incessantly mocks “losers” -- doesn’t fare as well. He earned less than 47 percent of the ballots cast.So will he end up being the Republican presidential nominee in four years?That seems rather a long shot. Trump is hardly a traditional politician -- he functions on instinct, in the moment. Long-term strategic planning is hardly his strong suit. In theory, nothing is preventing him from trying again in four years. The US Constitution prevents anyone from serving more than two full terms in the White House, but non-consecutive terms are possible.Only one president did so: Grover Cleveland, in the late 19th century. Elected for the first time in 1884, his reelection bid was a failure in 1888, but four years later, he won again -- making him both the 22nd and the 24th president of the United States.Cleveland was 56 at the start of his second term. Trump would be 78 -- the same age as Biden is now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-openly-floats-idea-of-2024-white-house-run/story-63JSUQlKDohInVBOPNqHAN.html
02-12-2020||World||Covid-19: US CDC recommends shorter self-quarantine periods||US health officials on Wednesday recommended a shortened quarantine period for people exposed to Covid-19, from 14 to 10 days if they haven’t taken a test and have not developed symptoms.This can be further reduced to just seven days if the exposed person receives a negative test, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientist Henry Walke said.“Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to take this critical public health action, reducing the economic hardship associated with a longer period, especially if they cannot work during that time,” he said.“We believe that if we can reduce the burden a little bit, accepting that it comes at a small cost, we may get a greater compliance overall.”The US is seeing more than 150,000 new cases a day and is bracing for a coronavirus super-surge following extensive travel over the Thanksgiving holiday.The new guidance, which will be posted on the CDC’s website and passed on to state and other local jurisdictions, was based on the latest research regarding infectiousness and how the disease progresses.But, Walke stressed, it isn’t risk-free and people who end quarantine early should continue to monitor for symptoms for the full 14 days.Reducing the quarantine period from 14 to 10 days comes with a “residual risk” the person leaving early could transmit to someone else at between 1-12 percent, according to CDC calculations.For the seven-day quarantine with a negative test, the residual risk of onward transmission is 5-10 percent.In addition, the CDC also announced testing guidance in light of Thanksgiving travel and in anticipation of more of the same over the Christmas holiday period.CDC epidemiologist Cindy Friedman stressed that the safest option was to postpone all plans.But if people do decide to travel, the agency recommends they get a viral test one to three days before their trip, and consider getting tested after their trip within three to five days.This should be accompanied by reducing non-essential activities for a full seven days after travel, even if the test is negative.“Testing does not eliminate all risks, but when it’s combined with reducing non-essential activities, symptom screening, other precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-cdc-recommends-shorter-self-quarantine-periods/story-we2GJTfaNaZQsk74eeclkL.html
02-12-2020||World||US justice dept finds no vote fraud, orders probe into ‘cash for pardon’ scheme||The US justice department had found no evidence of widespread voting fraud to change the outcome of the 2020 election, attorney general William Barr has said, in a big blow to President Donald Trump’s plans to overturn his defeat.The department is also probing an alleged bribery scheme involving campaign donations to secure a presidential pardon, a court filing showed on Tuesday. The document is highly redacted, with all identifying information blacked out. But it refers to a “secret lobbying scheme” directed at “senior White House officials” to gain a presidential “pardon or reprieve of sentence” for an unnamed person. The probe comes days after Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The clean chit to elections from Barr, a Trump ally, was seen as a stunning repudiation of his boss’s efforts. Barr told the Associated Press that the department of justice prosecutors and FBI agents had followed up specific poll fraud complaints and information they had received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election”.Trump’s attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis hit back in a statement, saying “there hasn’t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation” and that the lawyers had “gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined”.Barr also told the news agency he had named US attorney John Durham as Special Counsel to investigate origins of the Russia meddling probe into the 2016 election. As attorney general, a political appointee, he could have been easily removed by the Biden administration, but firing a special counsel can be messy.Trump’s lies about election fraud are beginning to alarm Republicans. One Georgia election official angrily appealed to him to stop and condemn threats of violence against election officials by his supporters.With his chances of staying in power dwindling, Trump indicated he may be considering another run in 2024. “It’s been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years,” he told guests at a White House Christmas party, according to a CNN report.The president has also threatened to veto the defence spending bill if it did not include a provision rescinding a law that shields social media platforms from liability for their content — Section 230. He and his allies have long complained of discrimination by Facebook, Twitter and others.Seemingly undeterred by being fact-checked by his attorney general, Trump tweeted out a stream of TV clips of so-called witnesses speaking about election fraud at briefings and one legislative hearing that they claimed to have seen or experienced personally, which, have failed, once again, to withstand scrutiny in court.President-elect Joe Biden, on the other hand, has continued to put together his administration publicly, unaffected by Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He introduced his economic team comprising Janet Yellen and Neera Tanden, nominees for treasury secretary and director of the office of management and budget respectively, in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again,” Biden said while introducing his team. “We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country — the middle class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-dept-finds-no-vote-fraud-orders-probe-into-cash-for-pardon-scheme/story-EwdLU5PuayX1ZhaJoetygO.html
02-12-2020||World||‘Let’s get to work already’: Putin directs authorities to start mass Covid-19 vaccinations||President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian authorities on Wednesday to begin mass voluntary vaccinations against COVID-19 next week as Russia recorded 589 new daily deaths from the coronavirus.Russia will have produced 2 million vaccine doses within the next few days, Putin said. Russia said last month that its Sputnik V jab was 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 according to interim results.“Let’s agree on this - you will not report to me next week, but you will start mass vaccination...let’s get to work already,” Putin told Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova.Golikova said large-scale vaccination could begin on a voluntary basis in December. The rise in infections has slowed since reaching a high on Nov. 27, with 25,345 new cases reported on Wednesday. Russia has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted regional curbs. With 2,347,401 infections, Russia has the fourth-largest number of COVID-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. It has recorded 41,053 deaths related to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.The Kremlin earlier gave assurances that Russians were first in line to be vaccinated, with Moscow also discussing supply deals with other countries. “The absolute priority are Russians,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Production within Russia, which is already being developed, will meet the needs of Russians.”Authorities in St Petersburg, which reported 3,684 new infections on Wednesday, ordered bars and restaurants to close from Dec. 30 until Jan. 3, to combat the rise in cases there, the RIA news agency reported. Museums, theatres and concert halls would be closed to the public in the city of more than 5 million people for the duration of Russia’s New Year holidays, from Dec. 30 to Jan. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-s-get-to-work-already-putin-directs-authorities-to-start-mass-covid-19-vaccinations/story-aVN9VcLynvc7gci6kxv9UI.html
02-12-2020||World||US companies add fewer jobs than forecast, ADP data show||US companies added fewer jobs in November than forecast, signaling a deceleration in hiring as coronavirus cases surge and some governments begin imposing new restrictions.Businesses’ payrolls increased by 307,000 during the month, the smallest advance since July, after an upwardly revised 404,000 gain in the prior month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 440,000 advance.The slower-than-expected pace of hiring illustrates the labor market’s uneven recovery as Covid-19 continues to spread and some states and local governments enact new restrictions on restaurants, retail and travel. At the same time, Congress has yet to agree on another round of fiscal assistance to shore up the most-affected businesses and keep employees on payrolls.The data precede the federal government’s monthly jobs report on Friday, which is forecast to show private payrolls increased by about 486,000 after a 638,000 gain in October.Service-provider employment increased 276,000 in November, reflecting gains in leisure and hospitality, health care and business services, according to ADP. Payrolls at goods producers rose 31,000 last month, including a 22,000 gain at construction firms.Payrolls at small, medium and large businesses all increased, with the biggest advance occurring at medium-size firms. Hiring rose 139,000 at those companies with 50 to 499 employees. Large businesses added 58,000 to payrolls and small companies took on 110,000 workers.ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-companies-add-fewer-jobs-than-forecast-adp-data-show/story-KZ6mTLIIhstNJNbEoQTlZJ.html
02-12-2020||World||North Korea-linked hackers targeted J&J, Novavax in hunt for Covid-19 research||Suspected North Korean hackers have recently tried to break into at least nine health organizations, including pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and vaccine developer Novavax Inc, revealing a broader effort to target key players in the race to develop treatments for Covid-19.Four people who have investigated the attacks said the spate of hacking attempts began in September, and used web domains mimicking online login portals to try and trick staff at the targeted organisations into revealing their passwords.The hacking attempts included a bid to get inside British drugmaker and vaccine developer AstraZeneca, which Reuters first reported last week was in Pyongyang’s crosshairs.North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections, but South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the country had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China - the source of the pandemic - before shutting the border in late January. A Reuters review of publicly-available Internet records show that web domains and servers used by the attackers have previously been identified by the US government and security researchers as part of a North Korean hacking campaign. Other targets identified by the sources, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, included the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the University of Tuebingen in Germany, and four South Korean pharmaceutical firms: Genexine Inc, Boryung Pharma Co Ltd, Shin Poong Pharm Co Ltd and Celltrion Inc.Reuters was not able to determine if any of the hacking attempts, some of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday, were successful.North Korea’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A message sent to an email address used by the hackers was not returned. Pyongyang, which has no direct line of contact for foreign media, has previously denied carrying out cyberattacks.Novavax spokeswoman Amy Speak said her company was “aware of this threat” and was coordinating with government agencies and private cybersecurity experts.“We are confident we can continue to progress with our Covid-19 vaccine candidate without disruption and that these incursions do not pose a risk to the integrity of our data,” she said.A spokeswoman for the University of Tuebingen said staff were repeatedly targeted by hackers but all recent attacks “were detected and blocked by our IT-Team at an very early stage, no damage occurred.”Genexine said it was aware of a malicious website impersonating a company login portal but had not recorded any direct attacks against its staff. Celltrion said it had recently identified and successfully blocked a number of hacking attempts as part of its regular security work.Johnson & Johnson, Beth Israel, and Shin Poong declined to comment. Boryung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Simon Choi, an expert at South Korean cybersecurity group IssueMakersLab, said he had attributed the hacking attempts to North Korea and it was clear the attackers were specifically hunting for information about Covid-19. In the case of South Korea’s Celltrion, for example, he said the spies tried to break into an email account set up to field queries about Remsima, a monoclonal antibody which is being studied as a treatment for severe cases of the disease.A person familiar with the matter said that some of the fake login pages had been spotted by security experts at Microsoft Corp, helping prompt an alert the company issued last month about the threat of North Korean espionage to Covid-19 researchers. Microsoft stopped short of naming the targeted organizations in its Nov. 13 blog post, but said they were “leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers” in countries including the United States and South Korea.Lawmakers in South Korea also appear to have alluded to the digital espionage campaign, saying last week that its intelligence service thwarted attempts by Pyongyang to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines, although they provided no further details.Officially, North Korean authorities have reported no cases of coronavirus in their country, making it the only non-island nation - aside from Turkmenistan - to do so. But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un raised eyebrows last month when he was quoted by state media as ordering officials to intensify their anti-coronavirus work. Digital espionage against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic as state-backed hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak.Reuters has previously documented how hackers linked to Iran, Vietnam, South Korea, China and Russia have on separate occasions been accused of trying to steal information about the virus and its potential treatments.Western officials say any stolen information could give foreign governments a valuable strategic advantage as they fight to contain a disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-linked-hackers-targeted-j-j-novavax-in-hunt-for-covid-19-research/story-AUopdjkwllSn2l1EtZe9MO.html

Spain’s Garajonay National Park, Olympic National Park in the United States, and Mexico’s Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve are among those under “very high” threat, the new report said.It said while 63% of the heritage sites are classified as “good” or “good with some concerns,” 30% are of “significant concern” and 7% are in “critical” shape.In a difference from the previous two IUCN reports, climate change has eclipsed “invasive alien species” — such as when foreign rodents, fish or plants are transplanted, accidentally or not, to new environments — as the most potent threat against such sites.Human activities like tourism, hunting and fishing, and livestock grazing have also had an impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-damaging-more-world-heritage-sites-report/story-2NhIUYH00se4PydC0qRN6N.html
02-12-2020||World||Warmer world in 2020 busted weather records, hurt people: UN Body||An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020, creating an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt, the United Nations’ weather agency reported Wednesday.While the globe partly shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, extremes linked to human-caused climate change intensified, the World Meteorological Organization said in its State of the Global Climate report. The report kicked off a day when the United Nations pushed for new climate action with two reports and a major speech by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres describing the woeful state of the planet.The UN is ramping up its efforts for a Dec. 12 climate summit in France on the 5th anniversary of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.The WMO report found that worsening global warming is being seen in all seven key climate indicators, but it said the problem is more than measurements and is increasing human suffering in an already bad year.“In 2020, over 50 million people have been doubly hit: by climate-related disasters (floods, droughts and storms) and the Covid-19 pandemic,’’ the report said. ”Countries in Central America are suffering from the triple-impact of hurricanes Eta and Iota, Covid-19 and pre-existing humanitarian crises.”By the time it ends, 2020 will go down as one of three warmest years on record, despite a La Nina cooling of the central Pacific that often lowers temperatures globally, the WMO report said.This year is set to be about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the last half of the 1800s, which scientists use as a baseline for warming caused by heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Most trapped heat goes into the world’s seas, and ocean temperatures now are at record levels, the report said.“There is at least a 1-in-5 chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2024,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.The Paris climate accord set a goal of not exceeding 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.A new analysis by Climate Action Tracker scientists who monitor carbon pollution and pledges to cut them said public commitments to emission cuts, if kept, would limit warming to about 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and possibly as low as 2.1 degrees Celsius. Those public commitments include President-elect Joe Biden’s promise that the US will have zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and China’s goal to do the same by 2060.“2020 was a shocking year, not only because of COVID, but also because of the impacts from extreme events we saw,” said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn’t part of the WMO report.Among the dozens of extremes that the report highlighted:-- A record 30 Atlantic named tropical storms and hurricanes, plus a record 12 that made U.S. landfalls.--Death Valley, California, hit 129.9 degrees (54.4 degrees Celsius), the hottest temperature the world has seen in 80 years, while the Los Angeles metropolitan area logged its hottest day on record with 120.9 degrees (49.4 degrees Celsius) in September.--Record wildfires struck California and Colorado in the western United States, following a major fire season in Australia, worsened by record heat.--The Arctic had record wildfires and a prolonged heat wave culminating in a 100-degree mark (38 degrees Celsius) in Siberia in June. Temperatures in Russia from January to August were 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) hotter than the previous record.--Record low Arctic sea ice was reported for April and August and the yearly minimum, in September, was the second lowest on record.--More than 2,000 people died in record summer rains and flooding in Pakistan and surrounding nations. Extensive flooding from extreme rains in Africa killed hundreds of people in Kenya and Sudan. And in China, the overflowing Yangtze River killed at least 279 people.--Near-record drought and heat caused heavy crop losses in South America. Much of central Europe had extensive drought, with a record 43-day spring dry spell in Geneva, home of the WMO.Mahowald of Cornell said while these events can’t solely be blamed on climate change, “these are the types of events scientists fear will increase due to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warmer-world-in-2020-busted-weather-records-hurt-people-un-body/story-EETjtVNwnW9BYfIVo7cIwI.html
02-12-2020||World||US trade conflict must end, says EU to Joe Biden in new transatlantic agenda||The European Union and the United States should resolve their trade disputes after US President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January in a “new transatlantic agenda”, the EU executive said on Wednesday, laying out its wish-list for better ties.After four years of US President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda during which Washington imposed tariffs on Brussels on national security grounds, the EU is now looking for close cooperation with Biden on almost all issues.The United States and the EU “must work closely together on solving bilateral trade irritants”, the European Commission said in a proposal to EU governments, noting that EU-US commerce accounts for a third of world trade.However, the 12-page document presented by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made no mention of how to progress, other than appealing to “shared values of human dignity, individual rights and democratic principles.”“We would prefer to have a friendly agreement among us and not to have to go to the World Trade Organization, which is the way you go when you don’t agree,” Borrell told a news conference.The European Union is awaiting a ruling from the WTO on its challenge to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Borrell said the EU would prefer to talk and not to wait for WTO settlements.Like NATO, the EU hopes to hold a summit in 2021 with Biden. EU leaders will discuss their approach at a meeting on Dec. 10.Both the EU and the United States have imposed tariffs in a dispute over aircraft subsidies. Washington has threatened further duties over EU plans to tax digital services companies.The two sides also have differing views on the value of the WTO and its system of settling disputes, which Washington has paralysed by blocking the appointment of judges.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in September that “major powers are either pulling out of institutions or taking them hostage for their own interests,” in thinly veiled criticism of the United States.In its proposal, the EU said a first step would be for the EU and the United States to finalise the appointment of a new WTO director-general and “explore how to restore the essential dispute settlement function by reforming the Appellate Body.”The Commission said the EU and the US should also open a “transatlantic dialogue” on the power of large technology companies, find fair ways to tax them and address “market distortions”.Other areas of work would focus on fifth-generation mobile networks, artificial intelligence, data flows and cooperation on regulation and standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-conflict-must-end-says-eu-to-joe-biden-in-new-transatlantic-agenda/story-qp8vRGfIAdWrc60gOIqKGN.html
02-12-2020||World||UK debates world-leading cuts in carbon dioxide emissions||Boris Johnson is mulling stricter UK greenhouse-gas cuts of as much as 69% by 2030, which would make it one of the most ambitious developed nations in the world when it comes to fighting climate change.A final decision hasn’t been taken, and targets in the range of 65% to 68% reductions from 1990 levels are also being considered, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the policy has yet to be finalized.A target of that magnitude would put the UK at the vanguard of global efforts to fight climate change, eclipsing the 55% reduction over the same period envisaged in the European Union’s Green Deal. It will also mark a key waypoint in the country’s plan to eliminate net emissions altogether by 2050 as part of efforts to contain global warming to at least 2 degrees Celsius.An announcement is planned before Dec 12, when Johnson is scheduled to co-host a United Nations event at which other countries may announce their more ambitious pledges on slashing carbon dioxide, the person said.“We’re looking at our nationally-determined contribution which will be extremely ambitious and will be published around the time of the climate summit on Dec 12 this year,” Johnson said in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Also Read | New Zealand declares climate emergency, promises carbon neutral government by 2025In recent months, major emitters including China and Japan have followed the UK in setting long-term goals to zero out greenhouse gases. Those new targets will put the world on course to limit global warming to 2.1 degrees Celsius, according to Climate Action Tracker. But mid-term goals are also required under the terms of the Paris Agreement to ensure countries stay on track and to provide signals to businesses on where to invest.Environmental campaigners at Greenpeace have called for a target as tough as 75% by 2030 that includes international aviation and shipping and doesn’t rely on the use of carbon credits, where polluters offset their own emissions by funding clean-energy projects elsewhere.Adair Turner, chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission research group, said that in order to have “a really credible and strong commitment,” the UK’s new goal should be in the range of 65% to 70%. Alongside that figure the UK should also commit to almost fully decarbonize its electricity system by 2035.“We’ve actually got to get emissions down a lot in the 2020s themselves, because what matters is the stock in the atmosphere” of greenhouse gases, he said.Glasgow CallingAs host of the next round of global climate change talks that take place in Glasgow next year, Johnson has been seeking to burnish his environmental credentials. Last month he unveiled a 10-point plan to boost green industries that included banning the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2030. The blueprint also included funding for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology and plans to expand offshore wind power.The new 2030 target will be based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee which is slated to be published next week, tracking the UK’s progress to meeting its environmental long-term goals. Its most recent figures found the UK to be off track to meeting the net zero goal and is “unprepared for the worst impacts of climate change.”The new 2030 target would replace an existing UK goal to reduce emissions by 57% in the period between 2028 and 2032. That goal was set in 2016 but to deliver on a 2050 goal to cut emissions by just 80% by mid century. Since then, the UK became one of the world’s first countries to set a binding net zero goal for 2050, meaning it now needs a tougher mid-term goal.Also Read | Biden plan to end US fossil fuel subsidies faces big challengesJohnson also wants to use green policies in a bid to boost relations with US President Elect Joe Biden, who has made climate change a key pillar of his campaign, reversing President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement.Amber Rudd, a former secretary of state for energy and climate change in Johnson’s Conservative Party, said setting the new target was complicated by Brexit. That’s because the UK is due to leave the EU’s Emissions Trading System on Dec 31, through which big emitters like steel makers, pay for their pollution.“As we leave the European Union, what is going to happen to the ETS and our involvement in it, is there going to be a replacement, how will it work? I think that’s going to be just as critical,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-debates-world-leading-cuts-in-carbon-dioxide-emissions/story-hNPtU3IhoL3FkdGOxkOrJL.html
02-12-2020||World||UN says 2020 likely world’s second hottest year, 2016 first||This year is on track to be the second hottest on record, behind 2016, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday.Five data sets currently place 2020, a year characterised by heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and raging hurricanes, as the second warmest since records began in 1850.“2020 is very likely to be one of the three warmest years on record globally,” the Geneva-based UN agency said in its State of the Global Climate in 2020 report.Stoked by extreme heat, wildfires flared across Australia, Siberia and the United States this year, sending smoke plumes around the globe.Less visible was a surge in marine heat to record levels, with more than 80% of the global ocean experiencing a marine heatwave, the WMO said.Also Read | India forms high-level committee to implement Paris Agreement targets“2020 has, unfortunately, been yet another extraordinary year for our climate,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, urging more efforts to curb the emissions that are fuelling climate change.Greenhouse gas concentrations climbed to a new record in 2019 and have risen so far this year despite an expected drop in emissions due to Covid-19 lockdowns, the WMO said last month.The latest WMO report said the global mean temperature was around 1.2 degrees above the 1850-1900 baseline between January and October this year, placing it second behind 2016 and marginally ahead of 2019.Hot years have typically been associated with El Niño, a natural event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean. However, this year coincides with La Niña which has the opposite effect and cools temperatures.The WMO will confirm the data in March 2021.A climate pact agreed in Paris five years ago compels countries to make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above which scientists warn of catastrophic climate change.While it is not the same as crossing that long-term warming threshold, the WMO says there is at least a one in five chance of temperatures temporarily, on an annual basis, exceeding that level by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-2020-likely-world-s-second-hottest-year-2016-first/story-vAF90XjPg3oxgt0fuibHGP.html

It released images of the barren landing site showing the lander’s shadow.“Chang’e has collected moon samples,” the agency said in a statement.The probe, launched Nov 24 from the tropical island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a space programme that sent China’s first astronaut into orbit in 2003. Beijing also has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.This week’s landing is “a historic step in China’s cooperation with the international community in the peaceful use of outer space,” said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.“China will continue to promote international cooperation and the exploration and use of outer space in the spirit of working for the benefit of all mankind,” Hua said.Plans call for the lander to spend two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule to take back to Earth, where it is to land in China’s northern grasslands in mid-December.Also Read |  US should act to counter China’s subversion of UN, commission says in report to CongressIf it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 probe in 1976.The samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although it is unclear how much access NASA will have due to US government restrictions on cooperation with China’s military-linked program.From the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs.American and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.“Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang’e 5. This is no easy task,” NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, wrote on Twitter.“When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.” US astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.The Chang’e 5 flight is China’s third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang’e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon’s little-explored far side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-spacecraft-collects-moon-samples-to-bring-back-to-earth/story-dv5VOFEWkEM6XagRILQwfK.html
02-12-2020||World||Ex-Hong Kong lawmaker asks Europe to provide ‘safe haven’||A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist who is visiting Denmark urged European nations on Wednesday to allow protesters in Hong Kong “a safe haven from the terror” of China’s Communist Party.“The situation in Hong Kong is getting worse by the day and it is important that the world knows that Hong Kong is no longer a free city,” Ted Hui said in an email to The Associated Press.Britain has extended residency rights for up to 3 million Hong Kongers eligible for British National Overseas passports, allowing them to live and work there for five years.Britain also has followed the United States, Australia and Canada in suspending extradition agreements with Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people which became a special administrative region of China in 1997 after Britain returned control of the territory to Beijing, which promised it autonomy over local affairs for 50 years.Hui arrived in Denmark on Tuesday “to change the Danish government’s stance,” according to Thomas Rohden, chairman of the Danish China Critical Society, which organized his trip. A former Hong Kong legislator, Hui was able to get his passport back from the government and a visa after receiving an invitation from Danish lawmakers.“When I began in politics, I never dreamed that the day would come that I could be jailed but democracy is fragile, and it is duty of all democrats everywhere to stick together in times of crisis. I call upon European countries such as Denmark to follow in the footsteps of Great Britain and allow protesters in Hong Kong a safe haven from the terror of CCP,” he said.“All politicians around the world should stand up for democracy together and face the realities of the situation in Hong Kong. If democracies do not stand together, we will fall together,” Hui said.Since the start of the protests in June 2019, Hong Kong police have made more than 10,000 arrests.Prominent pro-democracy figures who have been arrested include activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, as well as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy. Hui was arrested in May over an incident in the Legislative Council in which he dropped a rotten plant and attempted to kick it at the body’s president.Activists have accused the Hong Kong government and the central Chinese government in Beijing of tightening control over the semi-autonomous territory in response to demands for more democracy. They say authorities are destroying the autonomy promised to the city, a global financial center with greater freedoms than mainland China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-hong-kong-lawmaker-asks-europe-to-provide-safe-haven/story-U41P8h4kVdn9Psnbm0EQ2K.html

Biden is opposed to annexation and has promised a more evenhanded approach to the conflict.The taxes are a key source of revenue for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It was forced to cut the salaries it pays to tens of thousands of civil servants, worsening an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Also Read |  Russia slams Pompeo’s visit to Golan Heights: Know about all US decisions favouring IsraelHussein al-Sheikh, a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, confirmed the receipt of nearly 3.8 billion shekels (around $1.1 billion) from Israel. Israel’s Finance Ministry said the funds were transferred following the approval of the Israeli Security Cabinet last month.Israel said it would deduct an amount equal to what the Palestinian Authority pays to the families of prisoners and those killed in the conflict, including militants implicated in attacks that killed Israelis. Israel says the so-called Martyrs’ Fund incentivizes violence, while the Palestinians say it provides aid to needy families.President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, unveiled in January, would have allowed Israel to annex a third of the West Bank, including all its Jewish settlements. The Palestinians immediately rejected the plan, and Abbas announced in May that he was cutting all ties to the US and Israel, and would no longer abide by past agreements with them.Israel shelved its annexation plans in August after the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pause was only temporary.Also Read | Israel pushes for East Jerusalem building before Donald Trump exits White HouseTrump took unprecedented steps to support Israel and isolate the Palestinians, including moving the US Embassy to contested Jerusalem, cutting off aid to the Palestinians and ending decades of US opposition to Israeli settlements, which the Palestinians and much of the international community view as a violation of international law.Biden has vowed to restore aid to the Palestinians and press both sides to resume the long-moribund peace process, without providing much detail about his approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-transfers-1-billion-to-cash-strapped-palestinian-authority/story-VRwjyuZ14dVVizcReHb8SI.html
02-12-2020||World||UK approves Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine; roll-out from next week||The UK on Wednesday approved a Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, with 800,000 doses to be administered starting next week, marking the fastest development of any vaccine in history, from the design stage to approval within a year.The first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, the UK has ordered 40 million doses, with 800,000 doses arriving from its production base in Belgium next week. The UK’s regulator said the coronavirus vaccine was approved after rigorous, scientific and detailed review of rolling data.The usual prolonged process of vaccine development involving several years of design, clinical trials and regulatory scrutiny has been expedited to within 10 months in the case of Covid-19, marking a new phase in the history of global public health.June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said “no corners were cut” while assessing the data. The UK’s health officials said the elderly and those above 80 years will be prioritised when the first doses arrive.Raine said, “We have carried out a rigorous scientific assessment of all the available evidence of quality, safety and effectiveness. The public’s safety has always been at the forefront of our minds - safety is our watchword.”“I’m really pleased to say that the UK is now one step closer to providing a safe and effective vaccine to help in the fight against Covid-19 - a virus that has affected each and every one of us in some way - and in helping to save lives,” she added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the development as “fantastic” while a “thrilled” health secretary Matt Hancock reiterated his belief that normalcy would return by April. Johnson said, “It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.”Hancock, however, sounded a note of caution, asking Britons to see through the winter months by following restrictions until coronavirus vaccines are rolled out on a wide scale. “We can’t lower our guard yet,” said Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer.The vaccine with 95% efficacy needs to be initially refrigerated in bulk in “freezer farms” at between minus 70-80 degrees Celsius when doses arrive. It then has 10 days to reach vaccination centres, and once delivered, it can be stored up to five days in a fridge between 2-8 degrees Celsius, and administered.Arrangements are being made by the National Health Service (NHS) for mass vaccination across the UK.An official spokesperson said, “The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.“To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area, so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.”The MHRA is currently analysing data from trials of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. The former is expected to be the mainstay of countering the virus in the UK, India and elsewhere due to its low cost and logistical ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-approves-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-from-next-week/story-G31avctGke48JtW1GxCmYL.html
02-12-2020||World||Wildfire risks might cause nearly million Californians to face blackouts||Nearly one million people in Southern California are facing blackouts as the state’s three biggest utilities weigh cutting power to prevent live wires from sparking fires during high winds.Edison International’s Southern California Edison warned it may need to shut off electricity to more than 230,000 homes and businesses in eight counties, the utility said on its website. That’s about 690,000 people based on the size of the average household, and would constitute the region’s largest public-safety blackout this year.Dry winds that can fan flames and knock power lines down are forecast to rattle Southern California through Friday, with the worst of it on Wednesday and Thursday, the National Weather Service said. California has already been charred by record fires that have burned 4.2 million acres and killed 31 people in 2020. Utilities including Edison and PG&E Corp. have cut power repeatedly to prevent live wires from falling into dry brush.Edison’s cuts could begin between late Wednesday and Friday, Edison spokesman Chris Abel said.Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility also warned Tuesday that 88,700 homes and businesses, or more than 260,000 people, could lose power Wednesday night or Thursday morning, and possibly remain in the dark through Sunday or Monday. Most affected customers would be in the mountains east of San Diego. PG&E, California’s largest utility, said it may cut power to about 600 homes and businesses in Kern County this week, as well.Last week, Edison cut power to thousands of customers on Thanksgiving during high winds. In 2019, PG&E filed for bankruptcy after its wires sparked the deadliest blaze in state history.The high winds and blackouts will be mostly confined to Southern California but could touch a portion of the state’s Central Valley as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-risks-might-cause-nearly-million-californians-to-face-blackouts/story-cgVYx59AHYz09eo7wBHnkN.html
02-12-2020||World||US should act to counter China’s subversion of UN, commission says in report to Congress||The US should take steps to counter China’s efforts to subvert the principles of the United Nations and its bodies, including preparing a report on Beijing’s actions to influence votes of UN members, an American commission has recommended in a new report submitted to Congress. The report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was submitted on Tuesday, comes against the backdrop of concerns in New Delhi and other world capitals about the outsize influence wielded by China in UN bodies at a time when the efforts to reform the world body have made little headway. The commission recommended the US Congress should direct the state department to produce annual reports “detailing China’s actions in the United Nations and its subordinate agencies that subvert the principles and purposes of the United Nations”. Such reports should document China’s actions that violate UN treaties and are meant to “influence the votes of United Nations members, including through coercive means”. Also read | China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to CongressThe reports should also list China’s actions to “nominate or support candidates for United Nations leadership positions that do not adhere to United Nations standards for impartiality or are subject to the influence of the Chinese government,” and actions by Chinese nationals and others holding UN positions who appear to support the Chinese government’s interests in violation of UN impartiality standards. The commission further recommended the reports should document actions by “Chinese military and support personnel engaged in United Nations peacekeeping operations that are inconsistent with the principles governing these missions, including China’s deployment of these personnel to protect its economic interests and improve the power projection capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army”. The commission was scathing in its analysis of China’s role at the UN, saying Beijing’s efforts to “transform global governance is really a call to change the UN system to bring it more in line with Beijing’s principles” and preferences. “Beijing has sought to bring international law and the UN’s definition of human rights more in line with its own interests by decreasing emphasis on individual rights. China is the second-largest donor to the UN after the United States: it provides 12 percent of the UN’s total budget, up from 1 percent 20 years ago. The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] seeks to use this as leverage to reduce funding for human rights-related functions such as human rights officers in peacekeeping missions,” the report said. Besides, China has sought to use UN legal instruments such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea for its own gain, and also exploits its influence over UN organisations to “promote specific Chinese foreign policy objectives, contrary to both the spirit and the letter of how the UN was intended to operate,” the commission said. Noting that Chinese officials currently hold the post of director general of four out of 15 UN specialised agencies – Food and Agriculture Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Telecommunications Union and United Nations Industrial Development Organization – the commission said these officials “violate UN standards of conduct and leverage the institutions they lead to promote China’s political objectives, such as policies concerning Taiwan”. China’s election to the UN Human Rights Council in October, albeit with fewer votes than in 2016, created concerns against the backdrop of developments in Xinjiang and Hong and its assertive actions in areas ranging from the South China Sea to Taiwan to Ladakh. In New Delhi, China is often seen as a key force stymieing reforms of the UN and the Security Council, including its expansion to include more permanent members such as India. China is the only P5 member that hasn’t backed India’s admission into a reformed and expanded Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-act-to-counter-china-s-subversion-of-un-commission-says-in-report-to-congress/story-IkuHeKNpx0B0uVDDHpIJAP.html
02-12-2020||World||The UK has approved one Covid-19 vaccine, here’s what happens next||Now that Britain has become the first western country to approve a Covid-19 shot, the spotlight shifts to the high-stakes rollout. Vaccinating the country’s roughly 67 million people won’t happen overnight. The UK has ordered enough doses of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to immunize 20 million people.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Who will get the vaccine first?The government plans to prioritize as it begins to deploy the vaccine, starting with residents and staff in care homes, then moving to people over 80 years old and health-care workers, documents show.Britain will immunize people throughout the wider population next, based on age and risk. The shot is expected to be available from next week.Where can people get it?In the UK, 50 hospitals are ready to administer the vaccine, followed by doctors and pharmacists, assuming they have the facilities needed to store the doses, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sky News Wednesday.The country has moved to expand the pool of people who can give the jabs beyond the National Health Service to other health professionals.Where is the vaccine at the moment?The vaccine is still at Pfizer’s production site in Puurs, Belgium. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said the doses will be made available starting next week.Can I get more than one vaccine?Not for now. The UK only cleared the one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, although a product using a similar technology from Moderna Inc. may also get approved soon.It may become possible to mix shots when other vaccines are approved. That should work for shots that target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, according to Andrew Pollard, who is leading the University of Oxford’s vaccine trial with AstraZeneca Plc. The three front-runners use the spike protein as a target, as do many others in clinical tests.Also Read | Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin: List of states which have started phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccineHow does the approved vaccine compare with others?The product relies on a technology called messenger RNA, which has never been used to make approved vaccines before. So does Moderna’s. Both showed they were more than 90% effective in clinical trials. The approach is designed to transform the body’s own cells into vaccine-making factories.The main difference is that the Pfizer-BioNTech product must be stored ultra-cold until a few days before it is used. Moderna’s vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days. Astra-Oxford’s jab importantly can be kept at refrigerator temperatures.How do we know the vaccine is safe?Pfizer and BioNTech tested the product in a clinical trial involving almost 44,000 people without observing severe side effects. The most common symptoms were fatigue and headaches.The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said on Wednesday that the vaccine “met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.” Hancock described the review as having been “rigorous,” not rushed.Monitoring safety will be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely, Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, said in an interview last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-uk-has-approved-a-vaccine-here-s-what-happens-next/story-zYiSgAg6zNU3qNcetMx66L.html
02-12-2020||World||UK first to approve Covid-19 vaccine; roll-out next week||The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve a Covid-19 vaccine - developed by Pfizer and BioNTech - with 800,000 doses due to be rolled out from next week.The UK’s regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), granted its approval after a thorough analysis of the data that was submitted to it on a rolling basis. Its analysis and decision on other vaccine candidates is expected in the near future.An official spokesperson said, “The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent MHRA to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for use. This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness… The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week.”The vaccine with 95% efficacy needs to be initially refrigerated at a temperature between minus 70 and 80 degrees Celsius, and administered in two doses, 21 days apart. Since hospitals have the infrastructure, it will be initially given to hospital staff and to vulnerable care-home residents.The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with 800,000 doses arriving from the company’s production base in Belgium next week. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the development as “fantastic” while a “thrilled” health secretary Matt Hancock reiterated his belief that normalcy would return by April. Johnson said, “It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.”Hancock, however, sounded a note of caution, asking Britons to see through the winter months by following restrictions until vaccines are rolled out on a wide scale. “We can’t lower our guard yet,” said Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer.Arrangements are being made by the National Health Service (NHS) for mass vaccination across the UK in the near future.The official spokesperson said, “The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes, and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.“To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area, so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.”The MHRA is currently analysing data from trials of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. The former is expected to be the mainstay of countering the virus in the UK, India and elsewhere due to its low cost and logistical ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-first-to-approve-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-next-week/story-OZyvSU4GIs3f4fvR7blVqO.html
02-12-2020||World||UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine: Who gets it first?||Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use and said that it will be rolled out from early next week.Britain had ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has set out how the vaccine will be rolled out around the country:- Britain will start vaccinating ordinary people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Pfizer’s manufacturing centre in Belgium. The speed of the rollout depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said.- The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.Also Watch l UK clears Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine, shots available from next week - Hancock said the vaccine will first go to the elderly, those in care homes and their carers, and to those who are clinically vulnerable.- Britain has established three routes to get the vaccine out to the country, a programme it has described as “challenging” because it needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.- 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, large vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities.- The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-approves-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-who-gets-it-first/story-aP3bSQtBh2YfSwBSGzm54I.html
02-12-2020||World||New NATO report suggests measures to counter ‘China’s growing importance’||The North Atlantic Treaty Organization took another step toward making China a strategic focal point after the alliance published a report stressing Chinese geopolitical threats.The study, from a group of experts assembled by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for the 30-nation NATO, includes recommendations on bolstering its political cohesion and ability to face new security challenges. China features prominently.“NATO must devote much more time, political resources and action to the security challenges posed by China -- based on an assessment of its national capabilities, economic heft, and the stated ideological goals of its leaders,” the experts said in the report released in Brussels on Tuesday. “It needs to develop a political strategy for approaching a world in which China will be of growing importance through to 2030.”The recommendations follow a series of high-profile splits in NATO. The organization has been shaken over the past four years by US President Donald Trump’s vocal demands for European countries to spend more on defense and his unilateral changes to the deployment of American troops abroad.“China’s coming closer to us, investing heavily in infrastructure in NATO countries in Europe,” Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday after the first part of a two-day video conference of the alliance’s foreign ministers. It’s the last such meeting for US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo as NATO waits for President-elect Joe Biden to take office Jan. 20 and anticipates smoother transatlantic ties.On Wednesday, in the first NATO event of its kind, the alliance’s foreign ministers will be joined by representatives of Asia-Pacific countries -- including Japan and Australia -- in an online session devoted to China.The Chinese government said it was committed to “peaceful development and win-win cooperation” with the rest of the world.“Our development advances will not pose a threat or challenge to anyone else,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. “We hope NATO will look at our development in an objective, positive and open way.”Political TensionsNATO was established 71 years ago to deter a Soviet Union that collapsed in 1991. It’s now focusing again on threats posed by Russia as a result of its renewed muscle-flexing, pursuing anti-terrorism policies taken up after the 2001 attacks in the US and seeking to adapt to the rise of China.In December 2019, a NATO summit for the first time mentioned challenges posed by China.In this context, the US-dominated alliance is trying to prevent a repeat of internal political tensions that boiled over in the wake of a Turkish incursion into northern Syria in October 2019 to challenge Kurdish forces.Turkey, which has NATO’s second-biggest army, received Trump’s approval for the military operation that European countries opposed. This prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to say a lack of strategic cooperation among NATO members showed the alliance was suffering a “brain death” -- a remark that irritated many countries in the alliance including Germany.The German government then pushed for NATO to create an expert group to advise member countries on future transatlantic security challenges -- a proposal endorsed by the alliance’s leaders at their meeting a year ago in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-nato-report-suggests-measures-to-counter-china-s-growing-importance/story-8CumAnhai41pFAsNKYYSIJ.html
02-12-2020||World||China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to Congress||The Chinese government had planned the clash with Indian troops in Galwan Valley in June, which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties, a US commission has concluded in a new report to Congress. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, in the report submitted on December 1, described the nearly eight-month-long India-China standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as the “most severe border crisis in decades”. Referring to the “massive physical brawl in the Galwan Valley” between People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Indian troops on June 15, the report said, “Some evidence suggested the Chinese government had planned the incident, potentially including the possibility for fatalities. For instance, several weeks prior to the clash, Defense Minister Wei [Fenghe] made his statement encouraging Beijing to ‘use fighting to promote stability’.” It added, “Satellite images depicted a large Chinese buildup in the Galwan Valley, including potentially 1,000 PLA soldiers, the week before the deadly skirmish.” Also read | India’s ban on 43 Chinese apps is the 4th strike since Ladakh standoffThe report further noted that just “over two weeks before the incident, in another potential indication of Chinese leaders signalling their intent to escalate tensions, an editorial in China’s state-owned tabloid Global Times warned that India would suffer a ‘devastating blow’ to its trade and economic ties with China if it got ‘involved in the US-China rivalry’”. The India-China border standoff emerged in the open after two clashes between troops of the two sides in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors of the LAC. The two countries have been unable to agree on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. There was no word from Indian officials on the report. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, described the report’s conclusion as significant and said: “The finding that the Galwan Valley clash was planned sounds plausible and echoes concerns that were expressed by Indian experts as far back as the summer – that all this isn’t happening by chance.” He added, “Such a report would be born of diligent research and the fact that it has been passed and presented shows it reflects bipartisan sentiment in the US. You don’t suddenly deploy tens of thousands of troops at the border without a plan or a strategy that has a certain purpose.” However, Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, said: “The evidence presented in the report is weak at best. While it remains possible that China expected and perhaps even provoked the deadly clash, this report brings us no closer to knowing if that was indeed the case.” The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission was created by the US Congress in 2000 with the mandate of monitoring and submitting an annual report on national security implications of trade and economic ties between Washington and Beijing. The latest report focused extensively on China’s assertive actions against Taiwan and Hong Kong, its strategic aims in Africa and the border standoff with India. The clash in Galwan Valley resulted in the first fatalities along the LAC since 1975 and the Indian leadership has said the incident had shaken the foundation of India-China ties based on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the disputed border. The US commission’s report said the clash in Galwan Valley “followed a series of standoffs beginning in early May along multiple sectors of the LAC” and led to “at least 20 Indian deaths and an unconfirmed number of Chinese casualties”. If China’s goal from its actions was “to acquire territory...[the Chinese government] might deem the moves a success”, the report said. “If Beijing intended to dissuade India from building infrastructure on its side of the LAC or warn it against aligning with the United States, however, ‘then the Chinese moves have been ineffective, if not counterproductive’,” the report added. The report also referred to the imposition of a draconian national security law in Hong Kong this year and said, “This action was one of many in 2020 – including border skirmishes with India, military exercises to intimidate Taiwan, and pressure on Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others – that demonstrated the Chinese government’s indifference to its reputation abroad.” The report also noted that China and India had engaged in “multiple physical clashes” along the LAC for decades, but since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012 the “two countries have seen five major altercations along their border”. China and India had engaged in “multiple physical clashes” along the LAC for decades, but since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, the “two countries have seen five major altercations along their border”, it said. “The exact motivations behind the Chinese government’s provocative behaviour on the LAC this year remain unclear. The proximate cause of the clash appeared to be India’s construction of a strategic access road to support troops stationed along the LAC. China has also built extensive infrastructure along the LAC in recent years,” the report said. In the aftermath of the June 15 clash, China “asserted sovereignty over the entire Galwan Valley, a new claim and significant change to the territorial status quo”, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-planned-galwan-valley-clash-us-commission-says-in-report-to-congress/story-yZEK4tFfdcDOhNvnLVzigN.html
02-12-2020||World||Trump threatens to veto defense bill over social media protections||President Donald Trump is threatening to veto a defense policy bill unless it ends protections for internet companies that shield them from being held liable for material posted by their users.On Twitter Tuesday night, Trump took aim at Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted — whether their complaint is legitimate or not.Trump called Section 230 “a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,” adding, “Therefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill.”Trump has been waging war against social media companies for months, claiming they are biased against conservative voices.In October he signed an executive order directing executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies.Since losing the presidential election, Trump has flooded social media with unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Twitter has tagged many such Trump tweets with the advisory, “This claim about election fraud is disputed.”Tuesday’s veto threat is another potential roadblock for the passage of the annual defense policy measure, which is already being held up in Congress by a spat over military bases named for Confederate officers. The measure, which has passed for 59 years in a row on a bipartisan basis, guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-to-veto-defense-bill-over-social-media-protections/story-EqtHKS8inqP1KFdp46vLhI.html

02-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron on the defensive as pressure mounts over police abuse||Emmanuel Macron’s government is holding its line over police violence despite mounting criticism from civil society and parliamentarians.The tense relationship between the police and the public, and minority communities in particular, is becoming a major issue in France with the 42-year-old president pushing for tougher legislation as part of a drive to improve security and crack down on crime. Macron was forced to retreat from plans to make it harder for people to post images of the police on social media after protests on Saturday drew huge crowds -- as many as 300,000 by some estimates.In the days before the demonstration, a video showing three officers beating Black music producer Michel Zecler at the entrance of his Paris studio lent credence to those arguing that such footage has a role to play in holding the police to account and exposing abuses.Questioned by a Senate committee in Paris on Tuesday, National Police Director General Frederic Veaux, said the French police force doesn’t have a problem with racism or violence.“By saying this, I’m not in denial or stonewalling, I’m describing what I see and what I hear,” he said.The police chief condemned violent incidents and said those responsible were harshly sanctioned. Violence against police agents and their families meanwhile is on the rise, he said, echoing recent comments by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin.Speaking to the National Assembly on Monday evening, Darmanin blamed the attack on the music producer on “individual behavior” while acknowledging shortcomings in the training of officers.“I do not share the view that there is a divorce between the police and the population,” he said.Three officers were charged late on Sunday, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues into the alleged assault of Zecler.Government U-TurnOn Monday, the French government announced that it will rewrite Article 24 of the “global security law” that would have made it a crime punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($54,000) fine to publish the face or any other identifying feature of a police officer with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.”In announcing the complete rewriting of article, Christophe Castaner, head of Macron’s ruling party in the parliament, insisted the aim remains to better protect the police and to defend freedom of the press both for professional journalists and for citizens posting images on social media.“France should be the country of no violence or any infringement of any freedom whatsoever,” he said.Macron has been trying to position himself as the law and order candidate in a country where campaigning for presidential elections in two years time has already begun.In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 16 beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant he saw a bounce the polls, but enthusiasm for his tough stance was short lived and Macron is now under fire on multiple fronts as he tries to respond to the resurgence of jihadism and contain the spread of the coronavirus.His approval rating has dropped by 5 points to 41, according to a recent Ifop poll, with a 17 point fall among those aged under 25 years.Macron had sought to douse the anger over the video on Friday, asking his government to come up with proposals to restore the public confidence in the police. He said the beating “shames us,” and condemned violence both against and by the police, but he and Darmanin have repeatedly denied systemic racism with the security forces.The French leader himself will give an interview on Thursday to Brut -- an online channel that addresses young people.(Updates with comments from National Police General Director in 4th- 7th paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-on-the-defensive-as-pressure-mounts-over-police-abuse/story-urVg8XNCuIDo9e8NAsW1wL.html

Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, in turn, did not rule out that the vaccine developers would present it at the UN headquarters.“On Wednesday, December 2, a presentation of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will take place. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriyev will take part in the event,” Strzhizhovsky said.He said a virtual event entitled “Sputnik V: Vaccine Against Covid-19” will be held on the sidelines of a special session of the UN General Assembly. During the meeting, detailed information on the Russian vaccine will be presented.In August, Russia’s Health Ministry registered the world’s first vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19, developed by the Gamaleya Research Centre. It was named Sputnik V. The vaccine is based on a well-studied and validated human adenoviral vector platform, the important benefits of which are safety, efficacy and no long-term adverse effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-permanent-mission-health-ministry-to-present-sputnik-v-at-un/story-KdfGHGKfF8x21EW3SjwB3J.html
02-12-2020||World||Poll shows more Canadians see India as an opportunity, China as a threat||There is an increase in the number of Canadians viewing India’s growing economic power as an opportunity, while more and more of them now see China’s rise in the domain as a threat. These are among the findings of a national opinion poll conducted by the Vancouver-headquartered non-profit Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada).The organisation that strives to be a bridge between Canada and the Asia-Pacific region has been tracking Canadian attitudes towards the economic rise of India and China since 2004. “Between 2018 and 2020, the change in perceptions for China and India has followed opposing paths, something we have not observed before. While 72% of Canadians agree that the growing economic power of India is more of an opportunity than a threat, a modest increase since 2018 (71%), only 35% of Canadians agree that the growing economic power of China is more as an opportunity than a threat, down from 60% in 2018,” the results of the annual survey revealed.This is the also the first time that the survey has shown the majority of respondents seeing China’s economic power as a threat, at 57%. Again, the perception towards India is headed towards a positive direction with just 18% seeing its economic growth as a threat, which the APF Canada described as “an all-time low”.Canadians’ general feeling towards India has also remained stable. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 means “very warm, favourable”, India scores 5.7. “Over the past decade, the governments of India and Canada have been making efforts to build a mutually beneficial relationship, which can only prosper further if the Canadian public also holds a positive view,” the report noted. “On the flip side, Canadians’ feelings towards China, which had been remarkably stable for the past decade until 2018, dropped from 4.9 to 3.6 in 2020.”The survey said there was support for Canada entering into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, though that was not the case with regard to China. Just about one-third voiced support for an FTA with China, which 59%. “It marks the lowest support for an FTA with China since we started polling Canadians on the subject in 2012,” the report stated.One of reasons behind the growing animosity of Canadians’ towards China is the Covid-19 pandemic. Two-third of Canadians disagreed with the statement that the Chinese government “acted responsibly” at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan. The vast majority, at 68%, “feel that Canada should support an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 virus”.Human rights abuses and the arrest and detention of two Canadians by the Chinese government are also feeding into the escalating negativity. “The majority of Canadians (83%) feel that Canada should stand up to China as Canadian national values such as the rule of law, human rights, and democracy are on the line,” the report pointed out, while “67% think Canada should work alongside the US and other allies to pressure China, and about 67% also believe Canada should take a more aggressive approach towards China” to liberate the two imprisoned there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poll-shows-canadians-see-india-as-an-opportunity-china-as-a-threat/story-0ifQm2S1tbIuL1XllvrqAJ.html
02-12-2020||World||Joe Biden closes in on top health leaders as Covid-19 ravages US||President-elect Joe Biden’s front-runner for secretary of Health and Human Services is New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, and he may announce several of his administration’s health leaders as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The position of HHS secretary is down to two possibilities, the people said, between Lujan Grisham and former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a co-chair of the coronavirus advisory board Biden appointed shortly after he was elected.Biden’s health team will assume office with the US still suffering from the pandemic, as virus cases and hospitalizations soared over the past month. His health secretary is expected to have input on filling other top health posts, such as FDA commissioner and the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the people said, so those appointments may not be announced until later.The Health and Human Services secretary will have the tough task of rebuilding Obamacare, which Biden has promised to expand. That will be a difficult undertaking with a Republican-led Senate.Murthy or Jeff Zients, who led the Obama administration effort to repair healthcare.gov, the faulty Obamacare website, may be named to a leadership role on the pandemic, according to the people familiar with the matter -- a “Covid-19 czar.”Mandy Cohen, the North Carolina state health secretary, is a favorite for CMS, the people said. Biden’s choices to lead the Food and Drug Administration appear narrowed down to David Kessler, a former commissioner of the agency who is another co-chair of his coronavirus advisory board, and Joshua Sharfstein, a former FDA official who is a vice dean at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.Biden announced his economic team on Tuesday, a group led by Treasury Secretary-designate Janet Yellen whose top priority will be restoring jobs eliminated by the pandemic. An announcement on some of his health team could come as soon as Monday, the people said.The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because talks are still ongoing and no final decision has been made. It’s not clear how many people will be announced at once, or which positions would later be filled by the health secretary once the Biden administration is in place.Biden’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US recorded 158,000 new coronavirus infections on Monday and a record 205,000 cases three days earlier. Biden will take office as distribution of coronavirus vaccines ramps up, and he has warned that any delay in the transition to his administration could slow or complicate that endeavor.Lujan Grisham is seen as having an easier path to confirmation than Murthy, who has spoken out against gun violence as a public health threat and may draw strong opposition from Senate Republicans as a result, the people familiar with the matter said.Also Read | Joe Biden urges Congress to pass ‘robust package’ to deal with economic crisisIf he isn’t nominated to lead HHS, Murthy is under consideration as Covid-19 czar or another role, including a second stint as surgeon general, the people said. Murthy talks to Biden almost every day as co-chair of his advisory board and is seen as having influential supporters.Murthy and Zients have also represented Biden’s transition team on calls with current HHS officials, two of the people said.Biden’s team is still discussing what the White House coronavirus task force and Operation Warp Speed -- the Trump administration’s effort to fast-track vaccines -- will look like under the new administration.If Biden announces his health team next week, he may be just days ahead of the first emergency FDA approval of a coronavirus vaccine. President Donald Trump is planning a vaccine summit next week at the White House, while an FDA advisory panel is scheduled to meet on Dec 10 to discuss the shots.Vice President Mike Pence told governors this week that the vaccines could start being delivered as soon as the week of Dec 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-closes-in-on-top-health-leaders-as-covid-19-ravages-us/story-xN7nJtKZuC5ibAicepVsFL.html
02-12-2020||World||Chinese defence minister’s visit to Nepal, Pakistan made with eye on India, say experts||China’s actions during its defence minister’s recent visits to Nepal and Pakistan, including the signing of a defence agreement in Islamabad, were apparently made with an eye on India, experts and former diplomats said on Wednesday. Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe began his tour of the region with a day-long visit on Sunday to Nepal, where he told the leadership in Kathmandu that China “firmly supports Nepal to safeguard the national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Wei’s next port of call was Pakistan, where the two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoU) for enhancing defence cooperation. Wei met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and discussed regional security and expressed appreciation for Islamabad’s efforts to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). ALSO WATCH | ‘Faulty’: CSIR chief slams Chinese study on Covid’s Indian origin claims Bajwa too thanked Wei for China’s support to Pakistan on all key issues at regional and international forums. Experts and former diplomats believe these actions were taken by China clearly with an eye on the dragging border standoff with India, which is currently in its eighth month with little sign of an immediate breakthrough in the disengagement of troops and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash, who closely tracks developments in the neighbourhood, said Wei’s visit to Nepal came at a time when relations between Kathmandu and New Delhi were returning to normal after a border row over Nepal’s new political map that included Indian territories. “China was letting Pakistan and Nepal know it is still with them and this was also a message to India,” Prakash said. The experts said Wei’s remarks about China helping Nepal protect its territorial integrity clearly appeared to have been made with the India-Nepal border row in mind, especially when the two countries are making efforts to tackle the issue. “We had a number of good visits to Nepal, including by the Indian Army chief and foreign secretary, and the relationship was on the mend. The Chinese want to keep Nepal attuned to Beijing’s priorities and within the Chinese orbit. They also want to keep the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) intact,” Prakash said, referring to rifts within Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s ruling party. China’s envoy to Nepal has often publicly interceded to iron out differences between Oli and his main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, pointed to India’s outreach in recent months to key neighbours such as Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal – including several major development and connectivity projects and high-level visits – and said Wei’s visits to Kathmandu and Islamabad were meant to counter these efforts. “At a time when China is also facing criticism for its role in tackling Covid-19 in the initial stages, it wants to send out a message that it hasn’t vacated its space in India’s neighbourhood. China couldn’t send a senior minister, so sending a key general is the best case approach to ensure those who it believes are on its side remain there,” Patil said. Prakash added, “In Islamabad, the Chinese clearly wanted to add some steel to Pakistan’s spine. Besides, the Chinese have concerns about the pace of implementation of projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including CPEC, and they’re leaning on Gen Bajwa to ensure it remains on course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-defence-minister-s-visit-to-nepal-pakistan-made-with-eye-on-india-say-experts/story-wuDC90A4TXWA0znGrLOCtI.html

02-12-2020||World||World leaders to address special session of UNGA on Covid-19 pandemic||World leaders, the top leadership of the UN and vaccine developers will address a two-day, special session of the UN General Assembly on Covid-19 this week and discuss the pandemic’s impact as well as the multi-faceted, coordinated response required to address the greatest global health crisis in decades. The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in Response to the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic will take place on December 3 and 4 at the UN Headquarters. The world organisation said government leaders, United Nations’ principals and other relevant stakeholders would be able to engage in dialogue on the impact of the pandemic on people, societies and economies and discuss the multi-faceted, coordinated response required to address this crisis. Serum Institute of India Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla will also address the session through a pre-recorded video on December 4. BioNTech co-founders Ugur Şahin and Ozlem Tureci, vaccine team leader at Oxford University Sarah Gilbert and Chief Executive Officer of GAVI (the vaccine alliance) Seth Berkley will address the special session virtually. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are working on a Covid-19 vaccine, while global drugmaker Pfizer and BioNTech announced their vaccine candidate is 95 per cent effective. World leaders expected to address the session are Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, French President Emmanuel Macron, Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. President Donald Trump is not listed as a speaker for the session and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar will address the high-level meeting. The two-day special session will allow many stakeholders to share their experiences in fighting the pandemic, reflect on the global response to date, and forge a united, coordinated, and people-centered path forward. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and infected more than 54 million people globally, “is not only the greatest global health crisis since the creation of the United Nations 75 years ago, it is also a humanitarian, socio-economic, security and human rights crisis,” the world body said. The session’s first day will feature statements by the President of the General Assembly Volkan Bozkir, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President of the Security Council for the month of December South African Ambassador Jerry Matthews Matjila and Chair of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev. The General Assembly will then hear from world leaders. According to the speakers list, there are 141 speakers inscribed, including 53 heads of state, 39 heads of government, four deputy prime ministers and 38 ministers. The second day will feature speeches from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other UN and inter-governmental agencies. Bozkir’s Spokesperson Brenden Varma, replying to a question on whether it was far too late to hold the special session on Covid-19, said the President of the General Assembly agrees that it is already too late to have this meeting, which should have been held in the summer as the coronavirus cases were rapidly increasing across the world. Varma said member states have come together and decided to hold this special session on Covid-19. “And the point of this is to recommit to multilateralism,” he said. Currently there are a lot of responses to Covid-19, but the point of the session is to bring countries together, along with UN actors, the private sector and vaccine developers to work together to see “where we are, to take stock and to identify gaps and challenges and then to move forward together so we have a unified response that actually makes sense and that can actually combat this pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-to-address-special-session-of-unga-on-covid-19-pandemic/story-MqfNIIJS13HuGuG5cexUNO.html

Trump teases 2024 run at White House Christmas party||President Donald Trump teased running again for president in 2024 as he hosted a holiday reception at the White House on Tuesday evening.“It’s been an amazing four years,” Trump told the crowd, which included many Republican National Committee members. “We’re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years.”The video of Trump’s appearance was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee, Pam Pollard, who is national committeewoman for the Oklahoma GOP. It showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks.The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors — violating the very public health guidance the U.S. government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of COVID-19 skyrocket across the country.In the video, Trump is heard continuing to air baseless allegations of election fraud to explain his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden despite his attorney general, William Barr, telling the AP earlier Tuesday that the Justice Department had not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud and had seen nothing that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.“It’s certainly an unusual year. We won an election. But they don’t like that,” Trump told the group, adding: “I call it a rigged election, and I always will.”The White House has been the site of at least one suspected COVID-19 superspreader event, and dozens of the president’s aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, “while providing the safest environment possible.” She said that would include smaller guest lists, that “masks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.”“Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” she added.___Miller reported from Wilmington, Del.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-again-trump-teases-2024-run-at-white-house-christmas-party/story-GtMsJqGHTOfAG0C641FgNL.html
02-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s H-1B visa rule that hurt Indians scrapped by US judge||A US judge on Tuesday threw out two rules proposed by the Trump administration to narrow eligibility for H-1B visa aspirants and raise their salaries in an effort to make it tougher for companies, mostly in IT, to use this short-term employment programme to hire foreigner workers instead of local Americans.US district judge Jeffrey S. White of the Northern District of California ruled that the changes were introduced in a hurry and did not abide by the usual transparency obligations: provide notice and sufficient time for public comments. The administration had sought to rush it through in October arguing urgency - as a “good cause exception” - in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The court cannot countenance - reluctantly or otherwise - defendants’ reliance on the Covid-19 pandemic to invoke the good-cause exception,” White wrote. “The pandemic’s impact on the economy is the only reason DHS proffered as good cause, and defendants do not dispute that the failure to provide notice and comment was prejudicial.”ALSO WATCH | US President Donald Trump says ‘2020 election was probably least secure ever’ The United States issues 85,000 new H-1B visa every year. More than 70% of them go to Indian professionals hired by American companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and Indian IT services companies such as TCS, Wipro and Infosys.Many of them tend to stay on and graduate to permanent residency, or Green Cards, and eventually citizenship - such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who came to the US to study on an F-1 visa, got hired by McKinsey on H-1B and went on to become a US citizen via the mandatory Green Card.“This ruling has many companies across various industries breathing a huge sigh of relief today,” said Jon Baselice, director of immigration policy for the US Chamber of Commerce in a statement. “Both of these rules had the potential to be incredibly disruptive to the operations of many businesses.”Among those breathing easier will be people at Nasscom, which represents Indian IT companies, some of whom have built substantial operations in the US using H-1B visas to bring workers from India. “These regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counterproductive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs,” it had said when the administration announced the new rules in October.In October, the administration announced two rules. One of them went into effect immediately – it raised salaries for H-1B to match those of Americans workers with similar qualifications, which was intended to deny companies from hiring foreign workers only because they were cheaper.The second rule was to go into effect after some days. It sought to narrow the eligibility for H-1B aspirants. A basic bachelor’s degree in anything wouldn’t be enough. For instance, a foreigner being hired for a job in computer engineering had to be a computer engineer.The Trump administration has had the H-1B programme in its crosshairs from the president’s first year in office, when he announced his “Buy American, Hire American” policies.Critics of the programme that allows two tranches of three-year work permits to principal H-1B visa holders and work authorisation for spouses, have argued that companies have used it to replace American workers with foreigners on lower salaries. The Trump administration agreed. While it tried to change the system incrementally, it accelerated them and with more far-reaching changes after Covid-19 struck early this year, causing widespread job losses. Trump suspended the programme and immigration to ensure Americans have the first shot at jobs becoming available as the economy recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-strikes-down-donald-trump-s-rules-narrowing-h-1b-eligibility/story-BZTyzup99fIHx1RGx5556K.html

An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,” Ardern told lawmakers in parliament. After an hour-long debate, a majority of parliamentarians voted in favour of the declaration. The main opposition National Party voted against it saying it was nothing but “virtue signalling”.New Zealand joins 32 other countries including Japan, Canada, France and Britain that have declared a climate emergency.Ardern, who returned to power in October delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century, has called climate change the “nuclear free moment of our generation”.Also Read | New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China’s tweetIn her first term she passed a Zero Carbon Bill, which sets the framework for net zero emissions by 2050 with an exemption for farming, and banned new offshore oil and gas exploration.Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mainly methane.The government on Wednesday promised the public sector will achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Government agencies would have to measure and report emissions and offset any they can’t cut by 2025.The programme will be backed by a NZ$200 million ($141 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help purchase electric or hybrid vehicles, it said.Greenpeace welcomed the declaration, but challenged the government to follow through with policy and action.“For Jacinda Ardern’s climate emergency declaration to be more than just words, that means tackling New Zealand’s largest source of climate pollution: agriculture,” said Greenpeace agriculture and climate campaigner Kate Simcock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-declares-climate-emergency-promises-carbon-neutral-government-by-2025/story-3eYCH0DzLnfMzgJkRy09zM.html

Since Nov. 17, more than 1,000 cases have been reported, only a few of which were brought from outside the city.That is prompting the government to raise penalties for failing to follow orders on mask wearing in public and for compulsory tests.Exceptions were made for some group gatherings, including a limit of 20 people for weddings and shareholder meetings, but religious activities and group travel would no longer be exempt.Hong Kong and Singapore, meanwhile, have called off a planned travel bubble until next year in response to the surge in Hong Kong cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-limits-most-gatherings-to-2-people-amid-surge-in-covid-cases/story-HMNxaG0FDJZtboHyOTTRAJ.html
02-12-2020||World||William Barr disputes Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud||US Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said the justice department has found no evidence of widespread voting fraud to change the outcome of the 2020 election, delivering a big blow to President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat citing unfounded claims of poll fraud.Barr is a close Trump ally and has repeated and defended all of the president’s wild claims and allegations in the past. His clean chit on the elections was seen, therefore, as a stunning repudiation of his boss’s efforts to question it. He was seen at the White House after his remarks became public, but had his job intact till late in the evening.The attorney general told AP in an interview that department of justice prosecutors and FBI agents had followed up specific poll fraud complaints and information they had received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election”.The attorney general also told AP he had named US attorney Bill Durham as special counsel to investigate the investigators of the 2016 election, allegations of Russian interference and collusion by the president or his campaign. As US attorney, a political appointee, he would have been removed by the Biden administration, but not as special counsel.Barr’s remarks were consistent with the assessment by the department of homeland security’s top election security official, Christopher Krebs, who said the “2020 election was the most secure in US history”. Trump subsequently fired him.President Trump himself hadn’t reacted publicly to Barr’s remarks. But his attorney Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis hit back in a statement, saying “there hasn’t been any semblance of a department of justice investigation” and that the lawyers had “gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined”.They have been unable to prove any of this so-called evidence in any court of law despite having filed more than three dozen lawsuits along with Republican allies.Seemingly undeterred by being fact-checked by his attorney general, Trump tweeted out a stream of TV clips of so-called witnesses speaking about election fraud at briefings and one legislative hearing that they claimed to have seen or experienced personally, which have failed, once again, to withstand scrutiny in court.President-elect Joe Biden, on the other hand, has continued to put together his administration publicly unaffected by Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. He introduced his economic team comprising Janet Yellen and Neera Tanden, picks for treasury secretary and director of the office of management and budget respectively, in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again,” Biden said while introducing his team. “We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country - the middle-class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/william-barr-disputes-donald-trump-s-claims-of-election-fraud/story-AM5IYU24h9jhYMC2SvOXMP.html

Mr. President-elect, I know you’ve done the same. I saw that understanding during the last Great Recession and the Recovery Act that followed,” Yellen said. “And now we are facing historic crises again,” she said, adding the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout have caused much damage to American people and had a disproportionate impact “on the most vulnerable among us”. “Lost lives. Lost jobs. Small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good. So many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent,” she said.Also Read| US Election 2020: Meet the ‘trailblazers’ of Joe Biden’s economic team“It’s an American tragedy,” she added. “And it’s essential that we move with urgency.

Stagnant wages, especially for workers who lack a college education.” Biden said no one is better prepared to deal with this crisis than Yellen. “She will be the first Treasury Secretary who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Janet is one of the most important economic thinkers of our time,” he said.“She has spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work.

He said police on the scene issued him a verbal warning and took him home.Belgian newspaper HLN and other media reported on Tuesday that police had disrupted a sex party attended by 25 people above a café, and that one attendee, a Fidesz MEP, had attempted to flee the scene but was apprehended. HLN said several diplomats were also present.The newspaper did not name the lawmaker but said he had resigned on Sunday — when Szajer stepped down.The Brussels prosecutor’s office confirmed to The Associated Press that police ended a lockdown party in a downtown Brussels flat on Friday evening after they were called because of a night-time disturbance. The office did not confirm that it was a group sex party and a Brussels police spokeswoman declined to comment.In a statement, the prosecutor’s office later said police found about 20 people in the apartment. After police checked their identities, two partygoers invoked diplomatic immunity,The prosecutor’s office added that a third man was arrested after a passer-by told police he tried to escape. Only identified as S.J., the man was unable to show I.D. and was escorted to his residence, where he produced a diplomatic passport.“The man’s hands were bloody. It is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing,” the prosecutor’s office said, adding that police found drugs in his backpack.All those who attended the party have been reported for violating anti-COVID measures banning social gatherings. In addition, a police report has been registered against S.J. for violation of the narcotics legislation.Szajer denied using drugs at the party, and said he offered to have an on-the-spot drug test taken, which police declined.“Police said an ecstasy pill was found. It’s not mine, I don’t know who placed it or how,” Szajer said in his statement.It was the latest in a series of scandals involving members of Fidesz, which has vocally heralded Hungary’s role in defending Christian family values. Hungary’s prime minister and head of Fidesz, Viktor Orban, is a prominent critic of the liberal political culture of Western Europe, and has laid his political power on a foundation of what he calls “illiberal” Christian democracy.Szajer, a Fidesz founding member, was one of the lead architects of Hungary’s new constitution in 2011, which was criticized by opponents for emblazoning conservative Christian ideology.In July, a Budapest court sentenced Fidesz member and former Hungarian ambassador to Peru Gabor Kaleta to a one-year suspended prison sentence and fined him for possessing more than 19,000 sexually explicit images of minors.In 2019, video was leaked of Fidesz politician Zsolt Borkai participating in an orgy on a yacht in the Adriatic Sea. Borkai, the mayor of a medium-sized city 70 miles from the capital of Budapest, was re-elected that month despite the scandal, and Fidesz said it considered the issue “a private matter.”In his statement Tuesday, Szajer apologized for breaking Belgian rules limiting social gatherings.“It was irresponsible on my part and I will suffer the penalties,” he wrote.___Petrequin reported from Brussels.

The samples, collected by the American Red Cross, were sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing to detect if there were antibodies against the virus.“The findings of this report suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infections may have been present in the US in December 2019, earlier than previously recognized,” the paper said.Reports of a mysterious pneumonia spreading in Wuhan, China, first emerged in late December 2019. After multiplying rapidly throughout the city in the following weeks, the disease spread across the globe, with the first US case emerging on Jan. 19.The revelations in the paper by researchers from the CDC reinforce the growing understanding that the coronavirus was silently circulating worldwide earlier than known, and could re-ignite debate over the origins of the pandemic.Also Read: United States: CDC to shorten Covid-19 quarantine to 10 days, 7 with testIt’s not the first evidence showing the virus could have existed or infected people outside China before 2020. A patient in France was found to have contracted the virus after being hospitalized with flu-like symptoms at the end of December, contradicting official statistics showing Covid-19 reached the country from people returning from Wuhan at the end of January.The CDC study indicated there were isolated infections in the western part of the US in mid-December. Antibodies were also found in early January in other states before the virus was known to have been introduced to those places.The scientists indicated it’s unlikely that the antibodies developed to curb other coronaviruses, as 84 samples were found to have neutralizing activity specific to SARS-CoV-2.They also noted it wasn’t possible to determine the magnitude of infections on a state or national level based on the samples, or whether the cases were locally transmitted or travel-related.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-found-in-us-in-2019-weeks-before-china/story-n6O2m35NgG1ErF0oPKO4AJ.html
02-12-2020||World||United States: CDC to shorten Covid-19 quarantine to 10 days, 7 with test||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to shorten the recommended length of quarantine after exposure to someone who is positive for Covid-19, as the virus rages across the nation.According to a senior administration official, the new guidelines, which are set to be released as soon as Tuesday evening, will allow people who have come in contact to someone infected with the virus to resume normal activity after 10 days, or 7 days if they receive a negative test result. That’s down from the 14-day period recommended since the onset of the pandemic.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement, said the policy change has been discussed for some time, as scientists have studied the incubation period for the virus. The policy would hasten the return to normal activities by those deemed to be “close contacts” of those infected with the virus, which has infected more than 13.5 million Americans and killed at least 270,000.While the CDC had said the incubation period for the virus was thought to extend to 14 days, most individuals became infectious and developed symptoms between 4 and 5 days after exposure.It’s not the first time that the CDC has adjusted its guidance for the novel coronavirus as it adjusted to new research. In July the agency shortened, from 14 days to 10, its advice on how long a person should stay in isolation after they first experience Covid symptoms — provided they’re no longer sick.The new guidance was presented Tuesday at a White House coronavirus task force meeting for final approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-cdc-to-shorten-covid-19-quarantine-to-10-days-7-with-test/story-ZbEv8eFHoG03kOVR6Tfi0M.html
02-12-2020||World||Judge throws out Trump administration rules limiting skilled-worker visas||A federal judge on Tuesday struck down two Trump administration rules designed to drastically curtail the number of visas issued each year to skilled foreign workers.The changes applying to the H-1B visa program announced in October include imposing salary requirements on companies employing skilled overseas workers and limits on specialty occupations. Department of Homeland Security officials deemed it a priority because of coronavirus-related job losses and estimated as many as one-third of those who have applied for H-1B’s in recent years would be denied under the new rules.US District Judge Jeffrey White in California said the government didn’t follow transparency procedures and its contention that the changes were an emergency response to pandemic job losses didn’t hold water because the Trump administration has floated the idea for some time but only published the rules in October.“The Covid-19 pandemic is an event beyond defendants’ control, yet it was within defendants’ control to take action earlier than they did,” White wrote.The US issues up to 85,000 H-1B visas each year in sectors including technology, engineering and medicine. Usually, they’re issued for three years and renewable. Most of the nearly 600,000 H-1B visa holders in the US are from India and China.The H-1B rules announced weeks before the election were part of President Donald Trump’s wider agenda to curb nearly all forms of immigration. In June, he issued an order temporarily suspending the H-1B program until the end of the year.The US Chamber of Commerce and universities including the California Institute of Technology sued in California, arguing there wasn’t adequate notice or time for the public to comment on the changes. They also said the rules, particularly related to requiring a prevailing wage for visa-holders, would have a drastic impact on new hires and “sever the employment relationship of hundreds of thousands of existing employees in the United States.” The University of Utah cited an example where an H-1B employee seeking renewal was paid an $80,000 salary but would have to be paid $208,000 under the new rule.The judge agreed that the federal government didn’t make a case for implementing the rules under the Administrative Procedure Act, which makes agencies accountable to the public by requiring a detailed process for enacting regulations.“Defendants failed to show there was good cause to dispense with the rational and thoughtful discourse that is provided by the APA’s notice and comment requirements,” White wrote.The rule on wages, proposed by the Department of Labor, took effect in October, while the Homeland Security rule on occupations and other issues was supposed to take effect Monday. It also would have placed limits on “offsite” firms that employ and contract out H-1B visa holders to other companies; their visas would have been limited to one year at a time.“This is incredibly important decision to preserve the H-1B program,” said attorney Paul Hughes, who represented the plaintiffs. “This ruling enables those individuals to maintain their jobs and their families in the United States.” The Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that the ruling “has many companies across various industries breathing a huge sigh of relief,” with the visa changes having “the potential to be incredibly disruptive to the operations of many businesses.” Messages left Tuesday for spokespeople with the Labor and Homeland Security departments weren’t immediately returned.The wage rule has prompted at least two other federal lawsuits in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-throws-out-trump-administration-rules-limiting-skilled-worker-visas/story-WhtFgmltMNQYfy37oBmffN.html
02-12-2020||World||No evidence of widespread voter fraud, says US attorney general William Barr||U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in last month’s election, even as President Donald Trump kept up his flailing legal efforts to reverse his defeat.“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,” Barr, a Trump appointee widely seen as loyal to the Republican president, told the Associated Press.Barr told federal prosecutors last month to pursue investigations into credible allegations of election fraud, but warned them to avoid probes into “fanciful or far-fetched claims.” Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by 306 to 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College that chooses the president - the same margin that Trump declared a “landslide” when he won four years ago - as well as by more than 6.2 million ballots in the popular vote.Despite that, Trump has continued to claim loudly and without evidence that the election was marred by widespread fraud. Those claims that have been repeatedly rejected by state and federal officials.The Trump campaign’s legal team responded to Barr’s comments by saying the Justice Department did not do enough to investigate allegations of voter fraud. Trump’s campaign has had no success advancing election-fraud claims in court, but his continued complaints appear to have yielded political benefit as polls show a large percentage of Republicans now believe the election was not conducted fairly.A top election official in Georgia implored Trump to stop his baseless claims, saying they were leading to threats and potential acts of violence against him and other authorities.“Someone’s going to get hurt, someone’s going to get shot, someone’s going to get killed,” said Gabriel Sterling, manager for the state’s voting systems. “It has all gone too far. ... It has to stop.”In Wisconsin, Trump’s campaign asked the state’s top court to consider throwing out 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information. Biden won that battleground state by about 20,000 votes. CORONAVIRUS AID Biden, for his part, has focused on setting up his administration before he takes office on Jan. 20. On Tuesday, he urged Congress to pass a coronavirus aid package that has been stalled for months, and promised more action to help the economy after he becomes president.At its peak over the summer, expanded federal unemployment benefits funneled some $12 billion weekly into individual bank accounts, money that propped up spending, padded savings and fueled rehiring. But those benefits are expiring by the end of this year, prompting calls for a more extended safety net while a coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress should include a fresh wave of stimulus in a spending bill that must be passed by Dec. 11. Separately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion relief bill aimed at breaking the deadlock.Biden said any such package passed by Congress before he takes over next month would be “at best just a start.” “My transition team is already working on what I’ll put forward in the next Congress to address the multiple crises we’re facing, especially our economic and COVID crises,” Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.He was speaking alongside his selections for senior economic roles, including his nominee for Treasury secretary, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who said the pandemic and economic damage it caused in the United States was “an American tragedy.” Yellen would be the first female Treasury secretary.Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. Economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein would also serve on that council, which advises the president on economic policy.Biden has also chosen Neera Tanden, who heads the Center for American Progress think tank, to head the Office of Management and Budget. She would be the first woman of color to hold that post.The economic team’s makeup reinforces Biden’s view that a more aggressive approach to the economic recovery from the pandemic is required. Yellen, Rouse and Tanden would require Senate confirmation, and several Republicans in that chamber have said they oppose Tanden’s nomination. Control of the Senate will be decided in a pair of runoff election in Georgia on Jan. 5.The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with more than 4 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.

02-12-2020||World||Republican Nikki Haley slams Joe Biden’s immigration policy||Republican politician Nikki Haley Tuesday slammed President-elect Joe Biden’s immigration policy claiming it will hurt American workers and “insult” legal immigrants. “Biden’s immigration policies will create another border crisis that will undermine the rule of law, hurt American workers, and insult the legal immigrants who did the right thing,” Indian-American Haley said in a series of tweets.“It’s one more reason why America needs a conservative-led Senate to stop Biden’s plan in its tracks,” she said, seeking votes for two Republican Senators in the Georgia Senate race next month. The Republican Party currently has 50 Senators in the 100-member Senate, while the Democrats has 48.A Republican majority in the Senate along with the two wins in Georgia Senate race is essential for the party to maintain its hold in the national politics. The party has lost control of the White House and the House of Representatives.“Biden has promised to reverse the Trump admin’s immigration policies, halt all deportations, & introduce amnesty legislation for illegal immigrants on day 1,” Haley said.“The amnesty bill would send a clear signal to people across the world: Come to America illegally & get rewarded for it,” said the former two-term Governor of South Carolina. She was the first ever Cabinet-ranking official in any administration after President Donald Trump nominated her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations.A day earlier, Haley in a series of tweets was critical of the foreign policies of President-elect Biden.“Biden stated he wanted to return to the disastrous Iran deal that he helped orchestrate as VP. The Trump administration’s foreign policy made the Middle East safer & more secure. It would be a huge mistake for Biden to go running back into the arms of Iran’s ayatollahs,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-nikki-haley-slams-joe-biden-s-immigration-policy/story-kU7HLeqDH0MCS1A4ujnAHJ.html
02-12-2020||World||US to prepare for swift vaccine roll out as Covid cases surge||US officials on Tuesday unveiled plans to begin vaccinating millions of Americans against Cpvid-19 as early as mid-December, as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations in the United States soared once more to unprecedented heights.With outgoing President Donald Trump’s coronavirus strategy relying heavily on a vaccine, the chief adviser of his administration’s Operation Warp Speed program said on Tuesday that 20 million people could be inoculated by the end of 2020, and that by the middle of 2021 most Americans will have access to highly effective vaccines.“Within 24 hours, maybe at most 36 to 48 hours, from the approval, the vaccine can be in people’s arms,” Moncef Slaoui, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive, said at an event conducted by The Washington Post newspaper.The highly contagious virus infected 4.36 million people in the United States in November alone, more than double the tally of new cases the previous month, as many Americans refused to wear masks and traveled for holiday gatherings against the recommendations of health experts.Some 60 million to 70 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine could be available per month beginning in January, after the expected regulatory approval of products from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, Slaoui said.A Food and Drug Administration panel of outside advisers will meet on December 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine. They are expected to review Moderna’s candidate a week later.The distribution timeline described by Slaoui and US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar appeared to assume that the FDA’s authorization of the first vaccine would come within days of the December 10 meeting. But the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, told patient advocacy groups last week that it might take “a few days to a few weeks” for his agency to render its decision.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has likewise said the process could take longer than the Trump administration has suggested.Asked in a ABC News interview on Tuesday whether the vaccine could become available the week of December 15, Hahn said: “It is possible,” but noted, “it will depend on what sort of questions and data come out of the vaccine advisory committee.”The US Transportation Department said on Tuesday it has made preparations to enable the “immediate mass shipment” of Covid-19 vaccines and completed all necessary regulatory measures.A panel of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday voted 13-to-1 to recommend that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be first in line to receive initial doses of Covid-19 vaccines when they become available.The CDC will take the recommendation into account and provide guidance to the states to assist governors in their decisions about vaccine distribution priorities.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday complained about the lack of federal funding for vaccine distribution. He also criticized a data-sharing agreement put forward by the government that he said could “dissuade undocumented immigrants from taking the vaccine.” Cuomo expressed concern that data on those receiving the vaccine could end up in the hands of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Meanwhile, leading medical officials are pleading with Americans to abide by public health measures for slowing a pandemic that claimed 37,000 US lives just last month.A record nearly 96,000 Covid-19 patients were reported in US hospitals on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalizations and deaths are expected to spike even higher in the midst of the holiday travel season, a trend that officials have warned will push an already strained healthcare system to the breaking point.The monthly toll of US Covid-19 deaths are projected to nearly double in December to a pandemic-high of more than 70,000 and surpass 76,000 in January before ebbing in February, according to a widely cited model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The monthly record for US Covid-19 deaths of 58,740 was set in April.The pandemic and restrictions meant to stop it have ravaged the US economy.A bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Tuesday unveiled a $908 billion Covid-19 relief bill aimed at breaking months long deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over new emergency assistance for small businesses, unemployed people and industries.US nursing homes are experiencing the worst outbreak of weekly coronavirus cases since the spring, according to the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL).New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi urged at-risk residents to halt non-essential activities and stay in as much as possible as the city battles its second coronavirus wave.“This escalation unfortunately follows a tragically familiar pattern - cases grow, hospitalizations follow,” Chokshi said. “And, sadly, too many result in critical illness or even death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-prepare-for-swift-vaccine-roll-out-as-covid-cases-surge/story-QqSxr7pD0uH5ERS3RJumeI.html
02-12-2020||World||Which Americans will get the coronavirus vaccine first?||The Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines could be approved in a matter of weeks, but who in the United States will get them first? A high level panel of US experts on Tuesday voted that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be prioritized in the first phase.“I believe that my vote reflects maximum benefits, minimum harm, promoting justice and mitigating the health inequalities that exist, with regard to distribution of this vaccine,” said Jose Romero, chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.As the sequence continues though, US experts may differ from other countries in prioritizing “critical workers” who keep society running -- potentially even before people at highest risk. To be clear, there won’t be one single set of rules for the whole nation. At the risk of creating confusion, which was the case during the vaccine campaign against the H1N1 flu in 2009, the federal government only makes recommendations to states, which decide for themselves how to distribute the doses and who gets priority. Panels of top experts have already delivered their opinions, which diverge in certain key respects and reveal the tension at the centre of the debate: vaccines should both protect the most vulnerable and help facilitate a return to normal. It’s on the question of jumpstarting the economy as quickly as possible that the US may set itself apart.France’s top health authority recommended starting with retirement home residents and employees who work there, followed by the elderly and health care workers, then the over-50s, people whose jobs put them at risk, medically high-risk people, the poor, and finally the rest of the population.That’s the approach recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by a number of rich countries, Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told AFP.In the US, the panel voted overwhelmingly in favour of prioritizing health care workers and long-term care facilities, which have accounted for about 40 percent of deaths in the country so far.The committee did not vote for what would happen after the initial phase, but experts have proposed to then give priority to essential workers in phase “1b,” followed by adults with multiple risk factors and adults over 65 in phase “1c.”Keeping the country runningEssential workers include teachers, workers from slaughterhouses to the supermarkets who keep Americans fed, and those who drive buses and trains, sell them their medicine, maintain order, or deliver mail and parcels. People in these jobs are often minority Hispanics or Black, and have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic.In practice, these ethical, epidemiological and economic considerations may be ignored in the initial rush on doses. Problems remain to be solved: though it may be easy to target retirement homes and hospitals, how are pharmacists and doctors supposed to confirm that a person is indeed an essential worker, or that they have two underlying conditions? The Trump administration has said that retirement homes will receive Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines as early as mid-December in the event of a regulatory green light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-americans-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/story-OBhe6VzYe8wK0UqShmeZaP.html
02-12-2020||World||Baby among 5 killed as car runs down shoppers in Germany||A baby was among five people killed when a car tore through a pedestrian shopping street in the southwestern German city of Trier on Tuesday, police said, after arresting the driver.Prosecutor Peter Fritzen said the driver, a 51-year-old Trier native, appeared to be suffering from “psychiatric problems” and had been under the influence of alcohol during the incident, in which 14 other people were hurt.Police said they had “no indications of a political motive” after questioning the suspect, and Fritzen said prosecutors were considering requesting he be placed in psychiatric care.At the same press conference, Trier mayor Wolfram Leibe said those killed when the man drove his SUV into the shoppers included a nine-month-old and a 73-year-old woman. “I think this is Trier’s darkest day since World War II,” he said.Also killed were a 25-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man. Police have not yet released details on the fifth victim. Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate where Trier is located, expressed shock that a baby was among those killed by the driver’s “insane act” and shared her condolences with all the affected families.The baby’s mother was being treated in hospital for injuries sustained in the rampage.Witnesses had earlier described seeing people being flung into the air as the car struck them.‘Traumatised’ The incident started around 1250 GMT and ended within four minutes of the first emergency calls arriving, with police intercepting the driver after he turned off a main shopping street.Police said he had ploughed through the streets for between 600 metres and a kilometre, leaving behind a trail of destruction.Officers sealed off the area and cleared people from the centre of the city of about 110,000 people.Smartphone footage from an eyewitness showed the arrest of the driver, handcuffed and lying face down on the street being pinned down by several officers next to the damaged vehicle. In the evening, the cathedral bells were rung and a memorial service held for the victims.Joachim, accompanied by his teenage daughters Helena and Sophia, attended the service expressing their sadness.“We wanted to show our sympathy for those who lost their lives and those who lost a loved one,” Joachim said.An unnamed man who said he was a former neighbour of the suspect told NTV that the driver had a history of mental issues, as well as money worries and problems with his father.Christmas shopping Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced her “great sadness,” and said her thoughts were with the relatives of those who were “so suddenly and violently ripped from their lives” and with the injured, in a message shared by her spokesman. Early footage from the scene showed stunned shoppers huddling outside stores festooned with Christmas decorations as sirens blared in the distance.Broken glass and debris from stalls and outdoor displays were strewn along the cobbled street.Picturesque Trier, near the border with Luxembourg, traces its history back to the Roman Empire and is often called Germany’s oldest city. It is also the birthplace of Karl Marx.Although Germany is grappling with a second coronavirus wave that has forced restaurants, bars, sports and cultural centres to close, retailers have been allowed to stay open, and many people were out Christmas shopping.“It’s lucky that the Christmas market has been cancelled because of corona, or it could have been much worse,” witness Frederic Fries told Welt TV.The incident brought back memories of a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people, Germany’s deadliest Islamist attack to date.In January 2019, a German man injured eight people when he drove into crowds on New Year’s Eve in the western cities of Bottrop and Essen. He was later taken into psychiatric care.In April 2018, a German man ploughed his van into people seated outside a restaurant in the city of Muenster, killing five before shooting himself dead. Investigators later said he had mental health problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-among-5-killed-as-car-runs-down-shoppers-in-germany/story-fQZZK0luAbfc5knBTtPfxK.html

He said that Taipei could be used as a scapegoat to relieve increasing pressures at home.“If you look at the Chinese military activities around Taiwan, it’s been intensifying. We see that the Chinese military vessels, as well as its military airplanes, cross into Taiwan’s ADIZ, especially in the southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ almost on a daily basis,” Wu was quoted as saying by ABC News.“If an authoritarian country is facing domestic difficulties, the easiest way for them to keep the country together will be ... to find a scapegoat outside,” he added.The foreign minister has called on like-minded countries including Australia to back Taiwan against the Chinese “expansionism”.“I see like-minded countries like Japan and Australia and India and the United States can also work together to prevent China from further expansionism,” Wu said.This comes as a growing diplomatic dispute between China and Australia on trade, defence, and foreign policy matters.China continues to regard Taipei as a “breakaway province” and has said that it wouldn’t mind using force to claim it.In recent years it has also increased military drills around Taiwan, with almost 40 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line between the mainland.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the United States.

02-12-2020||World||Netanyahu rival Gantz threatens to end coalition, force election||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief governing partner on Tuesday said he would vote in favour of a proposal to dissolve their troubled coalition, accusing the Israeli leader of repeatedly breaking his promises and pushing Israel closer to its fourth election in two years.The announcement by Defense Minister Benny Gantz that he would vote in favour of a preliminary no-confidence measure on Wednesday did not immediately cause the government to collapse. Rather, it served as a warning by Gantz, who also holds the title of alternate prime minister, that he has run out of patience with Netanyahu and is ready to break up their alliance if a long-overdue budget isn’t passed immediately.A formal vote to dissolve the government could come as soon as next week, leaving the door open to last-minute negotiations.“The only one who can prevent these elections is the one who decided to have them — Netanyahu,” Gantz said in a nationally televised speech. “The burden of proof is on you.”Netanyahu’s Likud party and Gantz’s Blue and White battled to a stalemate in three consecutive elections before agreeing in May to form their coalition. Under the deal, Netanyahu is to serve as prime minister for the first 18 months before they trade places next November and make Gantz prime minister for another 18 months.The two rivals agreed to the power-sharing deal with the stated aim of steering the country through the twin health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus. But the government has been plagued by paralysis and infighting.Hovering over the disagreements is Netanyahu’s ongoing trial on corruption charges. Gantz accused Netanyahu out of acting out concerns for his “personal survival” and working to thwart the legal process as the coronavirus rages and hundreds of thousands of Israelis remain out of work and families struggle to get by.In his address, Gantz said he’d had “no illusions” about Netanyahu when he formed the government. He accused Netanyahu of blocking key appointments, delaying legislation and claiming credit for the accomplishments of others.“Netanyahu didn’t lie to me. He lied to all of you,” he added, looking straight into the camera.The biggest area of disagreement has been the failure to pass a budget. Their agreement called for passage of a budget by August. They then agreed to extend the deadline until Dec. 23, but no progress has been made. A failure to reach a deal would cause the government to automatically collapse and trigger a new election.Gantz, accusing Netanyahu of dragging out the talks for personal reasons, apparently does not want to wait that long.Once the budget is complete, Netanyahu would be forced to commit to their rotation agreement next year and yield power to Gantz. But if the government collapses, Netanyahu would remain as prime minister throughout the three-month election campaign and until a new coalition is formed.Fearing a new election is inevitable, Gantz appears to have concluded that it would be best for the vote to take place as soon as possible, when Netanyahu’s trial is underway and with the coronavirus still out of control.Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of offering favors to wealthy media figures in exchange for positive news coverage about him and his family. The trial is expected to kick into high gear in February when a string of witnesses is scheduled to testify.Netanyahu, on the other hand, would benefit by further delaying the budget talks. That would give more time for the coronavirus vaccine to arrive and the economy to begin recovering next year, presumably giving him a better chance in elections.Opinion polls predict that Netanyahu’s Likud Party would still emerge as the largest party in parliament in the next election, but with far fewer seats than it currently has. Gantz’s Blue and White has plummeted even further, making it in both their interests to compromise and avoid a new election.In a video released ahead of Gantz’s speech, Netanyahu accused Blue of White of acting like “a government within the government” and urged his rival not to force a new election.“Benny, what needs to be done now is to make a U-turn from politics for the citizens of Israel,” he said. “This is what needs to be done now and I’m asking you to do it.”Gantz accuses Netanyahu of stalling the approval of appointments of key judiciary and law-enforcement officials, in hopes that a new election might allow him to bring together a friendlier coalition that could appoint officials more inclined to delay the trial or dismiss the charges altogether.Opposition leader Yair Lapid, the sponsor of the bill to dissolve the government, welcomed Gantz’s speech.“Six months after the formation of this bloated and disconnected government, it is clear to everyone that Netanyahu can’t lead Israel out of the corona crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-rival-gantz-threatens-to-end-coalition-force-election/story-scb0OSFs2rlxtsztmMtIEL.html

02-12-2020||World||US urged to do more against rising China threat||The US should ratchet up its demands of China to include equal access for companies and media, stricter monitoring of Beijing’s activities at the UN and preventive action to safeguard American interests in technology and finance, a bipartisan panel told Congress on Tuesday.A 575-page report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress to track and anticipate threats from China, characterized the world’s second-largest economy as a threat to the current international order that has American values at its core. And it said China’s leaders view those values as a barrier to the country’s external ambitions and an existential threat to their rule.“Chinese leaders’ assessment of the United States as a dangerous and firmly committed opponent has informed nearly every facet of China’s diplomatic strategy, economic policy, and military planning in the post-Cold War era,” the panel said.Amid a continuing US effort to roll back China’s dominance in next-generation 5G communications, the role of technology emerges as a clear theme throughout the annual report. The study said Beijing uses the establishment of technical standards as a way to “advance an alternative technological order.”It also warned that China’s effort at financial opening was part of a “calculated strategy” to secure foreign investment inflows and use them to shore up the domestic economy. This would increase exposure to unique risks in China’s financial system for foreign investors, the report said.“China is an adversary presenting unique and immediate threats to our economic and security interests,” Robin Cleveland, chairman of the commission, said in an opening statement. Cleveland said the report reflected “an understanding that the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party are not partisan – they are American concerns.”The analysis also looked at areas including military capabilities, trade relations, public health and Covid-19-related issues, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong.Beijing’s national security law for the former British colony had “significantly compromised” the rule of law and press freedom, the report found. “Under growing pressure from the CCP, the territory’s judicial system has been thrown into crisis as judges are compelled to adopt mainland legal principles and CCP positions,” the report said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.A statement from Hong Kong’s government described the report as “yet another example” of US interference in Hong Kong’s affairs, using “democracy and self-determination as an excuse.” The statement continued, saying “such groundless and unjust political maneuvers will achieve nothing but undermining Hong-Kong-US relations and hurting the US’s own interests.”Competition between the US and China had intensified under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the authors wrote, and they argued that the time for action is now.“If Beijing succeeds in normalizing its views of governance, the result could undermine individual rights around the world,” the commission said. “Underestimating Beijing’s intent to revise the international order based on its current capabilities risks delaying a response until it is already too late to preserve the liberal international order.”The report makes 19 recommendations, highlighting 10 of those as being of “particular significance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urged-to-do-more-against-rising-china-threat/story-Cx4EyPJX2fELCEvx3qL9kL.html
02-12-2020||World||Trump family urges US appeals court to move lawsuit against them to arbitration||A lawyer for Donald Trump on Tuesday urged a federal appeals court to halt a lawsuit accusing the US president of exploiting his family name to promote a marketing scam targeting poor and working-class people.The lawyer, Thomas McCarthy, told the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan the plaintiffs were “done in by the allegations of their own complaint,” and that their proposed class action concerning the multi-level marketing company American Communications Network belonged in arbitration.Four plaintiffs, including a hospice worker, accused Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka and an affiliate of their family company of promoting ACN in exchange for millions of dollars in secret payments from 2005 to 2015.The plaintiffs said ACN charged $499 to sell videophones and other goods, and the Trump family conned them into thinking Donald Trump believed their investments would pay off.Trump and his children have called the civil lawsuit, one of many against the president, politically motivated, saying they had no control over ACN and that Trump’s endorsement was merely his opinion.Some defendants prefer arbitration to litigation because evidence can be harder to come by, costs can be lower, and proceedings are often confidential.US District Judge Lorna Schofield refused in April to send the ACN case to arbitration, saying the plaintiffs had no reason to believe their arbitration agreements with ACN covered the Trumps.In Tuesday’s arguments before a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Denny Chin appeared to agree with Schofield’s conclusion that it was unfair for the Trumps to demand arbitration only after she had dismissed a racketeering claim.“You waited eight months before asking to compel arbitration,” Chin told McCarthy. “You requested and obtained substantive relief. In those circumstances, why isn’t the right to arbitration, to the extent it exists, waived?”McCarthy responded that the claims against the Trumps and ACN were intertwined, that only “minimal” time had passed, and that the lawsuit was still in its early stages.Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, countered that arbitration is “fundamentally a matter of consent,” and that her clients never expected to battle the Trumps in arbitration.“This is a fraud case,” she said. “This is about what Donald Trump said.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-family-urges-us-appeals-court-to-move-lawsuit-against-them-to-arbitration/story-iLv98YbpgMokbcy35o8CJK.html
02-12-2020||World||China successfully lands spacecraft on moon to retrieve lunar rocks: State media||A Chinese probe sent to the Moon to bring back the first lunar samples in four decades successfully landed on Tuesday, Beijing’s space agency said.China has poured billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022 and of eventually sending humans to the Moon.The latest mission’s goal is to shovel up lunar rocks and soil to help scientists learn about the Moon’s origins, formation and volcanic activity on its surface.The Chang’e-5 spacecraft, named for the mythical Chinese moon goddess, “landed on the near side of the Moon late Tuesday,” state media agency Xinhua reported, citing the China National Space Administration.If the return journey is successful, China will be only the third country to have retrieved samples from the Moon, following the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.The probe entered the Moon’s orbit on Saturday after a 112-hour journey from Earth, Xinhua said, after a rocket carried it into space from China’s southern Hainan province last week.It is to collect two kilogrammes (4.5 pounds) of surface material in a previously unexplored area known as Oceanus Procellarum, or “Ocean of Storms”, which consist of a vast lava plain, according to the science journal Nature.The collection will take place over the course of one lunar day, equivalent to around 14 Earth days.Its lunar samples will then be returned to Earth in a capsule programmed to land in northern China’s Inner Mongolia region later in December, according to US space agency NASA.The mission is technically challenging and involves several innovations not seen during previous attempts at collecting moon rocks, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Jonathan McDowell told AFP last month.Under President Xi Jinping, plans for China’s “space dream”, as he calls it, have been put into overdrive.The new superpower is looking to finally catch up with the US and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones.A Chinese lunar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in January 2019 in a global first that boosted Beijing’s aspirations to become a space superpower.The latest probe is among a slew of ambitious targets set by Beijing, which include creating a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a lunar base and a permanently crewed space station.China’s astronauts and scientists have also talked up manned missions to Mars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-successfully-lands-spacecraft-on-moon-to-retrieve-lunar-rocks-report/story-5h5elkUs8jRiWbR3FXTzFJ.html
02-12-2020||World||Republicans oppose nomination of Neera Tanden; call her the worst nominee of Biden so far||US President-elect Joe Biden nominating Indian-American Neera Tanden as his Director for Office of Management and Budget has run into trouble with some of the top Republican Senators openly opposing the pick due to her “combative and insulting comments” about many members of the Senate.Tanden, 50, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman of colour and first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The OMB serves the President of the United States in overseeing the implementation of his vision across the Executive Branch. Specifically, OMB’s mission is to assist the President in meeting his policy, budget, management, and regulatory objectives, and to fulfil the agency’s statutory responsibilities.Tanden’s career has focused on pursuing policies designed to support working families, foster broad-based economic growth, and curb rampant inequality.Also Watch l ‘Trump one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history’: Joe Biden Influential Senator John Cornyn, who is also co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, described Tanden as the worst nominee of Biden so far and said: “I think in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path to confirmation.” In an interaction with reporters, Cornyn said that Tanden “deleted a lot of her previous tweets in the last couple of weeks which seems pretty juvenile, as if people won’t have access to it.” “I’m a little surprised that he would do that and not even consult with any Republicans. Some of this can be avoided with a little bit of a heads up and consultation,” Cornyn said.In a tweet he alleged that Tanden deleted more than 1,000 tweets, including criticism of Republicans.The Republican Party has 50 senators in the 100-member US Senate, with the Democrats having 48 in their kitty. Elections for the two Senate seats in Georgia are scheduled for January 5.Tanden, who has 313,400 followers on Twitter, where she is quite active, had been very critical of the Republican senators and President Donald Trump in the past.In one of her tweets, Tanden had referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as “Moscow Mitch.” She is reported to have deleted many of her tweets that were critical of Republican Senators.According to The Washington Examiner, Tanden has deleted over a thousand tweets in anticipation of a tough confirmation vote.“Tanden’s deleted tweets include, for example, multiple posts expressing disapproval of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist Republican who has been known to vote with Democrats on some issues and is considered a “swing” vote.Yet, she left a 2018 tweet that calls Collins “pathetic” for supporting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate,” the daily said.  Republican Whip Senator John Thune alleged that Tanden has been pretty partisan in some of her previous positions and in many cases with respect to Republican senators who have to vote on her potential nomination.Senator Rick Scott from Florida alleged that Tanden is a big-government, big-spending radical liberal who’s a terrible choice for OMB Director.“It’s just more proof that Biden and the Democrats will continue to move further and further to the Left,” he said.However, a few top Democratic senators also appreciated her nomination.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, alleged that the Republicans are twisting themselves into pretzels to explain their reflexive opposition to these outstanding selections.“Neera Tanden, who would be the first woman of colour to ever run the Office of Management and Budget, is so eminently qualified that some on the Republican side—grasping at straws—have taken issue with comments made on twitter criticising the policy positions of Republicans in Congress,” Schumer, a Democrat, said.“Honestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans are concerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at President Trump, who has made a hobby out of denigrating Republican Senators on twitter. I fully expect to see some crocodile tears spilled on the other side of the aisle over the President-elect’s cabinet nominees. But it will be very tough to take those crocodile tears seriously,” Schumer said.Senator Mazie K Hirono said that Tanden is a highly qualified nominee whose professional and lived experience makes her an accomplished choice to lead OMB.“As someone who relied on food stamps and public housing growing up, Neera understands the transformational role and responsibility of government programmes to help individuals and families across our country,” the Democratic Senator said.House Majority Leader Steny H Hoyer said that he has worked closely with Tanden for a number of years.“I know that she will be a tremendous asset to President-elect Biden as he works with Congress to invest in a stronger economy for all Americans,” the Democratic Party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-oppose-nomination-of-neera-tanden-call-her-the-worst-nominee-of-biden-so-far/story-KBbLBfQpiPxA4JXPp5UdlL.html

I feel solution will be there after talks with farmers. But there are certain disruptive forces who have reached there without any invitation and they don’t want a solution. They are trying to cause disruptions.”He said, “These are the forces which were behind the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Shaheen Bagh. But our farmers are intelligent enough to identify such elements. Hence, I am sure we will see a solution on the issues raised by farmers.”Meanwhile, a large number of farmers in 50 tractors and trolleys from Gwalior left for New Delhi to join farmers protest against the farm laws. Gwalior collector Kaushlendra Singh said, “We tried to convince farmers against proceeding to Delhi but they didn’t listen.” (With input from Mahesh Shivhare in Gwalior)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disruptive-forces-don-t-want-solution-to-farmers-protest-mp-home-minister/story-W17TwVgMz2fypBiYHoyEzI.html
02-12-2020||India||Most samples of honey found adulterated with modified syrup: CSE||New Delhi: At a time when honey is being touted as an immunity booster against Covid-19, the New Delh- based advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claimed on Wednesday that 77% of samples from 13 top honey brands in the country were found to have been adulterated with a modified syrup to beat safety tests.Only three of 13 brands --- Saffola, Markfed Sohna and Nature’s Nectar --- passed the internationally accepted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) tests conducted by a German lab, considered the gold standard to detect modified syrup adulteration of honey, CSE’s director general Sunita Narain told reporters.Narain, who released the findings of a four-month-long investigation, said honey samples of leading brands such as Dabur, Patanjali, Baidyanath, Zandu, Hitkary and Apis Himalaya failed the NMR tests. Three of these companies -- Dabur, Patanjali and Emami -- said in separate statements that the honey they produce and market complies with all food safety requirements and their products were 100% safe. A Dabur spokesperson termed the CSE’s report “malicious.” Patanjali said the report was aimed at promoting processed honey. The others didn’t respond. The findings dovetail with practitioners of traditional Indian medicine recommending honey, turmeric, ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin and other foods for their immunity boosting properties as the coronavirus disease pandemic rages.Narain said the findings of the NMR tests were worrying because such products could compromise human health in Covid-19 times. “We know that the households are consuming more honey because of its intrinsic goodness --- antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Our research has found honey is adulterated with sugar, which could add to risk of Covid-19. Sugar ingestion is linked to obesity and obese people are more vulnerable to life-threatening diseases,” she said. CSE had 22 samples of the honey brands tested first at the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) in Gujarat. Almost all the top brands passed the tests of purity; a few samples of the smaller brands failed the tests to detect cane sugar. Narain said some Chinese companies had developed a syrup containing fructose, or fruit sugar, that can go undetected in Indian tests for the purity of honey. “The Indian tests failed to track the marker for sophisticated rice syrup, which has high sugar content, but was found through NMR,” Narain said, adding that CEC can provide test reports from the German lab to regulatory authorities if they wanted. The rice syrup could be made of fructose which, the CSE found, was being produced by a company in Uttarkhand’s Jaspur town and sold at Rs 60 to Rs 68 per kilogram. The syrup was also available for import by Chinese companies, which claimed that it can beat food safety tests in India. The syrup was also available on the Chinese website of e-commerce giant Alibaba and was sent to CSE through Hong Kong as a paint pigment to evade the import license conditions necessary to import syrup. Narain said the Chinese companies wrote to a CSE employee saying that 50-80% fructose adulteration can remain undetected in food safety tests conducted in India. To test the claim, CSE got pure honey mixed with fructose tested at NDDB. Honey mixed with up to 50% fructose remained undetected. “Raw honey adulterated with 75% fructose was detected by NDDB, showing how easy it was to adulterate honey with the Chinese product,” Narain said. Around 11,000 million tonnes of fructose has been imported into India from Chinese firms since 2014-15, the CSE said. According to the National Bee Board, which oversees and coordinates bee-keeping, honey production in India increased to 105,000 tonnes in 2017-18 from 35,000 tonnes in 2005-06. Honey exports year-on-year increased by 13% in 2019-20; Punjab, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were the leading honey producers, the board said.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the regulatory body for food safety in India, has not prescribed NMR tests for honey. FSSAI acted as a whistleblower for the CSE’s investigation by writing to all states governments to look for adulteration of honey using golden sugar, invert sugar syrup and rice syrup, Narain claimed. “Fructose is developed in a way to escape Indian tests which looks for sugar syrup,” she said. “It remains unclear how much does the food regulator really know about this murky business. The three imported sugar syrups named by FSSAI in its directive – golden syrup, invert sugar syrup and rice syrup -- are either not imported in these names or are not indicted for adulteration. Instead, Chinese companies are mostly exporting this syrup as fructose to India. So, why did FSSAI put out what is clearly an erroneous order? We are not certain,” she said. A spokesperson for FSSAI said the regulator was waiting for the publication of the results of the tests and would “provide our response accordingly.” Dr Rommel Tickoo, associate director of internal medicine at Max Hospital in Delhi, said: “If it’s only sugar syrup that is being added to honey, it is not harmful as such. But if diabetic patients are taking it unknowingly, then it is a cause for concern as sugar levels will shoot up. It can also lead to weight gain if people are consuming {adulterated honey} regularly. More importantly ,the purpose of building immunity with natural honey is not served if its sugar syrup,” he said. Narain said that because of the adulteration the prices of raw honey has fallen from Rs 150 per kilogram a year ago to Rs 60 per kilogram and the business of honey collection was becoming unsustainable even though the Central government has pumped in Rs 500 crore to improve their livelihood in recent years. “Most honey collectors in Punjab and Haryana say there are no buyers as producers are getting Chinese honey, not knowing exactly what it was,” she said.Honey collectors of Punjab and Haryana said the adulteration was one reason for falling honey prices despite an increase in demand.“Increasing adulteration has now become a major challenge for the beekeepers as this has led a fall in prices,” said Gurbax Singh, a honey trader in Haryana’s Karnal, adding that beekeepers were unable to even recover cost of production.A Dabur spokesperson said the report seemed motivated and aimed at maligning the company’s brand. “We assure our consumers that Dabur Honey is 100% pure. It is 100% indigenous, collected naturally from Indian sources and packed with no added sugar or other adulterants,” the spokesperson said, adding that Dabur is the only company in India to have an NMR testing equipment in its own laboratory.Acharya Balkrishna of Patanjali said the company sells 100% natural honey which complies with FSSAI standards. “It seems to be a plot to defame Indian natural honey industry and manufacturers in a bid to promote processed honey and promote German technology for testing. “ he said.An Emami spokesperson said the company’s Zandu Pure Honey “conforms and adheres to all the protocols and quality norms/standards laid down by the Government of India and its authorised entities such as FSSAI.”(With inputs from Neeraj Mohan in Karnal and Aneesha Bedi in Ludhiana)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-samples-of-honey-found-adulterated-with-modified-syrup-cse/story-7wqjPxvCESPw8XA47BfssK.html

On Monday, Sawant had categorically stated that his predecessor was not opposed to the projects he is now pushing for. The video, dating back to the year 2013, when Parrikar was the chief minister and the UPA -II government was on its last legs, shows Parrikar alleging corruption and private benefit behind the doubling project. “South Western Railway wants to double the railway line. The Goa government does not want the double tracking. We are very clear, we will not give any permission for double tracking. I’m very clear,” Parrikar is heard saying “It is basically being double tracked because of MPT’s coal. There, through fraud, they have given 2-3 companies coal berths to handle coal... they have eaten money. Through privatization, they have given berths for handling coal at MPT. To shift that coal, this double tracking is proposed. Those industries are asking for it. I don’t need double tracking. Single tracking can be efficiently used,” Parrikar had said. Parrikar’s words have come to haunt Sawant, who has staunchly defended the project in the face of rising opposition and protests claiming that the doubling is in national interest and is not being done for coal transportation, something that people opposing the projects are refusing to believe.The Mormugao Port Trust has leased out three berths -- 5A and 6A to(SWPL), a subsidiary of JSW Infrastructure and berth 7A to Adani Mormugao Port Terminal Private Limited (AMPTL). Berths 6A and 7A are exclusively used for coal handling by JSW and Adani, which then shift the coal via rail to steel mills in north Karnataka.“We are not permitting to double the track. We have refused permission. I’m not going to allow [it]. Double line will not be permitted in Goa, we don’t need it,” Parrikar had said. For his part, Parrikar as the chief minister and chairman of the State Board for Wildlife had rejected a proposal from the South Western Railway, albeit a proposal different from the one being currently pursued to the extent that it was proposed along a different alignment. The Goa State Wildlife Board had earlier in the year 2013 rejected a proposal to construct a separate railway line through a different alignment, one which had an easier gradient, but would involve fresh disturbance in an entirely virgin area of forest.The railways then submitted a fresh proposal to the state wildlife board to double the track along the existing route which was processed during the tenure of former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and finally approved by Pramod Sawant earlier this year.In 2010, the ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line in the states of Karnataka and Goa. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and has already been completed. It’s the second phase between Tinaighat and Vasco da Gama that involves crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats as well as densely populated areas of coastal Goa that’s being contested fearing destruction to the fragile Western Ghats ecology as well as pollution resulting from increased coal transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-parrikar-video-threatens-to-derail-railway-line-doubling-project-in-goa/story-WfMPpwLw5gpMZo3vVmSTtK.html
02-12-2020||India||Now, Naga Hoho calls Nagaland Governor’s statement abusive||Nagaland Governor RN Ravi’s recent statement glorifying the controversial Naga Peoples’ Convention (NPC) and the creation of Nagaland state continued to draw flak from different sections of Nagas. Close on the heels of condemnation of Ravi’s remarks by the Isak-Muivah led National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and the Naga Students’ Federation, the Naga Hoho, an apex tribal body, on Wednesday accused the governor of making an abusive statement. “We had the notion that Ravi was unlike other interlocutors in the past and had great hope that during his tenure something could be worked out and he had wisely understood the Naga political problem and its history of more than seventy years. We never expected such antagonistic statement from a brilliant, intelligent and self respecting Interlocutor who is supposed to be a harbinger of peace,” the Naga Hoho said in a statement.It alleged that the governor’s utterances were aimed to create division among the Nagas in line with regional and artificial territory.Asserting that no governor in the past had resuscitated the 16 point agreement on which Nagaland was formed, the organization asked what prompted him (Ravi) to take keen interest on the contentious issue after 57 years of statehood when the government of India and Naga negotiators are trying to resolve the Naga political issue above the 16 point resolution.The Naga Hoho also shot a barrage of questions at the governor: “Why did GoI sign another ceasefire Agreement in 1964 and 1997 if the 16 Point Resolution/proposal is final settlement?” it asked the governor and accused him of being divisive.“Indeed, Naga political issue belongs to the Naga people alone and not outsiders. Which single entity is claiming the sole franchise over it? Who are the primary stakeholders on Naga issue? Are you not the one who created primary and secondary stakeholders?” the Naga HoHo said . While a separate Constitution and separate flag that the NSCN (IM) is pushing for becoming sticking points in the Naga peace talks, the Naga Hoho backed the demand.“The Indian National Flag and Constitution are the pride of the people of India, so also Nagas do have our own flag and constitution. Who is talking contrary and peddling preposterous lies? Are you not the one who misinterpreted the Framework Agreement?” it went on to say.The organisation also said the Naga issue would remain unless an amicable solution is arrived at and a logical conclusion is brought about with sheer political will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-naga-hoho-calls-nagaland-governor-s-statement-abusive/story-CF2IdifRG3TYoPclQd6M4N.html
02-12-2020||India||Small J&K hamlet near LoC protests eviction notices, alleges injustice||The residents of a small hamlet in Jammu and Kashmir named Rangwar village, displaced by the 2005 earthquake and forced to settle three kilometers down on the Chowkibal -Tangdhar main road as mark of protest, have been served with eviction notices while the threat of demolition hangs over their heads.The new settlement, raised after the 2005 quake, is mostly made up of tin and wood sheds on a vacant plot of more than one hectare in size on the roadside.The new place was named Rangwar in remembrance of the old. The original Rangwar village, surrounded by icy mountains and forests, was always on the edge due to frequent natural disasters. Villagers say that it had been declared ‘dangerous’ in a survey by the geology and mining department.First, the floods in August 1992 washed away the houses and close to three years later in March 1995, a landslide damaged over a dozen houses in the village before it was struck by another flood. In 2005, in one of the worst earthquakes to hit J&K, most of the houses in the original Rangwar village were damaged.The villagers say they were directed by the officials to settle on a vacant plot close to forests.“Our village was always at risk due to landslides, floods so we started pursuing a vacant plot of around 119 kanals which the government agreed to give us, since our land was washed away by floods in the village. As we were planning to settle there, the army established a big camp there. When the earthquake struck our village, causing devastation, we came down along with families from our village and began our protest. The officials came and asked us to construct temporary sheds till they could find an alternate piece of land for us,” said Afsar Khan, panchayat member of the Halqa panchayat. “The floods in the Khemil stream washed away almost all the plain land of the village and the land that was meant for us was taken over by the army. Either government should get us an alternate land or it should shift the army from the place which was actually meant for us. Till then we won’t leave this place.”The villagers are a worried lot after witnessing the eviction of tribal people from forest areas in various parts of J&K following the scrapping of the Roshni Act. The administration says the evictions were carried out as part of an anti-encroachment drive meant to retrieve forest and state land under the directions of the high court.Imran Ahmad was six years old when he came to this place along with his family comprising eight members.“We trekked down along with families and held protest with the hope that the government will do something for us. The officials gave us tents and asked us to settle down,” he said, adding that since the place witnesses subzero temperature, some non-governmental organisations (NGO) and locals provided them with tin sheets to construct sheds or small shelters to escape from chilling winters.“Since then we are settled here and waiting for rehabilitation. Instead of rehabilitation, the forest department has issued us eviction notices,” said Ahmad.Holding the eviction notice in his hands, Ahmad said the officials came and threatened to bulldoze the temporary houses.“Where will we go in this cold winter? We will die here but won’t allow anybody to touch our shelters. We are poor people and we work with the army as porters. That’s the only work we have got. This is great injustice,” Ahmad added.Saleema Begum, a widow who lives alone is equally worried.“I came to this place and constructed this small makeshift shelter along with my husband. Two years ago my husband died, now I am living alone here. Where will I go if they dismantle my shelter, which is now my only asset along with two goats?” She asks.Most of the residents of Rangwar village are Gujjars, who either work with the army as porters or in farms in neighbouring villages.“We have occupied around one hectare of land while the army has occupied six to seven hectares of plain land and nobody dares to ask them to vacate that land. The threat of eviction looks real now as we saw the government dismantling huts of people in different parts of J&K. We are dwellers of forests, how can they throw us out without rehabilitation,” said Sajjad, a young man from the village.Interestingly the government has made these 98 houses a part of Marsari Panchayat.Another villager, Alam Khan, said that even this place is not safe for the residents as it becomes a frequent target of indiscriminate shelling by Pakistan. “In August, three persons sustained injuries when shells fired from across the LoC landed close to houses. We will move out from this place but give us an alternate land.” Divisional forest officer, Khemil division, Mohammad Ayub, confirmed that notices have been served to the people who have set up shelters on the forest land. “They (villagers) have occupied two hectares of the forest land. The notices have been served to them and the department is waiting for the orders from higher authorities about these people. The area is already under snow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/small-j-k-hamlet-near-loc-protests-eviction-notices-alleges-injustice/story-gMmwY8ioK4ssX08tXNSfpN.html

The farmers say they will camp in Delhi till the laws are withdrawn by the Central government and they are ready for laying a long siege on the capital.“Farmers are heading to Delhi in batches of small groups due to Covid-19 outbreak. Some of them have already arrived in Delhi, some are camping near the Delhi border with ration and other necessary materials, while others are on the way,” said Prem Singh Sahota, district president, Bharat Kisan Union (BKU). A large batch of farmers from US Nagar had proceeded to Delhi on Saturday after UP police allowed them to move ahead from Rampur district, where they had been stopped. They held a sit-in for 48 hours before police gave them permission to go ahead, said a farmer. Another batch of farmers carrying ration and other essential supplies in tractor trolleys left for the national capital on Monday. “Government is playing in the hands of capitalists and its decisions are ruining the agriculture sector. Farmers are being forced to leave agriculture since they can’t bear the brunt of the newly introduced farm laws,” said Malook Singh Khinda, a farmer from Nanakmatta.Also Read: UP, Uttarakhand, MP farmers to hold mahapanchayat at Delhi-UP border on ThursdayBKU of the district unit has planned to send 2,500 farmers from US Nagar to Delhi to join the stir. “Around 1,500 farmers have left for Delhi and 300 more farmers were sent to Delhi on Wednesday,” Sahota claimed. US Nagar is considered the grain bowl of Uttarakhand and farmers here are not happy with the farm laws, prompting their march to Delhi to participate in the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-farmers-to-join-anti-farm-laws-protests-in-delhi-ready-for-long-siege/story-UCICCZ08KaYqjMi1VItwpO.html

She carried a bounty of Rs 4 lakh on her head.A resident of Kurub village of Malkangiri district, Madkami had joined the “Sanskrutika Gana Natya Mandali” the cultural troupe of CPI (Maoist) seven years ago at the age of 16. She was given military training and was armed with a .303 rifle by the rebels. She worked in different areas of Koraput and Malkangiri district and also involved in large number of incidences of violence. After being promoted to the rank of ACM she was armed with an INSAS rifle.Police officials said Madkami was fed up with the anti-social attitude of the party and with their indiscriminate and unjustified violence against her own people. She was also disgusted with the civilian killings by the Maoists even after protests by local people. She also resented Telugu and Chhattishgarh cadres gaining an upper hand in the outfit and not treating those from Odisha well.She had suffered a bullet injury during an encounter in July in a forest in Andhra Pradesh but the Maoists did not provide proper medical treatment allegedly because she belonged to Odisha.“She realized that Maoist leaders are using innocent tribals of the region for their own vested interests. For that they are making innocent tribals to fight amongst themselves and once their utility is over, they are being branded as police informers and being killed mercilessly,” said a police official.Apart from the Rs 4 lakh bounty that the government had put on her, she will now get monetary assistance as according to per the Surrender and Rehabilitation Scheme of Government of Odisha. She will also get financial assistance for building house, pursuing studies and getting training in a trade/vocation of her will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-maoist-who-guarded-senior-rebel-leader-surrenders-to-odisha-police/story-oIUlia4HvUUqhkPXCJcojO.html

Additional chief secretary of health, PK Mohapatra, said the cost of the test was reduced due to the lowering of price of testing kits and other accessories from Rs 1,200 to Rs 46.Earlier, the price of RT-PCR test by private labs and hospitals was capped twice on July 3 and August 25, bringing it down to Rs 2,200 from Rs 4,500 and then to Rs 1200 respectively.The government is also planning to bring down the price of rapid antigen tests from Rs 450.Recently, states like Bihar, UP, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi reduced the maximum price of RT-PCR tests. While Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Bihar brought it down to Rs 800, UP has fixed it at Rs 700.The reduction in prices of the tests came after the Supreme Court issued notice to the Center, States, and Union Territories, seeking reply on a petition demanding the capping of the price of the RT-PCR test across the country at Rs 400.Also Read: Expelled BJD MLA Pradeep Panigrahy allegedly stayed in hotels that cost Rs 2.7 lakh a dayCovid-19 cases in Odisha are on a downward spiral since October with daily positivity rate hovering at less than 1.5%. Of the 40,000-odd tests done daily, around 6,000 are RT-PCR tests. The death rates have also come down to a single digit in the last 4 days, raising hopes that the state is on its way to control the pandemic. Till now, 319,583 people in Odisha have tested positive for the virus including 1,781, who succumbed to the infection.“The scene looks encouraging. But we can’t be complacent as winter is yet to settle fully in Odisha.

The meeting ended in a cordial atmosphere, and it was decided that we will oppose and fight jointly any law which is considered against the interests of the people of the region,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbalai said.Karbalai said both sides presented their view points on all issues and decided to continue talks in the larger interest of Ladakh.“We agreed on various issues but there were also difference of opinion on some issues. Such type of a meeting had taken place for the first time, and we welcome it,” he said, expressing hopes that they will together usher in a new era in Ladakh.Veteran politician and former Lok Sabha MP Thupstan Chhewang, who is the leader of the People’s Movement for Sixth Schedule, said, “This is most probably happening for the first time in the history of Ladakh that all segments of society from both the districts, including political and religious leaders, social activists and youth leaders, met to discuss the safeguards, security and opportunities.” The meeting discussed all the issues concerning the interests of Ladakh in a conducive atmosphere, and the leaders were unanimous to fight together any move which would be against the interests of Ladakh, Chhewang said.“We will fight together for the rights of the people of Ladakh,” he added.Referring to the apex body’s meeting with the Union home minister in September over its demand for inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of Constitution, Chhewang said they are yet to receive a fresh invitation from the home ministry but would like representatives of Kargil to join them in the meeting as well.“We will like to go together but if they (people of Kargil) get a separate invitation, they can meet the home minister separately as well,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/religious-political-groups-in-leh-kargil-hold-joint-meeting-decide-to-continue-talks/story-okvyupJysUWpJ7N7lOBRYN.html
02-12-2020||India||Amit Shah, Amarinder Singh to meet tomorrow before talks with farmers||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh will meet Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday ahead of the Centre’s much-awaited meeting with the representatives of the agitating farmers. The Shah-Singh meeting will take place at 9.30am. Wednesday’s meeting between farmers and the Centre is crucial as this is the fourth such meeting — all previous meetings being fruitless — over the grievances against the three farm bills passed recently by Parliament. Reports said Amarinder Singh will hold deliberations with Shah in an effort to work out an amicable solution to the deadlock. Amit Shah, on Wednesday, held deliberations with agricultural minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways minister Piyush Goyal on ways to dispel concerns over the farm laws.On its 7th day, the farmers’ protests got a shot in the arm as transporters have also come forward calling for a nationwide strike from December 8 onwards. All-India Motor Transport Congress, the body that has called the strike, represents about 10 million truckers, which will massively hit the movement of essential goods across north India.The protesting farmers on Wednesday demanded the central government call a special session of Parliament to repeal new farm laws. With traffic in the Capital being thrown out of gear on Wednesday because of the protest, they have also threatened to block other roads of the national capital if their demands are not met.The ongoing protests led to several divisions and disagreement so far. Brickbats were being exchanged between Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart ML Khattar over the “use of force” by the Haryana Police on the protesting farmers. On the other hand, Khattar demanded that he wanted to talk to Punjab CM over the farmers’ issues as he didn’t want the protest amid Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, Singh and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal got engaged in a verbal face-off over the ongoing protests. Meanwhile, one of the farmers’ organisations — Krantikari Kisan Union — alleged that the Centre was dividing farmers’ organisations by projecting the ongoing protests as Punjab-centric.Thousands of farmers representing over 30 farmers’ organisations have been agitating in the national Capital since Saturday, responding to the “Delhi Chalo” call against the agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre in September.Thursday’s meeting will be the fourth meeting on the issue and the second meeting amid the ongoing protest. Over 35 farmer leaders had held a three-hour meeting on Tuesday at Vigyan Bhavan with the ministerial delegation. Though their first round of talks on Tuesday did not yield a breakthrough but both sides agreed to hold the next round of talks on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-amarinder-singh-to-meet-tomorrow-before-talks-with-farmers/story-KR0ZZrdyf6uJOcTSTFcVmI.html

This is the first such tough action against a politician of the ruling BJP in Gujarat, which came after a strong reprimand by the high court. Earlier too, in the wake of political rallies by the BJP and the Congress in the run up to the recent assembly by-elections, the court had observed that the politicians in the state should behave responsibly to send the right message to the people. In this case, the event was organised by Kanti Gamit on November 30 at Doswada village in Tapi district. The video showed hundreds of people dancing, throwing all Covid-19 guidelines to the winds. He was arrested under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code.Also Read: Travel agents get enquiries from Indians keen on going to UK for Covid-19 vaccineHe admitted it was a mistake to allow such a large gathering at the function. “I apologise for the mistake. We had organised Tulsi Vivah and my granddaughter’s engagement ceremony together but didn’t invite anyone personally. We’d prepared food for 2,000 people and also organised dance. Someone made the video & it went viral,” he told reporters on Wednesday. Gujarat has more than 2.11 lakh positive cases and the death toll has crossed 4,000.

02-12-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Is Pfizer approval hasty? Can Indians get vaccinated in UK? All you need to know||Britain on Wednesday raced past the United States and Europe as its regulator cleared Pfizer vaccine candidate for emergency use. The vaccine will be rolled out from early next week in Britain. The approval in a record time has led to some suspicion as well as curiosities. Here is all you need to know:1. The vaccine is about 95 per cent effective at preventing Covid-19.2. From January onwards, some 60 million to 70 million doses of the vaccine could be available per month. 3. The World Health Organization is reviewing the vaccine for possible listing for emergency use.4. The European Union criticised Britain’s rapid approval of Pfizer. Pfizer is a US company and BioNTech is a German company. Neither the US nor Germany has yet approved the vaccine.5. The vaccine makers, however, have assured that no corners have been cut and the vaccine shot has not been developed in a short span of time. It is the cumulative results since SARS and MERS outbreaks.6. The vaccine, as it was claimed, needs a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celcius for long-time storage.7. However, it can be stored in normal refrigeration for a shorter period of time.8. India didn’t conduct any trial of Pfizer vaccine. Talking about the vaccine, top officials earlier said that India may not need to procure Pfizer. Even if it does, it would not happen immediately.9. A report said Indian travel agents are receiving enquiries for UK trip as several Indians want to get the benefit of the mass vaccination drive.10. It might not be that easy for tourists from India to get the vaccine shot. Boris Johnson, who might take the vaccine shot on television to show it is safe, has warned people of the UK that there are several logistical challenges. He has urged UK people to not be carried away with over-optimism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-is-pfizer-approval-hasty-can-indians-get-vaccinated-in-uk-all-you-need-to-know/story-UcFcPn2ONYpnItdzMnUMRL.html
02-12-2020||India||Travel agents get enquiries from Indians keen on going to UK for Covid-19 vaccine||Travel agents have started receiving enquiries from Indians who want to travel to the UK as soon as possible to get the Covid-19 vaccine that was approved on Wednesday by the British government.One travel agent is planning to launch a three-night package for the Indians who want to get the benefit of the mass vaccination drive in the UK that is likely to begin as early as next week.The UK on Wednesday became the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 after “rigorous” analysis by its independent regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A Mumbai-based travel agent told the PTI that some people on Wednesday raised queries on “how and when and if” they can travel to the UK to get the Covid-19 vaccine. “I have told them it is too early to say (whether Indians can get vaccine in UK). Anyway, the first in line to the get the vaccine would be the elderly and health workers in the UK who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus,” the agent added.Nishant Pitti, Co-founder and CEO, EaseMyTrip.com said while this is an offbeat season for travel to London, after Wednesday’s announcement about the Pfizer vaccine he has already received queries from some Indians who have got UK visas and can afford to go to London.He said his company was waiting for clarity from the UK government on whether there would be compulsory quarantine requirements for travellers who want to get vaccinated and whether Indian passport holders are eligible for vaccination there or not.Pitti said his company is planning to launch a three-night package for those interested in travelling to the UK for the purpose of vaccination only. “We are dealing with an airline to offer fixed price seats. We already have deals with London hotels. And we are planning to do some deal with a hospital over there so that we can generate a package for that,” he explained.The recent UK government rules state that from December 15, every international arrival in the UK would have to remain in self isolation for five days and then get the RT-PCR test done on the sixth day. The passenger can leave isolation on the sixth day if found COVID-negative in the test. On Wednesday, a Bengaluru-based travel company said Indians are asking if a short trip, without quarantine, to the UK to get the Pfizer vaccine was possible.However, Jyoti Mayal, President, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) told PTI that people are right now “waiting and watching” as they want to know what the vaccine is going to be like. “Though the government has said there would be no side effects of the vaccine, people want to watch all this before getting the shot,” Mayal noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travel-agents-get-enquiries-from-indians-keen-on-going-to-uk-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-YSLgogGaZWHUy7I0e2pMIK.html
02-12-2020||India||AP govt withdraws law for speedy trial in rape and murder cases after Centre’s objections||Nearly a year after enacting a legislation to expedite trial and sentencing in rape and murder cases within 21 days, the Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday withdrew the law following queries raised by the Centre. State home minister Mekathoti Sucharita introduced a bill in the assembly on Wednesday seeking to withdraw the Andhra Pradesh Disha Bill – Andhra Pradesh Special Courts for Specified Offences against Women and Children Bill, 2019. It was named after a Hyderabad-based veterinarian who was raped and killed by four youths on November 28 last year and was given a pseudonym Disha. The legislation, which was passed by the state assembly on December 13 last year, sought to complete investigation into alleged rape and murder cases, conduct of trial in special courts and awarding of sentences to the accused within 21 days. The legislation was later sent to the Centre for Presidential assent, since it required certain amendments to the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to the Centre several times and even took it up personally with Union home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visits to New Delhi.An official in the Andhra Pradesh home ministry familiar with the development said the Union home ministry and law ministry which examined the state legislation raised certain objections, since it required a lot of amendments to the IPC and CrPC. “The Disha Act suggested changes in certain sections of the IPC and CrPC with a view to making them applicable only in Andhra Pradesh. The Union law ministry objected to it, saying it might not be possible to accept it in its present form, as changes cannot be made only for a particular state. If it has to amend the IPC and CrPC, it has to do for the entire country,” the official said.As a result, the state government withdrew the bill. “A fresh legislation would be introduced in the assembly after incorporating suggestions given by the Centre,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-govt-withdraws-law-for-speedy-trial-in-rape-and-murder-cases-after-centre-s-objections/story-CHZrmc6dPpyPthgDgHB53N.html
02-12-2020||India||After Suvendu Adhikari, another disgruntled TMC MLA fans speculation||Hours after rebel Trinamool Congress (TMC) lawmaker Suvendu Adhikari told the leadership that it is not possible for him to work for the party, Silbhadra Dutta, the legislator from Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, fanned speculations on Wednesday afternoon with an intriguing one-liner posted on Facebook. “Bondhu dekha hobe…..” (we will meet my friend), Dutta wrote in bold Bengali script, keeping the sentence incomplete and using a saffron template as background. Since Dutta recently became vocal against I-Pac, the company owned by election strategist Prashant Kishor, and declared that he will not contest the assembly polls due early next year, his post immediately drew attention. Most of Dutta’s followers on social media concluded that he would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said he had taken the right decision. There was not a single adverse reaction on his post till 6.45 pm. Dutta could not be contacted. TMC district president and food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick said, “He is aggrieved with certain decisions of the party. If he joins the BJP, it will be his personal decision. He is a nice man. I don’t want him to leave.” “We will certainly welcome Dutta if he joins us,” Arjun Singh, the BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP, told HT. “The way Mamata Banerjee is running the party, using the police administration and projecting her nephew Abhishek Banerjee as the future leader, it is only natural that all the good people in the TMC will leave,” he added. Singh left the TMC and wrested Barrackpore in 2019 when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. Incidentally, Mihir Goswami, the TMC lawmaker from the Cooch Behar South assembly seat in north Bengal, resigned from the party and joined the BJP in Delhi on Friday. Suvendu Adhikari, the lawmaker from Nandigram in East Midnapore district, resigned from the cabinet the same day. He was in charge of three important departments, including transport. Also Read: Cannot work with the party, says TMC rebel Adhikari after talks A representative from I-Pac met Dutta on Tuesday morning in an apparent bid to bridge the differences but it had no impact on the senior lawmaker. Mullick, too, fixed an appointment and went to his residence in the evening but Dutta was not home. The minister waited for more than an hour and left. “The talks should have taken place long ago. It is too late now. I have announced that I will not contest the polls. I don’t change my stand once I take it,” Dutta had said two days ago. On November 1, he told the media that he was feeling obsolete in the TMC. “I do not believe that political decisions can be taken by a hired commercial agency. The agency cannot lecture me on politics. I feel obsolete here,” he said. Also Read: Oxford Union debating society postpones Mamata Banerjee’s virtual address at last minuteOn Wednesday afternoon, Adhikari informed the leadership that it was not possible for him to work for the party. He wrote in a text message to Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy that the problems he was having in the TMC were far from over. This happened less than 14 hours after the TMC said that Adhikari told top leaders at a discreetly held meeting on Tuesday evening that he would not leave the party. Roy had called up chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the middle of the meeting and handed over the phone to Adhikari. “She told him that we all must work together and he agreed,” Roy said on Wednesday. Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor were present at the meeting along with Roy and Lok Sabha member Sudip Bandopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-suvendu-adhikari-another-disgruntled-tmc-mla-fans-speculation/story-QwA6UYK8O203LOkdK3WZvN.html

I have pointed out precedents in similar cases where the person has been released earlier. I want similar consideration for my client,” Sasikala’s lawyer Raja Sendoor Pandian said.In November, Sasikala had also deposited Rs 10 crore which was the fine amount ordered by the court and was a condition for her release.The senior prison official who did not want to be identified as he is not authorised to speak on ‘politically sensitive cases’, said the application for remission and early release has been forwarded to higher authorities. ‘There is no time binding on when the remission application should be considered,’ he said.The prison authorities are supposed to take into consideration allegations of special benefits which Sasikala was apparently receiving as alleged by the then deputy inspector general of police (prisons) Roopa Moudgil in 2017 which created a furore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-applies-for-early-remission-and-release-from-bengaluru-prison/story-KJiG9UXoFr0bA9f9kvy0gO.html

The spokesperson of the Chinese embassy, Ji Rong, outlined Beijing’s position in response to reports that a planned “super” dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo, close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Tibet, could have far-reaching consequences for water security for India’s northeastern states. The trans-border Yarlung Zangbo, which originates in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), flows into Arunachal Pradesh, where it is called Siang, and then to Assam as the Brahmaputra before flowing into Bangladesh. Chinese state media reported on Sunday that the dam would be built in Medog county of TAR, close to India’s Arunachal Pradesh state, and its hydropower generation capacity could be three times that of central China’s Three Gorges Dam, which has the world’s largest installed capacity. China has already built several smaller dams on the Yarlung Zangbo. Also Read: China ‘planned’ Galwan Valley clash, US commission says in report to CongressResponding to concerns that new projects on the Yarlung Zangbo will impact downstream countries, spokesperson Ji said in a statement: “Any project will undergo scientific planning and demonstration with full consideration for the impact on the downstream areas and the interests of both upstream and downstream countries. “At present, the downstream development of the Yarlung Zangbo river is still in the stage of preliminary planning and demonstration. There is no need to over-interpret it.” Also Read: Indian Navy ensured deterrence against any misadventure by PLA navy: Vice Admiral ChawlaJi also said China had “always taken a responsible attitude towards the development and utilisation of cross-border rivers” and has a policy whereby “protection goes together with development”.

02-12-2020||India||Nepal foreign minister to visit India this month to restore normalcy to bilateral ties||Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali is set to visit India this month for a meeting with his counterpart S Jaishankar aimed at boosting efforts to restore normalcy to bilateral ties hit by a border row earlier this year. Gyawali will be the senior-most Nepalese leader to visit India since ties were derailed in May, when Kathmandu issued a new political map that included Indian territories. The map was issued in response to India opening a strategic road to the Lipulekh border region, which is claimed by Nepal. After months of rancour, Nepal signalled its intention of resetting ties when Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on telephone on August 15 to exchange greetings on Independence Day. Back-to-back visits to Nepal by Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) head Samant Goel, Indian Army chief General MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had prepared the grounds for Gyawali’s trip to India in the later part of December, people familiar with developments in New Delhi and Kathmandu said on condition of anonymity. “Foreign minister Gyawali is expected to visit New Delhi to chair a meeting of the India-Nepal joint commission. The dates are yet to be announced,” said one of the people cited above. During Shringla’s visit to Nepal last month, the two sides underscored the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities and handling the boundary issue under appropriate bilateral mechanisms, while at the same time taking forward cooperation on connectivity and development projects. The meeting of the joint commission is expected to be preceded by consultations between officials of the two sides on a range of issues, including trade and transit, and water resources.

The bench was hearing a writ petition filed by Kamini Devi and Ajay Kumar of Farrukhabad. The petitioners contended before the court that both of them are adults and in love with each other. They have been living together as a couple for the last six months but Kamini’s parents were harassing them as they want her to marry another man. The couple said they made a complaint to the SSP, Farrukhabad in this regard on March 17 but their application was still pending.  The bench while allowing the petition observed, “We are of the view that the petitioners are at liberty to live together and no person shall be permitted to interfere in their peaceful living, as Right to Life is a fundamental right insured under Article 21 of the Constitution of India in which it is provided that no person shall be deprived of his right to life and personal liberty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-adults-can-live-together-without-interference-from-families-allahabad-hc/story-YUYEzuAe102zPDWb1EFIaO.html

A senior official of the management said the bank has deposited Rs 5.24 crore into their accounts.The imposing monument of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called as the Statue of Unity (SoU), is located at Kevadia in Narmada district.

Limited tickets are sold online.Offline sale of tickets at the counter has been stopped, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statue-of-unity-ticket-sale-case-fir-registered-against-officers-for-not-depositing-rs-5-24-cr/story-gEfVMbzE3t1dPD5R8O0AoN.html

Also read: With govt’s pro-farmer image under fire, BJP wants amicable end to farm protestsTomar also said that they will see to what extent issues can be resolved as they hold discussions with farmers’ leaders tomorrow.

The farmers, hailing from Punjab and Haryana, in their “Delhi Chalo” march had demanded the ruling dispensation agrees to hear their objections on the clearance of farm laws which, collectively, have paved way for agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.Also read: No agreement between farm unions, govt: Who said what during meetingAfter days of protest along Delhi border and within the national capital, the government on Monday initiated talks with the representatives of farm union organisation leaders but the dialogue remained inconclusive, without any sign of resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-address-farmers-concerns-govt-ahead-of-2nd-meet-with-farm-union-leaders-amid-deadlock/story-sQxSS81far8sE8J6NIc6zL.html

The Delhi government on November 23 notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday lashed out at the Delhi government and accused it of “working behind the farmers’ backs”, ANI reported.Kejriwal in response to these allegations said, “Punjab CM has made allegations against me that I’ve passed the black laws in Delhi. How can he do such low-level politics in this fragile situation? It’s not up to the state govt to implement it. Had it been so, why would farmers of the country hold talks with the Centre?”Kejriwal asked Singh if he is accusing the Delhi CM in a bid to form a friendship with BJP. He said, “So, is it the pressure of these people that you are putting allegations against me? Are you doing it for friendship with BJP or are you under pressure as the Enforcement Directorate has filed a case against your family?”Kejriwal defended the Delhi government’s decision to notify the farm law by saying that the state government cannot repeal them. Only, the Centre can roll back these laws since they had introduced them, he said.More than 30 farmers’ groups have gathered at the several locations across the Delhi-Haryana border protesting against the three farm bills passed by the Centre during the monsoon session of Parliament in September. They have demanded that the Centre rollback the farm laws, claiming that the new laws will affect the procurement of grains under the minimum support price system and will pave the way for corporate farming.The protests which began on November 25 saw clashes between Haryana police and the farmers. Haryana Police officials on November 25 fired tear gas shells and water cannons at the agitating farmers but the farmers managed to break barricades and enter New Delhi. While most farmers are protesting near the Singhu border, some farmers have continued their protests at DDA ground in Burari. On November 29, farmers groups rejected to talk with the Centre over the issues concerning the new bills and demanded that a high-level committee should listen to their grievances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-accuses-amarinder-singh-of-low-level-politics-says-he-is-under-pressure-from-ed/story-w8xYvl8yWL0LlE1fNZqiDL.html

We remain strong. We remain prepared...,” he said.India and China have held eight rounds of high-level military talks till November during the over six month long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh which also saw a bloody clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead, with the Chinese side also reportedly suffering casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-ensured-deterrence-against-any-misadventure-by-pla-navy-vice-admiral-chawla/story-y3c3By8qxYR8d7qA7i8pPI.html

Mahra who is a one of the most vocal and influential Congress MLAs made the allegation days after a controversy rocked the party following a meeting of some MLAs and MPs in Haldwani where they announced that the upcoming Assembly elections would be fought under Congress national general secretary and former chief minister Harish Rawat. Following the announcement, the Congress headquarters had to issue a statement the next day saying that the party has not taken any decision on the matter and state unit chief is still Pritam Singh who would lead the members. Mahra who is considered close to Rawat said Tuesday night, “There are some people within the party who are conspiring against it. They are working as BJP’s sleeper cells to create indifferences between the state leadership.” Continuing his attack without taking any name he said, “These people haven’t fought even ward level elections but are busy passing statements against senior leaders. All senior leaders should identify such elements around them and oust them from the party.” “Complaints should also be lodged against them in the party high command,” he said. The BJP rubbished Mahra’s “sleeper cells” charge and said the Congress was directionless.“There are different factions in the Congress led by their senior leaders including Harish Rawat, Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh. They all go in different directions which is an open secret. Why are they coming up with fiction like BJP sleeper cells?,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president. He went on to say, “It seems that Congress has lost its mental balance. Instead of blaming us for the issues in their party, they should put their house in order.” Political expert MM Semwal said until the Congress resolves its differences it would be difficult for them to win the 2022 elections. “It is an open secret that there are different factions in the Congress led by Harish Rawat, Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh. All of them are vying for the state leadership,” said Semwal. He said, “Apart from this, there are leadership issues in their national unit also. Unless the Congress leaders get united, it will be difficult for them to fight against BJP in 2022 who are already in poll mode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-in-uttarakhand-blames-bjp-sleeper-cells-for-differences-in-party/story-2t10nFWUKwGFaXbfduFwaL.html
02-12-2020||India||It’s an open competition, not stealing investment from any state: Yogi on film city project||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that he is not “stealing” any business from Maharashtra. Adityanath, who was on a one-day visit to Mumbai to attract investors, said the setting up of a film city in the state an “open competition”. The UP CM’s statement comes a day after his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray said that he will not allow anyone to take business out of Maharashtra.There’s a tussle between the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh over the alleged plot of the latter to move the film industry out of Mumbai. Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Wednesday asked if UP CM is going to visit other cities where the film industry is big or is he targeting only Mumbai.Speaking to press at the end of marathon meetings with business leaders, investors and film personalities, the UP CM said that his government is building a “world-class” film city in Noida, which will be well-connected by road and air with Delhi, Lucknow, Agra, etc.“The new film city will be built on a 1000-acre plot 6km from the proposed Noida international greenfield airport in Jewar. It will be connected to Delhi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Agra and state capital Lucknow. The interest shown by the people associated with the film industry is a good sign,” he said.Earlier in the day, Raut said, “It is not easy to move the film city out of Mumbai. Attempts have been made earlier also, but how will you recreate the atmosphere of Mumbai in UP and Bihar. Is he going to visit other cities in south India, West Bengal as they have big film industry or is he only locking horns with Mumbai?” Raut also asked Yogi Adityanath on the prospect of film city in Uttar Pradesh.“How can anybody take away anything from somebody. It is not a wallet to steal. This is an open competition and whoever can give a secure atmosphere, better facilities and most importantly, social security in which all people can work… The film city in Mumbai will continue to work. A film city in UP will be built as per the requirement, in a new atmosphere,” said Yogi.Responding to Raut’s question through the media, Adityanath said, “We have not come to take anything. We are building a new [film city]. Why are you so worried? We are giving a world-class infrastructure.” He also held meetings with companies interested in investing in his state, including N Chandrasekaran, chairman Tata Sons, Niranjan Hiranandani, CMD Hiranandani group, and Baba N Kalyani of Kalyani Group. “I also met with companies who are interested in investing or have invested in the defence manufacturing corridor, including Adani Defence, L&T Defence, Mahindra Defence, Hinduja, Seimens etc. Their suggestions have been taken. For the film city, we spoke to personalities from the industry about their requirements,” he said.The chief minister also listed Rs 200 crore bond of Lucknow Municipal Corporation, the first civic body in north India. “Uttar Pradesh has the highest municipal bodies in the country. Nearly 80 million population lives in urban areas. In a bid to provide better infrastructure and facilities we have listed bond for Lucknow Municipal Corporation, the first civic body in north India. After Lucknow, we will inspire Ghaziabad to do the same. This move will help bring in transparency and financial discipline in their workings, along with creating healthy competition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-s-an-open-competition-not-stealing-investment-from-any-state-yogi-on-film-city-project/story-MqMZsQlIUDMXKTUvfXWOXI.html

He had first appeared before the CCB on November 26 for an enquiry. The CCB has registered a case against Karnan under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including Section 228 (intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceeding), Section 509 (word or gesture intended to insult the modesty of any woman) and Section 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot). A division bench of the Madras high court is hearing the case against Karnan. The Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have sought criminal action against the former judge. The court, on Monday, had summoned the Chennai city commissioner of police and director general of police to be present for the hearing on December 7.His interrogation began after the Madras high court directed the director-general of police to supervise the investigation and the city commissioner to monitor the probe into the case.During the recent hearing in November, the state informed the court that they have blocked his videos from YouTube and are taking steps to block more content.Also Read: Cyclone Burevi to cross Tamil Nadu coast on Friday: All you need to knowThe court had observed that Karnan’s “repeated utterances would undermine the dignity, reputation, honour and majesty of the Institution.”Karnan is the first serving high court judge to have been found guilty of contempt by the Supreme Court in 2017 for allegations against judges. He served six months in a Kolkata jail and was released in December 2017.Justice Karnan had previously denied any wrongdoing, saying he was just highlighting the upper caste bias in the higher judiciary in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-hc-judge-c-s-karnan-arrested-for-insulting-sc-judges-women/story-w6TZS2WATU91lEiojH737M.html

Adhikari sent a text message to TMC leader Saugata Roy saying his problems with the TMC were far from over. He did respond to calls and text messages for comments.Adhikari’s response came a day after TMC said the legislator told top leaders at a meeting that he would not leave the party. Roy called up chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the middle of the meeting and handed over the phone to Adhikari. “She told him that we all must work together and he agreed,” Roy said on Wednesday.TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant kishor were present at the meeting along with Roy and Sudip Bandopadhyay.TMC leaders told HT last month that Adhikari was specifically unhappy with Banerjee and Kishor’s organisational decisions. TMC roped in Kishor after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 18 out of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.Adhikari, who was earlier appointed TMC’s election observer, had demanded that leaders of his choice be fielded next year from around 65 assembly seats. This was unacceptable to the leadership.Adhikari, who resigned from the state cabinet on Friday, and Abhishek Banerjee even took pot shots at each other.The people cited above said Adhikari has expressed unhappiness that the leadership briefed the media about the talks since it was decided that he would do so at a press conference a few days later.Adhikari texted Roy about the problems he has had with the party and offered an apology. “I communicated to you [the media] truthfully whatever happened at the meeting last evening and whatever emerged in the presence of five people present there. If there is any change of mind on the part of Suvendu, it is for him to decide and communicate to the media,” Roy said. “I will not say whether I talked to him after last night’s meeting. Yes, I received his message.”Asked whether there was a scope for more discussions, Roy said, “I do not see that happening right now if someone has changed his mind.”On Tuesday, Roy said the talks went extremely well. “Suvendu said he is very much with the party. I invited Abhishek Banerjee and Adhikari to sit for talks. Adhikari will make his position public. I had been saying all along that he would not leave the TMC.”Roy and Bandopadhyay have been holding talks with Adhikari over the past two weeks on the instructions of Mamata Banerjee.There has been speculation that Adhikari might join the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-work-with-the-party-says-tmc-rebel-adhikari-after-talks/story-OLSmFgqefymirtSnuKg3JI.html

In her application, she asked the apex court to not pass any order without hearing her side of the case — in case the BMC moves the apex court challenging the high court’s order. A division bench of the Bombay high court, on Friday, struck down a September 9 order issued by the BMC to demolish several unauthorised alterations made by actor Kangana Ranaut at her Pali Hill bungalow in Bandra (West).The bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and Riyaz Chagla held that the civic action was “actuated by malafides” and accepted the actor’s claim seeking compensation for damage caused by the illegal action. The bench said that the actor is justified in claiming damages in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the Sunbeam Hightech Developers case, where the court held that it can award compensation where demolition was carried out illegally, even if the structure was unauthorized.In the 166-page judgment, the high court bench said that it does not approve unauthorized construction, and also does not approve of loose and irresponsible statements (as made by Ranaut) against any individual, authority or Government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-moves-supreme-court-in-demolition-row-files-caveat/story-m3U7XUFz9Ac01zrsIEKi3J.html

They say the laws are a precursor to the withdrawal of government support for farming, and will replace existing middlemen with more powerful corporate entities.In a statement, the AIMTC said the transporters are extending unstinted support to the farmer agitation. “They are fighting for their legitimate rights. Like the road transport sector of India, the farm sector is indeed the backbone and lifeline of the nation…Over 70 percent of the rural households depend on agriculture. Entire North India is affected and thousands of trucks carrying food, vegetables, and other perishable and non-perishable items coming from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, J&K [Jammu & Kashmir] are impacted and we still support them as 65% of the trucks are engaged in carrying farm produce,” the statement said.“...it is the season of apples, which are getting wasted, apart from that potatoes, onions and other fruits and vegetables as well as other essential commodities like medicines, milk, etc as their movement is disrupted, which is leading to their shortage in Delhi and in other northern states. The situation will get acute in days to come unless the government takes prudent and pragmatic steps to resolve farmers’ concerns... [The farmers] are fighting their lone battle.”The farmers have been protesting for a week over the laws that allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system. The laws permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farm leaders say the laws will leave them at the mercy of private buyers and vulnerable to exploitation.Thousands of farmers, who are marching from various states towards the national capital to protest against the laws, have blocked all major entry points to New Delhi, demanding a repeal of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-transporters-call-for-nation-wide-strike-in-support-threaten-to-halt-supply-of-essential-goods/story-MmMM75KNxhKjq6LPNAxKuM.html

September had recorded a steep rise in cases to reach 37,372 from 17,339 in August.Also read | New single dose vaccine shows protection against Covid-19: StudyBreaking down the numbers, November recorded an average of 514 daily cases against an average of 632 daily cases in October, 1,245 daily cases in September and 559 daily cases in August.“The overall prevalence of the disease is reducing now in comparison to the past months. There are fewer deaths as well,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, nodal officer, Covid19, and head of the department of community medicine, Government Medical College Srinagar.In terms of fatalities, November saw the least number in the past four months. In the UT, 216 people lost their lives due to the virus in November, a notable decrease from October’s 293 deaths. The highest monthly death count was recorded in September with 478 people succumbing to the virus as against 326 in August.Seven deaths a day were recorded daily on an average in November, 10 in October against 16 in September.Khan said the prevalence of Covid-19 antibodies in 39% of the population of Kashmir, as revealed in a study, was a major reason for the decline. “In context of serum prevalence, our at-risk population is getting lower.

The matter would be now heard on January 7.Also read | HC dismisses plea challenging several questions of Delhi Higher Judicial Service examThe plea claimed that the three surveillance systems allow Central and state law enforcement agencies to intercept and monitor all telecommunications in bulk which is an infringement of the fundamental right to privacy of individuals.While CMS is a surveillance system under which all forms of communications, like telephone calls, WhatsApp messages and emails, are intercepted and monitored, NETRA has been developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAIR) to monitor internet traffic for the use of keywords such as attack, bomb, blast or kill in tweets or status updates on social media platforms, emails or blogs, the plea has said.NATGRID, the plea said, is “a counter-terrorism initiative to be undertaken on public-private partnership that will utilise technologies like Big Data and advanced analytics to study and analyse huge amounts of data and metadata’’ related to individuals from various standalone databases belonging to various agencies and ministries of the Indian government”.Under the NATGRID system, tax and bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and immigration records and itineraries of rail and air travel would be monitored, the plea has said.During the proceedings, Bhushan submitted that even though the apex court has held that financial details and travel plans of citizens cannot be intercepted or monitored except in larger public interest and in accordance with the laws, an RTI reply said 7,500 to 9,000 permissions were being routinely granted every month for intercepting and monitoring communications of citizens and the committee which is to review such permissions sits only once in two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-seeks-centre-s-response-in-plea-against-surveillance-systems/story-GRTYTGIzLSnwglnoXSckNK.html
02-12-2020||India||36 years on, Bhopal gas tragedy survivors battle obesity, thyroid disorders||A clinic run by a trust for treatment of Bhopal gas tragedy survivors has claimed that they are suffering from obesity and thyroid disorders that are also responsible for a host of other ailments.Sambhavna Trust Clinic made the claim on Tuesday ahead of the 36th anniversary of the tragedy, which falls on December 3. “Our analysis of data on body mass index and diagnosis of thyroid malfunction of 27,155 persons under care for the last 15 years at the clinic, shows that persons exposed to Union Carbide’s poisonous gases were 2.75 times more likely of being overweight or obese and that they were 1.92 times more likely to suffer from thyroid disease compared to those who had not been exposed to gas.” said Dr Sanjay Shrivastav, physician at the clinic. Satinath Sarangi, managing trustee of Sambhavna Trust, said, “Higher obesity due to gas exposure is likely to have made survivors vulnerable to various diseases like diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis and cancers of the liver, kidney, breast and ovary etc. Survivors having thyroid diseases at almost double the usual rate, indicate that in addition to several other systems in human bodies, the endocrine system has also been damaged due to exposure to Union Carbide’s gases.” Chingari Trust, another organisation organised a candle light march in Bhopal on Tuesday to pay homage to those killed in the tragedy. Meanwhile, four organisations working for justice to survivors of the tragedy have demanded that Union Carbide and its owner Dow Chemical pay additional compensation for the long term injuries caused to the survivors who were exposed to the gas as evidenced during the current Covid-19 pandemic. “Official records suggest that Covid-19 death rate in the gas exposed population is 6.5 times more than that of the non-gas exposed population of the Bhopal district,” four organisations including Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh, Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha, Bhopal Group for Information & Action and Children Against Dow Carbide said in a joint statement.“The pandemic has exposed the official lie that 93% of those exposed to Union Carbide’s poisonous gases had only temporary injuries. We have official records that show that the gas exposed population, that is 17% of the district’s population of 2.8 million, has contributed to 56% of the Covid-19 deaths in the district so far. It is time the Indian government present these data and other hospital records before the Supreme Court that is yet to hear the Curative Petition for additional compensation for damage caused by the December 1984 disaster,” said the statement. As per a state government affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in 2006 the tragedy had killed 3,787 people and affected more than 5.58 lakh other people in the state capital after toxic gas leaked from erstwhile Union Carbide factory which was closed after the tragedy, on the night of December 2, 1984. However, the organisations fighting for the cause of victims claim the tragedy had killed more than 15,000 people. A report released in April, 2019 by International Labour Organisation (ILO) dubbed the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy as one among the world’s “major industrial accidents” of the 20th century. The report stated at least 30 tons of methyl isocyanate gas released from the Union Carbide pesticide plant had affected more than 600,000 people including workers and nearby inhabitants. Despite efforts minister for Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Vishwas Sarang and additional chief secretary of the department Mohd Suleman could not be contacted for their comments. The ruling BJP said that its government has undertaken a number of measures to provide relief to the survivors.“The BJP government has not only been sympathetic to the Bhopal gas tragedy victims but also it has undertaken a number of measures to provide them relief like strengthening health facilities in the state capital for them inter alia. The government is always open to accepting the suggestions and demands from the organsiations working for the survivors,” BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/36-years-on-bhopal-gas-tragedy-survivors-battle-obesity-thyroid-disorders/story-4YewWUpdXK42S7UVORzC5I.html

02-12-2020||India||Goa govt blinks first, shows willingness to auction iron ore mines||The Goa government has signalled a change of heart and a willingness to auction dormant leases in a bid to restart mining in the state, halted since March 2018 after the Supreme Court cancelled Goa’s mining renewals. On return from Delhi, where he held a meeting with the Union home minister Amit Shah, also attended by the ministers of mines and petroleum, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said that a ‘solution’ through auctions was being considered. “We will come out with a solution through auctions. We want the mining activity to resume once again. So thinking of all this we have arrived at a consensus that we can work out a similar solution,” Sawant told reporters. Sawant’s announcement is a marked departure from the State government’s policy which, till date, has resisted auctions owing to what former chief minister Manohar Parrikar described as ‘inviting unknown business interests, who are often referred to as mining mafia, to carry out and undertake mining activities.’Mining in Goa is stuck in a deadlock with the Supreme Court directing that the state issue fresh leases and the MMDR Act in its current form mandating that any grant of fresh leases should be through a process of auction. Auctions could throw open Goa’s mines, hitherto held by a handful of family run companies, to bigger players from across the country. Sawant admitted that the Goa government was reluctant to opt for auctions, but hastened to add that it was only because of the interests of the mining workers, truckers, etc who he feared might be offloaded with new players entering the industry and not to protect the interests of the existing mine owners. “We were worried about the local workers, truck owners, machinery owners, farmers, etc. If tomorrow someone from outside wins a bid then would these people who were onboard with the existing operators, be left behind?

The National Green Tribunal in its statement said, “NGT says total ban on sale, use of all firecrackers during COVID-19 pandemic in NCR and all cities/towns where air quality is ‘poor’.”NGT permitted using green crackers during Christmas at places where ambient air quality levels remain above ‘moderate’ or better between 11:55 pm to 12:30 pm. In its directive NGT has also asked the district magistrates to ensure that there is no sale of banned firecrackers. It also instructed the District Magistrates to recover compensation from people violating the NGT’s order. NGT said if individuals face problems due to burning of firecrackers they can consult the district magistrate for compensation. It said, “Any victim of pollution, apart from other remedies, can approach the District Magistrate for compensation.”The air quality in New Delhi remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the air quality levels are likely to remain in this category throughout the week.The Central Pollution Control Board which is implementing the GRAP protocols in the city said that pollution levels in November were higher than last year. CPCB on Tuesday shared the results of their findings and pointed out that the monthly average air quality index (AQI) this November was 327.9, as compared to 312.2 in November 2019. Several states like Delhi had imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers before Diwali. West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan and Sikkim had imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers owing to pollution and it leading to poor air quality. Haryana, Maharashtra and Karnataka had not imposed a blanket ban but asked citizens to exercise restraint while burning firecrackers. Punjab and Haryana designated specific timings for citizens to burn crackers while Karnataka allowed the sale of green crackers during Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-firecracker-sale/story-0m7RMkAgIYOk2EA0NJgOCM.html

The deceased were identified as Asif Khan (50), Nazia Begum (45), Nazia Bano (36), Sania (17), Arshad (28), Asra Bano (6). Five others, including Syed Ali, Begum, Nausheer and Anwar Khan, besides an infant, sustained injuries. All of them are from Tadbund area in Secunderabad. “Two of the injured, Syed Ali and Begum, whose condition is critical, have been shifted to a private hospital in Hyderabad and the remaining two are being treated at Chevella government hospital,” Chevella inspector of police Balakrishna told reporters. According to the inspector, all the 11 members of the family left for Gurmatkal in Yadgir district of Karnataka in a Toyota Innova car early in the morning. “As they crossed Kandawada village on the outskirts of Chevella town, the driver of their SUV, in a bid to overtake another vehicle in front of him at a road turning, failed to notice a truck carrying a borewell rig coming in the opposite direction, and rammed it,” he said. The SUV got mangled completely and six members of the family were crushed to death on the spot. “The bodies of the deceased were shifted to the mortuary of the government hospital Chevella and the case is being investigated,” Balakrishna said. The accident severely affected the movement of vehicles on the Hyderabad-Bijapur highway and caused a nearly two-kilometre long jam.

02-12-2020||India||‘No option left’: Labourers from Bundelkhand on the move again for jobs||Despite the grim Covid situation, the Bundelkhand region, spread across districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, is witnessing a massive migration of labourers to mega cities in the country in search of jobs, say villagers and social activists in the region. The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have undertaken a number of measures to provide jobs to the labourers.The migration is reported to have increased post-Diwali. What has added to the migration is want of employment opportunities, damage to the kharif crop due to below average rainfall and no hope for good yield of rabi crops too. As per social activists, more than 40% of the labourers who had returned to their native places during the lockdown have returned to the cities like Delhi, Ghaziabad, Agra, Gurugram, Chandigarh, Indore, etc from the region.Biharikheda and Udaipura are two neighbouring villages of Sagar district situated about 30 km from the district headquarters. These villages wear almost a deserted look these days. The situation is such that even increasing Covid cases in these cities have not deterred the migrant labourers from getting back to these cities, as per villagers.These two villages have a population of around 2,500 each and more than 50% of people have once again migrated to big cities for employment.These villages are not alone in the district or the region witnessing massive migration. Similar situation prevails in other districts of the region whether it’s Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Panna, Niwari or Damoh.Satu Ahirwar, 83, a resident of Biharikheda, said, “I have three sons and all of them with their families left for Indore after Diwali looking for a job at building sites. There is no employment here and it’s difficult to sustain life with almost no employment and earning. Whatever savings they had was spent during this period. I have just one acre of agriculture land which is hardly enough to provide food to all of us.”He said, “When I came to know about the alarming increase in Covid cases in Indore I called up my sons and urged them to return but they didn’t listen to my advice and said there was no point in staying here with no job and income. Now I can only pray to God to protect them.”Kalu Ahirwar, 63, a resident of Udaipura, was sitting outside his house alone. He said, “My son Jhalkan stayed here for four months but he returned to Delhi after Diwali. I talked to him on the phone a couple of days back. He said there was a talk of lockdown in Delhi. If it happens then he would move to Gurugram but at least he would have some job and earning.”Kalu said, “I have three acre of agricultural land which is not irrigated. My younger son helps me in farming. When the kharif crop was destroyed we sowed seeds of wheat and gram but we have no adequate water for irrigation. I don’t know what would happen to my Rabi crop. Future looks bleak.”Tulsi Ahirwar of the village with his family has once again returned to Delhi leaving his house locked and so have Bhaiyaram, Ram Kisan and Santosh.Bhagwat Gond, 26, a tribal, with five other youths from this village is planning to go to Chennai.Gond said, “We mainly do whitewash work. We had some jobs till Diwali but don’t have any work now to earn money. That’s why we don’t have any other option left but to migrate again.”Udaipura village’s ex-sarpanch Vinod Yadav said, “MNREGA was of some help to migrant labourers but this is not enough to provide a good income to them. While they earn Rs 300 to Rs 400 per day in big cities they get Rs 190 per day under MNREGA and that too subject to availability of work. In our village the river dries up as winter comes. If some stop dams are constructed here for irrigation purposes then agriculture itself can provide them good employment opportunities. It’s dangerous to migrate to other cities during the pandemic situation but how long can they wait for the situation to improve?”Prem Choudhary, a resident of Srinagar village in Tikamgarh district, who returned to Gurugram said over the phone, “During the lockdown I could not get much work under MNREGA as sarpanch and panchayat secretary offer work to only those whom they want to favour. I got 20 kg of rice through the public distribution system (PDS). We have about 1.5 acre agricultural land which my father cultivates. These are hardly enough to help us sustain our life particularly when I have six children.”Chintaman Ahirwar, a resident of Durgapur village in Tikamgarh district, has a similar story to tell.He said, “I could not have waited for long. Since there is Unlock everywhere and there is availability of jobs which can give good income to me it’s no use wasting my time here when there is hardly any good job available here.”Superintending engineer, Water Resources Department, Anil Agarwal said, “The water bodies which consist of dams, ponds, etc are filled below their level this year. In Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Panna these are filled up to only 50% of the capacity while in Sagar and Damoh it’s around 70%. The irrigation for the rabi crop through the water bodies may not be available as much as was witnessed last year.Khajuraho railway station manager Man Singh Meena said, “Khajuraho-Delhi-Kurukshetra express these days is carrying migrant labourers from Bundelkhand. After Diwali the number of passengers has increased manifold. On an average around 400-500 tickets are being sold for this train and about 95% of the tickets are taken by the labourers only. At nearby Harpalpur station, the Sampark kranti express is also carrying a good number of migrant labourers from various parts of Bundelkhand.”Chhatarpur Bus Association spokesman Arvind Goswami said, “About 10 buses are going almost daily with migrant labourers from Chhatarpur, Bada malehra, Gadi malehra, Nowgaon towns, etc. In the neighbouring Panna district the situation is the same.Social worker Gyanendra Tiwari said, “In Bundelkhand migration has always been a big problem despite the tall claims made by respective governments. Even amid Covid pandemic time people are migrating to big cities in search of employment. More than 50% migrant labourers have returned to the big cities so far while the trend is only increasing by the day.”He said, “There is not a single village in this region from where migration has not taken place. During lockdown the central government and state government had allocated huge sums for MNREGA jobs but implementation of the same was hardly visible at the ground level due to malpractices and corruption.”Another social worker Rajkumar Ahirwar from Tikamgarh said, “The Kharif crop was destroyed in Bundelkhand and till now no compensation has been given to the farmers and due to less rainfall the Rabi crop prospects too don’t look good. In such circumstances poor people have no option but to migrate to big cities for employment. By creating employment opportunities, more irrigation facilities and curbing corruption in implementation of the government schemes the government can reduce the level of migration.”Divisional commissioner of Sagar Mukesh Kumar said, “The state government is trying to provide job opportunities to migrant labourers through MNREGA and other government schemes. I will further talk to district collectors in this respect and will try to provide livelihood means to them here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-option-left-labourers-from-bundelkhand-on-the-move-again-for-jobs/story-vQ7wkovB7w5ZbLVfyjbAzK.html

The advisory, released by the district administration on Tuesday, asks guests at weddings in the city to opt for online gifts and bless the newly-wed from a distance.“Avoid talking aloud and laughing and also talking in groups as these attract others to follow the suit. Avoid any contact like embracing and shaking hands with others”, the advisory issued by Bhopal district collector Avinash Lavania says.“Collector has made an appeal to people attending the wedding functions to stay for a short while in marriage functions, park their vehicles on their own and carry their own face masks and sanitisers. They shouldn’t touch their face repeatedly and maintain a distance of at least six feet from others. They should also avoid using their mobile phones and keys repeatedly and sanitise the same properly. Instead of serving food (in plates) on their own by touching the spoon, they should ask others to do so. Instead of opening the return gift immediately, they should keep it in an open space for a few days”, the advisory says.The administration has also asked people to avoid holding music programmes that involve a larger number of people.“There is a custom regarding dance and singing songs with friends and relatives. In such a situation, people should avoid sharing the same microphone. People should not remove masks for photos and avoid group photographs. Return gifts should be packed and distributed by a particular person. Gifts should be kept at a place from where guests can lift their gift. Gift (shagun) should be sent electronically. If it’s not possible, then there should be a fixed point where gifts should be delivered. Such gifts should be opened after certain days,” says the advisory.The government wants people to prefer an open and airy venue for the ceremony with arrangements for washing hands and sanitisation. Covid-19 guidelines should be displayed at various points. Covers of chairs, sofa etc should be changed regularly and the same should be disinfected. The wedding should be shown live on the internet and on screens at the venue to ensure that people don’t crowd at any spot in the venue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-hugs-group-photos-bhopal-draws-up-ground-rules-for-weddings/story-EcWpHqKdgaMJ5VSiEEO2wI.html

The notice gives Ranaut seven days to issue an apology failing which a defamation case will be pursued,” Singh told ANI here on Wednesday.The legal notice said Ranaut, in her tweet, claimed that Bilkis Bano was present at the farmers’ protest and was available in Rs 100.“It is to inform you that the said lady is not a fake lady. Her name is Mahinder Kaur and she belongs to Bathinda. She is the wife of farmer Labh Singh Nambardar. She in her life, has always remained connected with fields and filed work and she is the wife of a farmer,” the notice said.It said by using such remarks, Ranaut has not only lowered down the prestige and image of the lady but has also lowered down the image and prestige of each lady as well as of each person who takes part in protests for a noble cause and for fighting for their rights.Also Read: Farmers protest: Shaheen Bagh’s Bilkis Dadi turned away from Singhu border“That by tweeting in such a manner, the same also points out towards the fact that the protest which is being conducted by the farmers, is being conducted by bringing persons on rent.

It is expected to go below 5% in the next few days. Currently, more than 1600 ICU beds are available in hospitals in Delhi,” Jain said. Delhi’s positivity rate, which had crossed 15% on November 15, is hovering in 6-8% mark in the last few weeks.The health minister had previously stated that the positivity rate in the national capital has fallen by a margin of nearly 55 per cent since early November and it should reduce further in the next two weeks.Also read: Delhi government caps price of RT-PCR test by private labs at Rs 800Delhi battled a severe rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths last month. The recent surge in the virus cases was seen during the festive season and rising pollution level, experts said.In order to fight the rising cases, authorities ramped up the Covid-19 testing strategy and increased the tests to over 60,000 a day-mark. The government has also slashed the prices of RT-PCR tests in private labs to aid people who want to get their tests done in private labs.Adopting an aggressive approach of contact tracing and testing, the Delhi government has carried out RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test to detect novel coronavirus in the national capital. Both tests are done free at government testing centres and hospitals.Signalling the need to ramp up medical infrastructure, the National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently warned that the national capital needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-covid-19-positivity-rate-expected-to-go-below-5-health-minister/story-scqYJx3O8SJ6pX5EsetH7H.html

This order was based on a March 2018 circular released by MoRTH laying down guidelines for road construction in hilly terrains in the country.Both the ministry of defence and road transport have urged the top Court to review its earlier order, citing road safety and requirements of the army. A three-judge bench, headed by justice RF Nariman, asked the committee to examine all aspects pending before the court in the petition filed by Citizens for Green Doon as well as an application moved by the ministries. In addition, there were two letters addressed to the top court by the HPC chairman, which will also be gone into.The application by the defence ministry, presented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said, “The roads should have capacity to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles carrying troops, self propelled artillery and various machinery required by the army. For this purpose a double lane road having a carriageway width of 7m (or 7.5m where there is a raised kerb) is necessary to meet requirements of the army. The very security of the nation is involved and it has become necessary to seek modification of the September 8 order.”The road ministry had claimed that a substantial reduction in the width of the road to 5.5m in terms of the 2018 circular at this stage will result in non-uniform carriageway width varying from 10m to 5.5m in short stretches.“This sudden change in road width in a short road length is not desirable from road users’ safety perspectives and may lead to the formation of black spots and spurt in road accidents,” said the ministry.The top court asked the committee to supply a copy of its report to ministries and petitioner counsel Colin Gonsalves. The Centre will give its comments on the report and submit an affidavit in court in the third week of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vital-for-army-centre-asks-sc-to-review-char-dham-road-project-order/story-tJo29BaRNDmCzCIj2EvQmN.html
02-12-2020||India||Government plans technological road map for Covid immunisation||The government is planning a detailed technological road map to optimise the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine, officials aware of the matter said. The plan will include the use of more regional languages for creating awareness, addressing challenges of last-mile vaccinators and generating alerts about fake vaccines.The officials said health workers will be at the forefront of the immunisation drive while information technology (IT) experts will be in charge at the back end. The experts are working to develop requisite software to ensure the vaccine is properly distributed across the country.An inter-ministerial team for the purpose has members from the ministries of IT, health and as well as the United Nations Development Programme.Also read | 36,604 new Covid-19 cases take India’s tally to nearly 9.5 millionThe government is expected to roll out the COVIN app to track the procurement, supply and distribution of the vaccine to the last mile, the officials cited above said. The app is likely to be a bolstered version of the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (e-VIN) used for the polio eradication programme in India.The government also plans to rope in start-ups to create additional resources that can be integrated into the network to plug any gaps in the logistical systems.“The attempt is to create an integrated IT platform that will track the vaccine from the cold supply chain, its allocation, prioritisation of doses,” said an official, who did not want to be named.The Covid-19 vaccination will cover everyone. Earlier India’s largest immunisation programme against polio included only children under five. “Realtime ground-level information will be available on the portals,” the official cited above said.The IT ministry also plans to introduce value-added services, which will include interventions to address the technological and regional language challenges for the last mile workers. “For the last-mile workers to provide accurate data on the number of doses administered, the applications will have to be tailored accordingly,” said a second official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “The focus will be on increasing the [use of] number of languages available and introducing temperature trackers to monitor the vaccine centrally.”The second official said the technological solutions will help pick the ideal routes, to immunise all priority patients and ensure that the list is not violated. “The idea is to optimise supply and delivery and all possible solutions to that end will be worked out.”The first official said an integrated portal will also contain warnings against fake vaccines that are likely to become available as the immunisation programme starts. The technology has been showcased to other countries as well in case they require help in creating their own systems, the first official added.HT on Tuesday reported that the government is planning to mobilise the same resources used to conduct the polio immunisation programme for Covid-19 vaccination. The e-VIN technology is currently active in 32 states and Union Territories and the government plans to roll it out in the remaining ones immediately.“... 23,507 cold chain points across 585 districts of 22 states and 2 UTs [Union Territories] routinely use the eVIN technology for efficient vaccine logistics management. Over 41,420 vaccine cold chain handlers have been introduced to digital record-keeping by training them on eVIN. Nearly 23,900 electronic temperature loggers have been installed on vaccine cold chain equipment for accurate temperature review of vaccines in storage,” the government said in a statement in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-plans-technological-road-map-for-covid-immunisation/story-8gxOpA1hEEyB6AR4t5TXXP.html

02-12-2020||India||Delhi’s air quality inches closer to ‘severe’ zone||Delhi’s air quality was in the upper end of the “very poor” category Wednesday morning, while pollution levels have already entered the “severe” zone in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 381 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 367 on Tuesday. It was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 430 and 410, respectively.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The maximum wind speed is expected to be 12 kmph on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 27 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The predominant wind direction remained westerly-north-westerly on most of the days. These winds blow from snowcapped western Himalayas towards the plains.Also Read |  Delhi AQI rises to 339, continues to be in very poor zoneAnother reason for the below normal temperatures is La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the “very poor” category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the “severe” category between December 4 and December 7, it said.The city’s ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was 2,500 m2/s on Tuesday and is likely to be 6,000 m2/s on Wednesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The contribution of stubble burning in the neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels was 4 per cent on Tuesday, 7 per cent on Monday and 6 per cent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-air-quality-inches-closer-to-severe-zone/story-ZvqJea6sQYfS4igWdV3esM.html

Three people are said to be critical.“It was revealed that a company was laying a gas pipeline in the area. The pipe was hanging in the air on a pipe-burning hydraulic machine. According to the company’s manager, the pipe picked up from the hydro machine was under control, but in order to save the bulls crossing the road, the driver accidentally threw the pipe, which caused it to crash into the bus,” said a police official from Pali.He added that the driver was also riding the bus at a very high speed. “The major reason behind the accident was the negligence of the firm laying the gas pipeline because it is not possible to control the 80-feet long pipe by simply lifting it with a hydraulic machine. The company should have taken safety measures,” the police officer said.Six days ago, the police had seized a JCB and tractor of the company due to negligence and lack of safety equipment. The company’s manager was called and instructed to improve the security system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-s-neck-slit-man-killed-after-pipe-crashes-into-moving-bus/story-Dc0KH2KvWOw3hLqr8kzULP.html

If okayed, this will be the first electronic voting exercise in the state for filling up 2.58 lakh posts in the three-tier panchayat election.The estimated cost in holding the elections through EVMs will be Rs 392 crore, which will be Rs 142 crore higher than the expenditure made in 2016 panchayat polls. Sources said the state government in 2016 panchayat polls had incurred a cost of Rs 250 crore.Sources said recently the SEC had sent a proposal to the panchayati raj department to hold the polls through EVMs, reasoning it will help in bringing transparency, checking counting anomalies and rigging.Kerala, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among few states where the EVMs have been used to conduct panchayat polls in the last several years, an official said.“We have received the proposal from the SEC and it is in active consideration,” said additional chief secretary, panchayati raj department, Amrit Lal Meena. He said the proposal will be sent to the cabinet for approval.Till now, the panchayat polls in the state have been conducted through ballot papers. The panchayat polls in the state are not held on party lines though a large number of candidates get backing of major political parties, especially for posts like mukhiya and district board members.Meanwhile, sources said the panchayati raj department has started working on the modalities in connection with the requisition of EVMs from the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Bengaluru.“We will get the EVMs from ECIL once the proposal is approved. It suits our needs because we have six posts in the panchayats and the EVMs have multiple voting options,” said a government official.In Bihar, elections in three-tier rural local bodies are held for six posts, namely ward member, mukhiya, panchayat samiti member, district board member, panch and sarpanch.The voters get six sets of ballot papers during the voting to choose their nominees. Now, if the EVMs are used, voters will have to press six buttons on the EVMs to vote against six posts, the official said.There are a total of 8,387 gram panchayats (the bottom level of three-tier local bodies), 534 panchayat samities and 38 district boards. Total posts in the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) in the state stand at 2.58 lakh with at least 1.15 lakh ward members in the gram panchayats.“The panchayat elections in Bihar is one of the biggest poll exercises in terms of posts, number of candidates and booths. This is why we are in favour of using the EVMs so that the process is less time consuming, transparent and less cumbersome,” said an SEC official, pleading anonymity.Digitising detailsIncidentally, the SEC this time is also contemplating putting nomination papers of candidates on the SEC’s website and uploading affidavits having details of the candidates’ income, assets and personal profile as done in the legislative and parliamentary elections so that more information is available in the public domain.Sources said the SEC is planning to hold the elections to the PRIs from April onwards and extend till May in a phase-wise manner in 2021. The process of nominations by candidates will start from March onwards.The 2016 panchayat polls were held in ten phases in April-May with the counting process continuing till mid June, an official said. The total number of polling stations for panchayat election standing at 1.19 lakh is also expected to increase this election with possibility that maximum number of voters in each booth could be capped at 700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-mulls-conducting-panchayat-polls-via-evms-to-bring-transparency/story-pfm7rfF5dBbhBxNL1qTReK.html

The agriculture reforms in the past few days have also now opened new doors of possibilities for our farmers.”“These reforms have not only broken shackles of farmers but have also given new rights and opportunities for them.

Rs 101,416 revenue was collected at the CMBC from November 1 and 30.“Bhandup is displaying all features of a birders’ paradise that are being appreciated by visitors. The idea was never to focus on revenue but to regulate and protect this zone, which has now begun. Now we exactly know how many people are going and at the same time nuisance activities [open drinking or unregulated entry] have stopped completely,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell).The 11-hectare BPS is a satellite wetland of the flamingo sanctuary. “The main aim is to concentrate on this part of TCFS with the sole purpose to protect, conserve and create awareness among masses about birds and other biodiversity,” said Tiwari. He added a plan was being prepared on how the area could be further developed. Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, an NGO, said BPS has the potential to be the best forest tourism spot in Mumbai. “It can showcase the wetland biodiversity like no other place in Thane creek.

Farmers, who have been calling for a repeal of what they term as “black laws” since these were passed in September, have been camping on the outskirts of Delhi. While majority of the protesters are from Punjab, in recent days small groups of farmers from neighbouring states, including Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, too, have joined them.1. Tuesday’s talks between the government and farmers’ unions were not able to break the impasse as the unions didn’t accept the government’s suggestion of setting up a panel to discuss these legislations. After the meeting, farmers’ leaders told media that the stir would continue and the next round of talks will take place on December 3, as originally suggested by the government.Also Read | Meeting between farmers’ leaders, govt inconclusive; next round on Dec 32.

India also issued a strong rebuttal to Canada PM Justin Trudeau who became the first international leader to speak up on the ongoing farmers’ protest. “We’ve seen some ill-informed comments by Canadian leaders relating to farmers in India. These are unwarranted especially when pertaining to internal affairs of a democratic country. It’s also best that diplomatic conversations aren’t misrepresented for political purposes,” the ministry said in a statement.5. Trudeau, whose country has a large Indian diaspora, including Sikhs, had on Tuesday, on the occasion of Gurpurab, said, “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers.

On Sunday, farmers had rejected Union home minister Amit Shah’s offer of talks, calling it “conditional.”10.

We got an increasing trend since the festive shopping started just before the pujas. Now that the festive season is gone, it has started to decline one again. It is for the same reason that the active cases have also gone down,” said an official.The positivity rate was 6.7% on September 1 and 7.4% on October 1. While the number of active cases on September 1 was 24,822, on October 1, it had increased to 26,552. West Bengal has till date registered 486,799 cases and 8476 deaths.

The study was published on November 24 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.According to researchers, the objective of the study was to observe Covid-19 susceptibility in patients with bronchial asthma. The scientists used data from a large nationwide health maintenance organisation in Israel.“The enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included,” said the study.Further describing the results of the study, the researchers said that 37,469 subjects were tested for Covid-19 RT-PC test and results for 2,266 of them were positive. This constituted just above six per cent of 6.05% patients who tested positive.Asthma was found in 153 (or 6.75 per cent) subjects of the Covid-19-positive group, the study said. “We observed lower Covid-19 susceptibility in patients with pre-existing asthma,” said the authors of the study.They, however, pointed out that more research is needed on the subject.A study in October on the similar group (asthma patients) in the United States had said that these patients who become infected with Covid-19 appear to have no higher risk of hospitalisation or need for mechanical breathing assistance compared to Covid-19 patients without asthma.The October study had also said that asthma patients are less likely to die from the disease.Researchers at a Boston healthcare system had studied 562 asthma patients with Covid-19 and 2,686 similarly-aged Covid-19 patients without asthma for the study. The two groups were hospitalised at similar rates and had similar need for mechanical ventilation.But the asthma patients were 70 per cent less likely to die from the virus, researchers reported. None of the 44 patients with severe asthma died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asthma-patients-less-likely-to-contract-covid-19-claims-study/story-u5rPRzrWkFPqkK92r3BwyN.html

02-12-2020||India||Farmers reject govt’s offer on panel, talks deadlocked||Farmers protesting against a set of laws they say will hurt their incomes agreed, at a meeting led by three Union ministers on Tuesday, to continue discussions with the government later this week, but rejected a proposal from the Centre for a five-member committee of officials, economists and farmers’ representatives to hold future negotiations. Farm union leaders from 35 organisations based in Punjab and Haryana met agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Prakash for over three hours at the capital’s Vigyan Bhawan, as protests by thousands of farmers on Delhi’s borders entered the sixth day. The government and the farm leaders agreed to meet again on December 3 to for discussions, the government said in a statement. Behind the scenes, the talks were facilitated by several rounds of phone conversations between Union home minister Amit Shah and key farm union leaders over the course of the past two days, which led to the government advancing the date of the talks, initially scheduled for December 3. “We were initially reluctant for another round of talks. Home minister Amit Shah talked to us several times by telephone. We agreed on the ground that the government should rethink the three farm laws,” said Jagmohan Singh, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and working committee member of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), the platform spearheading the agitation. The farmers did not agree to the government’s proposal for a committee to carry out future talks because “all 35 farmers’ leaders will have to be present in all future discussions”, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm leader who leads the Rajewal faction of the BKU. “During the deliberations, the Union agriculture and farmers welfare minister proposed to constitute an expert committee to put forth the issues of farmers so as to resolve them with mutual consent but the representative of the farmers’ union suggested that all the representatives will attend further round of discussions with the government to resolve the matter amicably,” an official statement at the end of the talks said. Agriculture minister Tomar started Tuesday’s discussions by spelling out the government’s “seriousness to deal with farmers’ problems” as well as the resolve to “listen to farmers and their demands”, an official said, requesting anonymity. Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal also outlined the government’s initiatives in the farm sector. The agriculture minister suggested that farm leaders identify specific issues related to the three farm reform laws and share these with the government on Wednesday for consideration. “These issues will be discussed during the fourth round of meeting to be held on December 3,” the official cited above said. Darshan Pal, a farm leader representing the Krantikari Kisan Union, said the farmers were ready with their key demands. “We are still saying we don’t want these laws. However, the government insisted that the laws were in the interest of farmers. We will discuss the outcome of today’s meeting when we go back,” Pal said. Farmers want the Narendra Modi government to revoke three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Together, the laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices. On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking in Varanasi, slammed Opposition parties for misleading farmers and defended his farm laws as “historic”. He said the opposition had created unfounded fears in the minds of the farmers and insisted that support prices and procurement of staples by the government would continue||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-reject-govt-s-offer-on-panel-talks-deadlocked/story-q1I6vpUtdrnvVN5MmRXnJM.html

The court of Jagdeep Singh, special judge, CBI also issued summons to five additional accused including Rajiv Arora, additional chief secretary, home, and health and family welfare, Haryana, who was at the time of the land fraud managing director, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) . The others summoned are former chief town planner, HSIIDC, Surjit Singh; former chief town planner of town and country planning department, Dhare Singh; the then deputy superintendent, town and country planning, Kulwant Singh Lamba; and the then director, industries DR Dhingra.Interestingly, most of these accused were originally prosecution witness. The court observed that there is prima facie evidence against them under Prevention of Corruption Act, cheating and criminal conspiracy.The next hearing is on December 17. Meanwhile, the CBI has been directed to take sanction for prosecution from government, if any of the additional accused is working.The case dates back to 2004. The Haryana government issued a notification to acquire 912 acres and seven marlas of land under section 4 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, on August 27, 2004 in Manesar, Lakhnaula and Naurangpur villages. 1 marla is roughly 272 sq ft/ 30 square yards . Worried that this would reduce the value of their land, owners sold at throwaway rates, resulting in wrongful loss of Rs 1500 crore.On August 24, 2007 , the director industries passed another order releasing the land in violation of government policy, in favour of the people who had bought the land, instead of the original landowners, claims CBI. In 2018, the CBI had filed a chargesheet against 34 accused including Hooda. When contacted by HT, Hooda said, “It is a part of the process. I have got full faith in judiciary. As far as this case is concerned, it is politically motivated.” Rajiv Arora didn’t respond to HT’s calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manesar-land-case-court-orders-framing-of-charges-against-hooda/story-iX1RQritzSkhgkIlEpcmqJ.html
02-12-2020||India||SC rejects plea seeking action against Jagan||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a petition seeking action against Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who accused a senior judge of the apex court of trying to interfere in and influence the functioning of Andhra Pradesh high court. The petition was filed by two Supreme Court lawyers — GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav — against Jagan’s decision to write a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde against Justice NV Ramana, who is the senior most judge of the SC t after the CJI. The petition accused the CM of misusing his office and attacking the independence of the judiciary. A three-judge bench — headed by Justice SK Kaul and also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy —held that a prayer to gag the CM from making allegations or seeking action against him was “not maintainable”. The bench told the petitioners that another SC bench recently lifted a gag order by the HC in a dispute arising out of an FIR lodged by the Andhra government in the Amaravati land case against relatives of Justice Ramana. “Since the dispute is pending consideration before that bench, whatever consequences have to follow will also be gone into by that bench,” the court said. On another prayer for a judicial probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation against Justice Ramana, the bench said, “...If you are wanting an in-house inquiry that will be looked into by the CJI. Why should we direct an inquiry?” The court dismissed the PIL by Mani and Yadav, as well as a separate one filed by one Anti-Corruption Council of India Trust over similar demands. It, however, agreed to send a third PIL seeking examination of whether a CM should refrain from making unfounded allegations in open against a judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-action-against-jagan/story-2N3FPtVSV8sbDZz4S5Ur6K.html

02-12-2020||India||‘Can be sold for profit’: Sitaram Yechury warns on postal ballots for NRIs||Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday told Hindustan Times that the Election Commission’s proposal to extend postal ballot facilities to overseas electors is an exercise fraught with large-scale manipulation, suggesting to the poll body to set up a polling station in their missions abroad, a practice followed by other countries. “In the Gulf countries especially, many Indians are taken by managers who even impound their passports,” Yechury told Hindustan Times. “The people working there will be under immense pressure, their postal ballots can easily be manipulated and sold for profit.”Yechury was referring to the EC proposal sent to the law ministry on November 27 to expedite an amendment to the People’s Representation Act, which will allow non-resident Indians to vote remotely using the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (EPTBS) in the upcoming elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Puducherry and West Bengal. The amendments, if approved, will have far reaching ramifications as they will not require the nod of Parliament.“When this question was first raised in 2014, we said it was not feasible,” Yechury said. “Then the BJP introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha that wasn’t passed by the Rajya Sabha.”The veteran leader added that the top poll body was increasingly bypassing the deliberative process, wherein it would consult all political parties before taking such a decision, that had been its modus operandi since Independence.“Increasingly, decisions are being taken without consultation,” Yechury said. “The same happened when it came to expanding the ambit of postal ballots during the Bihar elections, a decision that the EC eventually did not implement.”According to Yechury, the ideal method to enable non-resident Indians (NRIs) to vote in polls would be to set up a polling station in their missions overseas to enable physical voting.“The practice is followed world over and this way a free and fair exercise of one’s voting rights can be ensured,” he said. “Diplomats, businessmen who come to India from abroad often use this means to cast their vote.”At present, voters living outside India can only cast their vote in their respective constituencies. The amendment proposes that overseas voters send an intimation in Form 12 to the Returning Officer within five days following the date of the said election. In return, the RO shall issue a postal ballot paper to the elector.There are 12.6 million non-resident Indians (NRIs), those holding an Indian passport but ordinarily residing outside the country, spread across more than 200 nations, according to the government. The number could make a significant difference in the states which have a large population overseas such as Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-be-sold-for-profit-sitaram-yechury-warns-on-postal-ballots-for-nris/story-nm4uHaW3kL4rcvlB7w7gbL.html

02-12-2020||India||Four key aspects of the farmers’ protest||The ongoing stand-off between the Union government and protesting farmers does not show any signs of a resolution at the moment. Farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the three agriculture laws enacted by the central government. The argument is that these reforms will abolish middlemen and enhance farmers’ incomes, but farmers maintain that this is a precursor to the largescale withdrawal of government support from farming, and will only replace existing middlemen with more powerful corporate entities.These bills essentially pave the way for a greater role for market forces and the private sector in agricultural value chains by allowing contract farming, removing restrictions on movement and storage of food items, and allowing trade in food items to take place outside government-controlled markets.The protests have now escalated to a stage where thousands of farmers are threatening to block all road routes to the national capital. Interestingly, some aspects of the debate between the pro-farm bills and anti-farm bills groups merit clarification.1 India is not a food-surplus countryThe roots of state intervention in agriculture, from government procurement to rationing and restrictions on private traders, which is what the current reforms seek to abolish, are to be found in recurring food shortages in the period after Independence. The Green Revolution, which entailed widespread use of high yielding varieties of seeds, became successful because the state gave dual incentives – input subsidies and remunerative prices via Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) – to farmers to adopt this technology.  Many commentators believe that these incentives are not needed today because India is a food-surplus country now. The sharp rise in India’s agriculture exports is often cited as evidence of this fact. However, when read with the fact that average nutritional intakes in India are much lower than not just developed countries but even China and Vietnam, the purported food surplus seems to be the result of inadequate food consumption by the local population.Also Watch l Farmer protest: What happened at meeting with govt? Union minister reveals 2 Most Indians don’t eat enough; they can’t afford toWhy are Indian diets poor when there is no scarcity of food? Most of them cannot afford good diets. A recent paper by Kalyani Raghunathan of the International Food Policy Research Institute and others, the findings of which were reported in these pages, found that 63.3% of people in rural India could not afford what the authors describe as the Cost of a Recommended Diet (CoRD).  This share increases to 76.2% if one were to assume that a third of their spending would go on non-food items. CoRD has been calculated for a food basket which includes broad categories of cereals, proteins (pulses, meat, fish and eggs), dairy, fruits, vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables and oil and fats.3 Farmers in Punjab, Haryana are better off than the restThe farmers who are protesting outside Delhi’s borders are among the richest among their peers in India. Data from a 2013 survey carried out by the National Statistical Office (NSO) shows that farmers from Punjab and Haryana had the highest incomes in the country. A disproportional share in government procurement at MSP plays an important role in this.  In 2019-20, 65% of wheat and 30% of rice was procured from Punjab and Haryana. The share of these two states in wheat and rice production in the country was 28.7% and 15.9% in 2017-18, the latest period for which data is available for all states. States where there are no large-scale MSP operations tend to have lower prices in private markets as well. That incentivises the richer farmers to lobby for the continuation of the status quo.4 Richer farmers inflicted greater environmental damageThe skewed nature of MSP procurement, especially for rice, has not been an unambiguous blessing for Punjab’s agriculture. The state is not in an agro-climatic zone suited for cultivation of rice, which is a water-intensive crop. Large-scale rice cultivation has resulted in farmers sinking private tube wells, which has led to a drastic depletion of ground water levels.  A 2011 Economic and Political Weekly paper by Anindita Sarkar found that richer farmers in Punjab were a bigger reason for depletion of water tables as they sank deeper tube wells everywhere including in villages which were already facing ground water problems. Because resorting to environmentally harmful farming practices promise monetary rewards in the short term, it is difficult to get the farmers to abandon them. Even the roots of the stubble burning in Punjab that chokes Delhi for a few weeks every winter can be traced back to water management.PRESENT STAND-OFF WILL WIDEN TRUST DEFICIT BETWEEN FARMERS AND THE STATEEven though Punjab and Haryana are not as critical to the country’s food security as they were a few decades ago, they are extremely important in India’s farm economy. Decades of high farm earnings also mean that the peasantry in these two states has much more in terms of material wherewithal to fight for its interests. Therefore, the fact that the government’s attempts to undermine their interests by enacting the recent farm laws have triggered a sharp political backlash is hardly surprising. No matter what the outcome of the present conflict, the trust deficit which will result from this confrontation is likely to erode the state’s credibility to persuade the farmers to shift to more environmentally sustainable practices in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-key-aspects-of-the-farmers-protest/story-UKuhPOVY7N3nAs1OZXBU0L.html

The ministry also said that the number of tests have also gone up - to more than a million daily. #IndiaFightsCorona #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/wwCgIKCD0tIndia recorded 31,118 cases of the disease on Tuesday, a snapshot of the Covid-19 situation in the country in last 24 hours showed. The health ministry data also showed that India’s active cases stood at 4,35,603, much below the 5-lakh mark.“Cumulative positivity rate has decreased in India from 7.15% to 6.69% during November 11 to December 1 period. In November 2020, the number of recoveries has been more than the number of new Covid-19 cases,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan told reporters on Tuesday.While the tally of Covid-19 cases stood at 94,62,810, a net decline of 11,349 cases was recorded in the total active cases in the last 24 hours (till Tuesday). As many as 41,985 new recoveries were reported in the last same period.Sharing the data of the entire month of November, Bhushan said that more than 10.55 lakh tests were conducted daily, while on an average 43,152 new cases and 47,159 recoveries were recorded each day.He also said that India still figures among the countries having the lowest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths per million population.The Union health secretary further informed the press briefing that the top five states that have shown a decline in active cases during last month are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The top five states showing a rise in active cases during the same period were Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-new-cases-of-covid-19-remain-below-50-000-million-tests-conducted-daily-health-ministry/story-mRTsNro0zXjEv4Fqt3zExN.html
02-12-2020||India||SC judge looks to fix delays in filing cases, hold govt accountable||For this judge, a note by Supreme Court officials is curiously the single most important document in any case before him. This note, however, has nothing to do with the facts of that case, or the kind of people involved; not even arguments by the big guns make a difference to the final outcome.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul has his eyes fixated just on one thing -- how long did it take for the case to be filed. He seems to have taken it upon himself to fix the recurrent practice of huge delays by governments in filing cases, and make public authorities accountable. In the last seven months, Justice Kaul has issued almost 100 orders, reproaching what he has frequently called the ‘can’t care less’ attitude of legal departments of various states. Some of these orders contained strictures with monetary penalties while some others even suggested revamping the entire legal department of that particular state.Interestingly, Justice Kaul has even coined a term for these cases filed belatedly — “certificate cases”. His orders have defined a certificate case as one which has been filed by the officials only to get certificates of dismissal from the apex court. While there is demonstrably no effort involved to either file such cases in time, or have them listed for hearing as quickly as possible, a final order of rejection by the Supreme Court is to only help save the skin of officials responsible to file appeal against an adverse order by a high court.These cases are filed way beyond the period mandated under the law of limitation only to let officers go back and tell their superiors that nothing can be done since the Supreme Court has refused to entertain a case.The judge has repeatedly come down heavily on this practice, saying certificate cases can’t clog boards of the Supreme Court at the sheer convenience of the government officers.“Supreme Court cannot be a place for the government to walk in as and when they feel like,” Justice Kaul responded when being requested to take a liberal view since a government is involved. When change of guard in a state is cited as a chief reason for delay, the judge has asserted that “governments may come and go” but a litigation must follow the requirements of the law. The submissions of “administrative lapses and red tape” have elicited even stronger comments: “This Court is not here to protect the administrative inefficiencies and incompetence of the officials of the state governments.”When some states tried to take refuge under the present pandemic, justice Kaul was quick to note that Covid-19 was a sheer pretext because the orders being challenged were passed by high courts in 2019.Justice Kaul has maintained that the government may change the law to give itself more time to move appeals if its officers are incapable of timely filings, but they cannot expect the top court to accord any special treatment. These body of orders have invariably imposed fines on the government departments, with a direction to recover the monetary losses from the officers whose negligence and ineptitude caused this. For some states such as Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the judge had to further make it clear every subsequent case filed with an inordinate delay will only increase the quantum of fine.Around 100 orders on, some of the states have learned enough to immediately ask for withdrawing a case when it comes up for a hearing. Given the apparent determination of justice Kaul to change what has become a custom, the lawyers’ attempt to wriggle out still fails most of the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-judge-looks-to-fix-delays-in-filing-cases-hold-govt-accountable/story-yLi99o1N43ImvIBzwgyx0M.html
02-12-2020||India||The other side of the Covid pandemic: Some idealism||When the new dawn breaks, as it inevitably must, it will reveal a tired world. A world in which millions will be struggling to pick up the threads of their lives, in body and in spirit, surrounded by the debris of livelihoods and the devastation of disease. Many will have to live on without a loved one. Many more will find that in this one year, they have grown old and weak and tired or simply, irrelevant. Some people will never leave their village again. Others will never unlock that shop front. Yet others will find that they are no longer required by those who once employed them.The pandemic has brutally brought us face to face with the eggshell fragility of our industrial and post-industrial lives. It has exposed the perverse nature of our priorities. It has hit us in the face with the uncaring vanity of our over-stretched lifestyles. It has shone the spotlight on the cracks that man has forced in his pact with nature, and given a dark warning of the kind of vengeance that nature can wreak.The future, without making it sound too dire, remains unpredictable. The virus has not run its course. The news on the vaccine offers hope but not a full solution. For that, nations will have to go back to the drawing board, consciously or willy-nilly. Budgetary priorities, social security nets, energy and industrial policy, environmental regulations, consumption patterns all need serious reassessment. Denial of these imperatives is always an option, but then so is suicide.The international landscape is in disarray, reflecting the disorder within. The withdrawal of the US from global leadership roles, the decline of globalisation, the arrogant rise of China and the emasculation of alliances and international organisations have brought us to a point when the centre no longer seems to hold. The pandemic has exacerbated these trends and added its complicating impact on global health, international trade and supply chains, migration, tourism, financial burdens and so on.An immediate rescue effort does not seem forthcoming from the usual quarters. Biden’s good intentions are unlikely to translate immediately into a silver bullet. He has internal problems: a galloping pandemic with nearly 12 million cases and fatalities fast reaching the numbers lost in World War II needs handling. A tanking economy has put more than 20 million on unemployment benefits. That this should happen in the richest, most developed country in the world is bad enough; that it should have been worsened by misgovernance is damning. This, along with the deep racial divides in society and the flagrant disavowal of democratic traditions by a sitting President, have badly dented America’s credibility as the leader of the free world.The biggest beneficiary of America’s withdrawal is China. It has steadily increased its grip on the international system, even as it sets up its own parallel systems. Four of the 15 specialised agencies of the UN are headed by Chinese international civil servants. The WHO is not one of them, but its all-too-obvious bias towards China shows that country’s reach even in other organisations. China has also subsumed the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals within the rubric of its Belt and Road Initiative. The system that was built on post World War II idealism, to secure peace and development around the globe, is now being cynically subverted to meet China’s illiberal objectives. China disregards rules when it wants, even as it forces, as recently the case with Australia, to make other play by its rules.But this is not about taking sides, or grabbing opportunities. In these dark days, human beings – and nations – need a vision, a hope, a light. The idiom in which nations deal with each other needs softening: idealism needs to replace the usual gruel of realpolitik, generosity must overcome reciprocity. The pandemic must be turned into an opportunity to repair human discourse. It will take time before America can recover its credibility, or Europe overcome its self-obsession or China be able to project trust. It is for India to once again occupy the moral high ground: let us recall that India’s non-violent freedom struggle inspired several other freedom movements.The immediate human concern that needs a different approach is health care. India, while taking care of its own people, should also think of others. We should not be satisfied with our ability to produce vaccines but spearhead the campaign for equitable access for all countries, beginning with our neighbours, thus building on the 15 million dollar pledge by the PM to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; this alliance needs another 5 billion dollars, and 2 billion doses for equitable access to vaccines by 92 eligible economies. A non-commercial outlook by our pharmaceutical giants will be critical; dividends need not always be immediate or in money terms.Climate change is the other looming global risk. A mass movement in India, led from the top – say to ban plastic, or protect forests, or reduce fossil fuels – can catch the world’s imagination and take us beyond Paris. Biden’s ambitious plan aims to take the US to net zero emissions by 2050. Climate change, as clear from the high-profile appointment of John Kerry, is going to be embedded in policies across the government. But internal headwinds, including a possible Republican senate, will not make Biden’s progress easy; India’s partnership, in the form of a mass movement of 1.3 billion people, will be valued. Biden plans to hold a summit meet on climate in his first 100 days, where India needs to unveil an imaginative climate vision, not to please Biden or anybody else, but out of genuine concern for humanity. A battered world, tired of transactional one-upmanship, will pay heed.Navtej Sarna is former Ambassador of India to the US and High Commissioner to the UK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-other-side-of-the-covid-pandemic-some-idealism/story-UOa2rqOFiHigWss4tWlIJM.html

02-12-2020||India||AG nod to contempt case on cartoonist||Attorney General KK Venugopal has granted consent for initiating contempt against artist Rachita Taneja for depicting the Supreme Court as biased towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in successive tweets published soon after the top court granted bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami last month. A law student Aditya Kashyap brought these tweets to the notice of the top law officer of the country for grant of consent under the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court of India, before lodging a contempt petition against her. Venugopal examined the three tweets by Taneja, the creator of the webcomic Sanitary Panels, and found them to be in contempt of SC. The first tweet depicts Goswami asking the SC if it knows who his father is (the tweet shows figures purportedly representing Goswami, the court, and the BJP). “The clear implication (of the tweet) would be that SC is biased towards the ruling party BJP and would tailor its judgments for benefit of the ruling party.” The second tweet depicted the SC as “Sanghi Court of India”, an apparent reference to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) with the flag of the BJP in place of the tricolour atop the court building. The Attorney General found this to be a gross insinuation against the top court of the country to the effect that “Supreme Court has ceased to be an impartial organ of the state” He said, “The tweet is calculated to undermine public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court of India.” Taneja’s third tweet made a reference was made to the Ayodha title suit judgment delivered by Supreme Court in November last year with the insinuation that this was delivered in favour of BJP in exchange for a favour. The AG said, “This is a clear attempt to turn the minds of the people against the then Chief Justice of India, and in the bargain against the judiciary as a whole. It is deliberately intended to shake the confidence that people have in the apex court of the country and to lower the authority of this institution.” On November 12, AG Venugopal gave consent to initiate contempt proceedings against standup comic Kunal Kamra. Kamra in a series of tweets lampooned the Supreme Court as the supreme “joke” of India and even put out a tweet showing the Supreme Court draped in saffron and replacing the Indian Tricolour with the party flag of the BJP. Those tweets too were in the context of the Goswami case. The TV journalist was granted bail by the apex court which said that states should not use the law to “harass citizens” and that high courts need to protect the liberty of individuals (the Bombay high court had denied bail to Goswami in the case, which involved charges of abetment of suicide). Terming the tweets as “gross insinuation” against the Supreme Court and its judges, Venugopal held the tweets to be in “bad taste” and found Kamra guilty of having crossed the line between humour and contempt. “Under the Constitution, the freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt and I believe that it is time that people understand that attacking the Supreme Court of India unjustifiably and brazenly will attract punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972,” he said at the time. Following this , a contempt petition has been filed in Supreme Court against Kamra which is yet to come up for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-nod-to-contempt-case-on-cartoonist/story-6N9DZsdtlai6m93GL4gK7L.html
02-12-2020||India||After SC rebuke, Centre orders end to home isolation posters||The practice of putting up home isolation posters outside houses of Covid-19 patients may end very soon. Nudged by the Supreme Court, the central government has written to all states and Union territories to stop the practice.In a letter dated November 19, the government has maintained that Union health ministry guidelines never contemplated pasting of such posters or other signage outside residences of those who tested positive for Covid-19. “MoHFW (ministry of health and family welfare) Guidelines do not contain any instructions or guidance regarding affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found Covid- positive,” stated the letter, addressed to additional and principal home secretaries of states and UTs.It added that July 2 guidelines are clear regarding home isolation of Covid-19 patients and that states must comply with them in letter and spirit and demonstrate “unscrupulous adherence” to only these mandates.The Centre’s clarification will help in allaying concerns of several people who, despite having symptoms of the coronavirus disease, have been reluctant to come forward for tests, fearing posters will be pasted outside their homes, causing social stigma.Recently, the Supreme Court had shared similar concerns with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta when a public interest litigation (PIL) by lawyer-petitioner Kush Kalra sought a directive to stop the practice.The bench had commented that Covid patients can face stigma because of such posters, and may not be willing to come forward to get tested. Citing the Delhi government’s decision to stop this practice, the bench had last month said the central government should come up with guidelines dealing with the matter for the entire country.The Centre has now filed its affidavit in the matter, referring to the letter sent to states and UTs on November 19. It pointed out there are no guidelines by the health ministry to put up any such poster. “There was never any such directive from the centre to paste slips outside the residence of a quarantined person as part of community surveillance. It probably was done at the local level but not asked [for] by the centre,” said a government official with knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. Representing the Centre, Solicitor General Mehta, however, submitted his personal opinion that these posters were to do more with sounding caution to others, who may inadvertently enter a premises where Covid-19 patients were residing.He said that while states are at liberty to pass appropriate directives in this regard, it is his opinion that these posters have a logical purpose.At this, the bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, replied that this practice may make patients feel as “untouchables” and hence, the issue requires consideration. But the detailed arguments in the case could not proceed because the bench had received the Centre’s affidavit late. The petitioner too wanted some time to go through the response and the matter was adjourned to Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-rebuke-centre-orders-end-to-home-isolation-posters/story-UAdTrMUlVi3choUfNkUerL.html
02-12-2020||India||Local emissions, weather push air to ‘very poor’ zone||While the farm fires in neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab have drastically reduced — it contributed just 4% to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Tuesday, according to System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research — the national capital’s air quality plunged further to the upper end of the very poor zone of the air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday. According to government agencies, it is likely to remain there throughout the week owing to the wind speed calming down and wind patterns changing in the coming days.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI on Tuesday was 367, even worse than Monday’s 318, though both are in the very poor category. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 300 and 400 is considered very poor, and those above 400 are considered severe.The air quality continued to deteriorate further Tuesday evening, with most of the hot spots slipping into the ‘severe’ zone. By 9pm, 11 of the 35 monitoring stations recorded severe air quality — Anand Vihar (414), Ashok Vihar (437), Bawana (413), DTU (409), Jahangirpuri (443), Mundka (413), Nehru Nagar (404), Patparganj (410), Punjabi bagh (405), Rohini (414) and Vivek Vihar (425).The CPCB, which is in charge of implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), said it is taking measures to control local pollution levels.“We are monitoring the situation closely. Measures under the very poor zone are already being enforced. Patrolling teams are carrying field inspections regularly,” said a senior CPCB official. Despite repeated attempts, MM Kutty, chairperson of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas, could not be reached for a comment.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the average wind speed during the day reduced to 7-8 kmph from 10-12 kmph on Monday. “The wind speed will further reduce from December 4 or 5 and the direction is likely to change to easterly, from the present north-westerly. Whenever there is a change in pattern, winds turn calm and trap pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He said easterly winds are also likely to bring in moisture, which when combined with calm winds allow pollutants to accumulate. There is also a forecast of shallow fog on December 4 or 5. “Besides, the change in wind pattern will also lead to a rise in minimum temperature between December 4 and 7,” Srivastava further said.On Tuesday, the Safdarjung Observatory — the official marker for the city’s weather — recorded a minimum temperature of 8.1 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The maximum settled at 27.2 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.Sagnik Dey, associate professor, IIT-Delhi, said, “In October and November, farm fires contribute about 25% to the overall pollution in Delhi. In December, we record the same pollution level even without stubble burning because of reduced dispersion of pollutants,” Dey said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said at present, the only factors at play are meteorological and local pollutants. “Even though there has been a declining trend in the overall pollution levels since 2017, Delhi still has to reduce its PM 2.5 concentrations at least by 60% to mitigate these peak episodes. Also, on-ground monitoring of waste burning and emissions from illegal industries need to be stepped up to have some real impact,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-emissions-weather-push-air-to-very-poor-zone/story-WHUh9GCAxqlcPc5fKKvjjM.html
02-12-2020||India||‘Adverse event’ won’t delay Serum vaccine plan: Centre||Initial assessments after a volunteer’s illness suggested the trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine did not need to be halted and the incident will not affect the time lines for the emergency approval process in the country, top officials said on Tuesday — the first reaction from the government on a controversy that had appeared to dampen hopes for an early coronavirus inoculation. The remarks were made by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Indian Council of Medical Research head Dr Balram Bhargava at a weekly government briefing on Covid-19. The officials also indicated that the country may not need to vaccinate all of India’s population to contain the spread of the disease. “I just want to make this clear that the government has never spoken about vaccinating the entire country. It’s important that we discuss such scientific issues, based on factual information only,” secretary Bhushan said while responding to a question on when a vaccine can be provided to everyone in the country.Explaining the remark, Bhargava, the ICMR director general, said vaccinating the entire population may not be required if “critical mass of people” is vaccinated and the chain of virus transmission is broken.Earlier in the briefing, both the officials addressed the controversy triggered by allegations by a Chennai-based man that the clinical trials – sponsored by Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – left him with serious neurological symptoms. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate is largely believed to be the first that could be cleared for use among people, with an emergency approval expected in the next couple of months. India is targeting shots for 250-300 million health care workers and essential services staff in its first phase of vaccinations, which it targets to be over by June, 2021. “This event will not affect timelines in any manner whatsoever. But since there is now a court case, so we will not comment on specifics relating to the case,” Bhushan said, before enumerating five safeguards that are a part of clinical trials in India. These, according to him, include monitoring by two independent groups of experts, a process of informed consent and detailed vetting of data and review of such incidents by India’s regulators. “The drugs controller has the authority to not allow vaccine trial to proceed to the next level if the data produces a doubt regarding the vaccine candidate. Currently, Serum Institute’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate has entered the phase 3 stage of the clubbed phase 2/3 trials after receiving necessary approvals post review of all relevant documents. Similarly, Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate has also entered the phase 3 clinical trial stage after review of all data they submitted,” said Bhushan.The volunteer who took ill has sued SII for ₹5 crore in damages, drawing a legal notice by the Pune-based vaccine maker seeking ₹100 crore. SII issued a new statement on Tuesday, reiterating the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response and said that its notice was meant to protect the company against attempts to malign it. Adverse effects, as they are referred to technically, are when trial volunteers develop any serious illness following an inoculation and during the period for which they need to be monitored – usually, this is two months. In this case, the side effects experienced by the volunteer has been said to not have been connected to the vaccine – although the detailed data is being studied. “All serious adverse events do not need to be informed to every participant. Let us be very clear that many serious adverse events are coincidental. In fact, that is more often the case than causally related serious adverse events, for which, of course, information must be shared,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of the prominent researchers in the field of vaccines in India. “A trial that we did for illustration, we had 1,462 serious adverse events of which three were considered possibly related (and none of the three were hospitalized), with similar serious adverse events rate in intervention and placebo recipients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adverse-event-won-t-delay-serum-vaccine-plan-centre/story-C93dn5U6uBBKM9fHdGpj0H.html
02-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Monday, former US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Scott Gottlieb said in an interview to CNBC that his estimate is that by the end of the year 30% of Americans would have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease. That’s almost one in three Americans who will have some sort of immunity against the virus. I know there is a lot of confusing research on this, especially when it comes to those asymptomatic patients who have low viral loads, but I am going to go with the most comprehensive research – Dispatch 207 on November 19 covered it – that most infected people have at least six months of protection (of some sort) against Covid-19, with a not insignificant probability that this protection could actually last for years. Gottlieb went on to add in the interview that he believes some states may have an infection rate of up to 50%. INFECTION ESTIMATEFormer US FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said in an interview to CNBC that his estimate is that by the end of the year, 30% of Americans would have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This bodes well for 2021, he suggested – and it’s easy to see why. If a third of the population is protected against the virus, there is a high chance of the chain of infection being broken before too many people are infected. “You are getting to levels where this virus is not going to circulate as readily,” he told CNBC. The US ended November with 13.6 million recorded cases of Covid. It could end the year with anything between 17 million and 18 million, at the current rate of growth of recorded cases. If Gottlieb’s assessment is accurate, this number, in reality, should be 100 million – which means that for every infection recorded, the US is missing around six. That seems plausible, and also highly probable. For the purposes of this column, I have assumed it to be true.WHAT NEXT?If a third of the population is protected against the virus in the US, there is a high chance of the chain of infection being broken before too many people are infected.India has seen almost 9.5 million cases of the coronavirus disease to date (it is second in terms of the number of cases after the US). A direct extrapolation of Gottlieb’s constant (if it can be called that) might not make sense for a variety of reasons. India and the US are both large and have high population counts, but the differences between them on these two parameters are still stark. The US has a population of 330 million; India, 1.3 billion (1,300 million). The US has a land area of 9.8 million square km; India, 3.3 million square km. The US’s population density, based on these numbers, comes to 34 per square km; India’s almost 394 people per square km. Some of these factors point to the constant being higher in India; others, lower. There are also other factors at play – populations in some parts of India, like populations in parts of Africa, may have some protection against the coronavirus disease on account of previous infections by other coronaviruses; and the BCG vaccine, which almost all Indian children have received for decades now, may offer some cover against the infection or, at the least, the intensity of infection.In Dispatch 158, on September 15, I had put forth assumptions that around 15% of the urban population in India and 5% to 7.5% of the rural population may have been infected by the virus. That number was based on antibody prevalence surveys carried out in many parts of the country. Those numbers are sure to have moved north. It is likely that the metropolitan cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai, have infection rates of around 20%; other Indian cities, 15%; and rural India 7.5%. India’s top 10 cities have a population of around 110 million. At a 20% infection rate, they would have seen 22 million cases. India has a rural population of around 850 million people, and an infection rate of 7.5% translates into around 64 million cases. The remaining 340 million urban population would have seen 51 million infections at a 15% infection rate. That works out to a total of 137 million cases – which means that for every infection recorded, India is missing 15, which too is plausible. At an aggregate level, this translates into an overall infection (or exposure) rate of approximately 10%, although the number is likely to be far higher in some large cities, and much lower in some remote rural areas.Interestingly – and I did not assume numbers with this end in mind, although it may now seem like that – at 137,000 dead (the current death toll in India), and 137 million infections, India’s infection fatality rate works out to 0.1%, which some experts believe to be a reasonable estimate of the Covid-19’s fatality rate. Sure, it is likely (very likely) that India’s actual death toll is higher, but it is just as likely that the number of cases is as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8asZFrTHpXfxKnAmjeHagN.html

The judge was hearing a suo moto {of its own accord} petition on the condition of Child Care Homes during the pandemic when suddenly an image flashed on the screen of a bare-chested person adjusting the camera of the standing counsel for the Kerala government, G Prakash.The bench called out to the lawyer appearing on the screen, “Someone is standing beside you who is shirtless.” There was no response from the other end and the next moment, the link with the lawyer could not be established. The bare-chested person was also a lawyer, ML Jishnu, who is related to Prakash.Upset by the behaviour of the lawyer in question, the bench, also comprising justice Hemant Gupta ,said: “Even after seven to eight months of telling lawyers to be careful during videoconferencing, you (advocates) are so reckless.”“I was not able to hear or see the courtroom. Before the hearing started, the link was connected but later it disappeared. It was during that time somebody was helping to fix the system for me. But I was fully dressed up in my advocate robe and because my device faced technical glitch I was unable to hear or see what happened in the court,” Prakash told HT.This is the second instance in two months of a lawyer appearing without a shirt during a virtual hearing at the Supreme Court. On October 27, another lawyer appeared shirtless during the hearing of a case before a bench presided over by justice DY Chandrachud. The judge had then remarked, “Some decorum has to be maintained by lawyers while appearing before us. Caution must be taken in future.” Even solicitor general Tushar Mehta called the behaviour “unpardonable”.The lawyer who was involved then was MS Suvidutt who wrote to th solicitor general snd the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association president that he was attending the Vidyarambam (initiation of education) ceremony of his niece with his camera off. He expressed regret and apology for his inadvertent act. Since the videoconferencing proceedings started in March this year, lawyers across high courts too have been caught eating food and appearing casual dressed, lying on the bed, and even chewing gutka. In May this year, the Supreme Court secretary general Sanjeev S Kalgaonkar issued a notification allowing lawyers to shun their long robes and coats while appearing before the court through videoconferencing. The notification said, “The advocates may wear plain white-shirt/white-salwar-kameez/white saree, with a plain-white neck band’ during the hearings before the Supreme Court of f India through Virtual Court System till medical exigencies exist or until further orders.” A lawyer found smoking in the car during a virtual hearing before the Gujarat high court was fined Rs 10,000 for his conduct. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan faced an embarrassing moment when he was found smoking a hookah during the hearing of an important case before the Rajasthan high court. He escaped the eyes of the judge, though. In June, the Supreme Court hauled up a lawyer for appearing in a T-shirt, lounging on his bed. A bench remarked: “Minimum court etiquette in terms of what can be considered a decent dress, background, etc should be followed given the public nature of the hearings.” The lawyer was let off on offering an unconditional apology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-angered-after-man-appears-shirtless-during-online-hearing/story-wAbcpcx8A2n4o20AvyXCEP.html

Field Director, Sariska Tiger Reserve, RN Meena said tigress ST-14 gave birth to a cub two months ago. The reserve has six tigers, 10 tigresses and four sub-adults. The new cub takes the tiger population to 21.In May, tigress ST-12 was camera trapped with three new cubs in the reserve. This was the second litter of three cubs of 6-year-old ST-12. The cubs were three months old. In 2018, she had given birth to three cubs which dispersed after they became adults. In March 2020, after a two-year wait, Sariska tigress ST-10 and her cub were spotted in the Talvriksh range. Sariska Tiger Foundation,’s secretary Dinesh Verma welcomed the news of the new cub. “Sariska Tiger Reserve is certainly a potential habitat and can support a good number of big cats. The current number of 20 can increase up to 35 but for that we need to reduce grazing in and outside the reserve,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sariska-s-tiger-population-rises-to-21-with-new-cub/story-p7UjzRNIf11ejpMiOOctbL.html
02-12-2020||India||Expelled BJD MLA Pradeep Panigrahy allegedly stayed in hotels that cost Rs 2.7 lakh a day||Expelled BJD MLA Pradeep Panigrahy stayed at luxury hotels in Delhi and Mumbai that cost as much as Rs 2.71 lakh a day and had spent about Rs 84 lakh while staying in Hotel Taj in Mumbai during lockdown, investigators probing the disproportionate assets case of senior Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Pathak said.Panigrahy, who was expelled from BJD on Sunday for “anti-people activities” is under the scanner of both vigilance department as well as state CID over his suspected financial transactions with the tainted IFS officer as well as in the job scam in which several youths of Gopalpur were allegedly defrauded in the false promise of getting employment in of Tata Motors. Abhay Pathak’s son Akash had allegedly conned several youths by promising them jobs in Tata Motors.Vigilance officials who raided the house of the IFS officer again on Tuesday said they were trying to find out if the officer had any illegal financial transaction with the MLA. Pathak has been accused of amassing Rs 9.3 crore of assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.The Biju Janata Dal has accused Panigrahy of flying in chartered planes and enjoying luxurious accommodations in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Pune when the Covid-19 situation was grave in Ganjam district. “He was cheating people of his own constituency and taking bribes promising the unemployed youth to provide them jobs through Akash Pathak. He also broke people’s trust by leading a lavish lifestyle while people of Ganjam suffered during Covid. That’s why Naveen Patnaik took the strongest action against him,” said BJD spokesman Lenin Mohanty.“CM consciously used the word anti-people as Panigrahy was like Nero playing music when the whole Rome was burning. It is a very insensitive inhuman display of power and arrogance that is characteristic of an anti-people attitude by Pradeep Panigrahy,” Mohanty said.A defiant Panigrahy asked why the government did not stop him when he travelled in chartered flights during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Why now? I have travelled with due permission of DGCA and AAI. There is nothing wrong in it,” he said.Panigrahy alleged he was being made scapegoat to divert public attention from issues like the murder case of a 5-year-old girl in Nayagarh and famers’ suicide. “There is no official complaint registered against me. Yet police are picking my relatives and family members at midnight and using third degree torture in order to coerce them to lodge FIR against me,” he said.Panigrahy said he has written a letter to Naveen Patnaik in which he has accused police of torturing his relatives and forcing them to give statements against him.“Government is misusing its agencies to harass me and my family members. I don’t know whether the CM knows about these motivated conspiracies against me. However, I tried to reach out to Naveen Patnaik through phone call, but they didn’t allow me to talk to him. I urge the media to stop ‘media trial’ against me. I still trust the Chief Minister. He had affections towards me. I just want to know if he is aware of the harassments I have been facing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expelled-bjd-mla-pradeep-panigrahy-allegedly-stayed-in-hotels-that-cost-rs-2-7-lakh-a-day/story-9ByFYvT7DsyloA1hMGuolL.html
02-12-2020||India||TMC staves off crisis, says rebel leader Suvendu Adhikari not leaving party||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Tuesday night avoided a major crisis before the crucial assembly polls when its heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari told top leaders at a discreetly held meeting that he will not leave the party. Adhikari had been maintaining a distance from the TMC for more than two months. He stopped attending office, triggering rumours that he might join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Going a step further, he resigned from the cabinet on Friday. He was in charge of three important departments, including transport. The most significant part of Tuesday’s meeting, held at an undisclosed location in north Kolkata, is that the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant kishor were present at the meeting along with two senior Lok Sabha members, Saugata Roy and Sudip Bandopadhyay. Senior TMC leaders told HT last month that Adhikari was unhappy with organizational decisions taken by Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor, who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Adhikari and Banerjee even took potshots at each other without taking names at recent public meetings. Significantly, senior TMC leaders said that Adhikari, who was earlier appointed election observer for several districts, including Murshidabad, had demanded that people of his choice be fielded next year from around 65 assembly seats. The leadership did not accept this. “The talks went extremely well. Suvendu said he is very much in the party. I invited Abhishek Banerjee and Adhikari to sit for talks. Adhikari will make his position public. I had been saying all along that he would not leave the TMC,” said Roy after the two-hour talks. “I informed the chief minister what emerged at the meeting,” Roy told HT. Roy and Bandopadhyay had been holding talks with Adhikari over the past two weeks under instructions from Mamata Banerjee. On Friday, the disgruntled legislator from Nandigram in East Midnapore district dealt a blow to the TMC and Mamata Banerjee by resigning from the state cabinet. He also quit the Haldia Development Authority and the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners. He was chairman of both the bodies. “This is a good development. What was happening was not good for the party,” said Adhikari’s father and the TMC’s seniormost Lok Sabha member Sisir Adhikari. The former minister’s elder brother is also a Lok Sabha member from East Midnapore. “The TMC has shown great maturity by dealing with the crisis through talks,” said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay.The BJP’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh described the developments as the TMC’s internal matter.“This is an internal matter of the TMC. A lot of leaders from the TMC have joined us. Many more will come in the future,” Ghosh told a local news channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-staves-of-crisis-says-rebel-leader-suvendu-adhikari-not-leaving-party/story-5VTggxSm1CrJ8HLvx0UJlK.html
02-12-2020||India||Asked to comment on Kangana Ranaut, Shiv Sainik Urmila Matondkar responds||Actor-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar on Tuesday joined the Shiv Sena, nearly a month after her name was proposed by the party for one of the 12 nominated seats in the Maharashtra legislative Council, and one among the several questions put to her was about actor Kangana Ranaut, who had called her a “soft porn star”.Matondkar declined to speak on the war of words between actor Kangana Ranaut and Shiv Sena leaders, underscoring she is not Kangana’s “fan”. “I think much has been spoken on Kangana. No need to give her that much importance now. Everybody has the right and freedom to criticise, she is free to do it. I wish to clear this today that I never responded to her [Kangana] in my interview [earlier],” she said.Senior Sena leaders said that the party leadership was impressed with the manner in which Matondkar took on actor Kangana Ranaut when the latter and the Sena were locked in a war of words after Ranaut equated Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Also Watch l Actor & former Congress leader Urmila Matondkar joins Shiv Sena The former Congress leader, who had quit the party after contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, said she was impressed by the work undertaken by Uddhav Thackeray and his government. Thackeray’s wife Rashmi tied the ‘shiv bandhan’ (a saffron thread) to formally induct Matondkar in the party. Held at the CM’s residence Matoshree, the event was attended by Thackeray and other senior leaders like Subhash Desai, Anil Desai, Aadesh Bandekar, among others.“It has been 14 months since I quit Congress and not 14 hours. There is a huge difference when people quit a party and immediately join another. But I think Maha [Vikas] Aghadi government has done a praiseworthy job in the state. They got only three months of normal working [before pandemic]. Uddhav ji has steered the state very well. He shows strength where needed and speaks to us like a family member when required,” said Matondkar while speaking to a posse of reporters after joining the party. The actor defended her switch from Congress to a hardline Hindutva party and said that she has been close to Hindu religion but never needed to “tom-tom” it. “Hindutva doesn’t mean hating other religions. I am a Hindu by birth and my actions. I can speak a lot about religion as I have studied it. Never needed to speak about it,” she said.Responding to a question on how long will her new political stint last, considering she joined and quit the Congress party within a few months in 2019, she said, “When I quit the Congress party, I quit the party but not politics. See my letter [written to the party], I had said that I will continue to work for the people. I will continue working for the people from the grassroots,” he said.Speaking about Thackeray recommending her name as one of the 12 nominated members, she said, “Uddhav ji called and told me a beautiful thing that he wanted to uphold the social and cultural standard of Vidhan Bhavan. He said that he needed people like me. I consider myself fortunate.” She said that she was offered an MLC seat by the Congress but she declined it.Matondkar had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai North constituency on a Congress ticket. In September 2019, she quit the Congress, stating that her efforts to work for the betterment of the party did not find support.Matondkar will help the Sena spread its message on a national platform, say party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asked-to-comment-on-kangana-ranaut-shiv-sainik-urmila-matondkar-responds/story-ow0TOU1AiJMffwleV0O8HL.html
02-12-2020||India||A trip to the holy land of Varanasi is healing and enlightening||From the ancient waters of the Ganges to the thousands in search of spiritual awakening along with flocks of migratory Siberian birds seeking refuge -Varanasi is one of the most enchanting showcase of the mystic of India. A trip to this holy land at this time of the year is an enlightening experience. With the ghats all lit up with thousands of lights and tiny diyas that are set afloat down river in honour of Kartik Poornima, also called Dev Deepavali or the Deepavali of gods, has pilgrims from across the world flock this landscape for contemplation in order to find the light within.Swami Ramnareshacharya who heads the Shri Math, credited for reintroducing the festival of Dev Deepavali in the 1980s and giving it the shape that we recognise says, “The festivals in India start from Sharad Purnima and Dev Deepawali is the culmination of all festivals. Diyas are lit along the banks to welcome the gods and mark their descent on earth.”Narrating the legend, he says, “Dev Deepavali, is celebrated to mark the victory of Lord Shiva over demon Tripurasur.” Roshani Yadav, a rangoli enthusiast whose work can be seen dotted along the ghats, says, “ Rangoli is made to welcome gods on this auspicious occasion, a gesture specially designed to welcome Goddess Lakshmi.”She adds, “Rangoli is coined from two words, ‘Rang and Aavali’ which means row of colours. The patterns are usually made using marble dust, rice powder and crushed limestone.”This time around, Sumit Singh with Kashiyana Foundation lighted organic diyas made of cow dung. He says, “ These diyas once lit can be used to enrich the soil as manure. It is through the initiative of each one of us that we can bring about awareness and celebrate eco-friendly festivals for years to come.”What seems common to all civilisations all across the world is the act of bringing light to dispel darkness, fear and avarice. And as Ramnareshacharya says, “The tradition of lighting earthen lamps is to banish the evil within us. It is symbolic of the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, injustice over justice and peace over unhappiness.”Dev Deepavali is the time to kill the demons existing inside of us and in our society. There are demons in society who kill people, harm the innocents. But we all have some demons like anger, greed, jealousy, anxiety, depression are our inner demons, which harm us mentally and emotionally.On a stroll along the series of wide stone platforms descending to the river, it is revealed that along with religion, this land has been called home by the likes of Buddha, Jain Tirthankars, Kabir, Tulsi, contemporarily art lovers and historians such as Rai Krishnadasa, musician Gopal Mishra, Omkarnath Thakur, Ravi Shankar, Bismillah Khan, Girija Devi have kept this city relevant in the spheres of fine arts.The historic temples, the yogi babas and the monuments of Banaras are intriguing but you can’t miss the delectable street food. Jalebi and Dahi, samosa and dahi with green chutney, Kachori, Tamatar chaat with a piping hot cup of tea is an unforgettable food journey. From Malaiyo to Rabri Malai Lassi to thandai, one requires more than a lifetime to indulge in all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-trip-to-the-holy-land-of-varanasi-is-healing-and-enlightening/story-4E8g6xMsxWnAhJhIFqMKmJ.html
02-12-2020||India||Dolphins spotted along Mumbai coast earlier than usual this year||Dolphins may have made an appearance along Mumbai’s coastline earlier than usual this year.Conservation biologist and Malabar Hill resident Darshan Khatau, who has been documenting the movement of the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin annually for the last four years, said sporadic sightings of dolphins were usually seen from the second or third week of December annually up to last week of May (just before the monsoon season).“This year, they arrived unusually early during the third week of November,” said Khatau. He spotted three individuals off Malabar Hill from November 15 and 16 onwards and has been regularly photographing them since. “In the previous years, the maximum number of individuals has been 12 in one pod. The early arrival could be due to shifts in ocean currents leading to more prey availability along the Mumbai coast.”Last Wednesday, a video was circulated on social media by environmentalist Zoru Bhathena of an Indian Ocean humpback dolphin spotted off Juhu beach.Also read | Maharashtra CM reviews Mumbai coastal road work; tunnelling to begin in JanuaryMarine biologists concurred with Khatau’s finding but said it cannot be verified as no official survey or study to monitor the population or behaviour of this species was carried out along Mumbai so far. “The Mumbai coast is used by Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) for biologically important activities. Darshan has been observing foraging, socialising and mating in the area he observes. It is possible that their early arrival is related to oceanographic characteristics - currents, productivity, and prey availability,” said Dr Dipani Sutaria, senior research fellow, who has undertaken extensive research in cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) along the west coast of India.Dr Baban Ingole, visiting scientist, National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under the Ministry of Earth Sciences and former chief scientist, National Institute of Oceanography, said, “Since these are observations over four years, I certainly support it, and this may be happening across other areas along the west coast too, but we must understand the specific reason why this might be happening.”Ingole explained that from April onwards till early November, fishing activities had been at its lowest due to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdown followed by the southwest monsoon (when the annual fishing ban is in place). “2020 was lean for fishing in at least over 10-15 years. There is enough evidence to suggest prey must be abundantly available along the coast. This means dolphins and other predators had enough food as compared to previous years. However, we must assess it now as the fishing activity picks up. Thus, we could expect more such sightings along the west coast,” said Ingole.The state fisheries department said fishing was practically zero during the lockdown followed by monsoon. From August onwards to the first week of November, it was just about 10% of what it is annually during this period. “This was because a large number of workers that generally come from Ratnagiri (as crew) avoided coming to Mumbai due to the pandemic. They arrived post Diwali, and since then, fishing activities has been about 40-45%,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner, Maharashtra fisheries department.Protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable, the Indian Ocean humpback dolphins have sporadic distribution, and are found in localised areas mainly in shallow waters very close to the shore (less than 20m deep, less than 1.5km from the shore, and around river mouths or estuaries), according to the Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Network of India. This dolphin species primarily feeds on fish such as mackerel, mullet, sardines and pomfret.“Since this is identified on the basis of live examples, it is an interesting identification. It could be due to changes in ocean currents which carry their feed material in plenty, and also may be favourable for their movement at the moment. Also, the Covid-19 associated lockdown may have improved water quality closer to the coast,” said E Vivekanandan, emeritus scientist at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.Vivekanandan however warned that with an increase in infrastructure projects planned along the Mumbai coast, there was an immediate need for a population estimation of the marine species. “It will help strengthen conservation measures and provide crucial information about the species,” he said.The state mangrove cell said they were focusing on occurrence and genetic studies related to Indian Ocean humpback dolphins along all coastal districts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai. “This has been proposed under our action plan for oceanic dolphin conservation under the Centre’s Project Dolphin program, which has been submitted to the state chief wildlife warden for approval. We hope such studies will help improve the understanding of this species,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dolphins-spotted-along-mumbai-coast-earlier-than-usual-this-year/story-131SlndfyFayw7D0ZLnI2L.html
02-12-2020||Editorials||Hold Facebook accountable | HT Editorial||Facebook will pay a hefty fee to mainstream news outlets in the United Kingdom (UK) to license their articles, according to a report in The Guardian. The social media company will create a dedicated news section, where paid contractors will select key news stories of the day from news media organisations. In return, the news organisations will get a dedicated fee. While the exact amount is not clear, a Facebook executive confirmed that it is an “extremely large investment”. The decision comes in the backdrop of the pressure on Facebook for its dominance of the online news market, and to support the finances of news publishers. It also comes soon after Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission issued a code of conduct to determine the compensation that online tech companies should pay to local publishers for content, and said that there was an “acute bargaining imbalance” between the two.These are significant developments which have the potential to affect not just the manner in which news is produced, distributed and consumed but also the foundations of democratic societies which depend on informed and civil discourse. This newspaper has consistently argued that Facebook (and Google) have taken advantage of the cover of being intermediaries/platforms to escape the ethical responsibility and legal and financial obligations that come with being a publisher. This has allowed the proliferation of fake news and the amplification of hate speech. It has also resulted in a blow to the media ecosystem. Mainstream news outlets invest in news gathering, editorial vetting, and publication of accurate stories — but global tech companies pick these stories, use it to increase their reach, and then use this reach to almost monopolise digital revenues. The mismatch between who invests and who profits is not just a commercial matter between companies — but threatens to undermine the system that enables democratic discourse.India must have a stronger regime that brings companies such as Facebook and Google under a regulatory framework and treats them for what they are — media companies. These companies must recognise that the days of leveraging free content and pushing out fake news is coming to an end — it is not just an act of irresponsibility but has now generated substantial backlash to erode their own brand legitimacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/hold-facebook-accountable-ht-editorial/story-AGk3uZkwiRQRxz46pUOKZI.html
02-12-2020||Editorials||Justin Trudeau is wrong, yet again | HT Editorial||The ministry of external affairs sharply rebuked comments by Canadian politicians on the farmer protests, coming close to calling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a speaker of untruths. There is a certain pattern in this. Canadian liberal politicians, under pressure from local Sikh voters, often feel the need to comment on anything concerning Punjab. What is unusual is that the present protests have no international repercussions. The Narendra Modi government has the legitimacy and mandate to carry out domestic reforms. Punjab’s farmers have the right to protest while the rest of India will express its viewpoint when it next goes to polls. All of this is within the realms of normal democratic procedure.There is of course room to criticise totalitarian regimes if they violate basic human rights — which is why calling out China for its Uighur concentration camps, for instance, which Canada has done more vociferously than India, is legitimate. But intervening on a policy or legislative issue within a democracy defies international norms.What emerged was a blatantly gratuitous intervention over an issue Mr Trudeau probably knows little about. Ironically, Canada has, for years, officially criticised India’s Minimum Support Price policy. There has been a global tendency towards letting diplomacy be infected by localitis, where local politics is allowed to overwhelm foreign policy positions. Judgments are best arrived by focusing on the overall bilateral relations which, in this case, face only one challenge — Mr Trudeau’s penchant for letting domestic messaging prevail over a key partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/justin-trudeau-is-wrong-yet-again-ht-editorial/story-E8CdE91BKiLUSioOLdLo2J.html
02-12-2020||Editorials||Convey concerns on China’s dam-building||The Chinese government will build a “super” dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river’s lower reaches close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Tibet, according to a Chinese State media report. The trans-border river, which originates in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), flows into Arunachal Pradesh where it is called Siang, and then to Assam as the Brahmaputra before flowing into Bangladesh. The new dam’s ability to generate hydropower could be three times that of central China’s Three Gorges Dam, which has the largest installed hydropower capacity in the world. As a lower riparian country, India has the right to be worried because this can have far-reaching impacts on the lives and livelihoods of its people. According to the United Nations, more than half the global population will live in water-stressed or water-scarce countries by 2025, and the vast majority of these people will be in China and India. While China is home to almost 20% of the world population, it has only about 7% of water resources. India is home to about 17% of the world’s population but has less than 4% of water resources. It is dependent on foreign-originating rivers for about a third of its surface water. As both grow economically, water consumption will increase and it will automatically place ever-greater pressure on water supplies. Macro challenges such as the climate crisis and pollution will further strain freshwater resources.India must explore all diplomatic and economic options to bring China to the discussion table. But whatever it does, timing will be key to make the right impact, says Water Wars: The Brahmaputra River and Sino-Indian Relations, a paper by the US Naval War College. The earlier India pushes back against Chinese dam building, the more options will be available to it in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/convey-concerns-on-china-s-dam-building/story-KNQGagHwUolKVUR0pmZKON.html
