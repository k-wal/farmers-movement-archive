28-12-2020||News||How biofuels can double farm incomes||India currently consumes only one-third of the global average consumption of energy. As we move towards more robust energy consumption figures, the country faces the unique challenge of fusing together disparate needs: A ballooning appetite while cutting dependence on imports; greening the grid while ensuring affordability; and replacing old forms of energy production while boosting employment, and the human and economic capital of the people. Then there’s the fact that the energy sector is closely intertwined with issues related to climate change. Needless to say, a vigorous ideation needs to undergird such energy transitions. The question is particularly cardinal for the sector I am in charge of: Petroleum and natural gas. We import about 84% of our oil and 56% of our gas for domestic use — and this in itself tends to negate the deliverables — delineated above — that we aspire to achieve. In this context, biofuels have become a tool for achieving these delicate balance of outcomes. In the past few years, progress made in the use of ethanol, compressed biogas and biodiesel — all different forms of biofuel — will have a direct positive impact on both farm incomes (and the prosperity of agricultural communities), even as it cuts down our import dependence for energy. Currently, the aim is to achieve 10% ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20% blending by 2030 — something that will cut down carbon emissions in vehicles. In 2019, in a first for the Republic Day parade, the Indian Air Force flew aircraft in a Vic formation, with the lead plane using a mix of traditional fuel and biofuel, symbolising the government’s determination to seek alternative sources of fuel. The primary raw material for ethanol production in India is sugarcane and its by-products, accounting for more than 90% of fuel ethanol supplies under the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme of the ministry. This programme injects liquidity into the stressed sugar sector and provides an alternative revenue stream to farmers. This programme also encourages diversion of sugarcane for ethanol production, which results in a decrease in the sugar glut in the country. Ethanol supplies have improved from 380 million litres in 2013-14 to 1.89 billion litres in 2019. Offers of about 3.5 billion litres from both sugar/molasses and grain-based distilleries are expected this year. In addition to sugarcane, ethanol is also produced from damaged food grains, B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice. This translates into a sum of nearly Rs 35,000 crore in the past six years — money that has flown back to farmers through sugar mills and distilleries as oil marketing companies (OMCs) provide off-take guarantee at fixed prices. This arrangement also improves the health of the payment cycle to farmers since OMCs settle their ethanol dues to distilleries in 21 days instead of the months that the farmers had to wait for their payment from sugar mills.The recent decision to utilise surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India and maize as an additional source of feedstock for ethanol production, starting this year, means farmers will now have an alternative market for their produce.With regards biodiesel, the National Policy on Biofuels in 2018 targets 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short-gestation crops. These crops can be easily cultivated in various states on land that is barren or not fit for edible crops, thus boosting farm incomes. Biodiesel procured by OMCs for blending high speed diesel has increased from 11.9 million litres in 2015-16 to 105.5 million litres last year.The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme launched in October 2018 aims to establish an ecosystem for production of compressed biogas (CBG) from various waste biomass sources in the country. Under SATAT, 5000 CBG plants with a total production capacity of 15 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA), which is equivalent to 54 MMSCMD of gas by 2023, has been planned. This initiative offers a potential for investment of about Rs 1.75 lakh crore, generating about 75,000 direct employment opportunities. Many of the proposed plants will use crop residue such as paddy straw and biomass as feedstock for production of CBG, especially in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The SATAT scheme will not only stanch greenhouse gas emissions, but will reduce burning of agricultural residue, which results in significant air pollution in cities like Delhi, generate employment in rural and waste management sectors, and boost income for farmers from their unutilised organic waste. One of the byproducts of CBG plants is biomanure, which can be used in farming.The components of a biofuel supply chain create a circular rural economy that results in substantial environmental, socio-economic and health benefits for communities. A total of Rs 1 lakh crore worth of biofuel will be purchased by OMCs every year in the near future for blending. This money will be ploughed back to the rural economy, thus doubling farmers’ incomes. Keeping in mind international climate commitments and domestic requirements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis has been on energy availability, accessibility and affordability; efficiency in energy use; energy sustainability; and energy security for mitigating global uncertainties. The quest, therefore, has been to shift the perception and the functioning of my ministry from one focused on international trade to one that strengthens the human development indices of the poorest standing in the queue.

According to officials, even the national apparel export has suffered a loss of over 20% due to the pandemic.Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida apparel export cluster (NAEC), said that due to Covid-19, the export of apparel between January and November this year has suffered a decline of ₹8,000 from 2019’s tally for the same period. “Apparel trade, which is integrated with the global value chain, has suffered a lot in both imports and exports due to disruption caused by the pandemic. There has been a severe impact on order position of exporters, global apparel consumption, working capital, raw material and pending refunds. The apparel export from Noida has come down to ₹17,000 crore between January and November this year, as compared to ₹25,000 crore last year for the same span of time,” he said. He added that overseas buyers and buying houses were either cancelling or postponing confirmed orders indefinitely right from the first day of lockdown in India. “Though the situation was improved to a large extent after the union textile minister’s appeal to do “commerce with compassion”, the fresh lockdown in the UK and other European countries once again worsened the situation for exporters,” Thukral said.According to data provided by the apparel export promotion council (AEPC), textile and apparel exporters suffered a severe fall of 91% in the month of April this year as compared to the same month last year – the nationwide lockdown was announced from March 25, 2020.AEPC is the official body of apparel exporters in India. AEPC chairman, A Sakthivel, said that after the continuous fall in export for five months, the sector witnessed a positive shift in September-October. “India’s apparel exports rose by 10.22% in September this year to $1,190 million, from $1,079 million a year ago. Similarly, it rose by 6.3% in October 2020 to $1,177 million from $1,107 million a year ago. The recovery from the huge fall of April this year to a 10% rise in September corroborates the industry’s belief that the apparel sector is already on its path to a V-shaped recovery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pandemic-effect-apparel-export-in-noida-down-by-32-this-year/story-Vi3LpK2GDISiYNGvCsz3fO.html
28-12-2020||Noida||For the first time, RT-PCR test share surpasses rapid antigen in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: For the first time, the number of RT-PCR tests in the Ghaziabad district has exceeded the number of rapid antigen tests. According to data from the district health department, the testing through rapid antigen kits has been on the higher side in each month from July to November, but the trend has now reversed in December. The use of rapid antigen kits for Covid-19 was allowed on June 26. Out of 88,253 tests conducted from December 1 to December 27, the share of RT-PCR testing is 55.88%, while the antigen testing has a share of 44.12%, shows the data. The figure of RT-PCR testing also includes 3.32% of testing done through the TrueNat method, officials said, adding that they are now focussing more on RT-PCR testing. The share of RT-PCR tests was 26.89% (of 83,787 tests) in July, 44.11% (of 92,395 tests) in August, 38.19% (of 117,951 tests) in September, 44.12% (of 125,699 tests) in October and 44.84% (of 121,274 tests) conducted in November. “Since the active caseload has declined and we have lesser number of positive cases coming in, the RT-PCR testing is on rise. We will be focussing more on RT-PCR testing in coming days. The RT-PCR is more reliable and we will make efforts that the turnaround time for getting its test results is decreased. However, antigen tests will also continue,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The UP government has directed that the ratio of RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing should be 40% and 60%, respectively. “We have been facing short supply of rapid antigen kits. So, more of RT-PCR tests were getting conducted,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named. According to the official records, the district till December 27 has conducted overall 636,819 tests since March that include 361,191 tests conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits. The overall share of the rapid antigen kits in total testing till December 27 is about 56.71%. “There is no issue if the district conducts more of RT-PCR tests but the issue with the time in getting the test results. If the results can be provided the same day, RT-PCR will be more fruitful as its sensitivity is about 80% as compared to about 60% of the rapid antigen kits,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. The health department officials said that the RT-PCR test results are generally received in 1-2 days from labs outside the district while the new RT-PCR laboratory in Ghaziabad provides the results within 24 hours but conducting only 550-600 tests per day. Alok Kumar, UP’s principal secretary (health), on Monday said that more of tests through RT-PCR are getting conducted. “It is because we now have required infrastructure in place. Yesterday, we conducted overall 125,734 tests which included 67,807 tests through RT-PCR and this is more than 50% share. So, we are now doing more of RT-PCR tests,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/for-the-first-time-rt-pcr-test-share-surpasses-rapid-antigen-in-ghaziabad/story-EQ7DPYWMwmmJz8U2T5W7mO.html

Two suspects were arrested in connection with the incident.Police said the suspects, 21-year-old Govind Sharma and his friend 22-year-old Amit Kumar, were jealous over the victim Ajay Kumar’s flower business doing well. All three were residents of Sarita Vihar in Delhi. The murder happened even as passersby and vehicles rushed past, some even stopping to take videos of the attack that later found their way to social media. The videos purportedly caught an unmasked Govind and Amit beating the victim with iron rods multiple times before fleeing. Police said the duo had pulled the victim out of an auto-rickshaw he had hired to go home after closing his shop for the day at around 11.30 am and assaulted him.“They kept on hitting him for about 3-4 minutes and later fled. When police received information about the assault, a team rushed to the spot near DLF Ankur Vihar and took the victim to a hospital where he succumbed to severe head injuries,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). Later, police formed several teams to arrest the suspects.“The two suspects were arrested from Loni. Govind is the prime suspect and he had planned the murder with the help of his accomplice. Govind operated a flower shop for the past several years outside a temple in Loni, while the victim had opened up his shop about eight months ago. The prime suspect said that this affected his busines,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). While videos showed one of the suspects holding what appeared to be a gun, Raja said no shots were fired in the crime. “We have also recovered the blood stained iron rods from the suspects.”Police said Govind and Ajay had argued over the issue several times previously.On the day, another video emerged in which Govind was purportedly seen stabbing the victim’s brother, Sanjay Kumar, at the shop and had threatened to kill him.“That incident happened in April this year. We have informed senior officers about it and an inquiry is going on against the local police post officers to find if they were lax in dealing with that . I have been informed that the two parties involved in that incident had reached a compromise and gave it in writing to the police. I have issued directions to find this compromise letter and probe details of the case,” said the SP.The family of the victim also gave a police complaint on Monday in which they named Govind. The two suspects were booked under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder) with 34 (common intention), and police said they will also levy section 120B (criminal conspiracy).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/23-year-old-beaten-to-death-with-iron-rods-on-road-in-ghaziabad/story-BousnUqWck0aKaj1hyosYI.html

It imposed a ₹50,000 penalty against each violator. “We will conduct random inspections at other premises to make sure that the waste is segregated all households and commercial buildings and penalise violators.”As per waste management rules, it is mandatory to segregate waste at the premises and hand it over to the agency that transports it for the treatment. It also requires buildings built on at least 5,000 square metres or produces 100 kg waste daily treat it at their premises. Residents have been told to segregate waste into plastic, dry and wet waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-establishments-in-noida-s-sector-18-penalised-over-flouting-waste-handling-rules/story-WPYOIAgAwXVbnCpkHEVWwK.html
28-12-2020||Noida||Garbage burning continues in Noida||Illegal waste burning continues in certain areas in Noida, compounding the already unhealthy air in the city and surrounding regions. District officials blame a number of unauthorised clusters of scrap dealers for dumping and burning the city’s garbage. On Monday, a huge pile of illegally dumped solid waste near sector 62 was burnt, while there was another such pile already dumped along areas like Bahlolpur in sector-63. “This is perhaps fifth time that the garbage has been burnt in this neighbourhood. The main culprits are scrap dealers who get waste from industries recover what’s useful to them and dump the rest at roadside and burn it at tbeir will,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur residents’ welfare association (RWA), sector-63. “We have become used to breathing uneasily due to the smoke. We have been complaining about it over Twitter and WhatsApp groups, but the issue continues,” said Sundar Yadav, a Bahlolpur resident. Another resident pointed out that several spots, including areas around the under-construction underpass that connects sector-63 with the FNG road, including Radha Krishna Temple in the same area, are one of the places where burning often happens. “Several pocket of this area have been illegally converted into a dump yard,” said Naresh Singh, another resident. “Scrap dealers have become a big menace because of the illegal dumping and burning of the waste across Noida. Earlier too, we had faced similar issue due to a makeshift colony of scrap dealers near sector-57. We will look into the matter and take legal action against miscreant in sector-63 soon,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty (health), Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/garbage-burning-continues-in-noida/story-JKQk7HBgbFXvfZm1Fft1dL.html
28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Mayor elections: All’s not well within Chandigarh BJP again||History repeats itself. Chandigarh mayoral elections are due on January 8, and strife within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the nomination, as witnessed in the last four years, seems to be playing out yet again. This time around, the matter has been further complicated with BJP state president Arun Sood also said to be one of the contenders for the post. Some party members and councillors are learnt to be unhappy with the prospect of one person holding two posts. “The party follows one-man-one-post principle. If the state president is chosen as the mayor, then we would demand that he relinquishes his other post,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity. With a clear majority in the House, the party’s nominee is destined to become the mayor. However, in the last four mayoral elections, there has been marked infighting with even rebel candidates standing up against the party nominee. In 2018, Asha Jaswal, backed by Arun Sood and other councillors, filed separate nomination in protest against the candidature of Davesh Moudgil. She later withdrew it after the intervention of the high command. In 2019, Rajesh Kalia was the chosen nominee, but Satish Kainth filed nomination in protest.MC election later in the yearThis time around the mayoral elections become even more crucial as fresh MC elections are slated for the end of the year. “In an election year, the party organisation needs to be strengthened. At the same time, pending works have to be completed by July-August so that the party can face the electorate. Combining the two posts in one man will weaken the party position in the election,” said a councillor, who didn’t want to be named. Meanwhile, supporters of Sood’s candidature are contending that his record as the mayor in 2016 shows that he can deliver results in the election year. “Sood was able to get the work done through the city’s bureaucracy. This year, that’s what the party needs. After his performance, the party had a thumping victory in MC elections,” said another councillor. Downplaying the tussle going on within the party, Dinesh Kumar, organisation secretary, said, “The party follows the one-man-one-post principle, but there are exceptions to it too.” The state party in-charge Dushyant Gautam, who is slated to arrive on December 30, said, “Nothing is decided yet. From December 30, we will start interacting with councillors and party leaders on the issue and take their views.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mayor-elections-all-s-not-well-within-chandigarh-bjp-again/story-YOpZF4CERXxmR1jAw0VN9J.html
28-12-2020||Noida||Cold wave in Noida for rest of the week||The final week of 2020 is expected to be a chilly one with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting a cold wave from Tuesday. Officials added that the national capital regions will also see moderate to dense fog till December 31. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10°C or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. It is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4°C in the plains. According to the IMD, the wind directions have changed from easterly to the icy cold north westerly from Monday evening. “Due to the passage of a western disturbance (a wind phenomenon arising from the Mediterranean) the hilly regions have received good snowfall which will start showing its effect from Tuesday onwards when the winds blow from there. The mercury will fall by 3 to 4 °C and reach around 3°C on December 31. The day time temperatures will be around normal,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature for Noida on Monday was recorded at 9.8 °C against 7.6 °C a day earlier. The maximum temperature was recorded at 19.1°C against 21.3°C a day earlier. Over the weekend, the city had seen a rise in temperature due to the comparatively warmer easterly winds. Meanwhile, the average minimum temperature for the national capital region, based on IMD’s Safdarjung observatory, was recorded at 5.6 °C, as against 6 °C the day before. The average maximum temperature was recorded at 20.9 °C. “The minimum temperature may fall around 4 °C in average around different spots in NCR including Noida,” said an official at IMD. “The sky is clear and the icy cold winds will drop the mercury leading to cold morning hours. Since the sky is clear and there are no clouds to trap the heat during the evening hours, there will be nip in the air around evening as well,” said Sriastava. According to the officials however, the mercury will start rising and fog density reduce from January 1. AQI IMPROVESMeanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad improved markedly due to better ventilation conditions. On Monday, the air quality index (AQI) for Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 225 or “poor” against 405 a day earlier. The AQI for Greater Noida was 237, also “poor”, against 418 or “severe” a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 256, also “poor”, against 407 a day earlier.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality would see slight improvement towards Tuesday, however it will start worsening towards Wednesday. “The AQI is likely to improve to the lower end -end of the “very-poor” to “poor” category for December 28 and 29. AQI is likely to deteriorate thereafter to the middle-end of the “very-poor” category by December 30. Due to the low ventilated conditions, the AQI is likely to touch the higher end of “very-poor” category on December 31 and may touch the “severe” category for a shorter period on New Year’s Eve,” said the SAFAR statement on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cold-wave-in-noida-for-rest-of-the-week/story-J4revbNdbhjSqZVOwoYyGK.html

The protesters said, and the Greater Noida Authority confirmed, that it recommended that land leased to native farmers be cancelled. The protesters arrived at around noon and attempted to enter the building. Police, however, foiled it. Instead, the farmers set up a makeshift tent and said they would continue the protest till their demands were met. Traffic, however, was not hit.The government had acquired the village lands for development in 2007-’08. However, later the original owners protested demanding the land back. The Greater Noida authority thereafter decided to lease the land back to them, without rent, for 90 years. In 2017, allegations were raised that rules were violated and land leased to people outside the district and who were not farmers. A SIT headed by Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) chief executive officer (CEO) Arun Vir Singh was constituted then and it submitted a report to the Uttar Pradesh government on December 14.“Instead of acting against the outsiders, the SIT recommended that residential plots allotted to 2,300 native farmers who gave their land also be cancelled,” said Manveer Bhati a member of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, which is leading the protest. Farmers also demanded 10% share of developed residential plots. Greater Noida Authority officer on special duty Sachin Kumar tried to end the impasse, but to no avail. “We will end the protest only if the Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan assures us that our demands will be accepted,” said Bhati. Bhooshan said, “The SIT report is not final as yet as the government has sought some clarifications. Farmers do not need to worry as their suggestions also will be included in the report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bisrakh-village-farmers-protest-outside-greater-noida-office/story-2bcX7I8kr7ml54Bm6wmIaM.html
28-12-2020||Chandigarh||New Year’s Eve: Chandigarh hoteliers seek clarity on night curfew||With the Chandigarh administration failing to take a decision on the imposition of night curfew on New Year’s Eve, confusion and anxiety prevails among hoteliers.Amid fear of spread of the new strain of coronavirus, the administration had earlier stated that it was considering imposing night curfew. In a review meeting held on December 23, it was decided to wait and watch for a few days. A senior official said on Monday that there was no plan to impose night curfew so far, but the final decision will be taken by the UT administrator.Reeling under heavy losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Chandigarh has demanded immediate clarity on the issue, stating that any decision to impose night curfew in the city would adversely affect their businesses.“The hospitality industry is slowly limping back and any short-notice decision will bring considerable loss to the units that are endeavouring to organise New Year’s Eve parties. Hotels have started booking events and the decision should be communicated at the earliest,” said Arvinder Pal Singh, association president.Meanwhile, requesting the administration not to impose the night curfew, Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association, and joint secretary, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India, said: “The hospitality industry has been facing losses, high retrenchment and imminent closure of several outlets. During New Year’s time, the industry will follow all Covid protocol as laid down from time to time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-year-s-eve-chandigarh-hoteliers-seek-clarity-on-night-curfew/story-arlSMBYECjvyi3BucjQKcN.html
28-12-2020||City||Kharar flyover project set to meet Jan 15 deadline: SDM||Running late by two years, the Kharar flyover project is all set to meet the latest deadline of January 15, 2021. “We are almost through with the project with work under progress on about 2% of the stretch towards Ropar. The flyover construction is expected to be completed by January 15,” said Himanshu Jain, subdivisional magistrate, Kharar, after the complete Verka Chowk to Khanpur-Ludhiana stretch was thrown open to the public on Monday. The national highway where the flyover is located connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab, besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck, as about 50,000 vehicles cross the stretch daily.The ₹350-crore project was initiated in November 2015 and has missed six deadlines, after initially slated to be completed in three years by December 2018. The Balongi stretch of the 10-kilometre project was the first to be opened in October this year, followed by widening of the road between Balongi and Kharar T-point and construction of another two stretches of flyover and three minor bridges in early December. Sharing the milestones achieved since July 2019, Jain said: “Taking possession of multiple pieces of land was a major bottleneck. Demolition drives were conducted since July last year and about 99% length of the project was cleared for shifting of utilities, drain work and service road, which was earlier only 40%.” Thereafter, working on mission mode, the completion of drain work was accomplished, pulling it up from 20% to 100%, followed by construction of service roads and shifting of high-tension lines in a timely manner, which was pending since long. “Despite Covid-19 challenge, regular supply of fly ash and gravels from Ropar was ensured. Flyover top structures are now complete and the progress on the wall of the elevated approach road is almost 95%,” said the SDM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharar-flyover-project-set-to-meet-jan-15-deadline-sdm/story-KN2cinLwRJAHx9wjsx7o6L.html

28-12-2020||City||Man beaten to death in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: A 23-year-old man was beaten to death with iron rods by two assailants in Ankur Vihar area of Loni in Ghaziabad on Monday morning, police said.Two different video clips of the incident that were widely shared on social media shows passersby recording the attack on their phones as the assailants beat the victim mercilessly. The cops said the attackers, who were arrested later in the evening, held a grudge that the flower shop of the victim outside a temple in Loni was doing well while their business had slowed down.Police said the victim, Ajay Kumar, and the assailants, Govind Sharma, 21, and his friend, Amit Kumar, 22, lived in southeast Delhi’s Sarita Vihar. Superintendent of Police (Rural) Iraj Raja said Govind planned the murder with his friend. “Govind had been selling flowers outside the Loni temple for the past several years. However, his business was affected after the Ajay opened his shop there eight months ago,” said SP Raja while explaining the motive behind the crime.Police said the incident took place when Ajay boarded an auto to return home after closing his shop. The suspects pulled him out and started beating him with iron rods, investigators said. “They kept on hitting him for about 3-4 minutes. Passersby recorded videos of the incident but did not help the victim. Soon after getting the information, the police rushed to the spot and took the victim to a hospital where he succumbed to critical head injuries,” the SP said.Based on police complaint by the victim’s family on Monday, an FIR was registered against the two suspects under IPC section 302 (murder) with 34 (common intention). Police said that they will also add section 120b (criminal conspiracy) as the murder was planned. “We have also recovered the two iron rods from the suspects,” SP Raja said.Meanwhile, another video allegedly related to victim’s brother, Sanjay Kumar, also surfaced on the social media on Monday. It purportedly shows Govind stabbing Sanjay at the shop.“With regards to the old video of a stabbing incident in April, we have informed senior officers and an inquiry is going on against the local police-post officers to find if they had shown any laxity. I have been informed that the two parties had then reached a compromise and gave it in writing to the police. I have directed officials to find the compromise letter and details of the previous case,” the SP said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-beaten-to-death-in-ghaziabad/story-y7pfUuwhp5NUfCqfPWCVwM.html
28-12-2020||City||Farmers protesting in Delhi say they will attend the meeting with Centre||New Delhi: The farmer groups protesting against the three contentious farm laws at four different borders near Delhi said the different union representatives will attend the meeting called by the central government on Wednesday to discuss the farm laws and end the deadlock, as their agitation entered 33rd day on Monday amidst the prevailing cold weather.On Monday evening, he farmer unions held two meetings to discuss their stand on the government’s invitation and plan the further course of action. Farmer leaders who were part of the meetings said that the fate of the farmers and the future of their agitation would depend on the outcome of Wednesday’s meetings with the government. The farmer have also decided to hold a tractor march on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal highway on December 30 (Wednesday).“In the meeting, leaders of all the unions decided to attend the meeting with the government on Wednesday. Everything now depends on the outcome of the meeting. We are hoping that the government will accept our demands,” said Satnam Singh Sahni, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Doaba group.Addressing a gathering of farmers at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border, BKU’s national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said that the government’s meeting scheduled on Tuesday has been rescheduled on Wednesday.“We will keep our demands before the government in our seventh round of talks. Hopefully, the government will understand the problems of farmers. We should continue our agitation peacefully till patiently,” said Tikait.At least six borders connecting Delhi and Haryana – Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh -- are closed since November 26, when thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana arrived there and began their agitation, demanding that the government repeal the farm laws. The UP Gate and Chilla borders, connecting Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh are partially closed, as movement of vehicles to Delhi from the two places are suspended.The traffic between Delhi-Haryana and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh is being diverted to the alternate borders since the borders were closed and the police placed sand-laden trucks, iron and concrete barricades with barbed wire atop, and iron containers to form multi-layered security arrangements and stop the farmers from proceeding into Delhi.At the Singhu and Tikri borders, hundreds of volunteers were seen serving meals, tea, snacks, medicines, jaggery and gajjaks to farmers through various tents set up on the roads and tractor trolleys. At many places, the farmers at Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla borders were seen comforting themselves around small log fires and braving the cold.On Monday, many women and children also joined the male farmers in the protest. “Since the male members of our families have been fighting this battle and braving the cold weather, why we women should sit at home and wait them to die. It’s not just their (male farmers) battle, but of the entire farmer community. We will either die here protesting or go back home together after the government accepts our demands,” said Sabreen Kaur from Punjab’s Patiala.The core-committee of the farmers unions is likely to hold another meeting on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protesting-in-delhi-say-they-will-attend-the-meeting-with-centre/story-avvG87LUqrInblNCPCQn3M.html

28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s booming economy descends into gloom||The pandemic hit Ludhiana where it hurts the most- its industry. Beginning with the migrant exodus in March, which was triggered by the sudden announcement of the lockdown, the industry was faced with one challenge after the other throughout the year. The easing of the lockdown in May was of little help as the rising steel prices added fuel to fire even as the industry was struggling to bring back its labour, The weekend curfew announced by the state government wreaked havoc to sectors such as hotels, malls, cinema halls, gyms and saloons. Shutting down of Atlas cycles in Ghaziabad on June 1 brought more misery for over 80 vendors in Ludhiana who supplied cycle parts to the firm. The only silver lining for the industry in Ludhiana was the surge in the sales of bicycles post-lockdown when fitness was high on people’s minds. The hosiery sector too had a difficult year. While the production was hit in summer months owing to the lockdown, the extremely low demand from showrooms and garment stores turned it into the worst year for the sector. Towards the end of the year, the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s agricultural reforms brought the industry on its knees as goods trains stopped running and hit the supply. Heart-rending migrant exodusWith work suspended due to the lockdown, several labourers found themselves suddenly out of work. Faced with economic uncertainty, at a place where they had come to make a living, many felt it was best to return to their native places. But with road and rail transport suspended due to the lockdown, the migrants had no choice but to head to their hometowns on foot or cycles. “Such was the panic of the pandemic that all we wanted was to go home and be with our families,” said Raju, a migrant worker from Sitamarhi district in Bihar, who has recently returned to the city after spending eight months in his native village. Even those who stayed back did not have it easy their employers refused to pay wages, citing losses. At an aluminium manufacturing plant in Macchiwara, around 200 migrant labourers protesting for wages were beaten up by the police. Shramik trains take away labour, hope In May when the industry was planning to restart work, around 3 lakh migrants left the city on special Shramik trains, started by the government to take them home. This huge exodus left the industry in despair as it was already battling a financial crunch, and with its labour force gone, the chances of recovery seemed bleak. The labour-instensive hosiery industry, for which the months of May and June, are peak seasons, lost valuable production time for winter wear. There was a section of the industry which stated that since they had to work under severe lockdown restrictions and at 50% capacity, paying wages to all its labourers was becoming difficult.Ludhiana becomes PPE’s manufacturing hub in stateAs soon as the coronavirus cases in the country began to surge, the hosiery sector in Ludhiana shifted to making Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits. Over a dozen firms in Ludhiana received huge orders from Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL), a centralised disbursing authority, for making PPE kits in April and May. Cycles sales see surge post lockdown With a sharp rise in demand post-lockdown, cycle sales in Ludhiana surged post lockdown so much so that the manufacturers in the country, 90% of these in Ludhiana, produced nearly 10 lakh bicycles by the end of July. The flip side was that due to the rise in demand, leading brands like Hero and Avon in Ludhiana faced shortage of such components, leading to huge waiting time with dealers. Japanese firm Shimano, a major supplier, shifted its unit from China to Singapore, adding to the delay. Atlas Cycles shuts down operations After years of losses that were amplified during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Atlas Cycles, one of country’s oldest bike-maker, shut its operations this year. The company wrapped up its last working unit in Sahibabad (Ghaziabad) on the World Bicycle Day. The iconic cycle company was into manufacturing business since 1951. The Sahibabad unit has the capacity to manufacture more than 4 million cycles per annum with a 1,200-strong workforce. The company has a running dispute pending before the National Company Law Tribunal. As per estimates, Atlas Cycles owes over Rs 120 crore to around 80 vendors in Ludhiana, a number of whom had been its suppliers for several decades. Rising steel prices a cause of concern As prices of steel escalated by as much as Rs 5,000 per tonne since September this year, the industrialists said a section of small and medium scale units are on the verge of collapse as the price hike has made it impossible to meet the confirmed orders. In a letter to PMO, the industrialists expressed fear that they are losing their market to competitors. While those having monopoly over the product, have decided to export as much as possible to get maximum benefits, it is the domestic manufacturers, who are bearing the brunt as not just they are facing scarcity, but the exorbitant rates make it out of reach. The price rise is having a direct impact on steel consuming industries such as bicycle, fastener, auto parts, sewing machines, machine tools, hardware and hand tools. The construction sector is also facing the heat of the price hike as the cost has increased manifolds. Goods trains stop due to farmers’ protest The strike and ‘rail roko’ agitations by farmers in September spelt disaster on exports in Ludhiana at a time when the businessmen were already reeling under losses due to the pandemic. Not only were the shipments delayed, the supply of goods from Ludhiana to the rest of the country was also severely hampered owing to non-movement of trains at the ports. The industry faced a huge deficit of containers due to imbalance in import and exports. The problem became so grave that the godowns used to stock goods were full to capacity in the absence of any movement with production taking a toll. Thousands of containers with export material remained stocked at dry ports in Ludhiana, while an even larger number of containers (around 8,000) with import material were stuck in transit. Officials at dry ports in the financial capital of the state witnessed a steep fall in Exim (export-import) business for the last two months. Dry Ports in Ludhiana’s Dhandari Kalan, Sahnewal, Focal Point and Kila Raipur account for 95% of logistics business in the region. The logistics business itself has shrunk by 50% in the months of October and November till the time the goods trains finally resumed. Big Ben owner passes away due to dengue Angad Ahuja, who was all of 33 and the managing director of Big Ben Group, passed away in October, sending shock waves in the Ludhiana business circuit. He was suffering from dengue.Lockdown, cap on gatherings leaves marriage palace owners, tent dealers high and dryFirstly the lockdown, then the cap on gathering limit took a toll on the wedding industry this year. While the owners of marriage palaces were left high and dry in the absence of government support, different associations of tent dealers also took to the streets against the state government, seeking an extension in gathering limit, in the month of September. The marriage palaces wore a deserted look for almost six months after the imposition of lockdown with residents opting to organise low-key functions in their neighbourhood or gurudwaras. It was in the month of September that the sector heaved a sigh of relief after the gathering limit was extended to 100, however, the imposition of night curfew in the state from December 1 added to the woes of the sector. Traders, gym owners raise hue and cry over restrictions With trade and business hit at large due to imposition of lockdown, traders and gym owners also came at loggerheads with the government on several occasions. While the traders took a stand against the state government over imposition of odd-even rule and weekend lockdown restrictions among other issues, the gymnasium owners moved on roads in the month of June after the union and state government failed to open gyms even when markets were allowed to open. The gyms remained closed for almost five months after imposition of lockdown. Lockdown, night curfew eats into hotel, restaurant businessThe hotels and restaurant business in the industrial hub was hit hard after the imposition of lockdown in the country. The sector was allowed to operate with certain restrictions in the month of June, but it saw a poor response. Imposition of night curfew was another blow for the restaurant business as most of residents prefer to go out to dine in the night hours. The hotel sector also suffered losses after the trains were suspended due to farmers’ agitation as no travelers were visiting the city. A flop show for cinemas After witnessing a shutdown for over seven months, cinema halls in the state opened on November 1, but it failed to attract the visitors as no new movie had released and the fear of Covid infection gripped residents. Even after the management of different multiplexes slashed the ticket prices by around 60%, the cinemas continued to receive tepid response.

28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s weekly Covid-19 positivity rate remains a constant||The weekly Covid-19 positivity rate in the city continues to be 5.3% even though the cases and testing levels have seen a marginal increase. However, the rate is still more than double the national average of 2.3% and puts Chandigarh among the top six states and union territories.The positivity rate in Chandigarh last week had dropped to 5.2% which according to the health department officials was the lowest in the last six months.Positivity rate is the number of persons turning out infected among every 100 tests conducted suggesting the extent of the virus spread among the population being screened.While Sikkim continues to top at 16.6%, it is followed by Kerala (10%), Ladakh (5.7%), Maharashtra (5.6%), Goa (5.4%) and Chandigarh.The positivity rate in the UT is also higher than the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.“The spread of infection is largely under control. Theoretically, we can assume that there is less mobility due to winter seasons. The number of cases has not seen any major jump and the testing levels are also satisfactory with respect to last week. The same scenario is expected to continue,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director, Chandigarh health department.The senior officer said the testing levels, which may have decreased with respect to November, is because less people were coming forward to take the test voluntarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-weekly-covid-19-positivity-rate-remains-a-constant/story-NkQaX8AT5dLMjlmHGikt5H.html

Family members of the suspect alleged they were tortured the entire night in their house, taken to the crime unit in Faridabad the next morning, and even subjected to third-degree abuse. They alleged that the deceased woman, who was the sister of the accused, killed herself due to “humiliation and torture” faced by the family in the hands of the police.Surender Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Rajendra Park police station, said the case was registered on the complaint of the deceased brother. “The family has alleged torture and assault against the police team,” he said, adding that the case was being investigated by the senior officers.Singh said the body of the deceased was handed over to the family members on Sunday after the post-mortem examination and, as per the medical reports, it was a clear case of death due to hanging.Sandeep Singh, brother of the deceased and the complainant in this case said, an FIR into the matter has been registered against the policemen. “On Friday, police personnel came to the house and started inquiring about Shankar. He is wanted in a fraud case and had allegedly helped his close aide to run from the police custody in Gurugram. The policemen physically abused everyone and assaulted the deceased,” he said. On Saturday, the victim died after hanging herself from the ceiling fan of her apartment.Sube Singh, the spokesperson of the Faridabad police, said, “The cybercrime police station team conducted a raid on Friday night at the house of the suspect, who is involved in a cheating case of ₹6 lakh. He also helped his accomplice in escaping from the custody of the Faridabad Police in Gurugram on the same day. A separate case has been registered against him in this matter.” Singh, however, denied that the allegation that the family members of the suspect were tortured.Singh, said “Shankar and a few others have been accused in a case of cyber fraud wherein they used to clone SIM cards of people in the name of porting their phone numbers. They used to empty out their bank accounts later. A case in this regard has been registered at the cyber police station of Faridabad.”Singh said Faridabad police officials are also probing the case and will ensure justice to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/four-officers-of-faridabad-police-booked-on-charges-of-abetment-of-suicide/story-fv1WkYZHpt4iravb6gQ8AJ.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||Kherki Daula toll plaza to experiment with digital payments||The concessionaire of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on Monday said that they will be experimenting with full-fledged digital payment from Tuesday onwards for couple of hours daily on the Kherki Daula toll plaza in the run-up to January 1, when all toll plazas controlled by the National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) will accept only online payments through Fastags. Millennium City Expressway Private Limited(MCEPL), the highway concessionaire, said that around 80 percent commuters already pay online and that they expect the number to hit 96 percent by next month. There are 24 Fastag lanes and two cash lanes at the present at the toll plaza. Suraj Bhardwaj, chief executive officer, MCEPL said that from Tuesday onwards they will be accepting only online payments through Fastags for a couple of hours at Kherki Daula toll plaza as this would serve as an experiment for the digital-only payments from January 1. “There are minor issues which will be resolved but we are fully ready to face the situation. From Tuesday onwards, for a couple of hours, all 26 lanes will accept only digital payments. We have changed RFID readers, installed new ones and have also deployed a large number of hand-held machines to ensure there is no delay in payments,” he said. Bhardwaj, however, said that they are preparing for the digital payments from January 1 onwards and they have been experimenting to ensure that the teething problems are resolved. “The one problem that is expected to hinder the smooth movement of traffic is that the new Smartags, which are currently being issued, have quality issues and despite the presence of new tag readers, there are technical glitches. We will deploy more personnel to resolve the issues,” he said. The NHAI said that with Fastag becoming mandatory from January 1, the authority has updated its mobile application, called My FASTag App, with a new feature which would enable commuters to check their balance status by simply entering the vehicle number. This feature will help Fastag users to verify the tag status of the vehicle during their passage through a toll lane in case the status has not been updated in the toll plaza server due to any technical reason. This new feature will help both the commuter and the toll operator to check the tag balance status on a real-time basis and eliminate the problem of disputed status. “The authority has also reduced the refresh time limit of blacklisted tags from existing 10 minutes to three minutes, to expedite update of the status in the rolling system and show the current status in the app for a seamless passage,” said an NHAI spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/kherki-daula-toll-plaza-to-experiment-with-digital-payments/story-XdeA10Bg3CIFCdB0T8M10N.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||City roads not pedestrian-friendly, finds mobility plan; GMDA sets long-term plan for footpaths||The final draft of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan (CMMP) for the city, released last week, bolsters a longstanding claim by residents and experts — that Gurugram is not a pedestrian-friendly city. As per a study done by the Delhi School of Planning and Architecture, which was tasked with drafting the CMMP, Gurugram has an average walkability index of just 0.68 out of 5, “reflecting an overall poor condition” of relevant infrastructure.This index is calculated based on four parameters — footpath availability, footpath width, kerb height and the overall condition of the footpath. Based on empirical measurements taken on the ground, a normalised score has been assigned to each of Gurugram’s 115 sectors, ranging between 0-5, wherein 0 indicates poor walkability and 5 indicates that the area is highly suitable for walking.Of these, only four sectors — 28, 29, 44 and 45, all in the vicinity of Huda City Centre — were found to be pedestrian-friendly. “The average index for the study area came out to be 0.68, thus reflecting an overall poor condition. The maximum index obtained sector-wise was 4.68 in the new Gurugram area near MG Road, Huda City Centre and Rapid Metro area,” the CMMP states.To remedy the situation, the GMDA, in the mobility plan has proposed to build nearly 800 kilometres of footpaths across Gurugram over the next 20 years, up from the planned 400 kilometres, as per an earlier draft that was criticised by residents over lack of focus on pedestrian infrastructure. From the existing scenario, in which only 14% of the city’s road network (or 153kms) is serviced by footpaths, the GMDA has proposed to increase this to 100% coverage by 2041.The CMMP also found that walkability decreases as one moves away from the city centre. “Upcoming development areas such as the Badshahpur, Narsinghpur, beyond Dwarka Expressway, sew sectors — 34, 36, 37, 53, 61, 49, 50 etc — are completely devoid of footpaths. Most of the locations in the central core area have a footpath, unfortunately, they are either encroached or occupied by vehicles and forcing pedestrians to walk on the carriageway. This leads to a reduction in carriageway capacity. Besides, pedestrians’ walking experience on the carriageway is neither safe nor convenient,” the CMMP states.This is significant in light of another data point in the CMMP, which shows that 33% of all daily trips undertaken by Gurugram’s residents are on foot, more than any other mode of transport. Two-wheelers account for 28% of this modal share, while cars make up 14%, auto rickshaws 13%, public transport 9% and non-motorised transport 3%.Data available with the traffic police also show that pedestrians remain vulnerable, with at least 750 fatalities reported between 2015 and 2019.“Given the high share of walking in the modal split, there is a potential to develop a robust system for non-motorised transport, such as protected bicycle lanes and usable footpaths, which would protect vulnerable road users. The fact that we have neither reveals the inequities inherent in urban planning. We continue to build more roads which don’t serve the larger population at all,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based transport planning and mobility expert.The GMDA’s CMMP takes cognisance of such concerns. “The overall walkability index needs urgent improvement through appropriate targeted interventions...Although a large share of trips is conducted by walk, there are grossly inadequate pedestrian facilities such as footpaths and road crossing facilities making pedestrians vulnerable. The pedestrian infrastructure is deficient not only in quantity but also in quality...The act of walking is fundamental to urban life,” states the CMMP.“Poor quality of pedestrian infrastructure sends a message that pedestrians are not welcome in the urban environment. Fortunately, the street design practice in India is beginning to recognise the integral role of walking in any sustainable transport system. Increasingly, engineers and planners are emphasising the need to design ‘complete streets’ that make walking safe, comfortable, and convenient,” the mobility plan states.As per the GMDA’s plan, about 300 kilometres of footpaths are expected to be created by 2031, while an existing 65 kilometres will be revamped to meet the stipulations of the Indian Road Congress’ (IRC) First Revision of the Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities.GMDA officials could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-roads-not-pedestrian-friendly-finds-mobility-plan-gmda-sets-long-term-plan-for-footpaths/story-VsYtx3rc6vUFxYuoxqdY8H.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||Pandemic played havoc on academics this year||Months of lockdown and subsequent measures to curtail to spread of Covid-19 restrictions has derailed the academic sessions of schools and colleges this year. While private institutions quickly moved to the online platform, the digital divide proved to be a big hurdle for students in many government schools and colleges, who could not access remote lessons.While students who started college expressed unhappiness over diving into virtual classes without the atmosphere of the campus, those graduating lamented the job crisis brought about by the pandemic. At the kindergarten level, parents put off admissions, while many have opted for homeschooling.Since the lockdown on March 25 to contain the coronavirus pandemic, schools across the country have remained shut for most of the year. Although online classes and television programmes were tailored for students of government schools, many were deprived of learning due to issues ranging from affordability to accessibility.Rinki Sharma, a 17-year-old class 12 government school student, attended online classes via WhatsApp till September but struggled to keep pace with her classmates, as there was only one smartphone in the house. “I get the chance to study once my mother returns from work in the evening. Over the phone, there are many delays, and comprehension is not effective. I visit the school as and when required and find physical sessions more fruitful for understanding. However, safety continues to be a concern,” said Sharma.Even in private schools, which were relatively better placed when it came to online classes, students missed the atmosphere of the school campus. Aditi Mishra, the principal of Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that while online classes were taking place smoothly, students missed physical classroom sessions and other amenities that the school campus offered. “Things will not be normal till the time children get back to school, meet their friends and can play and dance as they did earlier. We have done the best we could do online by providing every kind of experience through intraschool and intrahouse competitions and events, but there’s nothing that can replicate the human touch,” said Mishra. She said that doubt-clearing sessions that took place with physical distancing had shown that students were missing the personal connection with teachers and classmates. “We had to keep children apart from each other during the small doubt-clearing sessions that we organised. The first instinct of children is to hug each other, but in changed circumstances, they are discouraged from doing so. The sense of normalcy is certainly missing this year,” said Mishra. Deputy district education officer Kalpna Singh said that Covid-19 had a devastating impact on academics in government schools. She said that while physical classroom sessions for students in senior classes had begun, students in classes 1 to 8 would not get to a chance to visit schools this year.“Coronavirus has greatly impacted education in the country. It will take a lot of time for the situation to improve. Primary and middle grades are yet to start physical classroom sessions. They did not have any in-person interaction with their teachers or classmates with the pandemic causing the closure of schools,” said Singh.Singh said that the absence of smartphones was a grave issue across the board, but the percentage of such students was greater in primary and middle classes. “Most children in classes 9 to 12 have managed smartphones now, but children in classes 1 to 8 are facing many difficulties in the absence of phones. In these grades, many students do not have android phones. These students are being deprived of lessons and one cannot ascertain if they are able to share resources or catch up on lessons with the help of their classmates,” said Singh.Suman Sharma, the principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that while teachers had put in a lot of effort in managing online and offline classes, students had reached a certain level of saturation with online classes. “While we are conducting the lessons and making preparations from our end, there is no way to understand how much students are grasping. With the year coming to an end, we have noticed that students are losing interest. Some of them are not as active as they were during the earlier months of the lockdown,” said Sharma.College principals said that due to the pandemic, classroom and campus life are bound to be affected. Besides classrooms, canteens and students’ hostels have changed view of social distancing concerns. “Due to restrictions and distancing needs, it could not be business as usual this year. The majority of our students are taking online classes. The safety of students continues to be our priority as we continue with classes both on and off campus,” said Dr Satyamanyu Yadav, the principal of Government College in Sector 9. Yadav said that a personal connection was missing due to lack of interaction besides academics. “Due to the curtailment of extracurricular activities and the online-offline nature of classes, a personal connection between students and teachers is missing. Students tell us that they are feeling deprived of the campus experience. They think that they have lost a year,” said Yadav.Educationists insist that while the lack of internet access had been a limiting factor, learning had to continue amid the pandemic while taking cognisance of the fact that the year was unprecedented in multiple ways. “Right now, private schools are having seamless online classes whereas children in the rural areas are being left behind. The lack of internet access has been a limiting factor. However, one has to recognise that this has been an unprecedented year and learning has to continue. Schools can share resources with parents to ensure that learning continues in some manner,” said educationist Gowri Ishwaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pandemic-played-havoc-on-academics-this-year/story-husIpn1KCJSagqQiAulqsK.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||Cops link 10 murders to Binder Gujjar||The Special Task Force (STF) of the Haryana Police on Sunday linked more than 10 murder cases over the last decade to gangster Virender, alias Binder Gujjar, who was brought to the city on a production warrant from Mumbai’s Taloja jail in the last fortnight. According to an official, the special team, taking action as per the directions of senior officers, arrested Gujjar on a production warrant for the murder of Ashok Kumar (25) in Gurugram, an incident that dates back to 2015. Gujjar is incarcerated in the Mumbai jail for the murder of gangster Sandeep Gadoli. The police said that Gujjar has confessed to the murder of Ashok Kumar, who was his driver then, when Gujjar was a city councillor. Kumar was found shot dead on Basai Road by unknown persons while he was returning home. He was a resident of Arjun Nagar and was Gujjar’s driver and his gunman, said police. Kumar was also a criminal and had been involved in over a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, robbery and other crimes. “During the eight-day remand, Gujjar disclosed that he had shot dead Kumar and then hatched a conspiracy against his rival gangster Sandeep Gadoli by falsely implicating him as Kumar’s brother. Gujjar was sent to judicial custody on Saturday,” said Varun Dahiya, inspector, special task force. Gujjar had allegedly got one Raju Sethi killed in Sector 5 in 2015 through contract killers, including Kallu, a wanted man against whom 17 cases are registered across police stations in the city. Kallu is alleged to have committed murders and robberies on the directions of Gujjar. The Gurugram police had arrested Gujjar on October 18, 2019, as a pre-emptive measure to ensure that the general elections are not disturbed. The police said that they had received several complaints against him, alleging he was trying to influence people to vote for candidates he was supporting. The police said that Gujjar’s involvement in leading the police to Gadoli was allegedly established during the investigation, when it was found that he was allegedly constantly in touch with Gadoli’s live-in partner and had tipped off the police about his location. The family of Gadoli also alleged that he never used a mobile phone while on the run, but never objected to his partner using one. A team of the Gurugam police had gunned down Gadoli at a Mumbai hotel on February 7, 2016. Later, a case of fake encounter was filed and eight people, including four policemen, were arrested by the Mumbai Police. The family had named 11 persons in the FIR after the Supreme Court ordered a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to file an FIR based on their complaint. “Gujjar had paid a huge amount to the city police to kill my brother. My brother’s live-in partner was in touch with Gujjar. She kept sharing his location with Gujjar, following which the police reached the hotel. She was with my brother when he was killed in Mumbai,” Kavita, Gadoli’s sister, alleged.Officials of the Gurugram police arrested in connection with the encounter continue to remain in a Mumbai jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-link-10-murders-to-binder-gujjar/story-pcT9DfqXPpFElJR74xfEXJ.html

28-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG chief gets additional charge, to head Manesar civic body as well||The commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Vinay Pratap Singh, has been given the additional charge of the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) by the Haryana government on Monday. Singh, a 2011 batch IAS officer, will be the first commissioner of the MCM, following recent approvals from the government for setting up the body.On December 24, the Haryana government cabinet had approved the proposal for the formation of MCM.“Similar to Gurugram branching out of Delhi, Manesar too has branched out of Gurugram and has its own identity. The formation of a civic body will help expedite development projects in the area and fast-track Manesar in becoming one of the key cities all over Haryana,” said Singh.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, a large number of MCG officials will likely be given dual charges, in both MCG and MCM, during the initial stages. Only after a period of two to three years would they be slowly phased out, they said.The MCM has 28 villages falling under its jurisdiction, over an area of 125 square kilometres. In a nutshell, areas falling within sectors 77 to 93 will come under the ambit of MCM, along with a few areas located near the Kundli Manesar Palwal (KMP) Expressway.Stormwater and sewerage drains in the area, which are currently being looked after by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), will now be transferred to the MCM. Besides these, civic amenities such as roads, streetlights, parks, green belts, water lines and garbage will now be looked after by the municipal body. Earlier, the gram panchayats were looking after these services.The panchayat system will also be abolished in Manesar area with the formation of MCM. Around 500,000 people are expected to benefit from its formation.On November 12, during a virtual inauguration of multiple developmental projects for Gurugram district, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that Manesar will soon have its own civic body. During a meeting last Wednesday’s, the Haryana cabinet also gave a nod for 16 villages to come under the ambit of MCG, extending its jurisdiction as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-chief-gets-additional-charge-to-head-manesar-civic-body-as-well/story-vrzerKxtliC9LhpoWNw3CJ.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG declares Sector 23 market polythene-free||The Sector 23 market, near Palam Vihar, was declared as the city’s first polythene free market by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). The MCG stated this is in an official release on Monday. The Sector 23 market has more than 120 shops and 70 street vendors. Starting this month, all the shopkeepers and vendor owners were sensitised about the problems associated with the use of polythene bags and subsequently, around 10,000 cloth bags were purchased by shopkeepers in the area from the MCG’s cloth bag bank. Depending on the size of the bag, shopkeepers procured cloth bags from the MCG at prices ranging from ₹3 to ₹20. Although, MCG in its official release termed the market as polythene-free, officials privy to the matter said that currently around 60% of shopkeepers have made the complete switch from polythene to cloth bags while the remaining are under process for making the switch-over. The market used around 40 kilograms of polythene every day. Madhu Azad, mayor of Gurugram, called upon the citizens to motivate people to cleanliness. “Initiatives such as polythene-free markets will help Gurugram rise to the number one position in the country in future Swachh Survekshan surveys. Such initiatives cannot be achieved only on the strength of government or the municipal corporation or even technology, but needs active participation by the citizens as well,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG. Brahma Yadav, head of the Sector 23 market association, said that all the shopkeepers are committed towards making this market the first polythene-free market in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-declares-sector-23-market-polythene-free/story-b3QLvHrNvfsK56TpFQb68I.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||Haryana approves plan to construct museum at pre-Harappan site in Fatehabad||The state government has approved plans for the construction of a museum and interpretation centre at a pre-Harappan site in Kunal village of Fatehabad district. Officials said that work on the project would be initiated next year after the completion of all administrative approvals. Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of Department of Archaeology and Museums, said that the museum would help visitors gain more insights about Kunal’s history. “We will be setting up a site museum and interpretation centre at Kunal. The museum will give visitors insights about Kunal, the history, timeline of various excavations over the past years and the findings. The museum will have three galleries, along with open-air sitting arrangements and other visitor facilities,” said Bhattacharyya. Kunal is one of the oldest pre-Harappan settlements and dates back roughly to the 5th millennium BCE (before the Common Era). The roughly 6,000-year-old site holds within it a rich legacy. Excavations at the site first started in 1986. Excavations have taken place in at least six times between 1992 and 2003. The seventh round of excavations in Kunal took place last year. Excavations over the years have shown that Kunal was a rural village centre. Pottery or Hakraware sourced from Kunal gives evidence of the craftsmanship of the people of the settlement. People who lived here were great artisans, as demonstrated by the cultural material discovered, and are identified as Hakraware people, say experts. The core surviving area of the site is, at present, spread over five acres and is being protected by the state. Bhattacharyya said that the conceptual design of the proposed on-site museum had been approved by the chief minister and the Public Works Department(PWD). The latter will be responsible for the construction of the museum. “The conceptual design of the museum has been approved by the chief minister. The architecture department is working on the drawing. Once it’s ready, we will start work. PWD will be responsible for the construction. It will take us two to three months for us to process the administrative paperwork after which we can start work,” said Bhattacharyya. She added that the museum would be a good addition at the site since Kunal had become quite popular in the past few years. Officials said that while the final cost estimate is yet to be finalised, the department estimates that nearly ₹2 crore might be needed for the project. “The administrative approval of the financial costs is pending final approval,” said Bhattacharyya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-approves-plan-to-construct-museum-at-pre-harappan-site-in-fatehabad/story-96rk9koDjMerNJVcStzUDL.html

Based on the list shared by the Haryana administration, the number of UK returnees who need be traced and tested to identify the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased to 714 from 695.Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, said, “Few more names have been added to the list of travellers who are to be tested. Till now, 367 have been tested have been tested — about 315 by the health department and 52 by private labs. Out of these,319 were negative for the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).” Test results of at least 150 are pending.According to Sharma, until Monday, at least 38 UK returnees were untraceable due to incorrect addresses and mobile numbers, and over 159 people have moved back to different countries, states or districts. “The list of travellers who have moved back has been shared with the state administration, while the list of untraceable travellers has been shared with the commissioner of police, Gurugram. Earlier some people refused to get themselves tested but they too have given their samples now,” said Sharma, mentioning that action can be taken against people who refuse to get tested. Earlier this week, chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav stated that action can be taken under Section 188 of IPC for not complying with government rules.Senior police officials confirmed to have received a list of untraceable travellers from the health department and have initiated working on it. Private labs, on the other hand, have been told to collect additional sample while testing a UK returnee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/319-uk-returnees-test-negative-for-covid-19/story-Fqzf2Q9OoojFheXbaD4R4N.html
28-12-2020||Gurugram||Health department finalises 181 sites for first phase of Covid-19 vaccination||The district health department has finalised at least 181 session sites for Covid-19 vaccination. Of these, more than 60 percent sites are government and private schools, where the first phase of the vaccination will be conducted, once the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus is rolled out. Of the 181 identified sites, at least 93 are government schools, 17 private schools, 31 community centres, 21 private hospitals and eight government facilities. It also includes 11 other sites, such as marriage halls and residential societies.“Every vaccination site has to be a spacious area, with at least three rooms — one each for waiting, vaccination and observation — to conduct the entire procedure smoothly,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “These 181 sites, which have been finalised, have well-ventilated rooms with separate entry and exit points, while having enough space to maintain social distancing,” he said.Going by the Covid-19 vaccination guidelines, Singh said that waiting areas need to have adequate seating arrangement to ensure physical distancing. This is because only one person can enter the vaccination room at a time. There has to be a hand-washing or sanitising facility at the entrance to avoid transmission of virus. “Likewise, after the vaccination, the beneficiary will have to wait for 30 minutes in the observation room, for which enough space is required,” said Singh.According to him, health facilities have been chosen as fixed vaccination sites, whereas community centres, schools, halls have been selected as outreach sites. Based on the priority population identified for Covid-19 vaccination, fixed session sites, such as government health facilities and private hospitals will be used for healthcare workers. For front-line workers and people above 50 years, the vaccination will be administered at outreach session sites like schools, community centres, besides the health facilities. Since only pre-registered beneficaries will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccination, there will no on-the-spot registration at the vaccination sites, said Singh. Every site will have a team of five vaccination officers, including the vaccinator to administer the vaccine. The vaccination sites will also be linked with nearby the AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) centres in case the beneficiary reports of any negative reactions within 30 minutes of inoculation.The department has also spotted and finalised upon at least 57 AEFI centres. It includes 19 urban primary health centres, three community health centres, 11 primary health centres in rural areas, Civil Hospital in Sector 10, polyclinic in Sector 31. Besides, over 21 private hospitals have already been designated as AEFI centres.Singh that in addition to health facilities, ambulances will be stationed near those vaccination sites that might be far from AEFI centres. Earlier this week, the health department held a meeting with the members of the AEFI committee on the Covid-19 vaccination plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-finalises-181-sites-for-first-phase-of-covid-19-vaccination/story-DlpNLSWHmwxxCI4x1J5k0L.html

28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Property tax evasion: Banks on Ludhiana MC’s radar, rent deeds being scrutinised||The municipal corporation (MC) has started scrutinising rent deeds of all banks in the city after the owners of two properties rented out to banks were caught for tax evasion.A penalty of Rs 8 lakh was imposed on the violators and a 100% penalty on the amount evaded was also imposed.Officials said that managements of banks or property owners have to pay 7.5% of the annual rent as property tax. But, it is suspected that a large numbers of them are evading tax by quoting lesser annual rent received. The civic body officials said there are over 500 banks in the city which are renting properties. The property tax returns and rent deeds are being scrutinised to find any anomalies in the tax paid and amount due. MC has already received copies of around 400 deeds. Superintendent of property tax, Vivek Verma, said,”As per directions issued by the higher authorities, the rent deeds and property tax returns are being scrutinised. A 100% penalty on evaded amount will be imposed on violators. If the owners or bank managements have failed to pay the tax, a 20% penalty and 18% interest per annum will be recovered along with the pending amount.” Pay property tax by Dec 31 or face penaltyMC officials said December 31 is the last date to pay property tax for the year 2020-21 without facing any penalty. There are around 2.7 lakh properties in the city and over 1 lakh owners are yet to file the tax return. If the owners fail to pay by the end of the month, a penalty of 10% will be imposed. The officials said that this year, a large number of residents have not submitted the tax due to financial crisis amid the pandemic. The managements of some malls have also not paid the tax because of which MC has not been able to meet the recovery targets this year. “MC is sending text messages to residents and also calling them to ask them submit pending tax to avoid a penalty. Reminder notices have also been served.

He said that Union minister Rajnath Singh had said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and PM Narendra Modi share an emotional connection with the people of the state, which is completely false. “Narendra Modi-led central government has zero contribution to the development of Himachal. Playing with the emotions has been the nature of BJP and Modi and now people have also started to acknowledge this,” he added.Rathore said that wherever Modi goes, he tries to adapt to the same color, and plays with the emotions, sentiments of the people.

28-12-2020||Pune||After missing five deadlines, Satara road BRTS to open from Jan 1||After four years and five deadlines, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will finally reopen the bus rapid transit corridor (BRTS) between Katraj and Swargate on Satara road from January 1. The announcement came on Monday after municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap and mayor Murlidhar Mohol inspected the stretch and asked the administration to clear it for public transport from January 1. “Most of the BRTS work has already been completed on this corridor and we are starting operations from January 1. The work on this stretch got delayed even as the tenders for BRTS work were floated in 2016. Due to technical reasons, PMC did the re-tendering process in 2018. However, due to two flyover works located at Swargate and Shankarmaharaj math, the BRTS work got delayed,” said Mohol. The BRTS corridor was India’s first pilot BRTS, originally started in 2007, though it had to be stopped for traffic due to several issues including bus stops and alignment of stretch. Due to several errors, the corridor became an accident spot and many citizens lost their lives. In the last two years, PMC had set four deadlines for restarting the BRTS operations, but was not able to kick start the project. The PMC has spent more than Rs 100 crore for revamping the corridor, which is around 5.5km long. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has demanded inquiry of BRTS work in the city. NCP Parvati assembly constituency president Nitin Kadam said, “PMC has spent almost Rs100 crore for repairing this corridor. The work got delayed for four years we are demanding the civic body to start operations immediately or demolish the BRTS corridor.” Deadlines missed May 31, 2018 August 1, 2018 December 2018 March 2019 May 2020||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-missing-five-deadlines-satara-road-brts-to-open-from-jan-1/story-5Y3ixugHhDei9SamxSy5aO.html

If you don’t eat, leave it, I’m not going to force you.I eat because I like, who are you to ask? Do you need courage to say this?” Siddaramaiah said.Speaking at the Congress foundation day event, he said, many of his party colleagues hesitate about talking or taking a stand on issues fearing consequences or backlash.“...our people stay quiet creating a feeling that what others are saying is right.You should come out of such confusions, please,” Siddaramaiah said, while referring to the anti-cow slaughter bill. Where will the farmer send aged cattle like cows, buffaloes, he said, pointing out that taking care of a cow or a buffalo costs about Rs 100 per day.”“Who will give that money? Farmers too worship cows,” he added.Interestingly Siddarmaiah’s statement comes on a day when the state cabinet decided to promulgate an ordinance to give effect to the contentious anti-cow slaughter bill that is yet to be approved by the legislative council.Once it comes into effect, there will be a blanket prohibition of slaughter of cows in the state.However, the slaughter houses will continue to function and beef consumption will not be prohibited with respect to buffalo meat.Siddaramaiah, Leader of opposition in the state assembly, had recently expressed regret for his purported remarks that Kodavas eat beef, for which he came under attack, saying he has a lot of respect for Kodava people and their culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/food-habit-my-right-says-former-karnataka-cm-over-anti-cow-slaughter-bill/story-npAyUx0CAqHBaUtgZ4qIOP.html

Commercial activities are permissible only in buildings with commercial use,” said Junaid Azim Mattu, SMC mayor. A sealing drive will be kicked off soon, he said.Srinagar and its adjoining areas have witnessed a construction boom in the last two decades, especially shops and malls that have come up in residential areas and many people have converted their residential properties into commercial buildings without seeking proper permission from the concerned authorities.Sources said that the government has already identified many such buildings or houses which are being used for commercial purposes.“Earlier also warnings were given to people and at some places, the action was taken against the violators, but it proved short-lived,” said Javeed Iqbal, a resident of Rajbagh where dozens of houses have been turned into commercial places.At Umerabad and Shalteng localities on the city outskirts, houses and plots meant for residential purposes have been converted into commercial properties.“During the lockdown, several shops were constructed in our lane and the authorities didn’t take any action. How can shops be constructed in a residential colony? We even approached the authorities and brought it to their notice but to no avail,” said Tariq Ahmad, a resident of Umerabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srinagar-mc-to-seal-residential-premises-being-used-for-commercial-purposes/story-Mw9VvQHBk2v4vAbHRdwa3L.html
28-12-2020||Pune||Property registrations up as compared to last year, but revenue drops||Maharashtra government’s decision to reduce stamp duty from six per cent to three per cent till the year-end has provided a much-needed boost to the realty sector between September and December in Pune and rest of Maharashtra, with property registration numbers rising. However, it has not helped government coffers as the revenue generation from stamp duty in the year has reduced as compared to last year even when property registration during the four months in 2020 has gone up as against 2019.According to the statistics shared by the Inspector General of Registration’s (IGR) office, between September and December this year, 11,94,013 document registrations were reported with a revenue of Rs 11,702 crore since January till December 27. This was against 8,44,963 document registrations bringing Rs 28,989 crore to the government exchequer in the same period last year. Omprakash Deshmukh, IGR, said, “After announcing the discount, the property registration increased substantially. It shows that buying and selling sentiment has increased in the realty sector.”Another official from the IGR office, aware of the developments, said, “Though the number of property registration increased as compared to previous year (2019), this year, the department received less revenue. Last year, Rs 28,989 crore revenue was generated through stamp duty which is only around 12,000 crore this year.”According to realty experts, the dip in revenue is mostly because for a major part of the year from March to August there was reduced sale of document registration while when the registrations witnessed a surge, most of them were low-cost housing. Advocate Vijay Pawar, said, “As the government announced a three per cent cut in stamp duty, many people got their property and registration done early. In Pune, an average flat’s price is between Rs40 lakh and Rs50 lakh. Citizens are getting huge discount and it has helped increase the property registration since September. Even banks and builders promoted the reduction in stamp duty. As citizens were getting direct benefit of the government’s move, the number of registrations increased in Pune.” The state government in August had announced reduction of stamp duty levied on sales of apartments from 5 per cent to 2 per cent from September 1 for four months and to 3 per cent from January 1 to March 31, 2021. As the reduction on stamp duty has led to rise in purchase of properties by people, boosting the realty sector, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), Pune, has demanded an extension of the current incentive till June 2021.Credai (Pune) president Suhas Merchant, said, “We wrote a letter to the revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and sought an extension for the scheme. It has boosted the realty sector during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the government received less revenue, the government will achieve various goals by giving this discount. It is helping boost employment too. Even property tax is likely to go up. We are appealing to the government to give an extension till June 2021.”Because of the lockdown, property registration had dipped between March and August though it picked up during the festive period when government offered sops. Satish Magar, Credai India’s national president, said, “This decision about stamp duty has really helped boost the realty sector. It is helping provide a much-needed boost to the economy. The benefit of this scheme is directly for the buyers.”Stamp duty registrationMonth/ 2019/2020January/2,35,066/2,12,354February/ 2,71,180/2,69,508March/3,14,372/2,14,195April/2,28,848/1139May/2,66223/42573June/3,20,183/1,53,155July/2,58,632/1,65,139August/2,21176/1,83,515September/1,90,841/2,47,609October/1,93995/2,47,601November/2,20,808/2,74,773December/2,39,292/3,97,396||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/property-registrations-up-as-compared-to-last-year-but-revenue-drops/story-7nVBeDs069n93oa7n8OnRI.html

28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest: Protestors damage over 1,500 telecom towers in Punjab||More than 1,500 telecom towers in Punjab have been damaged by farmers protesting against the three farm laws, disrupting services in some pockets, sources said.Power supply to towers that relay telecom signals was snapped and cables cut in several parts of the state as farmers vented their anger on the infrastructure owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s firm Jio as they saw him along with infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani as major beneficiaries of the new laws.Neither Ambani’s Reliance group nor Adani’s companies are into the business of procuring foodgrains from farmers.“Till yesterday, 1,411 towers were damaged and today the count has gone well past 1,500,” a source with knowledge of the matter said.In Jalandhar, some bundles of Jio’s fibre cable were also burnt.Jio has 9,000 plus towers in the state.Another source said the most common way of damaging the telecom towers was to cut off the power supply.In at least one case, the generator at a tower site was physically taken away and allegedly donated to a local gurudwara.Videos of Jio employees being threatened and made to flee have gone viral.The attacks have impacted telecom services and operators are struggling to maintain services in absence of action by law enforcement agencies, the source said.The Punjab chief minister had on Friday appealed to protesting farmers to not cause inconvenience to the general public with such actions and continue to exercise the same restraint as they had shown over the past several months of their agitation.Sources said state police have so far not acted against those damaging telecom towers and even FIRs have not been registered in most cases.According to the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), a registered body of telecom infrastructure providers, at least 1,600 towers have been vandalised.These include common access infrastructure as well.Hundreds of farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders for over a month now against the three farm laws which they see would user in end to minimum support price (MSP) based procurement of farm produce like wheat and paddy.The government has denied the apprehensions, saying MSP will continue and the new laws only provide farmers an alternative market to sell their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/over-1-500-telecom-towers-damaged-in-punjab/story-BkbcSi20e36ldMJKwXCTXN.html

Postmaster general VK Varma admitted the lapse on the part of a clerk.“We are investigating in-house how did this happen and why the said clerk could not identify the gangsters,” he said.Left red-faced, the postal department said its employees would be extra careful and vet the information more stringently from now on.Around twelve stamps each of Rajan and Bajrangi were accidentally printed under the ‘My Stamp’ scheme, which was launched by the department in 2017. Under this scheme, anyone paying Rs 300 can get stamps with their photos or that of their family members printed and released.“The stamps are like any other stamp and could be put on envelopes,” said postal department officials. The scheme is quite popular and people have been gifting these stamps to their family members and friends.Also read: Centre calls farmers for meeting over farm laws on December 30 in DelhiThe process is now being made more comprehensive, Varma said. Now on, the clerks would vet the documents more carefully and would not make the stamps if the person was not physically present before the webcam, he added.“As of now, only an identity card was enough; now we will ask for more details and ensure the person is present in the room,” Varma said.In this case, someone gave the pictures claiming Rajan and Bajrangi were his relatives. Without asking for their identification papers, which is essential, the clerk released 12 stamps each with their pictures.The form that was filled before the stamps were given had names ‘Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi’ and ‘Rajendra Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan’.Rajan is currently in a Mumbai jail and Bajrangi was murdered in Baghpat jail of western Uttar Pradesh on July 9, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kanpur-postal-dept-accidentally-releases-stamps-featuring-gangsters-chhota-rajan-bajrangi/story-7JgsX2vxNXwPNZhFuRgieO.html

CBI advocate Bharat Bhushan Sharma said, “The final charge sheet will be filed on December 30 in the case of the fraud committed by a private medical college of Bhopal by giving admission to undeserving candidates in PMT 2011.” “The case was registered in 2013 by a special task force (STF) of the state government against three medical students only. After the Supreme Court order, the CBI took over the case in July 2015. After investigating the case for five years, CBI accused 57 other people too. They included 39 medical students, 11 officials of the management of the private medical college, which is one of the main Covid-19 dedicated hospitals in Bhopal, then director of medical education (DME), then joint director of medical education and five others,” said an investigating officer, requesting anonymity.Also Read: CBI cast a wide net, scrutinised 16 lakh people to nab Vyapam scam accusedCBI also sought sanction from the department of medical education to prosecute then DME and joint DME, said the officer. According to the complaint of the Vyapam scam whistle blower, Ashish Chaturvedi, lodged with the Special Task Force in Gwalior in 2013, a few medical students of second, third and final year of MBBS had appeared in the Pre-Medical Test (PMT) 2011 and topped the exam. They had locked the government quota seats and later vacated them for undeserving students. “In the investigation, it was found that private medical college had paid students studying in medical colleges in MP and others states to appear in PMT 2011 and to lock the seats during the first round of counselling. The medical students had vacated the seats after counselling. Later, the private medical college had admitted undeserving students to the seats after taking donations. Then DME and joint DME also acted against the rules,” said the officer. Of the 154 cases being probed by CBI under the Vyapam scam, this is the last case in which investigation had been pending for the past five years. “Now, CBI is left with eight cases in which supplementary charge sheets will be filed,” said the officer. In all, 3,500 people were accused by the CBI in different cases.The Vyapam scam came to light in July 2013 when Indore Police arrested 20 impersonators who appeared for the medical entrance examination to help undeserving candidates secure high ranks. The cheating net also involved a clique of politicians and bureaucrats that facilitated the fraud in exchange for bribes, according to investigators. The CBI took over the case in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/vyapam-scam-cbi-summons-60-accused-before-special-court/story-vPeii304d7YGesY3hOjAdO.html

From 61 donations in 2018 and 63 in 2019, the number has come down to 39 organ donations this year. The total number of transplants done in 2020, till December 24 stood at 79, even as experts note that there is more awareness among families now in case a family member is declared brain dead, even as experts note that there is more awareness among families now in case a family member is declared brain dead. Dr Sheetal Dhadphale, secretary, Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) Pune, said that organ donation and transplants were stopped initially, as Covid cases were increasing, but later, it was resumed.“Our team of doctors and social workers are working day and night to save more lives. We take all precautions and the process of organ retrieval as well as donation is completely safe. Though the number is less this time, it is more as compared to other regions,” said Dhadphale. ZTCC Pune division includes Pune, Nashik, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur, Dhule and Jalgaon. Arti Gokhale from ZTCC Pune said that all the awareness initiatives are now online. “We have left no stone unturned. There are families who are willing but because of Covid, things stopped. Now that everything is getting back on track there is a need for more offline awareness among families,” said Gokhale.Talking about brain dead patients, Dr Sanjeev Jadhav, Heart and Lung Transplant Surgeon in Mumbai at Apollo Hospitals, said, “We get a lot of young patients who are declared brain dead post road accidents. Due to the lockdown this number has significantly reduced. Because of this, the waiting list for heart and lung transplants has increased.” He said that the precautions during retrieving of organs are paramount.“We test the organ donor and the patient for Covid, only then we go ahead with the procedure. These are challenging times, but we are doing our best,” said Jadhav.Dr Bipin Vibhute, head of Liver and Multi-organ Transplant department at Sahyadri Hospitals, said that earlier there was some fear because of Covid. “But now, many patients are coming to us for transplants. Most of the transplants that we did were from ‘live’ donors. This is a living person donating a part of their liver to another person.

28-12-2020||Pune||Vida Heydari: Contemporary art’s new address in the city drawing in top talent||When you enter Koregaon Park’s recently launched contemporary art space, Vida Heydari Contemporary (VHC), you are transported to a sprawling 3,000 sq ft venue marked by green environs, warm lights and high ceilings. Vida Heydari, the founder of VHC is an Iranian-Canadian curator and gallerist who has worked with Indian, Iranian and Chinese contemporary artists, private collectors and international galleries for about a decade-and-a-half. Last week, her concept art gallery VHC opened doors to city’s art enthusiasts with the inaugural show, Origins of a Perennial Bouquet. The show, which will continue till February 14, has been curated by Bose Krishnamachari, founder of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Krishnamachari is an artist known for his bold abstract paintings, multimedia installations and figurative drawings.The show displays the works of five of India’s contemporary artists - Benitha Perciyal, Manish Nai, Sudarshan Shetty, Sumedh Rajendran and Tanya Goel. Heydari, while elaborating on the connection between Pune and the role VHC will play in its cultural fabric, says, “My time in the city has shown me that there’s an abundance of artists and art lovers. I want VHC to be a space for creative minds of the city to come together, get inspired and facilitate dialogue in the realm of art.”Upon entering, guests experience an effect that is grand yet simple, with subdued colours used on the walls, and greenery all around. The gallery has many alcoves and spaces for art displays. The space uses the natural curvature of frontage and beams to its advantage, and the matte grey flooring works as a dramatic setting for the artworks. Speaking about the debut art show, Krishnamachari says, “It is important to understand that in the field of art, there should be consistency in terms of knowledge sharing. That is why the title of the exhibition highlights the idea of being perennial. Another remarkable feature of VHC is that it does not display art in isolation; it offers a great fusion with a restaurant, green spaces, and scope for conversations.”VHC also has an attached restaurant, which serves European fare, and the menu for which has been curated by chef Ajay Chopra.Artwork 1:The artwork ‘The mysterious visitor’ has been created by Benitha Perciyal, who hails from Thiruvanamalai. Her practice encapsulates the use of primarily organic materials, with a strong focus on those that induce olfactory experiences like myrrh, cinnamon, frankincense and more. Her sculptures are solely made of organic compounds that slow down the process of creation, while enabling a certain perpetuity to their ‘becoming’.Artwork 2:Tanya Goel, who has completed her post-graduation in fine arts from Yale University, is the driving force behind this piece of art, titled ‘Tracing modernity in dust and light.’ The artwork has been created using cement mixed with debris collected from the central public works department, New Delhi. With a focus on textured pigments, Goel utilises a diverse array of materials from urban climes (aluminium, concrete, glass, soil, mica, graphite and foils) in order to accentuate the equally versatile effect of light on them.Artwork 3:Mumbai’s Sudarshan Shetty has reused teak wood to create this artwork ‘For all that we gather’. Shetty was initially trained as a painter, but his exposure to the work of his contemporaries at the National School of Design helped him explore the intersections of sculpture, design and architecture. His installations are developed around a rigorous selection of materials and juxtapositions of things that are culturally distinct. The artist turned curator for the third edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, 2016.Artwork 4:Manish Nai’s untitled artwork uses a flyscreen, water colour and wood. Nai has always been fascinated with minimalism. Materials, such as jute and newspapers, are reborn in his work, and he transforms functionality into art.Artwork 5:Sumedh Rajendran’s ‘sky stalkers’ makes use of charcoal on paper. With the usage of industrialised materials like ceramic tiles, leather, tin sheets, cans, rubber, cement, concrete, and steel, Rajendran dissolves notions of boundaries between entities. His work is known for providing a fresh perspective to sculpture and for re-contextualising its relevance to the world of contemporary Indian art.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/vida-heydari-contemporary-art-s-new-address-in-the-city-drawing-in-top-talent/story-o7K5mIbuJGcOEpfE0neRRN.html
28-12-2020||Pune||Residents in 23 villages rush to gram panchayats for property registrations||After the state government issued a notification to merge 23 villages into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), local residents are rushing to record their yet to be authorised properties in the land register (8A Extract) of Gram panchayat office to get it a legal status. With the rush pouring in, Wagholi– one of the 23 villages being merged - has started a token system to enrol property details in the land register. On December 24, the state government issued an official notification about the merger of 23 areas (referred as villages in government records) in the PMC limit. The state has given one month’s period to register suggestions and objections on the government decision of merger. Division Commissioner (Revenue), Pune division will take record objections and submit a report to the state government’s urban development department, after that, the state will take a final decision on the merger and issue a final notification. After this notification, residents have begun visiting the gram panchayat offices in their villages to register their properties. All gram panchayat offices are busy in the registration work. Wagholi is one of the areas of upcoming 23 merge villages and it is a highly urbanized part, around 1,000 people per day visit gram panchayat for registration. Vasundhara Ubale, sarpanch of Wagholi village said, “After notification of the state government, residents are approaching the gram panchayat office to register their properties in 8 (a) extract record. Due to the heavy rush, we have started a token system. There is too much pressure on us.” Many of these 23 areas, which until now came under PMRDA, also face the problem of unauthorised structures. In 2018, the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) identified 16,938 unauthorised constructions in its area with most falling in these villages. While the PMRDA served notices to those responsible for unauthorised constructions, not much happened. According to Nitin Dhavade, sarpanch of Kondve-Dhavade residents are rushing to gram panchayat office to record their property. There is illegal construction in villages. “Of the total 2,700 acres of village land, around 2,500-acre land has been given to the National Defence Academy (NDA). Therefore, land is limited. People have constructed unauthorized construction and they have-not mentioned new construction in gram panchayat. Now, they are hurrying to register their properties in the land record. Population density is more in our area due to limited land,” said Dhavale. Khadakwasla sarpanch Saurabh Mate said, “After the state government notification, people have started the process of registering properties in gram panchayat. Earlier, they were not serious. Residents were happy to pay a single tax on old households to the gram panchayat. After the merger process started, they suddenly realize the importance of registration of newly constructed properties in gram panchayat. We include properties in 8 (a) and we mention the status of properties like unauthorized or authorized in it. It is formed to collect taxes and not the process of legalizing unauthorized construction. After including new property (new construction such as ground plus one or two), we collect property tax on this property and clear the dues. In this process, gram panchayat will get additional tax.” Vivek Kharvadkar, chief engineer of Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) said, “Recording property details in gram panchayat is a process eligible to pay property tax. It is not a process to legalize unauthorized construction. It is part of collecting revenue through property tax. The PMRDA is authorized to sanction plans of the building and decide the authorized and unauthorized status of structure based on building permits and other related documents.” Suresh Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner of PMC said, “Though the gram panchayat is mentioning the name of properties in their land record, the corporation will verify and then apply property tax. The merger process will take more than one month to complete. After that, gram panchayat will have to hand over all records to PMC. Then, the actual merger process starts.” BOX Khate Utara (8A extract) It is a document which details the exact holdings of an owner; therefore, it is advisable to check that document for calculation of the total holding of the present owner. It is useful for establishing ownership. It shows total information of the owner’s properties in that village area. It is important documents which will help gram panchyat to evaluate and collect property tax on particular property||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/residents-in-23-villages-rush-to-gram-panchayats-for-property-registrations/story-QGrYkdqoyny52FSckjGpIP.html
28-12-2020||Pune||Demand to re-start Pune-Daund DEMU train||For more than 10,000 passengers travelling between Pune and Daund daily, the daily Pune–Daund shuttle Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (Demu) train operating daily is a lifeline. However, the train has not yet begun after lockdown despite repeated demands by passenger groups on the route. The Daund-Pune-Daund Pravasi Sangh has now given an ultimatum to the railway administration to immediately start the Demu train services from next week or face protest. “There are thousands of people who are working in the emergency services between Daund and Pune like government offices, semi-government, banks, police department, blood banks, hospitals and several other emergency services. The number of passengers travelling between both the cities is more than 10,000, so it is necessary that the shuttle Demu train service begins immediately. Earlier, we had a meeting with senior railway officials and repeatedly demanded to start the train, but nothing happened so we have now decided to go on a protest if the train doesn’t start from next week. Why are the Daund- Pune passengers treated badly,” asked Vikas Deshpande, secretary of the Daund-Pune-Daund Pravasi Sangh. From October 12, the Pune-Lonavala local train service resumed after almost six months and since then the daily passengers on the Pune – Daund route have started demanding to start the daily Pune – Daund shuttle Demu. The Demu train service between Pune and Daund was inaugurated in March 2017 by former union railway minister Suresh Prabhu. It is a 76-kilometre train route and there are ten halts on the route – Hadapsar, Manjari Budruk, Loni, Uruli Kanchan, Yavat, Khutbao, Kedgaon, Kadethan, Patas and Daund. “I daily travel by ST bus from Daund to Pune for my job and many times I miss my scheduled bus and reach late to office. If the Demu train is started there won’t be any problem and so it should be started immediately. As the Pune Lonavala local train has started then our daily shuttle train should also start as thousands of passengers are dependent on it,” said Gautam Pardhe, a daily commuter on this route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/passengers-demand-re-starting-of-the-pune-daund-demu-train/story-wi3TKmA8X0t7ONEDVj9siK.html

28-12-2020||Pune||Two years on, Pune’s parking policy awaits implementation||Civic activists have appealed to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to execute the parking policy it passed in March 2018 which creates parking spots on major roads around the city. The parking spaces will be chargeable by the civic body and also generate revenue. Parisar, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) focusing or traffic issues, has asked the PMC to immediately introduce the recently passed policy. The new parking policy, which allows enforcement of pay and park on certain roads is gathering dust due to the opposition from some corporators. Sujit Patwardhan, program director of Parisar, along with his colleague Ranjit Gadgil and air quality co-ordinator Sharmila Deo have accused the civic body of delaying the implementation of policy unnecessarily.“The PMC had approved the parking policy on March 23, 2018. Despite getting the nod from elected members, it is still gathering dust. After getting a nod from the general body meeting, it was decided that the mayor would call the meeting with party leaders and announce the parking policy on selected roads on a pilot basis. Later, it would get executed in the city,” said Patwardhan. In the past when activists approached Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, he promised that the civic body would take a decision on it very soon but nothing happened, according to Patwardhan.Gadgil said, “Cities around the world are talking of parking management. As cars are occupying valuable land space which can be used for housing hospitals, parks and community spaces. As traffic congestion grows in urban areas, it is imperative to have a good management system in place which will create convenience not just for the car users, but all users who occupy road space, like cyclists, bus commuters and pedestrians.”The parking policy calls for marking streets and spaces to be used as parking lots which will be charged by the civic body. Although the administration has already given a list of around 37 roads including FC road, JM road, Gokhale road, Dhole Patil road, Koregaon Park road, MG road, among others it has not been implemented as the final decision was to be taken at an all-party committee meeting chaired by the mayor. Deo said, “There is a strong connection between having a parking policy and mitigating congestion and air pollution. When free parking is available it promotes haphazard parking that creates traffic blocks and congestion. PMC must need to execute its parking policy.” As per the new parking policy, residents will need to pay the parking fee for two-wheelers, as well as night charges. The minimum parking fee for two-wheelers is Rs 2 per hour and maximum Rs 4 per hour. The minimum parking fee for four-wheelers is Rs10 per hour and a maximum of Rs 20 per hour. This met with resistance from politicians since the 2019 Lok sabha and state elections were scheduled for this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-years-on-pune-s-parking-policy-awaits-implementation/story-yHvCok0msnbemIq4sAfzNJ.html

All you need to know||Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao on Sunday announced that all farmers in the state will receive financial assistance under the ‘Rythu Bandhu’ scheme from December 28. A day after a review meeting at Pragathi Bhavan, Rao said more than Rs 7,500 crore would be directly transferred to the bank accounts of around 6.14 million farmers. The financial aid will be given to the farmers from December 28 to January 7.According to the chief minister’s office (CMO), the amount will be credited towards 15.2 million acres of cultivated land at the rate of Rs 5,000 per acre for upcoming cropping season. Rao instructed the concerned officials to ensure that each and every farmer in the state receives the benefit of the scheme, the release said.“He (Rao) said the assistance should begin with farmers who have less holding of lands and to the farmers having a large extent of holding and all farmers should get the assistance in 10 days,” the statement read.During the review meeting, the officials had also apprised the chief minister of the heavy losses incurred by the government to the tune of Rs 7,500 crore due to the purchase of paddy, sorghum, maize, redgram, Bengal gram and sunflower. The officials said that though the government purchased at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), it had to sell them at the lower prices in the market, as there was no demand for these crops.What is ‘Rythu Bandhu’ scheme?The state-run scheme, formally known as the Agriculture Investment Support Scheme, is aimed at incentivising lakhs of farmers every crop-sowing season to support farm investment. The government provides financial assistance for the purchase of inputs like seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, labour and other investments in the field.Under the scheme, every farmer in Telangana is supposed to receive Rs 5000 per acre for two seasons - Rabi and Kharif - which amounts to Rs 10,000 every year for an acre of cultivated land. The direct money transfer in farmers’ bank account allows them to withdraw the amount from the post offices near them, instead of travelling to the towns and cities. According to the government website, the farmers can withdraw the amount through the micro ATMs available through thousands of post offices in rural areas of Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/telangana-farmers-to-get-financial-aid-under-rythu-bandhu-from-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-XD3vrOWGw2VZigaPK0JZfJ.html

Raut, in a press conference held at Shiv Sena Bhavan in Central Mumbai, alleged that some BJP leaders have been trying to pass on a message to him that by using agencies like ED, CBI and the Income Tax department, they plan to bring down the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. ED has summoned Varsha Raut for an inquiry on December 29. The central agency has reportedly found a link of transactions between the accounts of Varsha Raut and Pravin Raut, one of the directors of Guruashish Construction Private Limited, who was arrested recently.Also Read: PMC Bank scam: After ED summons Varsha Raut, Shiv Sena shows support“Since the last year, leaders like Sharad Pawar, Praful Patel and others who were responsible for forming this government are being targeted. From the last three months, three people from the BJP have been frequenting the ED office and procuring documents from there. Since the last year, few BJP leaders have been trying to contact us with the message that the MVA government will soon be brought down. They said that they will use all agencies to achieve their aim of targeting opposition legislators and seeking their resignations. A list of 22 MLAs from the three ruling parties (Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress) was shown to be ready for action by these agencies. Pratap Sarnaik (who is facing an ED probe) was one of them. Since they have failed, they are now targeting our family members,” alleged Raut. Raut alleged that though outsiders are not allowed in the ED office, a few BJP leaders have been frequenting the office to get key documents. He questioned whether the BJP office has an ED cell or if the ED’s office has one for the party leaders. Raut also claimed that he has a list of 120 BJP leaders who have been party to questionable transactions and he was going to hand it over to the ED for further action.He said his wife Varsha Raut is a teacher who took a loan of Rs50 lakh from her friend 10 years ago. “For the last one-and-a-half months, ED has been corresponding with us. We have given all the documents they demanded. We have shown our IT returns and even disclosed my Rajya Sabha affidavit. If I start targeting BJP leaders, many of them in the Centre would have to run away from the country,” he added.BJP said that Raut was making misleading claims. “Raut should face the agency and furnish facts instead of politicising this inquiry. Raut should furnish the list of 120 BJP leaders and demand an inquiry. Who is stopping him from giving it to ED?” questioned BJP legislator Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-scam-sanjay-raut-says-ed-action-an-attempt-to-bring-down-mva-govt/story-FAvv7oCEciaLpYYIp6u2aO.html

28-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC ensured ‘all hands on deck’ to check coronavirus spread in 2020||Covid-19, which brought the country to a standstill in March, did not deter the Delhi High Court from ensuring that people had access to justice and “all hands were on deck” to curb the spread of the deadly virus as also to provide treatment and basic amenities to those affected by it.Before the pandemic brought the country to a grinding halt, the high court conducted two unprecedented midnight hearings, one related to north-east Delhi riots and the other to the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.Throughout the year, the high court dealt with a number of petitions relating to Covid-19, including pleas to provide adequate PPE kits to health workers, sanitation staff, medical cover to media persons reporting on the pandemic, payment of salaries to teachers, doctors, nurses, safai karamchaaris and retired employees of municipal corporations.A day after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, the high court took no time to commence hearings via video conferencing of very urgent matters, and only lawyers appearing for each side were allowed the access.In the riots case, a call was made at the residence of a judge explaining the dire circumstances wherein it was not possible to move the victims from a small hospital to a government hospital. The court directed the police to ensure their safe passage and emergency treatment. The next day, the judge, Justice S Muralidhar, expressed “anguish” over Delhi Police’s failure to register FIRs against alleged hate speeches by three BJP leaders. Hours later a notification was issued by the central government for his transfer to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Even as many in the legal community questioned the timing, Justice Muralidhar, during his farewell, apprised everyone that he was informed about the transfer much before he heard the riots case.On late evening of March 19, three of the convicts in the Nirbhaya case approached the high court to stop their execution. However, their plea was dismissed by the High Court as well as the Supreme Court and they were hanged on the morning of March 20.During the initial phase of hearings via video-conferencing, the court dealt with the pleas of students and other citizens stranded abroad due to coronavirus and directed the authorities to take steps to evacuate them.It also from time to time extended interim orders, including bail, issued by it and subordinate courts before the lockdown.By June, when Unlock-1 was implemented, almost all benches of the High Court began hearing matters via video conferencing which the general public was allowed to attend.Following the Supreme Court orders, a high powered committee, headed by a senior Delhi High Court judge, was formed to reduce the number of inmates in over-crowded jails via parole and interim bail.The High Court also directed the Centre and the Delhi government to implement steps to curb domestic violence and protect the victims during the lockdown and to also ensure there was no dearth of food, water, electricity and sanitation requirements for homeless workers during the period. It observed that in the present “emergent” situation when the country is struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, “it is the need of the hour that all hands are on the deck” and suggested the government to appoint officers to address all problems faced by migrant and daily wage workers living in relief camps during the lockdown.It also gave stern directions to the authorities to clear the arrears and pay salaries of the employees.Besides, it asked the government to ensure that Covid-19 test samples sent to the accredited labs are processed swiftly and the results declared within 24-48 hours. Availability of beds -- both ICU and normal -- and ambulances were the other issues which the High Court kept monitoring.It kept pushing the Delhi government to go for RT-PCR tests, instead of Rapid Antigen Testing, but it was only after the per day cases crossed 8,000 in November and strictures were passed by the High Court that the AAP administration “turned turtle” and “woke up” to the situation.In September, the High Court began physical hearings of matters on a smaller scale due to requests from a section of lawyers. However, according to the High Court data more than 90% advocates preferred proceedings via video conferencing.In October, the High Court also decided to stop granting blanket extension of interim orders, including bails, and ordered staggered surrender of the prisoners. However, the decision was put on hold by the Supreme Court.In November, the High Court decided to extend its restricted form of functioning till January 16, 2021.Towards the year-end, by an interim order it allowed Amazon to oppose before regulators a Rs 24,713 crore deal by Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail to sell assets to Reliance Retail but ruled that the US e-commerce giant’s attempt to control Future Retail is violative of FEMA and FDI rules.The other cases dealt with by the High Court during the year related to actor Rakul Preet Singh’s plea over media connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case as also the pleas challenging election of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia for allegedly violating poll campaign norms in the recent assembly elections.The court also set aside ex-law minister Jitender Tomar’s election in 2015 polls for false declaration, and refused to suspend BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar’s life imprisonment for raping a minor girl in Unnao in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-ensured-all-hands-on-deck-to-check-coronavirus-spread-in-2020/story-T7UR4gUCXT8PkUkGnqTfqI.html

28-12-2020||Kolkata||Bengal forest dept radio collars tiger in Sunderbans to study man-animal conflict||For the first time in the Sunderbans, forest department officials and wildlife experts are taking the help of satellites and radio signals to study tigers and assess the human-tiger conflict in the world’s largest mangrove delta, which has around 100 big cats. A male tiger, that was captured and fitted with a satellite radio collar, was released back in the wild on Sunday, close to a human settlement in the Basirhat range of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve (STR). In the Sunderbans, where human settlements and tiger territories are separated just by a river in many places, tiger straying is common.“Officials from the West Bengal government’s wildlife wing and experts from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) fitted a tiger with a collar and released it in the STR to assess human-tiger interactions through telemetry,” said a top forest department official, requesting anonymity. Also Read: Intellectuals protest against treatment meted out to Sen by Visva BharatiThe Sunderbans, located at the southern tip of West Bengal, account for the highest number of people killed by tigers in India. At least 62 people were killed in the state by tigers between 2015 and 2019 as per figures placed before the Lok Sabha on September 23. Maharashtra with 61 deaths was second. “Incidents of tigers straying into the bordering villages have been brought down over the years by putting up nylon fences all along the forest boundary. But people are still attacked and often killed when they enter the forest to catch crabs, fishes and collect honey,” said a forest official. Officials said that earlier, tigers were collared in the Sunderbans to collect data on their home range and territory. But this is the first time that the data will be used to assess the human-tiger conflict. Forest officials said that three more tigers will be collared soon. The tigers’ movement patterns in the vicinity of human settlements will be studied over the next three years at least. “The forest department has always prioritised scientific management of biodiversity in the Sunderban Biosphere Reserve. This initiative will help manage and safeguard the tigers,their habitat and human population as well as help understand the tigers’ behaviour and habitat utilisation patterns,” said VK Yadav, chief wildlife warden of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sunderbans-first-tiger-fitted-with-radio-collar-to-study-man-animal-conflict/story-tu6IyxYtgUALwqcLM5YS1M.html

28-12-2020||City||Panchkula records 54% turnout, polling peaceful Panchkula||Of the 1.86 lakh voters in Panchkula, only 54% turned up to vote for the municipal corporation (MC) elections on Sunday. It was lowest turnout among the three MCs in Haryana that went to the polls today. During the last MC polls in 2013, Panchkula had recorded a turnout of 64.1%. Polling began at 8.30am and continued till 5.30pm, with most of the elderly choosing to vote in the initial few hours itself. The last hour was reserved for Covid-19 patients, however, officials could not confirm if any positive patient had turned up to vote.The maximum voting was recorded in ward number 20 (84.9%), which covers mostly villages, while the lowest voting was in ward number 2 (urban sectors) which saw a turnout of 38.9%. Over 1,400 police personnel had been deployed across the city to ensure peaceful polling. Of these, 1, 000 were posted at polling booths. Low turnout attributed to Covid, holiday seasonCongress’ mayoral candidate Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia said the low turnout could likely be due to the pandemic and holiday season. “The city has a large number of elderly persons, who may have stayed home due to the pandemic. Also, as New Year is round the corner, many may have gone out of station to celebrate,” she said. City MLA Gian Chand Gupta also said that Covid and New Year holidays may have led to fewer persons coming to vote. The 20 wards of Panchkula had 257 polling booths, while 98 booths were declared hyper-sensitive, 29 were sensitive. Dalip Singh, state election commissioner, Haryana, said: “Voting was held peacefully in Panchkula and all Covid-19 norms were followed. I visited 15 to 16 polling booths and found all arrangements satisfactory. Law and order situation remained peaceful. No incident of bogus voting was reported.”There are six mayoral candidates and 83 others in the fray for 20 seats of councillors in the Panchkula MC House.Stark contrast in arrangements at rural and urban boothsIn terms of Covid safety, there was a stark contrast in the arrangements made at polling booth in urban and rural areas of the MC.The administration was asked to ensure that each polling booth had thermal scanners and sanitisers, besides PPE kits for those in need. Special arrangements were also to be made for senior citizens, pregnant women, and the differently-abled.At the polling station in the Saarthak, Government Intergrated Model Secondary School, Sector 12-A, voters got a red-carpet welcome. The temperature of every voter was checked and they were provided mask and gloves before entering the booths.The entry was from one gate and exit was from another. For elderly persons or for those with disabilities, there were volunteers to take them in on wheelchairs. Dr Vijay Kumar Sharma, 55, a resident of Sector 12-A said: “The arrangement is appreciable. My 88-year old mother was provided with a wheelchair and a volunteer came forward for help. We did not face any problem.”Similar were arrangements in place in other sectors as well and there was no visible crowding inside or outside the polling stations.However, the arrangements at polling stations catering to colonies were not satisfactory. The road leading to Government School, Sector 17, which had 10 polling booths for the population of Indira Colony, was jam-packed with voters. A differently abled voter, Savitri, had to crawl to get to the voting booth as there were no wheelchairs available. A supervisor present there, was without mask.Also, there was only one small gate for both entry and exit and there was no temperature scanning of voters. The arrangement at Buddanpur and Maheshpur polling stations were also not adequate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-records-54-turnout-polling-peaceful-panchkula/story-2EdGOTkqDS668VeFt0THXI.html
28-12-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh: Curtains come down on 2020, what are your hopes and plans for the new year?||The curtains are finally coming down on 2020, a year in which a virus took over the world, snatched lives and livelihoods and caused untold sufferings, virtually ruining economies and bringing countries to a standstill. At the threshold of a New Year, however, hopes are flickering as vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been authorised for use many countries and others being developed by University of Oxford-AstraZeneca are on the verge of being approved even as emergence of a newer, more virulent strain, is adding to worries. The pandemic alone, however, has not been the cause of concern. From the Shaheen Bagh sit-in and the farmers’ stir; the Delhi violence, the locust attack, the India-China standoff at the borders and cyclones such as Amphan and Nisar, one unfortunate happening followed another. Many issues remain unresolved.The world has done its best to adapt. Work from home has become the norm, classes have grown smaller to fit a computer monitor or mobile phone screen, many people say they are learning to do with less, feeling more sympathy for their fellow men and enjoying time spent with loved ones. Exploration of art, taking new courses, thinking positive and doing one’s bit for others has suddenly become more important.This New Year, therefore, will definitely be one of renewal, no matter what it has in store for us. Still coming to terms with the shock of Covid-19, people are definitely not going to take life for granted.What are your hopes and plans for the new year?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-our-take-finally-curtains-come-down-on-2020/story-ZixaPQ3vg8mlPWU4M5q9NP.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Declare timetable, paper pattern for SSC, HSC exams, say Maharashtra teachers||Teachers groups across the state have demanded the Maharashtra education department to give them more clarity on conducting SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12) examinations which are likely to take plan in May-June 2021 due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown.In a letter addressed to the department on Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) teachers’ cell said that there was a lot of uncertainty around the board exams. “The process for form filling has begun for Class 10 and 12 students, but there is no clarity on conducting exams. The department has neither announced tentative dates for the exams nor has it released details on the paper pattern to be followed. We hope that the paper pattern is not changed because that might lead to unnecessary confusion amongst students,” said Anil Bornare of the BJP Teachers’ Cell.Over the last few days, several parents and schools have been writing to the department requesting officials for clarity about the board exams. With a 25% reduction in syllabus across classes, schools said they are unsure about the paper pattern. A senior official from the state board said that the paper pattern is unlikely to be changed. “The syllabus and the paper pattern for Class 10 and 12 have undergone changes in recent years, and it is not expected to change this year,” said the official.In early November, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that exams for SSC and HSC are unlikely before May due to the prevailing pandemic conditions in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/declare-timetable-paper-pattern-for-ssc-hsc-exams-say-maharashtra-teachers/story-uyS84QxXZmSnpjyQ005zhP.html
28-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Re-carpeting of Sec-33 inner road on hold for over a month||Even after a month since the re-carpeting of the inner road of Sector 33 connecting the Sector 32/33 and Sector 33/34 roundabouts came to a halt, the work is yet to resume, despite residents complaining about the apathy of the authorities.The road had been scraped in the beginning of November, but the work had to be stopped, as the temperature went below the ideal 25°C, needed for re-carpeting roads. Balram of Sector 33 was driving his Activa scooter near the Terrace Garden market on December 14 when the vehicle slipped and he fell off. He sustained multiple injuries to the left side of his body, including his arm, leg and even his fingers and head. “The scooter had been losing traction on the road, and since it was late in the evening, the road was dark as the streetlights here don’t work properly. I have been bedridden ever since,” Balram said.He added that two of his neighbours also slipped on the same patch where he did, but it is still in the same state, even after it has been two weeks since the accident.Shabnam Sharma, another resident of Sector 33, also said that she had slipped here once and now takes the longer route around the Sector when she has to go to Sector 32.Kuljinder Sra, general secretary of the Sector 33-B residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “We have been asking the authorities to fix this problem for over a month, but to no avail. Driving on the road stirs up the sand lying here which has been causing breathing problems for those who live nearby. MC has started work on the road in the past few days, but only a small part has been fixed, while the rest lies abandoned.”Shailender Singh, MC chief engineer, says he is aware of the problem. “Work has been restarted on the road and we are confident that it will be fixed in a week. If it rains, then it might take a couple of more days,” he added.Local area councillor Rajesh Kumar Gupta added that one layer has been laid down on parts of the road so far, but, they will lay down three layers in total, before the maintenance work is complete. “Earlier, the work had to be stopped because the temperature had dropped too low. Even now, it is taking longer because of the winter conditions. However, it should be completed soon,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-re-carpeting-of-sec-33-inner-road-on-hold-for-over-a-month/story-CdAF3yO8HUhuxuv6O7p7HO.html
28-12-2020||City||Personal finance: Know the different kinds of mutual funds||Last week, we discussed why parking some money in mutual funds isn’t a bad option, provided you have a basic understanding of what your investment objectives are: are you looking to save for retirement, or repay a student loan? What is your tolerance for risk, and how many more years do you have left to work? Here’s a look at some of the types of mutual funds that exist.Tax saving funds While planning your retirement savings, you must not ignore the taxation aspect. There are specific kinds of mutual funds called equity linked savings schemes (ELSS) that as Archit Gupta, founder and CEO, ClearTax, an online e-filing portal put it, “Offers the dual benefit of tax deductions and wealth creation over time.” The money in these funds is used to primarily invest in the equity market that avail returns in the range of 10-12 per cent, which is twice the interest offered by tax-saving fixed deposits. But be warned, these investments come with a lock-in period of three years.Open-ended funds These types of funds allow you to stay invested for any choice of tenure without warranting any upper or limits of investments. This means that you can buy or redeem any number of these mutual fund units throughout the year with subscriptions and redemptions being allowed on the prevailing net asset value. Suresh Sadagopan, founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories, a professional financial planning and wealth advisory firm says, “Open-ended MFs are the most common kind of MF schemes available. It is suitable for all kinds of investors as it offers liquidity at every point. One may look at close-ended funds only if one has that kind of tenure to invest and only if it allows some specific benefit.” Investors prefer putting money in open-end funds owing to the ease of investments at low cost.Equity funds These mutual funds are best suited for investors inclined to benefit from the highs and lows of the equity stock (shares) market. Apart from earning returns and benefit from regular dividends on equity funds instruments, investors are saved from the risk of losing the entire investment amount as long as you retain a long-term investment outlook. The risk is typically based on the industry, for instance, the IT sector seems to be stable than say, the oil industry, at present. However, this is not a fixed state of affairs. So you need to understand the composition of your mutual fund, and look out for risk-o-meters that indicate the risk factor involved in that particular mutual fund investment that you are looking at.Sahil Arora, director and head of Investments, Paisabazaar.com, a virtual debt syndication service said, “While equities can be highly volatile in the short term, it beats inflation and other asset classes like fixed-income instruments by a wide margin over the long run. Another benefit of investing in equity mutual funds is that they are well diversified across stocks and sectors, which helps to reduce risk and usually they are liquid and come with no lock-in period.”Mutual funds give better returns over a period than the average inflation rate, and though the pandemic makes it difficult for us to predict the inflation rate the way that we may have been able to in the previous years, the market itself is resilient, backed by industries. Thus, it is highly probable that the returns will continue to stay higher than inflation rates.Debt fundsIf you are wary of risky investments or prefer options that promise fixed returns and guarantee capital protection, debt funds will serve your purpose. This is because debt funds are investments in government bonds and securities, corporate bonds or other fixed income instruments. So the initial capital that you invest does not waver, what will vary is the returns on your investment, which is mostly lower than the returns that you get from equity mutual funds. Depending on the holding period, the returns from debt funds can be long-term or short-term gains. Short-term funds typically have a short maturity period (holding period; tenure over which the investors stay invested in a mutual fund) of usually three years or less. If you remain invested in these funds for at least three years, you get the benefit of long-term capital gains tax. If you redeem your investment within three years, the capital gains will be added to your income and will be taxed as per your income tax slab rate.Pension funds These kinds of mutual funds instruments suit best if you are looking for a regular and constant income source. Designed for investors with a long-term perspective on income and returns, pension funds start generating steady returns by the time you reach your retirement age. Besides Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra, a financial services marketplace says, “The investment in equity with debt helps to steadily grow the retirement corpus while ensuring maximum capital protection. With exposure to diverse asset classes, pension funds aim to obtain a higher yield as compared to fixed return schemes, and thus try to ensure that returns beat the inflation rate.” You may choose between receiving returns in a lump sum, pension, or both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/personal-finance-know-the-different-kinds-of-mutual-funds/story-tcXZBrJ2uWeu6xBktg4fTJ.html

28-12-2020||City||Shiv Sena-NCP camaraderie worries Maharashtra Congress||The state leadership of the Congress is upset over the hobnobbing between its allies, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), of late, as well as about the recent criticism against its central leadership. Recently, deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar told his party workers to adjust with Shiv Sena at local levels, as the two parties were looking at a long-standing alliance.“The Congress has always been getting secondary treatment in the ruling alliance. The MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly) from Shiv Sena and NCP have been getting special development funds. The municipal corporations and councils headed by Congress are not given the funds as the departments which release the money are held by other two parties. Being the head of MVA government, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray should personally look into these matters,” said Congress leader and former minister Arif Naseem Khan. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat and former CM Ashok Chavan had openly expressed their discontent on the secondary treatment given to the party in the alliance in the past. Congress leaders also feel they may be pushed to an insignificant position during the upcoming major civic body elections. As many as 27 district councils of the total 34 and 15 of 27 municipal corporations are going to polls in the next two years. “It is a simple equation in the local body elections. The party with the highest corporators in the local body will be the senior partner in the alliance at that level. In most of the civic corporations, Sena and NCP have their stronghold. We have better understanding between us, but accommodating Congress in seat-sharing may become difficult in most of the cases,” said an NCP leader. NCP’s recent move of poaching 18 Congress corporators in the Bhiwandi-Nizampur civic body has largely upset the state Congress leadership. The central leadership, too, had taken cognisance of the poaching and had summoned Thorat to Delhi. Party leaders feel the move was against the principles of coalition as both the parties are part of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi. It has pinched the party leadership more because Shiv Sena managed to convince NCP to send its corporators back, when the Sharad Pawar-led party had similarly poached Sena corporators in July. “CM should have averted the crossover of our corporators,” said Khan. A senior Shiv Sena leader, who did not wish to be named, said, “Congress corporators were upset with the local leadership and wanted to quit the party. They had approached us but we did not think it was proper to induct them. Had NCP not given them the entry, they would have gone to BJP. Rather than cursing the partners, the Congress should first try keep its own house in order by resolving the issues at right time.” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s criticism against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by Sonia Gandhi has not gone well with the Congress in Maharashtra. Chavan said the Sena has no business to talk about UPA, as it is not yet a part of it. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “For strange reasons, the other two parties [Sena and NCP] have been cornering the Congress in the alliance. Sena and NCP have come close in the past few days and it may hurt the prospects of Congress at various levels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-ncp-camaraderie-worries-maharashtra-congress/story-5CdQ5wXPLAstdGHt0n7fhM.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||3 men held by Mumbai Police for killing Kandivli woman, dumping her body at Aksa beach||Samta Nagar police have detained three men on Sunday suspected of allegedly killing a 30-year-old woman and dumping her body near Aksa beach.According to police, the victim, Nandini Rai, was a resident of Kandivli. The officers said that after they sent the women’s body for a postmortem, it was clear that she had been strangled and killed. On circulating her photo to other police stations, they discovered that Rai had been missing from her in-laws’ house since December 8.Rai’s body was found in a sack at Aksa beach on December 24 and she was identified by her clothes and tattoo.Raju Kasbe, senior inspector of Samta Nagar police station said that on December 9, Rai’s father had registered a missing complaint after he received a call from her father-in-law, Kamal Rai, about her disappearance.Rai’s husband had left for their village in Uttar Pradesh two months ago and had not returned at the time of her disappearance.In his complaint, Rai’s father claimed that Kamal had also gone to their village after informing him about his daughter’s disappearance.The police detained Kamal from his village along with Nandini’s father and an autorickshaw driver. “We have detained Kamal as he had been deflecting from answering his neighbour when they asked where Rai was. Each time he made up a new excuse regarding Rai’s whereabouts,” said Kasbe.Police are questioning Kamal and others to find out the sequence of events leading to Nandini’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-men-held-by-mumbai-police-for-killing-kandivli-woman-dumping-her-body-at-aksa-beach/story-yabJ3flbItGicPwfHtMQMK.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Two interstate commuters||On this particularly cold sunless morning, Sangeeta and Shanu are hitting the road. They left from south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj two hours ago, and, now that they’ve crossed the interstate border from Delhi to Gurugram, in Haryana, half of their journey to work is done.And what’s unusual about that? After all, thousands of people living in the National Capital Region are in the same situation — having their residence in one state and their work place in another, and doing the commute.And yet, the sight of Sangeeta and Shanu seems extraordinary in this procession of cars and bikes. For Sangeeta, 9, is a white mare, while Shanu, 35, is a human. She is without the mask. He is wearing a black mask, and holding a mobile. Shanu is sitting atop Sangeeta.“We have an assignment in Sector 15, “ explains Shanu. Both work for a Delhi-based firm that supplies mares to celebratory events, mostly weddings in which the groom goes to bride’s place mounted on a mare.“Today it’s not for baraat (wedding procession)... but for ghurcharai,” says Shanu, explaining that this is a wedding-related ritual requiring the groom to go to the temple on a mare.If Sangeeta is tired, she isn’t being showy about it. Her face is calm. The pair is standing by the side of the highway for this brief interview, with a gigantic multi-floor grey building looming in the backdrop. Neither of them is looking impressed by the high-rise. As spotlessly white as fresh snow, Sangeeta is attired suitably for the job, with thick bands of pink and orange around her neck. A red cloth fringed with gold is spread under her saddle.It has to be said they started their day on a well-fed stomach. Shanu had a breakfast of parathas and Sangeeta had channa. “I have a stock of channa and gur (jaggery) with me, and I keep feeding her whenever she feels hungry.” He secretly hopes that they both will be offered lunch during the function.Working as “ghori walla” for 25 years, Shanu started as a very young boy, inheriting the profession from his father, who inherited it from his father. Sangeeta has been working for six years, and Shanu has no idea of her family background.Whatever, “the kaam (assignment) should last for an hour and then we’ll go back.”First, Shanu will drop Sangeeta at her farm in Vasant Kunj, where she lives with about 30 mares, after which he’ll head home to Sundernagri in Jumna-paar, in the bus.They now trot off, becoming once again part of the commuting traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-two-interstate-commuters/story-aZYZP7f7td4N0b8GikvdpI.html
28-12-2020||Chandigarh||MC polls: Poor show with 56% turnout in Ambala||Despite it being a Sunday, voters did not appear to be very enthusiastic about the municipal corporation (MC) elections here, with only 56.3% turning up, which was around 11% less than the 2013 percentage.There are 1.87 lakh voters here.Till this report was filed at 10 am, the website of the state election commission (SEC) showed 56.3% voting percentage, which was much less than nearly 67% recorded (2.72 lakh total voters) in 2013.Around 60.5% voters (2.54 lakh total voters) turned up for the 2019 assembly elections..Around 60.5% (2.54 lakh) voters turned up for the 2019 assembly elections. Locals cite drop in mercury levels since Saturday night and the shadow of Covid-19, especially for elderly, as the reasons for the poor show.Only 17% voters turned up early as the morning remained foggy, but the numbers increased once the sun came out after 1 pm. A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader who did not want to be named, however, said: “The voters don’t take these elections seriously and are aggrieved with the level of corruption in the municipalities. Three holidays this Christmas weekend could be another reason.”Political parties also made allegations of lapses by the SEC and the administration at different voting booths. Pawan Aggarwal, husband of the Congress mayoral candidate, said as there had been no door to door distribution of voter slips, and in the absence of booth level officers (BLOs) people had a hard time finding their name in the lists and on the MC website. Haryana Democratic Front general secretary Chitra Sarwara alleged that instances of negligence during delimitation of wards could have led to the confusion over voter lists. On being asked about the verification of the lists by political parties, Sarwara said, “Many voters had to leave the polling booth when their names were not found in the list. No MC or mayor is in power since the last house session ended in 2018, so no one was ready to take the initiative and verify the lists.”On these queries, SDM-cum-returning officer Sachin Gupta said that under the SEC, no arrangements are usually made for BLOs or voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT). “However, those under the Saksham Yuva Scheme (to provide jobs to young people for the state) have done a commendable job, the voter lists on the website were also perfectly fine,” he said.DC-cum-election officer Ashok Kumar Sharma said in a statement said that despite the harsh weather, the voters came forward to strengthen democracy and the elections concluded peacefully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-polls-poor-show-with-56-turnout-in-ambala/story-ItdYrdVYiWxbo5YMouPy7K.html

28-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt’s rejection of compensation claims by city cops: State BJP writes to L-G Baijal||The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, seeking his intervention over the state government’s rejection of compensation claims filed by families of police personnel who died while on Covid-19 duty. Hindustan Times had on Saturday reported that the Delhi government had rejected 12 of the 15 compensation claims it had received from families of police personnel who were verified, by the law enforcement agency, to have died of Covid-19 in the national capital. The three remaining cases are pending with the government. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, in the letter to Baijal, wrote that during the nationwide lockdown, police had risked their lives implementing Covid-19 norms across the city, especially in containment zones and distributing rations to poor or providing medicines and essential commodities to those in need. “Delhi Police has put up compensation claims on behalf of its personnel who died due to Covid while on duty and it is shocking to know that Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal government has rejected most of their claims…I on behalf of citizens of Delhi request you to intervene in the matter and ensure fair justice to all Delhi Police personnel who died on duty due to Covid infection,” Kapoor said in the letter.The government had in April announced compensation of 1 crore to the families of front line workers who died of Covid-19 on duty. In rejection letters sent to the families, the city-state’s government said that the officers hadn’t been deployed on Covid-19 duty but were on routine duty. This prompted families to ask the state government to define Covid-19 duty. Until Sunday, 31 Delhi police personnel died of the infection. While 15 claims sent to the Delhi government, the remaining 16 are yet to be sent and are being verified by police committee. Before sending the cases to the government, police check for details such as the cause of death and if the person was on duty when he/she contracted the infection. Despite many calls and text messages, the Delhi government did not comment until late Sunday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-s-rejection-of-compensation-claims-by-city-cops-state-bjp-writes-to-l-g-baijal/story-weBZ4lcQzZCsMv5LE9R2PJ.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Rise in number of domestic travellers for New Year’s; Goa top choice||While travel this year has been at an all-time low due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems that many Indians have started travelling again. With New Year’s around the corner, Goa is the top destination for people from Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. According to travel portals, leisure travel recovery is being led by millennials, and they expect the trend to continue in a more pronounced way in 2021. “Travellers are packing their bags for year-end trips. They are confidently exploring options which provide stringent safety and sanitisation processes with health and hygiene as the top priority. A majority of travellers are opting for places which are secluded and less commercial, providing them with peace and calm. Additionally, with 44% growth in last-minute bookings received this year as compared to the last, there has been a change in booking patterns,” said Sabina Chopra, co-founder and chief operating officer (COO), corporate travel and head industry relations, Yatra.Portals unanimously listed Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Udaipur and Ooty among others to be travellers’ preferred places. “In terms of accommodation, we have seen a surge in inquiries for options such as homes-stays, cottages and premium and luxury hotel properties,” Chopra added.According to Cleartrip, preferred travel destinations this season are Goa, Kochi and Bengaluru.“Essential travel picked up as the unlock phases were announced and travel season since Diwali validated this further as road trips, weekend getaways and day-cations were the top choice at Goibibo. Leisure travel recovery is being led by millennials and we expect that trend to continue in a more pronounced way, come 2021. Many more Indians will be taking their first real holiday in the coming months, having a host of products that put safety first to choose from,” said Vipul Prakash, COO, Goibibo.As per searches on Goibibo, people are looking forward to unconventional trips that promise adventure and manage to bring back the thrill of travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rise-in-number-of-domestic-travellers-for-new-year-s-goa-top-choice/story-s16jeQ3LssFyd2ZjoxsjqO.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||UGC funds delayed; scholars in debt||Debt is piling for 27-year-old Jatin Sharma, a research scholar from the School of Life Sciences, Central University of Rajasthan, as he has not received his fellowship for the past six months from the University Grants Commission (UGC). In 2018, Sharma had secured a good rank in the national entrance test for admission to an institute under the Council of Science and Industrial Research. Having qualified for UGC’s Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) scheme, Sharma used the funds not only on his living expenses, but also helped his mortgaged family home. However, with fellowships delayed by almost half a year, Sharma has been forced to borrow money from friends and private lenders at higher interest rates. The Covid-19 pandemic has further dented his family’s income from selling cutlery. “I feel like the government has abandoned me at the time when I need the support the most. I urge them to clear all the pending dues so that I can focus on planning my experiments rather on how and when will I pay my bills,” said Sharma. His plight is shared by thousands of research scholars in the country who have been waiting for their fellowships from UGC from three to 12 months. Shahrukh Bhati, a researcher at the Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, claimed he has not received his Maulana Azad National Fellowship for minorities for the past 10 months. “My pending fellowship amounts to Rs3.5 lakh. I am unable to continue my research work and have to manage the living expenses by borrowing money from elsewhere,” said Bhati. UGC offers 13 types of scholarships and fellowships for postgraduate and research students around the country in various fields of education. These include fellowships for women, minorities and economically-weaker sections, among others. The funds are transferred into the bank accounts of beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer. However, various fellowships offered to support research scholars by UGC have been delayed by three months to a year, claimed researchers. Bhushan Patwardhan, vice-chairman of UGC, said that the delay was owing to a technical glitch in the transfer system. “There was a glitch at the bank’s end, which has been identified and rectified. The payment for the next cycle will continue as normal,” Patwardhan added. Researchers said apart from the financial hardships, the delay in receiving the grant is also affecting their mental health. In a survey of around 1,000 scholars conducted by the Joint Research Council of India – an organisation formed by research scholars – 87% of the respondents said they had taken financial loans to pay for expenses and 97% said the delay had affected all aspects of their lives, including mental health. JRCI had earlier written to the central government, highlighting the delays and seeking immediate disbursal of funds, following which some beneficiaries received the fellowships in November. “Some JRF holders got their fellowship for a few months credited to their accounts. This was not the full pending fellowship amount but something to start off with. However, now other fellowships are being held,” said Mohammed Faizan, a scholar from Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad. “With institutes closed during the lockdown, there is a misunderstanding that we don’t need the funds. What the government needs to understand is that some of us are first generation learners supporting families with our fellowships. With frequent delays in the disbursal of fellowships, there is very little incentive for research work,” said a JRF scholar from Jawaharlal Nehru University. Patwardhan, however, contested this claim: “India is among the very few countries providing financial support to researchers on such a large scale. We have a host of programmes for various sections of students and courses they are pursuing,” he said. According to data from the annual reports of UGC, the apex body governing all higher education institutes in the country spends around Rs1,100 crore annually on fellowships and scholarships. This accounts for around 9% of its total expenses. In 2018-19, UGC spent Rs1,100 crore or 9.56% of its annual revenue on scholarships and fellowships. In 2017-18, the governing body spent Rs1,106.55 crore (8.89%) on scholarships and fellowships.

28-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 3,314 new Covid-19 cases, 21 returnees from UK test positive||Maharashtra recorded fewer than 4,000 Covid-19 cases for the 11th consecutive day on Sunday, amid authorities focussing on fliers who have recently arrived from the United Kingdom (UK), post the discovery of a new strain there. As of Sunday, 21 people in the state, who returned from UK in the past few weeks, have tested positive for Covid-19. According to a state surveillance report, eight samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing, apart from the 13 sent earlier. This is to test whether any flier was carrying the mutant variant responsible for the widespread transmission in the UK. On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 3,314 cases, taking the total to 1,919,550. The state’s Covid-19 toll reached 49,255 with 66 deaths recorded.Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) continued to hover around 2.57% even as the state administration is looking at bringing it below 1%. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 578 new infections, taking the tally to 290,914, while eight more deaths took the toll to 11,076. Pune, Nagpur and Nashik cities, which are among the highest contributors, reported 302, 255 and 220 cases on Sunday. State has 59, 214 active cases, while the recovery rate stood at 94.29%. The state health department has also undertaken contact-tracing of all these cases. According to the surveillance report, as of Sunday, a total of 2,935 travellers have been traced and 1,299 have also been tested for Covid-19. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, however, said that there is no reason to panic. “Mutation or change in genomic make-up is normal. It was always expected. There is no reason to panic as the trends in Maharashtra are a sign of hope,” he said. He further explained, “The positivity rate in September 2020 was around 24.6%. Every fourth sample being tested was found positive. The current positivity rate is around 6.5-7%. A Central government-appointed panel has also stated that the pandemic might end in the country by February 2021, however, we are prepared for any eventuality and must not let our guards down.” The government-appointed Covid-19 India National Supermodel committee had stated that if all measures are followed, the pandemic might end by February 2021, with a few sporadic cases being recorded post that. The state government has, however, put the administration on alert after the discovery of the mutant strain, asking civic bodies and district collectors to trace and conduct tests of all those who have come from UK between November 15 and December 23. Dr Shashank Joshi, members of the state-appointed task force said, “While the state did not see a surge post Diwali, there are chances of a wave post Christmas and New Year celebrations as Covid-appropriate behaviour is still not observed in many places. We are on alert for a surge between December 26 and January 26.” N Ramaswami, commissioner of National Health Mission, said, “We have started screening passengers from Middle East also. However, we are looking at UK on a priority basis.” Owing to the risk posed by the new strain, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also alerted people and stressed for the need to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Ruling out the need of reimposing the lockdown, Thackeray earlier this week also justified his move of imposing night curfew by saying it will inculcate the sense of risk of spread of the virus among the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-3-314-new-covid-19-cases-21-returnees-from-uk-test-positive/story-7nryx38zByPzDzKRYGRROL.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Metro-2A, 7 trial runs delayed, likely in March 2021||Mumbai The uncertainty owing to the Covid-19 pandemic has further delayed the trial runs for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E). The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is now looking at starting the trial runs from March 2021 instead of January 2021. The MMRDA officials said the pandemic has resulted in delaying the manufacturing of several crucial elements required for both – the civil works and the trains. A senior official, who did not wish to be named, said, “There are some crucial elements required for the rakes, which are stuck in Japan. Similarly, civil works have also been affected because manufacturing has taken a severe hit.” The rakes are being manufactured by the Bengaluru-based Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML). The two corridors, part of the 337-km Mumbai metro master plan, were initially supposed to be operational by December 2020. The official also said, “The station works are in progress and we have also got adequate workforce at the site now, which was a major issue in the initial months of the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-metro-2a-7-trial-runs-delayed-likely-in-march-2021/story-UMJE3vOLARSq2YbhkDN1CO.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Touching hand without sexual intent not assault under Pocso Act: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that merely holding or touching the hand without sexual intent does not amount to sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and granted anticipatory bail to a man booked for holding the hand of a 17-year-old while expressing his love to her. A bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the anticipatory bail application of the 27-year-old man from Baramati was informed by advocate Ranjeet Pawar that his client had expressed his love towards the teenager, but he had no sexual intent. It was a plain exhibition of his feelings. Pawar further submitted that the sessions court had rejected the application and hence he had approached HC. According to the complaint, the girl is a student, and the accused is her neighbour. While she was on her way for tuitions, the accused stopped her and expressed his love for her. When she not did respond, he caught her right hand and again expressed his love. She managed to escape, but the man persisted. He warned her from disclosing the incident to anyone and also sent her threatening messages on her father’s mobile phone using different SIM cards. The complaint stated that after going through the ordeal for eight months, the girl decided to lodge a complaint. The man was booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Pocso Act, 2012. Additional public prosecutor opposed the man’s anticipatory bail plea on the grounds that his custodial interrogation was required to ascertain from where he had sourced the different SIM cards. However, the court was not satisfied with the argument. “Prima facie, looking at the allegations levelled in the FIR (first information report), the applicant had expressed his feeling of love towards the complainant by holding her hand on one occasion. This by itself cannot be said to be falling within the sweep of section 7 (Pocso Act), since prima facie, the ingredients of section 7 are not made out in the wake of allegations in the complaint or attempting to contact her by use of electronic communication,” observed the court. “Subject to the stipulation that the applicant will in no manner pressurise the complainant, he is entitled for being released on bail in anticipation of his arrest,” said the bench, while allowing the bail. The court also restrained the man from entering the area where the complainant resides till the charge sheet in the case is filed, and also asked him not make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing the facts to court or any police officer and should not tamper with evidence either.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/touching-hand-without-sexual-intent-not-assault-under-pocso-act-bombay-hc/story-n1fUKWna2eD7i1aJHZXt2J.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses bail to 72-year-old accused of sexually assaulting 11-year-old neighbour||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has refused to grant bail to a 72-year-old man who was booked for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl on the grounds that as the trial would take time to commence, the man may threaten and terrorise the minor if he was freed. The court also observed that as the accused is practically the age of her great grandfather, and if the charges against him under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act are proved, and it would amount to a “heinous crime”, the court dismissed the plea. A division bench of justice RV Ghuge and justice BU Debadwar, while hearing the criminal appeal filed by the accused Harsing Patil from Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district, was informed that the appeal challenged a trial court order that denied him bail. Advocate AJ Patil for the appellant submitted that his client was 72 years old and would never commit an offence such as raping a minor. Patil submitted that his client had taken a house on rent just eight days prior to the lodging of a first information report (FIR), and it was not possible that he would commit a crime against the minor living in the adjacent house. He further submitted that his client did not have criminal antecedents, and as he was behind bars since his arrest on May 26, he should be released on bail. Additional public prosecutor PV Diggikar submitted that the FIR was lodged by Jalgaon Police on May 26, and the victim’s statement was recorded, wherein it was stated that the minor’s parents are farm labourers. On May 23, when the parents were not in the house, the appellant made his first attempt to sexually assault her and repeated the same the next day. On May 25, when the man entered the house, the victim realised that he would make a similar attempt and she started screaming and called her aunt. The man got scared and rushed back to his house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-72-year-old-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-11-year-old-neighbour/story-4B5JIhGQVXsTkWjPI0nq7O.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||BJP's Devendra Fadnavis alleges Maharashtra government’s move to rationalise taxes was to favour select builders||Opposition leader and former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis has accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government that in the pretext of rationalising of taxes for the realty sector in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was framing policies to favour a few select developers.Fadnavis said this would result in the windfall of ₹20,000 crore to these selected developers.In a letter to Thackeray, Fadnavis referred to the recommendations of the Deepak Parekh-led committee which was formed to suggest ways to revive the realty sector due to the pandemic.“The recommendations suggested by the said committee, it seems, are being implemented selectively without considering the real effect of the same,” said Fadnavis. “There seems to be a systematic method devised to give windfall benefit to said real estate developers by fragmented and prejudiced reduction of ready reckoner of some of their self-owned and interest plots to the extent of 70% of the existing ready reckoner’s rates. It was brought to my notice that when only a few projects of selected five developers were analysed to capture its effect, it was found out that this will lead to a windfall gain of more than ₹2,000 crore,” he added.The Parekh committee was formed as the realty sector was facing a massive slowdown due to Covid-19. It recommended massive reductions of premiums. Fadnavis alleged that the entire cabinet agenda, which was to be kept secret till a decision is taken, is being circulated to the developers and on social media.While signing off the letter, Fadnavis warned Thackeray that if no corrective action is taken, he would be compelled to file a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-s-devendra-fadnavis-alleges-maharashtra-government-s-move-to-rationalise-taxes-was-to-favour-select-builders/story-WeqaiTMGZsrHDWRoMf9rUI.html
28-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha summoned by ED in PMC Bank scam case||The wife of Shiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) and party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut has been sent a notice summoning her for an inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Varsha Raut has been summoned reportedly in connection with a multi-crore scam of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank. The ruling parties have, however, claimed the action was out of political vengeance. Two days after Eknath Khadse, who recently joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after defecting from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was sent a notice for interrogation, Varsha has been summoned by the central agency on December 29. Raut, who has been vocal against the BJP government at the Centre, said that they have not received the notice yet. He said that he will hold a press conference after they receive one. Raut later tweeted a line from Hindi film song, “Aaa Dekhein Zara Kisne Kitna Hai Dum, Jamke Rakhna Kadam Mere Saathiya.” Varsha has reportedly been summoned in connection with transactions related to the PMC Bank scam. The central agency has reportedly found a link of transactions between the accounts of Varsha and Pravin Raut, one of the directors of Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, who was arrested recently. Guruashish is a subsidiary of Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL), whose other directors Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan have already been arrested in connection with the scam. The ED had initiated an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2019, against directors of HDIL and Joy Thomas, chairman and managing director of PMC Bank, among others. The case was registered for wrongful losses of more than ₹4,300 crore to PMC Bank through forgeries committed by office bearers of two entities. The Maharashtra ruling parties – the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP – have termed the action by the ED as politics of vendetta and an attempt by the BJP to threaten leaders who have been criticising them. “This is nothing but an attempt to threaten the leaders from opposition parties by using the central agencies politically,” said NCP spokesperson and state minority welfare minister Nawab Malik. Congress’s Sachin Sawant said, “ED should now shift its office to the BJP’s headquarters as the central agency doesn’t act autonomously any more. It is expected to take action against wrongdoings under PMLA, but it seems to be acting under the Prevention of Opposition Leaders Act. The BJP has been grossly using the central agencies against opposition leaders, and it has posed a great threat to democracy.” The BJP’s Atul Bhatkhalkar pointed out that ED has been investigating the scam for the past eight months. “It recently attached the property of Ratnakar Gutte, an MLA who has supported our party. This shows that the central agency is not taking action only against the non-BJP leaders. The leaders should not be worried about the notices if they have not done anything wrong,” he said. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said that Raut and his wife should clarify if there was any transaction done by them concerning the PMC Bank scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-s-wife-varsha-summoned-by-ed-in-pmc-bank-scam-case/story-aEE4nprZ3J5PjSFPnzHCLI.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials confirmed their samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for genome sequencing to find if they are infected with a new strain of the virus. The BMC has also traced more than 40 people that came in contact with these 11 people. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “These 40 people will undergo Covid tests if required. The samples of the ones tested positive are being sent to NIV, Pune. These tests will continue for a few days more.” The BMC has identified upto 1, 765 returnees from the UK, who have arrived in Mumbai between November 25 and December 22, to check if they have been infected with the new strain of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. For the next few days, the administrative ward officials have been directed to contact the returnees located in their wards, check on their health, send a medical team if needed and also prescribe RT-PCR test if required. Kakani added, “Of the ones that have been quarantined in private hotels, more than 180 people were tested and none were found positive. Our teams are working tirelessly to ensure contact-tracing of all positive patients.” As a new variant of the coronavirus was found in the UK, the BMC announced that fliers from the United Kingdom, Europe and Middle-Eastern countries will compulsorily be quarantined for seven days after they land in Mumbai. Their stay may increase by another seven days if they test positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/11-of-738-passengers-who-returned-from-uk-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-mumbai/story-8IfnoZZXS8tr0KNhMdkfGK.html
28-12-2020||City||Closure of Pakhowal road: Locked in, Ludhiana shopkeepers fume over traffic curbs, seek diversion plan||Already reeling under losses due to the pandemic, a section of businesses fear further losses as customers are unable to come to their establishments due to construction on the Pakhowal Road. The section from Sidhwan Canal Bridge to Hero Bakery Chowk has been closed in view of the ongoing project for construction of a rail overbridge (ROB) and two rail under bridges (RUBs).This has resulted in another ‘lockdown’ for over 50 traders whose shops are located on the 500m stretch. Authorities had barricaded the road overnight without giving shopkeepers or commuters a heads up. Manager of petrol pump situated near Pakhowal road railway crossing, Bobby Verma said, “All roads leading to the petrol pump have been blocked. The situation is even worse than the Covid lockdown announced by the government as customer footfall was comparatively high at that time. The authorities are also not telling us the exact time period for which the roads will remain blocked but the project will take months for completion.”Manager of a meat shop, Gagan said, “Our business has reduced by 80% in just two days after the construction work started as many customers are not showing because of the blocked roads. Home deliveries are also low as many suspect the shop is closed.”Shopkeepers said the authorities should have come up with a diversion. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We understand the problems being faced by the shopkeepers but the project is being taken up for the benefit of shopkeepers and the public at large. I will direct the officials to visit the area and make changes in diversion plans, if possible, to facilitate the shopkeepers.” The project being taken up under the Smart City mission is set to be completed in August 2021. The owner of a garment shop near the railway crossing, Siroj Kumar said that he had inaugurated the shop on Sunday and the civic body had dug up the road outside his shop on Tuesday. “As the road has been blocked, there is no footfall. Now, I am mulling shifting to Vikas Nagar area. The construction company might take months to complete the project and we will not be able to run our business in these circumstances,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/closure-of-pakhowal-road-locked-in-ludhiana-shopkeepers-fume-over-traffic-curbs-seek-diversion-plan/story-q1M8Ygf85mHhQZ6bQCWYfN.html

We want police presence on the streets in the late hours, just like in Chandigarh. Also, the market of sector 12 A should be developed, as it hardly has any shops,” said Shashi Grover, 65.Manju Bala, 58, said women were afraid to move out of their homes at night or allow their daughters to stay out late in the evenings. “The streetlights too don’t work and the playgrounds are not well lit. We have hardly seen any development in the city in the past,” she added.“Snatchings occur frequently,” said Dr Poonam Sharma, 59.Many roads were damaged and some areas were not lit. “We want the new mayor to work on these issues,” she added.Women also wanted the civic body authorities to focus on jobs and skill development opportunities.“Girls from poor families need a source of income, so they need skills training to live dignified and independent lives,” said Neelima Rakhi, 63.Shanti Devi, 37, from Sector 14, wanted jobs and affordable education for children. “Getting admission in government schools is challenging. If you don’t have a reference, your child will not be admitted,” she said.For Barsaati Devi, 60, from Indira Colony, ration had to be made available at affordable rates. “Earlier we used to get pulses and oils from the government, but now we get only wheat. Facilities for the poor are getting scarce. We want the government to provide us ration at affordable rates,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panchkula-mc-polls-safety-key-issue-for-women/story-gFV74HUjsL8H7H7T6YAiDJ.html

This decision has been taken after the reports that a new strain of coronavirus has been found in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Middle East.At present, the BMC is running five jumbo Covid Care facilities in Mumbai- Byculla, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Nesco grounds (Goregaon-East), Mulund and Dahisar. Though the general ward at the jumbo care centre at Mahalaxmi has been discontinued, the intensive care unit (ICU) at the facility is still functional.“With the news coming in about the new strain of coronavirus, we have decided to keep the jumbo centres functional. In January, we will hold a meeting where we will decide on it. But mostly, those will remain functional for the next three months,” said a senior doctor from the health department.Between September and December, the civic body has shut down nearly 450 small Covid care facilities across all the 24 municipal wards in Mumbai. Civic officials stated, most of these facilities are now on standby mode which means - although they are shut, they can be made operational within 48 hours if the need arises.Additional municipal commissioner, Suresh Kakani, said, “Almost 90% of the jumbo centres are lying vacant. Now, most of the patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic who prefer taking treatment at home. However, we want to keep the centres at a stand by position, in case we witness any rise in cases.”Recently, the Nesco jumbo centre has started post-Covid-19 outpatient department (OPD), where recovered patients with Covid-related health complications are consulting doctors. Also, these jumbo centres are providing counselling to the infected patients to improve their mental health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jumbo-covid-19-facilities-in-mumbai-will-stay-open-for-three-more-months-says-civic-body/story-yFaerezWam3GmHpbM6wOlI.html

28-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Centre’s policies are destabilising India’s federal structure, says Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut||Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP) and Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that the Narendra Modi-led central government and the central policies were destabilising the federal structure of the country. Raut pointed out several issues, including the farmers’ agitation, the new Parliament building, Indo-China tensions, Centre claiming ownership of the land allotted for Mumbai Metro car shed and its alleged attempts in de-stabilizing the Madhya Pradesh government, in his weekly column RokhThok, in party mouthpiece Saamana. “Shockingly, the government is using all its might to see to it that Mamata Banerjee doesn’t assume power in West Bengal, BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leader Kailash Vijayvargiya made is clear that Modi played a role in destabilising the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. The states ruled by non-BJP parties look up to the Centre. But the federal structure is being systematically weakened. Congress government in Madhya Pradesh was pulled down by the BJP. There is instability in Kashmir valley. RJD’s (Rashtriya Janata Dal) Tejaswi Yadav posed a challenged in recent elections. All this may lead to the disintegration within the country, just like what happened in USSR [post-revolutionary Russia, Union of Soviet Socialist Republic],” he has stated.Raut said that the Centre’s leadership should realise that the people’s interest has been jeopardised for the political gain of the ruling party. The outgoing year 2020 has posed a question mark on the credibility and efficiency of the central government. Farmers in Punjab are protesting, the Metro project in Mumbai is stuck because of the Central government. Tragically, the country’s future is in the hands of only 2-4 people,” the column reads. “Lakhs of people lost their lives owing to the pandemic this year, but what was more horrifying in 2020 was that the country’s democratic foundation – the Parliament lost its soul. The very laws that the farmers are protesting against, because of which they are on the roads today, were passed in majority by this government,” Raut wrote.The Sena leader also came down heavily on the government’s most ambitious project – The Central Vista project – aimed at giving Delhi’s power corridor – a complete makeover. “Instead of spending ₹1,000 crore on a new Parliament building, the money should be utilised to strengthen the health sector, and leaders like Modi must realise this,” Raut wrote.He further said that if the Modi government were to collect funds for constructing the building – like being done for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya – it wouldn’t receive even a lakh. “Countries like the USA and UK helped their citizens in these tough times, but Indians got nothing,” he said stressing on how several people lost their jobs, faced salary-cuts and had to shut down their businesses this year.“The year 2020 was dark, filled with instability and mental stress. We do not know how 2021 will turn out to be. People should take care of their families. Modi will take care of the country,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-centre-s-policies-are-destabilising-india-s-federal-structure-says-shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut/story-OD0JEeBPKkLv0blPyQuD0J.html

However, only 550 people have registered their pets with the municipal corporation so far. Authorities said that December 31 is the last date to register pet dogs and cats with the MC by paying an annual fee of ₹400. So far, the civic body does not have a tally of pets in the city. However, a thorough drive will be carried out in January.The pet registration drive began in June and despite mayor Balkar Sandhu’s encouragement, most pet owners are yet to do it. Of those who have registered, only 200 residents have collected the brass token which has to be fastened on the pet’s collar.MC officials said that residents can register pets online on the website mcludhiana.gov.in. The pet owners will have to fill the pro forma including details and photographs of the pet and owner. They can also submit the required documents and register by visiting the MC’s zonal offices. They also need to submit a copy of the Aadhar card. The brass tokens can be collected from MC’s Zone-A office (MC headquarters) near Mata Rani Chowk.The officials said that pet registration will also help the civic body and residents identify and locate the pet if it is lost or stolen.MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “It is mandatory to tie a token around the neck of a pet and ferocious dogs must be muzzled while being taken for a walk. In addition to the ₹ 4,000 penalty, owners of unregistered pets will have to pay ₹ 100 a day to MC as the civic body will take the pet’s custody till it is registered. If the pet attacks anybody, the owner will have to bear the expenses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pet-registration-despite-looming-dec-31-deadline-4k-penalty-only-550-pets-registered-with-ludhiana-civic-body-so-far/story-ulTQWclrcselzy5L7nluTM.html

Two bank officials were booked for allowing her access to the locker.Those booked are Yashita Jain, Capital Small Finance Bank Limited branch manager Manpreet Singh and assistant manager Manish Verma. The main accused, Sahil Jain, was found to be involved in bogus billing of invoices worth ₹252 crore involving input tax credit (ITC) of over ₹17 crore in respect of 14 firms created and operated by him either in his name or in the name of his family members and friends, without actual movement of any goods and causing a loss to the government exchequer. Yashita was a partner in a number of such firms involved in issuing bogus bills and passing fake ITCs.In his complaint, Principal Commissioner Good and Service Commisisonerate inspector Anil Dogra said that while Sahil was in jail, the evasion wing of the Commissionerate found that the bank accounts and locker of the accused at Capital Small Finance Bank Ltd, Sunder Nagar, had been operated by the accused Yashita Jain on November 12.When the visiting departmental officers summoned the two bank officers, Manish admitted to have allowed Yashita to operate the locker on the directions of branch manager Manpreet Singh. He also forged Sahil’s signature to indicate he had operated the locker. However, Shail was in jail at the time.Manpreet said, “On November 12 , Yashita came to my office saying she immediately needed to operate her husband’s locker but he was out of town. Thus, I directed Manish to allow Yashita to operate the account.” The department found that both the bank officials had violated Reserve Bank of India guidelines and sought action against them for conniving with the accused. A case was registered under Section 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467, ( forgery of valuable security) 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating, 471 (use a fake document as genuine) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

28-12-2020||City||Hooda expresses concern over rise in farmer deaths||Former chief minister and leader of Opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, on Sunday, expressed concerns over rise in farmer deaths during the ongoing farmers’ protest.Hooda said over 40 farmers have sacrificed their lives amid the ongoing agitation against Centre’s three farm laws but the Centre is still silent on the issue.“Centre should hold dialogue with farmers and end the stir by accepting their demands. Farmers are sitting at Delhi border for valid demands for nearly a month,” he added.He said that his party wants to bring a non-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government in the assembly.“The government has lost trust of public and its legislators. Every section of the state’s population is on streets against the government and many independent MLAs have withdrawn their support from it. Many JJP MLAs have openly come in support of farmers,” he said.Hooda added that if the motion of non-confidence comes in the assembly, even the government’s alliance partners will vote against the government.“But still the CM says that there is no need to call a special session of the assembly as the Opposition does not have any specific issues. The CM dismissing this demand indicates that he himself does not trust his government and MLAs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooda-expresses-concern-over-rise-in-farmer-deaths/story-2f8rGZkYrXBGpFsNHod54K.html

He said they banged thalis and chanted slogans against PM Modi during his monthly ‘Maan Ki Baat’ programme.“We want to ask our PM not to lie in every episode of his radio address and ask him to maintain decency of the PM’s post. Instead of solving our grievances, the PM is blaming farmers for not reaching on table to discuss the issues.

28-12-2020||City||Haryana toll plazas to remain free for commuters: Farmers||Intensifying their ongoing agitation against farm laws, activists of farmers’ organisations said that toll plazas in Haryana will remain free for all commuters indefinitely.Earlier, the farmer union leaders had announced that toll plazas will be opened for three days from December 25 to 27. But in a meeting late on Saturday, farmer leaders said they will not allow the toll companies to charge anything from commuters until the Union government accepts their demands.“We met farmers and representatives of farmer unions. It was decided that toll plazas will not be allowed to charge commuters indefinitely,” said state Bharatiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Charuni.He added that farmers will continue their protests at all toll plazas in Haryana till protests at Delhi borders are not ended.On December 25, the protesting farmers had gathered at toll plazas, forcing toll collection booths’ staff to leave. The protesters took over Haryana toll plazas and removed barricades from toll gates and providing free movement to motorists.Women and children joined the protests at Kitlana toll plaza in Dadri, while farmers parked their tractor-trolleys on the roadside and sat on dharna near Makrauli toll plaza on Rohtak-Chandigarh highway and at Madina toll plaza on Rohtak-Hisar highway.Farmers took over Bastara toll plaza in Karnal on NH-44, Gullarpur toll plaza on Assandh-Karnal highway, Thana toll plaza in Pehowa of Kurukshetra on Hisar-Chandigarh highway, Panipat toll plaza on NH-44, and Dahar toll plaza on Panipat-Rohtak highway. Farmers from Haryana and Punjab continued their sit-in at Shambhu toll plaza near Ambala on Delhi-Amritsar NH-44 for the second day.As per information, the concessionaire of Bastara toll plaza on NH-44 near Karnal is among the biggest sufferer as the toll company is likely to suffer a loss of around Rs 1.20 crore per day due to free movement of vehicles from this toll plaza.Officials of the toll plaza said per day collection of Bastara toll remains around Rs 1.20 crore to Rs 1.30 crore as around 40,000 to 50,000 vehicle cross from the toll plaza every day.In Chandigarh, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said this loss is not to the toll companies. Ultimately, the public will have to bear the losses.‘Boycott products of select corporate houses’Farmer leaders have urged Haryana farmers to boycott products of select corporate houses to express their anger against the three farm laws allowing private traders to procure farm produces.“Besides indefinite protests at toll plazas, we have urged farmers to boycott products of Reliance, Adani and Patanjali,” Charuni said.He added that during meeting, it was decided that farmers will boycott politicians in next elections, if they are not supporting farmers’ stir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-toll-plazas-to-remain-free-for-commuters-farmers/story-EI5X7krtSShiGfEyEBJmbM.html
28-12-2020||Noida||Greater Noida most polluted city; Noida, Ghaziabad air in ‘severe’ zone again||Air quality in Noida deteriorated to the ‘severe’ level on Sunday, with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 405, two days after the region recorded an improvement.With Greater Noida the most polluted city of the country, the three NCR cities of Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad and Noida, were among the five most polluted cities on Sunday, as per the AQI bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the CPCB data, the AQI of Noida Dropped to 405 from a reading of 344 (very poor) recorded a day earlier. Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 418, which was 355 (very poor) a day prior. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 407— the third most polluted city on Sunday — as it dipped from 367 a day prior. An AQI between 101 to 200 is considered moderate, between 201 and 300 is poor, between 301 and 400 is very-poor, between 401 and 500 is severe, and readings above 500 severe plus. The CPCB listed ultrafine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), which mix in the bloodstream though breathing, as the main pollutant on Sunday in the three cities. The P2.5 levels in Noida was 279.01 microgrammes per cubic metres (ug/m3) for Sunday, against 197.99 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 294.84 ug/m3 against 212.27 ug/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad on Sunday was 279.17 ug/m3 against 226.81 ug/m3 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 ug/m3. The pollution monitoring agencies pointed to low wind speeds as the reason for the spike in pollution levels. The pollutants in the city’s air were locally generated, and not due to the external sources like stubble burning, said experts. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), due to a western disturbance in the Indian Himalayan region, which leads to snowfall in the northern states, wind direction changed and subsequently, wind speeds dropped. “Whenever the wind directions change, the pollution levels spike because the dispersion stops. The wind directions change from north-westerly to south-easterly on Sunday and the speed was around 8 kmph. On Monday, the speed may be around 10 kmph but the pollution levels may be high,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), higher ventilation is expected on Monday. “The surface winds are likely to pick up and AQI is likely to improve to the middle-end of very poor on December 28 and 29. AQI is likely to deteriorate thereafter towards the high-end of very poor by December 30. Low ventilation condition is likely to extend thereafter and it may affect AQI on New Year’s Eve,” read a statement issued by Safar on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-most-polluted-city-noida-ghaziabad-air-in-severe-zone-again/story-0p2LdGL5NDgZRRDJ0amaJI.html

28-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality nears severe; IMD warns of cold wave from Tuesday||Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Sunday, reaching the end of the very poor category -- just four away from the severe zone even as the Met office predicted cold wave conditions in the city. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the minimum temperature in Delhi may drop to 3 degrees Celsius from December 29. On Sunday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 6 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 22.6 degrees Celsius.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin showed that the overall air quality index of Delhi on Sunday was 396, in the ‘very poor’ zone. However, by 8pm it deteriorated to 407. At least 25 out of the 36 pollution monitoring stations were in the severe zone, according to Sameer app of the CPCB. On Saturday, the AQI was 337, also in the ‘very poor’ category. So far this month, the air quality in Delhi was severe for four days and moderate for just one day on December 14, CPCB data shows. IMD scientists warned that the air quality could deteriorate further over Sunday night. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said on Sunday Delhi received winds from the northeastern direction, which was high in moisture. This means that air quality will deteriorate over Sunday night and may enter the severe zone, he said. “The high moisture in the air will keep the pollution levels high, but from Monday morning the wind direction will change back to northwesterly. The wind speed will also improve slightly, which will result in a marginal betterment of the AQI,” said Soni. He, however, added that the improvement will not be significant and the AQI on Monday is also likely to remain in the very poor zone. Union ministry of earth science’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research forecast also said that from Monday, Delhi’s air quality is expected to improve. “The surface winds are likely to pick up and AQI is likely to improve to the middle-range of very poor for December 28 and December 29. AQI is likely to deteriorate thereafter towards the high end of very poor by December 30 and December 31,” the Safar analysis read. According to IMD, under the influence of an approaching western disturbance, there was snowfall over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad. Scattered snowfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and light rain and thundershowers were also noticed in the northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. The impact of this will be seen on Delhi’s temperatures from December 29. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said on Monday the minimum temperature will be around 5 degrees Celsius but this will dip and reach to around 3 degrees Celsius in the coming days. “In Delhi, we can expect clouds and trace rainfall. After the WD passes, cold wave conditions are likely to stay for three to four days from December 29 onwards. We are already recording very low minimum temperatures bordering cold wave conditions,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-nears-severe-imd-warns-of-cold-wave-from-tuesday/story-69ifg8umbYRUTCqU9gODZN.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||ICU beds reservation for Covid-19 treatment in 33 Delhi private hospitals reduced to 60%||The Delhi government on Sunday told the Delhi high court that it has accepted the recommendation of the de-escalation committee of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and reduced the reservation of Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) beds from 80% to 60% in 33 private hospitals.The court had, on December 24, said it would be “inhumane” to have 80% ICU beds in almost three dozen private hospitals of the city reserved only for Covid-19 patients, especially when the positivity rate and cases in the city were falling. The court was hearing a plea by the Association of Health Providers challenging the government’s September 12 decision reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals in Delhi for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The court said the order had to be removed if beds remained vacant.The government on Sunday also passed an order, signed by Delhi’s health and family welfare secretary Amit Singla, ratifying the move to reduce reserved ICU beds.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageOn December 24, the government had informed the court that an expert committee has recommended reducing the reservation to 60%. The government counsel had also assured the court that the Delhi government is going to pass an executive order for the reservation of beds on the recommendations of the committee by the DDMA.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for the government, had told the court a meeting would be held on December 26 in this regard, where the views of Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog and Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will be considered while passing an order on reservation of ICU beds for Covid patients.“In supersession of the order dated 12.09.2020, COVID ICU beds in 33 Hospitals shall be de-escalated to 60% from existing 80%, freeing up 20% COVID ICU beds for NON COVID,” the order passed on Sunday read.In the meeting on December 26, both Dr Paul and Dr Guleria agreed with the DDMA de-escalation committee’s recommendation.However, the Delhi government in an affidavit on Sunday said they would not consider any further de-escalations in the wake of the new strain of the Sars-Cov-2 virus detected in the United Kingdom, as well as with Christmas and New Year’s celebrations in mind. The government said it will review the situation on January 15 next year.The government, in an affidavit filed through advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel, has said that the expert committee took note of the declining trend of COVID infection in the NCT of Delhi.“The new UK strain of COVID-19 is a new development which has witnessed itself to the country very recently. The new strain situation is still evolving in the country. About 20,622 persons have landed from UK (combined list of APHO and Nodal Officer Vande Bharat Mission, GNCT of Delhi) in Delhi, from Nov 25 to December 23. Further till now about 19 UK returnees have tested positive and their genome sequencing in underway in NCDC,” the affidavit said.“In view of the unfolding situation of the new strain, we are of the view that we should take abundant precaution and abrupt de-escalation is not advisable at this juncture,” it added.The matter is now likely to be heard on December 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/icu-beds-reservation-for-covid-19-treatment-in-33-delhi-private-hospitals-reduced-to-60/story-679HTTYt0vLaExhTLOWBMM.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||PM Modi to flag-off Delhi Metro’s first driverless train, National Common Mobility Card today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday will inaugurate India’s first-ever driverless train operations on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line — which connects Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden — along with launching the fully operational National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) services on the Airport Express Line. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that the inauguration will be held via video conferencing at 11am on Monday. “These innovations are going to herald a new era of travelling, comfort and enhanced mobility for Delhi-NCR residents. With the commencement of driverless trains on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line, DMRC will enter the elite league of 7% of world’s Metro networks, which can operate without drivers,” the DMRC statement read. DMRC also announced that after the 37-km Magenta Line, they are also preparing to introduce the driverless technology on the 57-km Pink Line corridor (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) by mid-2021. This would increase the driverless network on the Delhi Metro to around 94kms, which is nearly 9% of Delhi Metro’s total network. “The driverless trains will be fully automated, which will require minimum human intervention and will eliminate the possibilities of human errors. Delhi Metro has been a pioneer in introducing technology driven solutions for passenger comfort and this is another step in the same direction,” the Delhi Metro said. Officials explained that the driverless train technology has set standards for automation called grades of automation (GoA). In GoA 1, trains are run by one driver and, in GoA 2 and GoA 3, the role of the driver is reduced to operating doors and for taking over in case of emergencies — the starting and halting of trains is automated. Finally, in the GoA 4, trains are set on a completely unattended operations mode.Beginning tomorrow, at the Magenta line between Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden, GoA 3 will be adopted for the services. Apart from this, the Delhi Metro on Monday will also begin the use of the National Common Mobility Card, on the Airport Express Line. This will allow passengers carrying a RuPay -debit card issued in the last 18 months by 23 banks to swipe these for Metro travel. Passengers from any part of the country will now be able to travel on the Airport Express line using this card, the DMRC said. “This facility will become available on the entire Delhi Metro network by 2022,” DMRC spokespersons confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pm-modi-to-flag-off-delhi-metro-s-first-driverless-train-national-common-mobility-card-today/story-MOoMeWDG5f5DLHvrSl7HaN.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||Only 7% of the 1,068 EVs that received govt subsidy were cars: Data||Only 7% of the 1,068 electric vehicles that received subsidy under the Delhi government’s EV policy since August, were cars/four-wheelers, shows data with the transport department. Maximum among the vehicle categories listed to receive benefits under the policy were e-rickshaws (59%), according to the data. On August 7, the AAP government had notified the Delhi EV Policy 2020 -- unveiled in December 2019 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal -- with an aim to reduce air pollution and to kick-start the economy by spurring demand. The policy offers subsidies,and road tax and registration free waivers, for electric vehicles bought in the Capital.Following the notification of the policy, the government on October 11 notified full waiver of road tax and registration fee for battery-operated vehicles. This benefit is in addition to a subsidy of Rs 10,000 per kWh which is being given to the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, capped at Rs 1,50,000 per vehicle. For electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicles, the subsidy is Rs 5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to Rs 30,000 per vehicle. Records show that since August, Delhi registered over 5,000 EVs. But, of these, only around 21% (1,068) vehicles got the incentives. Of the 1,068 EVs, as many as 625 (59%) new e-rickshaws were given subsidies under the EV policy --- the highest among all vehicle categories. This was followed by electric two-wheelers, 233 of which received the benefits. Even electric-carts, which are e-rickshaws modified to carry light-weight goods, were more than e-cars (72), data till December 22 showed. “The fact that electric two-wheelers comprise the second-highest share among the incentives disbursed to EVs so far shows that Delhi’s EV policy is on the right track. Delhi has over 7.3 million registered two-wheelers and they are also the ones that create a lot of air pollution which usually goes unnoticed. This segment of vehicle has been one of our main target areas to convert into battery-operated or electric mobility,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot.However, transport officials said the low demand for electric cars/four-wheelers is because of a lack of options in the market. “There are very few e-car variants that are on offer in the market at an affordable price. Things may look up for the e-four-wheeler segment in 2021 and 2022 with automobile manufacturers like Tata and Hyundai planning to introduce electric hatchback variants,” said a senior transport official. Officials who are handling the EV incentives said the government has received nearly 1,600 requests for subsidies so far of which nearly 180 were rejected, while around 280 requests are pending at various stages. “The most common problem we are facing in disbursing the incentive amount is from the dealer’s end. Aadhaar of the vehicle owner is mandatory for the application to be processed. But, in addition to that and prevent corruption, we asked all dealers to also take and upload a cancelled cheque from each applicant to ensure the government’s incentive amount is being transferred to the genuine beneficiary. So many a times this is not being done correctly. This delays the process,” the official said. While unveiling the policy in December 2019, Kejriwal had termed the policy a significant step towards ensuring cleaner air in the city. “Vehicles are the biggest source of pollution in the capital and amount to 40% of PM2.5 air pollution levels and 80% of carbon monoxide in the air. Over their lifetime, these EVs are estimated to save approximately Rs 6,000 crores worth of oil and liquid natural gas consumption,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-7-of-the-1-068-evs-that-received-govt-subsidy-were-cars-data/story-kG8nOzNlIVbKkBWaoPwvkM.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||Police urge trial judge to inspect Pracha’s office||The special cell of the Delhi police on Sunday urged a trial judge to inspect the office premises of advocate Mehmood Pracha, who, they alleged, prevented the investigators from confiscating a “primary evidence” against the lawyer in connection with a Delhi riots-related forgery case.According to the police, Pracha, who represents at least 80 accused and victims in the north east Delhi riots cases, threatened the team that had raided his office and did not allow them to seal a suspect computer, which might have several crucial pieces of information.The police also sought to explain the circumstances in which a fresh FIR against Pracha was registered under charges of obstructing the officials, stating that the lawyer along with his associates presented “stiff obstruction and criminal intimidation” when they proceeded to seal and seize the suspect computer.The investigating agency also opposed the plea by Pracha to receive a copy of the videography footage of the raid, saying that Pracha is “an accused” and that he cannot seek this evidence only as owner of the premises.Countering this, Pracha said that he had sought the video footage as an applicant whose premises has been raided and not as an accused. He maintained that he hasn’t been named as an accused by the police.Duty magistrate Udbhav Kumar Jain, however, accepted the contentions of the Special Cell and refused to supply the copy of the video footage at this stage. He said that the concerned chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) will take a call on the supply of footage when the matter is taken up next on January 5.The magistrate asked the police to preserve the video footage under the seal of the court and place it before the CMM court.On August 22, the Karkardooma court had passed a direction to look into the allegation leveled by a complainant Irshad Ali, mentioned in a police report where he had claimed that he was asked to depose falsely by advocate Pracha. Ali also told police on August 12 that he had falsely named three persons --- Navneet, Deepak and Mintu.Following this, an FIR was registered by the special cell against unknown persons. In connection to this, a raid was carried out at the office of Pracha on December 24, which according to the lawyer went on for 15 hours.On Sunday, the police moved its application under Section 310 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which allows a judge to inspect any place in which an offence is alleged to be have been committed for appreciating the evidences.The police also told the court that they have stumbled upon the particular e-mail, which was sent by the lawyer’s office to several senior police officers in the name of one Sharif Malik about a riots case even though Malik denied having sent any email to authorities. Pracha, on his part, has alleged overtures by the special cell officials under the guise of the warrant to search his official premises, and transgressing the attorney client privilege by taking away data from his computers.Meanwhile, the Bar Council of Delhi has also written to the union home minister, complaining against the manner in which Pracha’s office was raided and apprehended breach of the privileged communications between Pracha and his clients.The bar council has said that in this case they are not going into the depth of facts-related information, but the 15-hour search conducted by the police inside the lawyer’s office is against the understanding between the representatives of the bar association/bar council and the Delhi police that in case of any case against an advocate, the bar body will be informed and taken into confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-urge-trial-judge-to-inspect-pracha-s-office/story-eRDPeDhIWTBd6bONdgpo0H.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal visits Singhu, challenges Centre to debate farm laws||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday challenged the Central government and its ministers to take part in an open debate on the three controversial farm laws with the protesting farmers in the city. On Sunday evening, Kejriwal visited Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial near Singhu border where farmers have been protesting against the farm laws for over a month. To show solidarity with the agitators, the Delhi government organised a Kirtan Darbaar - ‘Safar-e-Shahadat’ - at the memorial to honour the martyrdom of the Chaar Sahibzaade and Mata Gujri Kaur. Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia attended this event, where the chief minister addressed the farmers.“The government is saying the farmers are being misled. They have little understanding about the farm laws. I have heard all speeches and hence, the government should send its most knowledgeable minister or representative to take part in an open debate with the farmers. It will be clear who has a better understanding. It will be clear how dangerous these new farm laws are,” Kejriwal said. Also Read | ‘Urging Centre with folded hands farmers are our people,’ says Kejriwal as he visits SinghuHe said the farmers have been braving the cold for the last one month to protest along Delhi’s borders, during which more than 40 people have lost their lives. “I want to appeal to the Central government with folded hands to repeal these farm laws. These are our people, our brothers, sisters, mothers and elders. These are the people of our nation, listen to them, and end their struggle here. How many lives will you take,” he said. The AAP chief said the Central government has fielded all their big leaders, ministers, and chief ministers of all states. “I heard all their speeches and I have not heard even a single leader talking about how these farm laws will benefit the farmers. As far as the benefits of these farm laws counted by these leaders, the first they say is that the land will not be taken away from the farmers. Is this a benefit? The MSP and the mandis of the farmers will not be revoked, is this a benefit? Why have you brought the bills then? Instead of telling the benefits, they are justifying that these bills are not harmful to the farmers. Who will benefit then if not farmers?” he asked. “The only benefit they tell us is that the farmers will be able to sell their produce anywhere in the country outside of the mandis. If the crop is being sold at Rs 800 per quintal in Bihar where there are no mandis, and the MSP is Rs 1850 per quintal then where do our farmers from Bihar and UP sell their produce for more than Rs 1850? They cannot even get 50% of the price outside of the mandis. This is not a benefit to the farmers but to the big companies and the rich,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-visits-singhu-challenges-centre-to-debate-farm-laws/story-mFfFKUJLVbQCM2rb1VRUPL.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||Rise in FIRs under drugs law, drop in seizures: Delhi Police data||The Delhi Police registered more FIRs under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances(NDPS) Act in 2020, even as the overall seizure of most drugs dipped significantly this year compared to 2019, spokespersons of the law enforcement agency said on Sunday. Against 712 FIRs under the NDPS Act showed through all of 2019, this year police filed 726 such cases until December 15. Compared to 909 arrests last year (till December 31), this year the police arrested 882 persons until mid-December.Meanwhile, the police seized 7,859kg of drugs in 2019, compared to 5,207kg till December 15 this year.“The seizure this year was lesser than last year because of our efforts to curb the sale and use of the drugs as well as the lockdown that disrupted the traffickers’ movement,” said Rakesh Paweriya, deputy commissioner of police (narcotics cell).Police said they also analysed the cases to identify where the drugs were being brought into the national capital from. “Marijuana, for instance, is mainly procured from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam. It is also being smuggled in from Nepal and by courier services from the USA,” said Anil Mittal, Delhi Police spokesperson.Heroin is smuggled in mainly from Bareilly and Badaun in Uttar Pradesh, Myanmar via Manipur and Bareilly and Amritsar through Afghanistan and Pakistan. “Cocaine is trafficked from west African/South American countries and also locally manufactured by Nigerians,” Mittal said.Police said they have also identified places in the city that are “hot spots for drug trafficking.” The hot spots were identified based on the cases and people arrested in those places. Police said some places they identified were Sultanpuri, Jahangirpuri, Inderpuri, Sagarpur, Uttam Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, Nand Nagri, Dwarka, Chhatarpur, Nizamuddin, Majnu ka Tilla and Paharganj, among others, said the officer.Police said they have identified three men as Delhi’s top drug smugglers, all of whom, according to the police’s list, are alleged heroin dealers — Sharafat Sheikh with 85 cases behind him, Pawan with 38 and Sunil Sansi with 36, the police said.“We are using the NDPS Act to go after the assets of the drug traffickers acquired from this illegal business,” said Paweriya about one of the efforts by the police to control drug trade.Barring opium, the seizure of which went up from two kilos to over 29kg, the recovery of other drugs was less this year. The recovery of marijuana dipped from 5,447kg to 4,378kg and heroin from 663kg to 88kg, police data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rise-in-firs-under-drugs-law-drop-in-seizures-delhi-police-data/story-022c3bpIeEGztwhGC69pxL.html

Police said the fight was the result of an old enmity. During the clash, more people from the area joined the two groups giving it a shape of mob violence. Though Trilokpuri has a history of communal clashes, police said that Saturday incident did not have a communal angle. Police said one man, Shahid, 40, was killed in the firing, while another named Faizan, sustained bullet injury to his thigh. The clash happened around 10 pm on Saturday. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said police teams conducted raids overnight and arrested two men for the murder -- Mannan, 35, who was leading one of the groups and his aide Salman, 30. “Both of them have been arrested and booked for murder and under sections of Arms Act for illegal possession and use of firearms,” Singh said. The DCP said, while Mannan has 5-6 criminal cases registered against him — such as those of assault and rioting — they are verifying if Salman has a criminal record. According to the police, after recording statements of the witnesses and local residents, it has been established that the violence on Saturday had been triggered by an old enmity. A senior police officer said, “Mannan and his family members run a meat shop near Trilokpuri bus stand. Mannan’s elder brother Asif and Shahid are neighbours and have fought previously also, over petty issues. On Saturday, following some argument, Shahid and his friends thrashed one of Mannan’s aide, identified as Kasim. When Kasim complained to Mannan, he called Shahid. Shahid and his men allegedly then vandalized Mannan’s motorcycle, after which more people joined the two men and the fight snowballed into mob violence,” the officer said. Police said Mannan’s brother Asif is absconding and search for him is underway. DCP Singh said the violence was not communal in nature. “No such incident was reported from the area on Sunday. Adequate staff from our area police station is deployed in the vicinity to maintain law and order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-for-trilokpuri-clash-cops-say-no-communal-angle/story-waBeybdoSqObntjpCzk4yJ.html
28-12-2020||Delhi||AAP leaders gherao MCD mayors over Rs 2,500 crore scam||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillors and hundreds of volunteers held a “gherao strike” at the homes of the three mayors of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations on Sunday to highlight an alleged Rs 2,500 crore scam of the civic bodies .The protest was led by leaders of opposition in the north, south, and east municipalities. Senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the BJP leaders, as well as the mayors of the three MCDs, are equally responsible for illegal waiving off Rs 2,500 crore, which the south corporation owes to the north civic body for using its office space in the Civic Centre building. “The BJP has been in power in the MCD for the last 15 years. In these 15 years, the BJP did not do anything other than corruption. The people of Delhi handed over the MCD to the BJP for the responsibility of cleaning Delhi, which is one of the most important tasks of the MCD, along with hundreds of other responsibilities that come under their ambit. But you go to any street in Delhi today, there are heaps of garbage everywhere. The drains are full of dirt,” he said.AAP leader Atishi said the accounts of south corporation for the last many years clearly state that Rs 2,500 crore was payable as rent for the SDMC office at Civic Centre, which is owned by the north corporation. “But in this year’s budget, the rent payable is shown as 0. The question that now arises is where did the Rs 2,500 crore go? Where has this money been appropriated? Which north MCD BJP leader and south MCD BJP leader received money to turn these Rs 2,500 crores into 0,” she said. The BJP rubbished the allegations and said there was no corruption or manipulation in settling of dues between two government bodies as reportedly done by north and south Delhi municipal corporations. BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “There has been no misappropriation of funds. The south MCD owes the rent to north MCD since 2012 when the trifurcation of the MCDs happened. In the current budget of the MCDs, there is also a provision for waiver on rent payment that is due, but that is awaiting approval of the House. The Delhi government can get it probed by any agency.”Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “ I waited at my residence at Timarpur with details of Rs 13,000 crore dues of municipal corporations in the Delhi government. But nobody came to gherao or seek details .”He also said that the AAP should prove the alleged scam of Rs 2500 crore or the chief minister should resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-leaders-gherao-mcd-mayors-over-rs-2-500-crore-scam/story-8oVGSTrID0s9T3HdvM4X9K.html
28-12-2020||City||Congress misleading farmers on new agriculture laws: Rajnath Singh||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday charged Congress with having misguided the farmers on the Centre’s three agriculture laws, which he said would provide farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere and boost their income.He was virtually addressing a function held by Himachal Pradesh government to mark the third anniversary of its rule in the state.“Unfortunately, some people who don’t know the basics of farming are misleading the farmers. However, I believe that as the farmers will understand these laws, their doubts will get cleared,” said Singh.He said there was propaganda that these laws would abolish the minimum support price (MSP) system. “The truth is contrary. In fact, the PM Modi-led government has adopted the Swaminathan Commission formula for fixing MSP and this year MSP of six rabi crops was announced as per this formula. Resultantly, there was a 1.5 to 2% increase in the MSP of these crops,” he claimed adding that the mandi system will also remain intact.“Nobody can snatch farmer’s land,” he said, appealing to the farmers to let the new laws be implemented for one or two years and that the government would be ready to rework them if not found beneficial.Congratulating the Himachal Pradesh government and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for completing three years, Singh said it was a proud moment for people of the hill-state as well.“Modi government is committed to eliminate poverty and has launched various schemes to achieve the goal. It is for the first time that the country’s budget has been prepared keeping the poor in focus,” Singh said.The minister added that the three-year rule of BJP has written a new chapter of development in the history of Himachal and brought sea changes in the lives of people through welfare schemes.He also mentioned the increased central assistant to Himachal Pradesh and lauded the state government for its achievement under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY).Singh said that the Atal Tunnel in Rohtang, inaugurated by PM Modi in October, has ensured easier deployment of troops and all-whether connectivity to tribal Lahaul-Spiti district. He also listed various public welfare schemes launched by the Centre and state.The Union minister said Himachal is a tourism state and its home-stay model should be replicated in the country.Gift of bulk drug park from Centre soon: Anurag Thakur In his virtual address on the occasion, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur congratulated the state government for its achievements. He lauded the chief minister for schemes like Him Care and Grihni Suvidha Yojna. He said the Global Investors’ Meet was a big achievement as MoUs worth ₹96,000 crores were signed last year.Thakur said Himachal may soon get a big gift from the Centre in the form of a bulk drug park.He expressed hope that the BJP would form the government again in the 2022 elections.Meanwhile, BJP national president JP Nadda in his message (read out by state BJP general secretary Trilok Jamwal) said the state has achieved new heights on development front under chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s leadership. He also appreciated the CM and his government for the battle against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-misleading-farmers-on-new-agri-laws-rajnath-singh/story-zTXgt0AsPS7f5AHNHBiZ5J.html

28-12-2020||Pune||Students go back home to villages as poll candidates||For Akash Dounde, a final-year student of mass communication from the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), it is a matter of pride to contest the gram panchayat elections in his village. “I am contesting the upcoming gram panchayat elections from our village Somthane Nalawade in Ahmednagar district. I am working for student issues during my college time and have fought for constitutional rights of students every time in the university,” said 27-year-old Dounde. Just like Dounde, there are other students from the SPPU, who are contesting the panchayat elections for the first time. Some of them boast got huge support in their villages, and expect to win the election “bin virodh” (without opposition). Talking about his election plans, Dounde further said, “While I was studying mass communication I worked for several corporate and political research firms. Then I decided to work in the rural areas. We are not succeeding in providing clean drinking water and a hygienic livelihood in the rural areas. Gender inequality, increasing illiteracy rate, unemployment and farmer suicides disturbs me allot. I live in a village where not even a printed newspaper has reached yet. Around 30 per cent of the population in our village has migrated to city for employment. Generating employment within the village, gender equality and a hygienic livelihood are my priorities. Highly literate people shouldn’t avoid politics, as it is a way to serve society.”Another student from the SPPU, 21-year-old Ruturaj Gaikwad, has completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and is from Ghatane village in Solapur district. He is also contesting the gram panchayat elections. “In our democracy the gram sabha is supreme in power and then comes the state assembly and then parliament. Gandhiji used to say if you want to change the face of nation then you must make sustainable changes in your villages. Taking inspiration from there I decided to contest the election and made our own panel in the village with all youngsters on it. Three major things we are focusing on – social, financial and environmental development of our village. We have already started work on solar power regeneration in our village through which each house will get 1KW of electricity. Apart from that, skill development projects for students, digital school, ATM machines, health card system, and a special mobile application for the village to give details of all the benefits and solid waste management are the plans we will be working on once our panel gets elected,” said Ruturaj. Another student of SPPU contesting the elections is Devidas Aarde from Chandgaon village in Indapur taluka, Pune district. Talking about his election plans, Aarde said, “Since childhood I have seen that there were no basic facilities available to villagers and we used to struggle daily for our livelihood. Now the time has come for youth to go beyond political parties and take management of our villages in our hand. So I decided to contest our gram panchayat elections. We like-minded youth in our village came together and made a panel, and now we are contesting to win. Once our panel is elected we will try to bring all the state and central government projects and benefits to each and every house in our village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sons-of-the-soil-why-sppu-students-going-back-to-villages-to-contest-panchayat-elections/story-pcMj9D6fXDS79TSrxXDZ0J.html

Schools have virtual tours however, not many parents have taken admission to the nursery due to the pandemic. Schools said that many are adopting a waiting and watch attitude.Milind Ladge from Aryan World School said that not many parents are keen to take admissions ahead of a new virus strain found in the United Kingdom.“There is a fear among many parents. So they enquire, but that does not translate into admissions. Many parents attended online activities, but for nursery classes they want to wait for another year before taking admissions. For Class 1 and Class 2, parents are keen,” said Ladge.He further added due to fewer admissions and no payment of fees, preschools are struggling.Jayshree Venkatraman, principal, SNBP international school, Rahatani, said that some parents are very keen for classes to start.“We have some parents visit the schools to see the premises with their children. It is great to see that parents want children to join school. There are many parents who have taken admission with the intention that the schools will reopen soon, but they don’t want to miss out on the online classes,” said Venkatraman.She further added that the schools are preparing for safety measures and until the education department gives a nod, there will no offline classes for nursery.“We are taking all precautions and measures to ensure safety. We think that children should know how to be safe outdoors, post the pandemic as well. We are teaching social distancing, the importance of masks and hand hygiene to young children through online classes as well. This will prepare them for offline classes,” said Venkatraman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-rush-for-nursery-admissions-as-covid-fears-linger-pre-schools-report/story-563jNd9kkcyyCSiDfd0zNJ.html

28-12-2020||Pune||Assess COEP Jumbo facility, and close down if not needed: Ajit Pawar||Four months since inauguration and with a cost of nearly Rs 80 crore till date, the makeshift, dedicated Covid-19 Jumbo care facility at the COEP is now being assessed in terms of requirement.Given the falling number of Covid-19 cases in the district, closing down the Jumbo centre may be a choice the administration will have to make.At a meeting held on Saturday, chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pawar opined that the administration must study the requirement and if not needed, then the facility could be temporarily closed. On August 27, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the jumbo facility, virtually. Although the facility was built with a capacity of 800 beds, it operated only 600 beds and was to be upgraded to full capacity in October. However, with the number of cases dropping in November, the administration put a brake on the upgrade of the facility. The facility also came under fire during its initial months of operation due to a high death rate and also, a large number of Covid-19 patients opting for discharge against medical advice (Dama) due to poor conditions at the facility. During the meeting Pawar instructed the administration to review the requirement and also take into consideration the ongoing protests by workers at the facility. The Med Bros agency currently runs the facility. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, who attended the meeting, said, “The deputy CM has instructed us to assess the situation - whether we need the facility or not, as the number of cases is going down drastically. Currently, we have about 150 patients still admitted to the facility, which also includes patients from rural Pune. We do not have any immediate plans to shift the patients out and we have not yet made any decisions on whether to admit new patients or not. This decision will be taken by the commissioner and the divisional commissioner.”The facility currently has 432 beds vacant, which means there are 168 patients admitted on oxygen beds or ICU beds with and without ventilators. The facility has 435 oxygen beds, 135 ICU beds without ventilator, and 30 ventilators. The staff working at the facility has been protesting delayed salaries and salary cuts. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who heads the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “The jumbo facility came at a time when the city had seen six months of the pandemic and then it never operated to its full capacity. It is a makeshift facility which will be brought down once the pandemic ends. Where will the ventilators and ICU beds go after that? PMC’s very own Naidu hospital, which is the state’s only infection control hospital, quite efficiently handled the swine flu pandemic and does not have an ICU unit. This money invested in the Jumbo facility could have been invested into upgrading PMC’s hospitals which would have helped in the long run even after the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assess-coep-jumbo-facility-and-close-down-if-not-needed-ajit-pawar/story-zxIlHQS35aNiofrudnNS8N.html

The ATM unit itself is valued at Rs 2.50 lakh.Police inspector Umesh Tavaskar said, “There was no security guard stationed at the ATM. It is the responsibility of the bank to have a proper security mechanism inside the ATM. The ATM was entrenched into the ground hardly one-and-a-half inch, which made it easy for the thieves to decamp with the machine.” According to police, the thieves used a four-wheeler to transport the ATM unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thieves-steal-atm-unit-in-shirur/story-vTOdkVzAT1lUt8DIIGkjTK.html
28-12-2020||Pune||Stage is a banyan tree: Bori’s play to create cultural hub for Pune||The construction work of an open-air theatre at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (Bori) in Pune is in its last phase. The speciality of this open-air theatre, is that an 83-year-old banyan tree will be at its centre. In 1937, this tree was planted by Vaijnath Kashinath Rajwade, the then executive chairman of the institute. Just like the work of the institute, the tree has grown and expanded over the years. Approximately two years ago, the construction of the open-air theatre around this iconic tree started and now it is to be completed. The institute hoped this theatre, which will be able to accommodate 2,000 people, will be a cultural centre in Pune and also a revenue source. Nachiket Patwardhan, a senior architect, has designed the theatre, which is expected to be inaugurated by March 2021. “That such a theatre can be constructed was the idea of Abhay Firodia. The funds required to construct the theatre are provided by the Firodia Trust. It will be a one-of-its kind theatres, as its ‘stage’ will be a tree. This tree was planted by Vaijnath Kashinath Rajwade brother of Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade, a famous historian, in 1937. The idea was inspired by the open-air theatres at Shantiniketan. We aim for it to be a cultural centre in Pune,” said Bhupal Patwardhan, executive chairman, Bori.The institute hopes it would be a revenue source for research projects. “We do not get any help from the government. We hope to get a source of funds for our research projects from this theatre. The historic banyan tree is so big, that it covers almost the entire area of the theatre,” said Bhupal Patwardhan.Nachiket Patwardhan said, “The design consists of two overlapping circles, 70M and 52M in diameter; the common area of both circles is the stage (around the banyan tree). The 50M wide stage is large enough to provide four different performance spaces for 35, 250, 400 and 800 people. The budget is substantial but I’ve focused solely on design and execution without the burden and responsibility of any budget making and control.” When asked about his inspiration behind the design, he said, “Inspiration was the tree and the frustration of seeing such amazing spaces destroyed by FSI hungry buildings.”The green rooms, washrooms and stores are yet to be built, but work is expected to be over soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-theatre-is-a-banyan-tree-bori-s-play-to-create-cultural-hub-for-pune/story-9IdnlaI8kLI2ZN24v1WsUN.html
28-12-2020||World||Mexican president plays joke on media, bluffs over ending press conferences||Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday played a trick on the media, pretending he was going to end the daily news conferences that he has used to pillory critics and dominate the national news cycle.Taking advantage of Dec. 28, Day of the Holy Innocents, a celebration associated with practical jokes in Mexico, Lopez Obrador opened his news briefing by saying he would in future hold only one conference a week, at midday on Wednesdays.Adopting a line in stark contrast to what he often argues, Lopez Obrador said with a straight face he had made the decision because the quality of public information was improving.“The majority of the news media in the country are carrying out their duty professionally, there is accurate, real news, the media are objective,” he said.However, around 40 minutes later he returned to a familiar refrain, referring to “conservative” media as “hypocrites” - then noted with a smile that he would, in fact, continue to hold his morning news conferences as his right to reply.“Do you really think we’re not going to have the morning conferences? All the subsidized conservative press would be rubbing its hands,” he said, adding that most of the traditional print and broadcast media in the country were against him.On social media, skepticism had greeted the president’s announcement that he was serious about ending the conferences.Before he admitted it was a joke, many of Mexico’s main newspapers did not carry a story on the front of their websites about what would have been a major change in policy.Since taking office two years ago, Lopez Obrador has used the conferences, which begin at 7 a.m. and can last over two hours, to set the political agenda and take critics to task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-plays-joke-on-media-bluffs-over-ending-press-conferences/story-BsVLK5ewqSKXLo4FAh5xoI.html
28-12-2020||World||Millions of Americans may not receive financial aid for 2020’s final week. Here’s why||US President Donald Trump on Sunday reluctantly signed a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government funding bill, averting the possibility of a weeks-long government shutdown at the last minute. The latest Covid-19 stimulus package has ensured that an estimated 12 million people under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs will now receive payments for another 11 weeks. Additionally, US nationals receiving jobless payments will get a $300 weekly boost from the federal government through mid-March. However, the delay in signing the bill means millions of Americans getting financial aid in two key pandemic unemployment programs may not receive a payment for the final week of the year. According to a CNN report, the payments could also be delayed for several weeks since state agencies have to reprogram their computers. Also, the states won’t be able to provide financial assistance for the weeks that started before programs were authorised through the Covid-19 relief bill.Also Read | Donald Trump ends days of drama, signs pandemic relief bill into lawIn a statement released by the White House, Trump said that he was signing the bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, and add substantially more money for vaccine distribution.“As President of the United States it is my responsibility to protect the people of our country from the economic devastation and hardship that was caused by the China Virus,” the statement read.The outgoing US president said that he signed the bill only after securing a commitment from the lawmakers to consider legislation to increase payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Trump also claimed that Congress has promised to review Section 230 and either terminate or substantially reform it.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is considered extremely vital for social media networks since the firm cannot be held accountable for the millions of content posted by users. Trump added that the House and the Senate have agreed to focus strongly on the “very substantial voter fraud” in the recently concluded presidential elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-may-not-receive-financial-aid-for-2020-s-final-week-here-s-why/story-h6WEy1drl94dFrjhINHcYJ.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump ends days of drama, signs pandemic relief bill into law||US President Donald Trump finally relented on Sunday, signing into law a bill that will provide $900 billion in Covid-19 relief for American families and business, and $1.4 trillion to keep the federal government funded until September.Trump reversed his position as inexplicably as he had announced his objections to the bill’s terms earlier last week.The spending legislation had been negotiated by his administration and passed with wide majorities in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and Republican-led Senate.Trump conveyed his decision in a statement on Sunday evening, a day after jobless benefits for an estimated 14 million Americans expired because of delay to the bill being taken up by the US president. The stimulus package will include $600 in direct payment to every qualifying American, assistance for small businesses, and funds for the states for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.“I am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP (Paycheck Protection Programme — assistance to companies to keep employees on their rolls), return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more,” Trump said in the statement.The outgoing president went on to list concessions he had claimed to obtain for signing the bill. He said, for instance, the House will vote to increase direct payments from $600 to $2,000 as he had been demanding. The House is expected to pass a measure to that effect on Monday, but the Senate is unlikely to clear it.Trump also said he will be sending a “redlined” version of the bill for the removal of wasteful expenditure. But there was no enthusiasm for it among lawmakers. He further claimed that congress will “review” a law that protects social media platforms from liability for their content, and also, there will be “focus” on voter fraud. Neither of these claims is expected to be met.The US president won no real concessions by delaying his nod to a bill that was negotiated and crafted by officials of his own administration, led by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, and was passed with overwhelming support by both chambers of congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ends-days-of-drama-signs-pandemic-relief-bill-into-law/story-g6v0IftQOqppt0vtXYSpyK.html
28-12-2020||World||Bangladesh sends second group of Rohingya refugees to isolated island||Officials in Bangladesh sent a second group of Rohingya refugees to an isolated island in the Bay of Bengal on Monday despite calls by human rights groups for a halt to the process.More than 30 buses carrying about 1,500 refugees left their camps in Cox’s Bazar district on the way to the island, a government official involved with the process said.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the refugees will stay overnight in a temporary shelter in the southeastern city of Chattogram and are expected to reach Bhasan Char island on naval vessels on Tuesday at noon.The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees left Cox’s Bazar voluntarily under government management.Authorities say the refugees were selected for relocation based on their willingness, and that no pressure was applied on them. But several human rights and activist groups say some refugees have been forced to go to the island, located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland.The island surfaced only 20 years ago and was not previously inhabited. It was regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.The island’s facilities are designed to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district.Authorities sent a first group of 1,642 Rohingya to the island on Dec. 4 despite calls for a halt by human rights groups.International aid agencies and the UN have opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The United Nations also voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have urged the government to cancel the plan.An influential Cabinet minister and general secretary of the governing party, Obaidul Quader, said Monday that the international community is opposing the relocation illogically.Quader said in a news conference that the Rohingya are being moved to the island because their repatriation to Myanmar has been delayed.He said refugees who were earlier taken to Bhashan Char have expressed satisfaction. “But some international organizations and media are saying the Rohingya were forcibly shifted, which is not true,” Quader said.About 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after August 2017, when Myanmar’s military began a harsh crackdown on the minority group following an attack by insurgents. Security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and burning thousands of homes.Bangladesh has attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral agreement, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other state-sanctioned discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-sends-second-group-of-rohingya-refugees-to-isolated-island/story-HxiRs6BADBEf3wpeVe6yvJ.html

28-12-2020||World||‘Considerable degree of divisiveness’ slowed down US Covid-19 response: Anthony Fauci||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Monday a “considerable degree of divisiveness” in the country played a role in slowing down the response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases highlighted the politicisation of Covid-19 measures, such as wearing face masks and following social distancing norms.“Unfortunately, this year, I think it’s no secret to anyone following what’s going on that there is a considerable degree of divisiveness in this country,” Fauci told BBC Radio 4 in a programme aired on Monday.During the initial days of the coronavirus outbreak, US President Donald Trump was reluctant to wear a mask and held events where attendees were seen flouting social distancing measures. In April, Trump called people protesting against their governors’ social distancing measures as “great people”. Fauci had then stated that the virus has nothing to do with the economics, adding that it is important to get it under control before the gradual reopening of businesses.“What we see is somewhat of a politicisation, where...things like the wearing of masks become a political statement, where...keeping away from crowds becomes a political statement, that has made it very problematic as we’ve dealt with this unprecedented and historic outbreak,” he said.Also Read | Dr Anthony Fauci says worst of Covid-19 pandemic still to comeThe 80-year-old immunologist pointed out that the disparity among states over the measures has also been a major weakness in the Covid-19 response. He said that pandemic doesn’t know the difference between state borders and a degree of consistency is required in the government’s response.“There have been a lot of factors that have led to the fact that unfortunately for us, the United States has been the hardest-hit country in the world, but I believe that disparity among how states do things has been a major weakness in our response,” he added.According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre tally, the United States has reported over 19 million Covid-19 cases and more than 333,000 related deaths so far. While the US has rolled out two vaccines to provide immunity against the infection, the current projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) suggest that around 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/considerable-degree-of-divisiveness-slowed-down-us-covid-19-response-anthony-fauci/story-JuGmxcmTKFH2qvSATlgjVP.html
28-12-2020||World||Russia to test new Covid-19 antibody drug from new year||Russia will begin trials of an antibody treatment for Covid-19 patients next year, the head of the Moscow institute that developed the country’s first vaccine against the new disease, Sputnik V, said on Monday.Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, was cited by the RIA news agency as saying that he hoped trials for the new antibody-based drug would begin in the autumn of 2021.“I hope clinical trials will begin in autumn,” he said. “We need to develop this drug using several technologies at the same time, which is something that is being done right now.”Russia has been asking Covid-19 patients to donate blood plasma, which is rich in antibodies, for research.Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump was treated with an experimental antibody cocktail for Covid-19 produced by drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Antibodies are proteins made by the body’s immune system that latch on to and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron’s cocktail contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from Covid-19.Gamaleya’s Gintsburg said on Sunday that the new Russian drug would be made up of “monoclonal antibodies”, genetically engineered versions of the antibodies that are found in the blood plasma of those who have been sick with Covid-19, the TASS news agency reported.Russia last week stopped taking in new volunteers for its main human trial of Sputnik V, with developers saying it was unethical to administer a placebo to participants now that the shot was increasingly available to the public.Russia began inoculating small numbers of people in high-risk groups soon after it granted regulatory approval to the vaccine in August. It launched its large-scale, final-stage trial in Moscow the following month.The rollout ramped up this month and more than 200,000 Russians have now received the shot.Since the start of the pandemic, Russia has recorded more than 3 million infections and 55,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-test-new-covid-19-antibody-drug-from-new-year/story-Uuw47SYtH1LeKdMc58u5GK.html
28-12-2020||World||British hospitals scramble for space as virus cases soar||British hospitals are cancelling non-urgent procedures and scrambling to find space for Covid-19 patients as coronavirus cases continue to surge despite tough new restrictions imposed to curb a fast-spreading new variant of the virus.Dr. Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said Monday that the rising number of hospitalized patients was “extremely worrying.”“With the numbers approaching the peaks from April, systems will again be stretched to the limit,” he said.British authorities are blaming a new variant of the coronavirus for soaring infection rates in London and southeast England. They say the new version is more easily transmitted than the original, but stress there is no evidence it makes people sicker.In response, authorities have put a swath of England that’s home to 24 million people under restrictions that require non-essential shops to close, bar indoor socializing and allow restaurants and pubs only to operate for takeout.Even so, hospital admissions for Covid-19 in southeast England are approaching or exceeding the levels seen at the first peak of the outbreak. Government figures show 21,286 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus across the UK on Dec. 22, the last day for which data is available. That is only slightly below the high of 21,683 Covid-19 patients who were recorded in UK hospitals on April 12.Dr. Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, described her experience working in a hospital on Christmas Day as “wall-to-wall Covid.”“The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost,” Henderson told the BBC. “The cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going.”Britain has already recorded more than 70,000 deaths among people with the coronavirus, one of the highest tolls in Europe.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said more parts of England might have to be put into the toughest tier of restrictions if case numbers do not fall. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have implemented strong lockdown measures.Still, there is rising confidence help could soon be on the way, with expectation mounting that UK regulators may authorize a second coronavirus vaccine this week.British media reports say the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is likely to give the green light to a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.The regulator authorized a jab made by US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German firm BioNTech on Dec. 2, making Britain the first country to gain access to a rigorously tested vaccine. More than 600,000 people in the UK have received the first of the two shots needed of the vaccine.If the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is authorized this week, members of the public could start receiving it from Jan. 4. Britain has ordered 100 million doses, compared to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is considered a potential game-changer in global immunization efforts because it is less expensive than the Pfizer shot and does not need to be stored at freezer temperatures, making it easier to distribute.But it had less clear-cut results from clinical trials than its main rivals. Partial results suggest that the shot is about 70% effective for preventing illness from coronavirus infection, compared to the 95% efficacy reported for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.But the trials produced two different results based on the dosing regimen used. Researchers said the vaccine protected against disease in 62% of those given two full doses and in 90% of those given a half dose followed by a full dose. However, the second group included only 2,741 people — too few to be conclusive.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told the Sunday Times newspaper that he was confident the vaccine would work against the new strain and would prove as effective as its rivals.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” Soriot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-hospitals-scramble-for-space-as-virus-cases-soar/story-5OGsl4GPmhekofpCvdBuDK.html
28-12-2020||World||EU nations unanimously back post-Brexit trade deal with UK||European Union (EU) nations have unanimously approve the post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom, a prerequisite for the agreement to come into operation on New Year’s Day.Germany, which holds the EU presidency, said the decision came during a meeting of EU ambassadors to assess the Christmas Eve agreement.“Green light,” said Germany’s spokesman Sebastian Fischer. “Ambassadors have unanimously approved the provisional application of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement as of January 1, 2021.”The approval had been expected ever since the deal was announced and all EU leaders warmly welcomed it. It still needs approval from the EU’s legislature, which is expected to come in February. The UK’s House of Commons is expected to approve it on Wednesday.Four days after sealing a free trade agreement with the European Union, the British government warned businesses to get ready for disruptions and “bumpy moments” when the new rules take effect on Thursday night.Businesses were scrambling Monday to digest the details and implications of the 1,240-page deal sealed by the EU and the UK on Christmas Eve.The UK left the EU almost a year ago, but remained within the bloc’s economic embrace during a transition period that ends at midnight Brussels time -- 11 p.m. in London -- on Dec. 31.The agreement, hammered out after nine months of tense negotiations, will ensure Britain and the 27-nation bloc can continue to trade in goods without tariffs or quotas. That should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.But the end to Britain’s membership in the EU’s vast single market and customs union will still bring inconvenience and new expenses for both individuals and businesses — from the need for tourists to have travel insurance to the millions of new customs declarations that firms will have to fill out.“Businesses will need to make sure that they’re ready for new customs procedures and we as individuals will need to make sure that our passports are up to date because they need to have at least six months before expiry on them in order to be able to travel abroad,” said Michael Gove, the British Cabinet minister in charge of Brexit preparations.“I’m sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path,” he told the BBC.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government argues that any short-term disruption from Brexit will be worth it, because the UK will now be free to set its own rules and strike new trade deals around the world.Yet an ominous preview of what could happen if UK-EU trade faces heavy restrictions came this month when France briefly closed its border with Britain because of a highly transmissible new variant of the coronavirus sweeping through London and southern England. Thousands of trucks were stuck in traffic jams or parked at a disused airfield near the English Channel port of Dover for days and supermarkets warned that some goods, including fresh produce would soon run short.Even after France relented and agreed to let in truckers who tested negative for the virus, the backlog of 15,000 drivers who now needed tests took days to clear.Both the British and European parliaments still need to vote on the Brexit trade deal. Britain’s Parliament is set to deliver its verdict on Dec. 30, but the EU legislature will not make a decision until after Jan. 1. Ambassadors from the 27 EU nations will meet Monday to determine how they can provisionally approve the deal by the end of the year.David McAllister, an EU lawmaker from Germany, said the European Parliament vote would take place in February. He signalled it was likely to be approved, calling it a “comprehensive, fair agreement” that protected the bloc’s single market.Lawmakers in Britain are also highly likely to approve the deal.Hardline pro-Brexit legislators in Johnson’s Conservative Party are poring over the agreement to see whether it meets their goal of a decisive break from the bloc. The main opposition Labour Party says the deal will hurt Britain’s economy but it will back it anyway because it is better than a chaotic no-deal split on Jan. 1.Despite the deal, uncertainty hangs over huge chunks of the relationship between Britain and the EU. The agreement covers trade in goods, but leaves the UK’s huge financial services sector in limbo, still uncertain how easily it can do business with the bloc after Jan. 1. The British territory of Gibraltar, which sees thousands of workers cross over daily from Spain, is also in limbo since it was not included in the deal.And Brexit deal has angered one of the sectors the government stressed it would protect: fishing. The economically minor but hugely symbolic issue of fishing rights was a sticking point in negotiations, with maritime EU nations seeking to retain access to UK waters, and Britain insisting it must control its seas.Under the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in UK waters, far less than the 80% that Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.“I am angry, disappointed and betrayed,” said Andrew Locker, chairman of Britain’s National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations. “Boris Johnson promised us the rights to all the fish that swim in our exclusive economic zone and we have got a fraction of that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-unanimously-back-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk/story-75rQljSseQMP06sPwCVohN.html
28-12-2020||World||Pope formally strips Vatican secretariat of state of assets||Pope Francis has formally stripped the Vatican secretariat of state of its financial assets and real estate holdings following its bungled management of hundreds of millions of euros in donations and investments that are now the subject of a corruption investigation.Francis signed a new law over the weekend ordering the secretariat of state to complete the transfer of all its holdings to another Vatican office by Feb. 4. The law also calls for all donations to the pope — the Peter’s Pence collections from the faithful as well as other donations that had been managed by the secretariat of state — to be held and managed by the Vatican’s treasury office as separate funds that are accounted for in the Holy See’s consolidated budget.The changes are a response to a spiraling Vatican criminal investigation into years-long allegations of mismanagement of donations and investments by the Vatican’s secretariat of state which has resulted in losses of tens of millions of euros at a time of financial crisis for the Holy See.Francis had already ordered the transfers in August and followed up in November by appointing a commission to put the changes into effect. The new law makes the changes permanent and sets a firm date for their execution.Francis said he was making the changes to improve the administration, control and vigilance over the Holy See’s assets and ensure a more “transparent and efficient management.”Francis moved against his own secretariat of state amid an 18-month investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the office’s 350-million-euro investment into a luxury residential building in London’s Chelsea neighborhood and other speculative funds.Prosecutors have accused several officials in the department of abusing their authority for their involvement in the deal, as well several Italian middlemen of allegedly fleecing the Vatican of tens of millions of euros in fees.The scandal has exposed the incompetence of the Vatican’s monsignors in managing money, since they signed away voting shares in the deal and agreed to pay exorbitant fees to Italians who were known in business circles for their shady dealings.Francis’ decision has been an embarrassing blow to the secretariat of state’s standing as the most powerful Holy See office, reducing it to essentially any other department that must propose a budget and have it approved and monitored by others.The outcome is essentially what was sought years ago by Cardinal George Pell, Francis’ first economy minister who clashed with the secretariat of state over his financial reforms and efforts to wrest control of the department’s off-the-books funds.Pell had to abandon those reform efforts in 2017 to face trial for sexual abuse in his native Australia, but he was acquitted and recently told The Associated Press he felt vindicated that the wrongdoing he tried to uncover was being exposed.The Holy See is facing a major cash crunch as its main source of revenue, ticket sales from the Vatican Museums, evaporated this year due to coronavirus closures. The Holy See last year narrowed its budget deficit from 75 million euros to 11 million euros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-formally-strips-vatican-secretariat-of-state-of-assets/story-BIxEHnOKgbJOO5l6qv8HuK.html
28-12-2020||World||WHO launches Covid-19 app to counter pandemic misinformation||The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a mobile application to provide users with the latest updates on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Called the WHO Covid-19 app, it seeks to provide “trusted info from both the experts at the WHO and regional partners, with regular updates and notifications as scientific findings progress.”WHO had launched a similar app at the beginning of the year to provide real-time updates on the coronavirus disease, which was spreading at a rapid speed around the world. The app works with devices running on iOS 9.0 and up and on Android 4.4 devices. Most phones released from 2011 onwards fall under either two categories. The app was developed by a diverse team of volunteers and WHO staff pooled together from different countries. What does the app do?WHO has said that through this app users can learn about the symptoms of coronavirus disease and how to protect themselves and their community from the virus. Users can also register for real-time notifications from their localities to get regular updates from WHO and its partners. The app also serves an altruistic purpose, it lets users learn about the different ways they can help out during the pandemic. The global health body is said to be working with local stakeholders in making the app more geographically viable. So that when users register with their locations, real-time notifications can be sent to their phones in a timely manner. Where is this app available?The app is currently only available in Nigeria, where it debuted as a limited release feature. WHO is working on making it widely available to all English-speaking countries in the future. Why is this app being released?WHO’s battle against misinformation started right about when the pandemic did. The rampant and unchecked spread of misinformation has hampered WHO’s efforts to fight this pandemic. Hence with the launch of this app the agency wants to make sure that only verified and scientifically accurate information gets out. By involving local stakeholders, WHO hopes to make the app relevant to small communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-launches-covid-19-app-to-counter-pandemic-misinformation/story-hCWecP5rt2gsNZWvVEWj0M.html
28-12-2020||World||How Covid-19 has affected countries around the world||It has now been a year since the origin and spread of the coronavirus pandemic around the world. The deadly virus, which was first detected in China’s Wuhan, has affected almost every country in the world, infecting and killing millions everywhere. At the end of 2020, people have pinned their hopes on vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as they look forward to returning to normalcy.Here is how several countries saw the pandemic ravage :1. United States: America has been the worst-affected country by Covid-19 and its tally will soon touch the grim mark of 20 million cases. The country has been hit by a multitude of waves of the virus. By mid-December five in every 100 Americans have been infected by the virus, as reported by AP.2. India: While the second-worst hit country has been showing a declining trend in reporting active cases of the coronavirus disease, it didn’t have a great start. India responded to the disease by declaring an early abrupt strictest nationwide lockdown of 21 days, followed by a series of lockdowns. India’s attempt to control the spread of the virus came at the cost of its economy, and the tragic migrant labour crisis due to the unplanned nature of the restrictions.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-193. Brazil: This nation with Covid-19 cases of more than 7 million saw the virus being introduced by the national leader as a ‘little flu’, as reported AP. President Jair Bolsonaro scoffed at the virus and instead encouraged the people to flout all Covid-safety protocols while refusing to take the responsibility of the rising toll, according to AP.4. Italy: The eighth-worst affected nation showed the world how dangerous the virus is as the healthcare system of the developed country started collapsing. According to AP, it became the epicentre of Covid-19 in February 2020, lessons from the first wave also didn’t help to cause many more deaths in September despite plans and protocols in place.5. Spain: The ninth-worst hit country saw numerous healthcare workers succumbing to the deadly virus. While public healthcare officials boast about the system even with 929 deaths in a single day, it was the overworked staff that managed to slow down the virus spread, as per AP.6. Germany: This European country enjoyed a relaxed summer due to ease of many restrictions, which was the result of early measures to control the spread. But as relaxations set in, the numbers started to rise, with the country’s chancellor warning people that it would be a difficult winter as the country went back in a lockdown, reported AP.7. Iran: Iran too has been a sceptic about the coronavirus but the situation of the country has been worsening till date with the virus infecting and killing the top officials. The virus has become the greatest threat for the country after turmoil and war that followed its 1979 Islamic Revolution, reported AP.8. South Africa: The virus hit the poor hardest in the country with unemployment rising up to 42%, AP reported. But the secret weapon of the country were the veteran health officials with the experience of longstanding battles with HIV/AIDS and TB, who were looked upon for another crisis, reported AP.Also Read | Lasting immunity against Covid-19 found after mild or asymptomatic infection: Study9. Japan: This country saw the virus hit its shores in February when the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess became the hotspot with an explosion of infections, reported AP. Japan credits the use of masks and border control measures for the disease mitigation and hopes to host the Olympic games next year.10. China: China, where the virus was first reported, is almost back to normal. AP reported, workers have returned to factories and offices, students are back in the classroom and people are back eating out in crowded restaurants with great economic projections for the upcoming decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-covid-19-has-affected-countries-around-the-world/story-MkXhtQ1WZC6oeUJZPdtGJN.html

She has 30 days to appeal the verdict.A rights group called “Prisoners of Conscience” that focuses on Saudi political detainees said that al-Hathloul could be released as early as the end of March 2021 based on time served. She has been imprisoned since May 2018 and 34 months of her sentencing will be suspended.The judge ordered her to serve five years and eight months in prison for violating anti-terrorism laws, according to Sabq, which said its reporter was allowed inside the courtroom during Monday’s session.Sabq reported that the judge said the defendant had confessed to committing the crimes and that her confessions were made voluntarily and without coercion. The judge said the verdict was issued in the presence of the prosecutor, the defendant, a representative from the government’s Human Rights Commission and a handful of select local media representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-women-s-rights-activist-sentenced-to-nearly-6-years/story-LBzsZlk0lCkm1Wr6khEunJ.html
28-12-2020||World||Azerbaijan reports attack on its troops in Nagorno-Karabakh||Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said Monday its army units have been attacked by “an illegal Armenian armed group” in Nagorno-Karabakh, killing one Azerbaijani serviceman and wounding another.The ministry said the attack took place in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday afternoon and was thwarted, leaving all six attackers dead.The Nagorno-Karabakh military dismissed the statement as “misinformation” and a “propaganda provocation,” saying that the territory’s army was “strictly observing” the cease-fire. Earlier on Monday the Armenian Defence Ministry also denied media reports of fighting in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.Heavy fighting erupted in late September in the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. A Russian-brokered peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim much of the separatist region along with surrounding areas ended six weeks of fierce fighting on November 10.On December 12, Armenia and Azerbaijan reported new clashes in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh, accusing each other of breaching the cease-fire. Russian peacekeepers deployed to monitor the peace deal also reported a violation at the time, but didn’t assign blame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-reports-attack-on-its-troops-in-nagorno-karabakh/story-NiHMyiDUhfDD3ehU9H544J.html

The economically minor but hugely symbolic issue of fishing rights was a sticking point in negotiations, with maritime EU nations seeking to retain access to UK waters, and Britain insisting it must control its seas.Under the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in UK waters, far less than the 80% that Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.“I am angry, disappointed and betrayed,” said Andrew Locker, chairman of Britain’s National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations. “Boris Johnson promised us the rights to all the fish that swim in our exclusive economic zone and we have got a fraction of that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-warns-of-bumpy-post-brexit-transition-despite-deal/story-HNEV1O60QdksLY2ufG9sLM.html
28-12-2020||World||US fliers less familiar with Boeing 737 MAX crashes two years on, but wary when reminded: Poll||With the passage of time, Americans are less familiar with two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes, but if they are made aware of those disasters, more than half say they would probably avoid the aircraft, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. The poll results, released on Dec. 28, a day before the 737 MAX resumes commercial flights in the United States, found that 39% of adults were familiar with the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 versus about half in a previous poll.Of those respondents, 73% correctly identified Boeing as the maker of the aircraft involved in the crashes, down from 82% who said the same in the poll that ran in May 2019.However, when respondents were told about the aircraft’s safety issues 57% said they were not likely to fly in a Boeing 737 MAX, while 37% say they would be likely to fly in it once it has been in the air for six months or more. “We continue to work closely with global regulators and our customers to support the safe return of the fleet to service around the world,” a Boeing spokesman said in response to the poll. The US Federal Aviation Administration lifted a 20-month safety ban on Nov. 18 after approving design changes by Boeing to address systems that played a role in both crashes, which killed a total of 346 people. All airlines must complete the mandated safety changes and new pilot training before taking passengers.American Airlines is set to relaunch passenger flights on Tuesday between Miami and New York and plans to gradually reintroduce its 737 MAX fleet.The airline said it would re-book customers who do not feel comfortable about the aircraft.“No one has to go on the MAX if they don’t want to, but if you want to, it’s there,” American’s Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said at a 737 MAX media event on Dec. 2.Pandemic TravelBoeing’s 737 MAX is making its comeback at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has thrust the industry into its worst crisis, with airlines parking hundreds of jets as demand hovers around 30% of levels in 2019.When the 737 MAX was grounded, U.S. airlines had to cancel flights because they lacked the aircraft to meet demand, adding to Boeing’s financial liability.Now airlines are deferring jet deliveries and do not expect a robust rebound until Covid-19 vaccines are widely available.The poll suggests that airline travel will recover pre-pandemic rates once the health crisis subsides and that travelers still consider ticket prices the most important factor when choosing a flight, followed by airlines’ measures to protect them from the spread of the coronavirus. When buying a plane ticket, 41% said ticket price was most important and 24% said Covid-19 safety measures such as whether airlines are blocking middle seats.Only 3% said the aircraft model was most important.When asked how they planned to travel “when the coronavirus pandemic ends,” 10% said they would travel for personal reasons at least once a month by plane and 34% said they would travel at least once a year, similar to their reported travel habits before the pandemic.The poll showed similar trends for work travel, a driver of airline revenues - 7% said they would fly at least once a month, while 17% said they expected to travel at least a few times per year. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points. Of the other U.S. carriers that owned the 737 MAX before its grounding, United Airlines plans to fly the jet again in February and Southwest Airlines - the world’s largest 737 MAX operator - in the second quarter of 2021.Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, Brazil’s largest airline, became the first carrier to restart 737 MAX flights this month, followed by Grupo Aeromexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fliers-less-familiar-with-boeing-737-max-crashes-two-years-on-but-wary-when-reminded-poll/story-D1b0KxI3YUmMIMEMnphy1O.html
28-12-2020||World||China sentences lawyer who reported on outbreak to 4 years||A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a former lawyer who reported on the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak to four years in prison on charges of “picking fights and provoking trouble,” one of her lawyers said.The Pudong New Area People’s Court in the financial hub of Shanghai gave the sentence to Zhang Zhan following accusations she spread false information, gave interviews to foreign media, disrupted public order and “maliciously manipulated” the outbreak.Lawyer Zhang Keke confirmed the sentence but said it was “inconvenient” to provide details — usually an indication that the court has issued a partial gag order. He said the court did not ask Zhang whether she would appeal, nor did she indicate whether she would.Zhang, 37, traveled to Wuhan in February and posted on various social media platforms about the outbreak that is believed to have emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.She was arrested in May amid tough nationwide measures aimed at curbing the outbreak and heavy censorship to deflect criticism of the government’s initial response. Zhang reportedly went on a prolonged hunger strike while in detention, prompting authorities to forcibly feed her, and is said to be in poor health.China has been accused of covering up the initial outbreak and delaying the release of crucial information, allowing the virus to spread and contributing to the pandemic that has sickened more than 80 million people worldwide and killed almost 1.8 million. Beijing vigorously denies the accusations, saying it took swift action that bought time for the rest of the world to prepare.China’s ruling Communist Party tightly controls the media and seeks to block dissemination of information it hasn’t approved for release. In the early days of the outbreak, authorities reprimanded several Wuhan doctors for “rumor-mongering” after they alerted friends on social media. The best known of the doctors, Li Wenliang, later succumbed to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-lawyer-who-reported-on-outbreak-to-4-years/story-ZslGQ65DveaTWqdLS9MuaP.html
28-12-2020||World||Each year 1,000 Pakistani girls forcibly converted to Islam||Neha loved the hymns that filled her church with music. But she lost the chance to sing them last year when, at the age of 14, she was forcibly converted from Christianity to Islam and married to a 45-year-old man with children twice her age.She tells her story in a voice so low it occasionally fades away. She all but disappears as she wraps a blue scarf tightly around her face and head. Neha’s husband is in jail now facing charges of rape for the underage marriage, but she is in hiding, afraid after security guards confiscated a pistol from his brother in court.“He brought the gun to shoot me,” said Neha, whose last name The Associated Press is not using for her safety.Neha is one of nearly 1,000 girls from religious minorities who are forced to convert to Islam in Pakistan each year, largely to pave the way for marriages that are under the legal age and non-consensual. Human rights activists say the practice has accelerated during lockdowns against the coronavirus, when girls are out of school and more visible, bride traffickers are more active on the Internet and families are more in debt.The US State Department this month declared Pakistan “a country of particular concern” for violations of religious freedoms — a designation the Pakistani government rejects. The declaration was based in part on an appraisal by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom that underage girls in the minority Hindu, Christian, and Sikh communities were “kidnapped for forced conversion to Islam… forcibly married and subjected to rape.”While most of the converted girls are impoverished Hindus from southern Sindh province, two new cases involving Christians, including Neha’s, have roiled the country in recent months.The girls generally are kidnapped by complicit acquaintances and relatives or men looking for brides. Sometimes they are taken by powerful landlords as payment for outstanding debts by their farmhand parents, and police often look the other way. Once converted, the girls are quickly married off, often to older men or to their abductors, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.Forced conversions thrive unchecked on a money-making web that involves Islamic clerics who solemnize the marriages, magistrates who legalize the unions and corrupt local police who aid the culprits by refusing to investigate or sabotaging investigations, say child protection activists.One activist, Jibran Nasir, called the network a “mafia” that preys on non-Muslim girls because they are the most vulnerable and the easiest targets “for older men with pedophilia urges.”The goal is to secure virginal brides rather than to seek new converts to Islam. Minorities make up just 3.6 percent of Pakistan’s 220 million people and often are the target of discrimination. Those who report forced conversions, for example, can be targeted with charges of blasphemy.In the feudal Kashmore region of southern Sindh province, 13-year-old Sonia Kumari was kidnapped, and a day later police told her parents she had converted from Hinduism to Islam. Her mother pleaded for her return in a video widely viewed on the internet: “For the sake of God, the Quran, whatever you believe, please return my daughter, she was forcibly taken from our home.”But a Hindu activist, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of repercussions from powerful landlords, said she received a letter that the family was forced to write. The letter claimed the 13-year-old had willingly converted and wed a 36-year-old who was already married with two children.The parents have given up.Arzoo Raja was 13 when she disappeared from her home in central Karachi. The Christian girl’s parents reported her missing and pleaded with police to find her. Two days later, officers reported back that she had been converted to Islam and was married to their 40-year-old Muslim neighbor.In Sindh province, the age of consent for marriage is 18 years old. Arzoo’s marriage certificate said she was 19.The cleric who performed Arzoo’s marriage, Qasi Ahmed Mufti Jaan Raheemi, was later implicated in at least three other underage marriages. Despite facing an outstanding arrest warrant for solemnizing Arzoo’s marriage, he continued his practice in his ramshackle office above a wholesale rice market in downtown Karachi.When an Associated Press reporter arrived at his office, Raheemi fled down a side stair, according to a fellow cleric, Mullah Kaifat Ullah, one of a half-dozen clerics who also performs marriages in the complex. He said another cleric is already in jail for marrying children.While Ullah said he only marries girls 18 and above, he argued that “under Islamic law a girl’s wedding at the age of 14 or 15 is fine.”Arzoo’s mother, Rita Raja, said police ignored the family’s appeals until one day she was videotaped outside the court sobbing and pleading for her daughter to be returned. The video went viral, creating a social media storm in Pakistan and prompting the authorities to step in.“For 10 days, the parents were languishing between the police station and government authorities and different political parties,” Nasir, the activist, said. “They were not being given any time… until it went viral. That is the real unfortunate thing over here.”Authorities have stepped in and arrested Arzoo’s husband, but her mother said her daughter still refuses to come home. Raja said she is afraid of her husband’s family.The girl who loved hymns, Neha, said she was tricked into the marriage by a favorite aunt, who told Neha to accompany her to the hospital to see her sick son. Her aunt, Sandas Baloch, had converted to Islam years before and lived with her husband in the same apartment building as Neha’s family.“All Mama asked when we left was ’when will you be back?’” remembered Neha.Instead of going to the hospital, she was taken to the home of her aunt’s in-laws and told she would marry her aunt’s 45-year-old brother-in-law.“I told her I can’t, I am too young and I don’t want to. He is old,” Neha said. “She slapped me and locked me up in a room.”Neha told of being taken before two men, one who was to be her husband and the other who recorded her marriage. They said she was 19. She said she was too frightened to speak because her aunt threatened to harm her two-year-old brother if she refused to marry.She learned of her conversion only when she was told to sign the marriage certificate with her new name — Fatima.For a week she was locked in one room. Her new husband came to her on the first night. Tears stained her blue scarf as she remembered it:“I screamed and cried all night. I have images in my mind I can’t scratch out,” said Neha. “I hate him.”His elder daughter brought her food each day, and Neha begged for help to escape. Although the woman was frightened of her father, she relented a week after the marriage, bringing the underage bride a burqa — the all-covering garment worn by some Muslim women — and 500 rupees (about $3). Neha fled.But when she arrived home, Neha found her family had turned against her.“I went home and I cried to my Mama about my aunt, what she said and the threats. But she didn’t want me anymore,” said Neha.Her parents feared what her new husband might do to them, Neha said. Further, the prospects of marriage for a girl in conservative Pakistan who has been raped or married before are slim, and human rights activists say they often are seen as a burden.Neha’s family, including her aunt, all refused to talk to the AP. Her husband’s lawyer, Mohammad Saleem, insisted that she married and converted voluntarily.Neha found protection at a Christian church in Karachi, living on the compound with the pastor’s family, who say the girl still wakes screaming in the night. She hopes to go back to school one day but is still distraught.“At the beginning my nightmares were every night, but now it is just sometimes when I remember and inside I am shaking,” she said. “Before I wanted to be a lawyer, but now I don’t know what I will do. Even my mama doesn’t want me now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/each-year-1-000-pakistani-girls-forcibly-converted-to-islam/story-9UOtssyEHJEGvnh7mxVjAM.html

28-12-2020||World||South Africa may ban alcohol as virus cases breach 1 million||South Africa may reinstate a ban on liquor sales as part of efforts to control a surge in Covid-19 infections, which have now surpassed 1 million, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The country had three record-breaking days of infections through Dec. 25, when it registered 14,796 new cases. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize a day earlier called for stricter measures to curb the spread, which has already battered the economy. South Africa recorded a cumulative 1,004,413 confirmed cases and 26,735 deaths on Sunday.Some countries, including the UK, have imposed travel restrictions on flights coming from Africa’s most industrialized economy after a new, more aggressive strain of the virus was identified in the eastern part of the country. The mutation, known as 501.V2, has increasingly dominated samples from the past two months and is rapidly spreading.Restrictions on alcohol sales have been implemented to various degrees since one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns was imposed in March, in part to lower hospital admissions from vehicle accidents and alcohol-related violence. Still, the government lost tax revenue as a result of the initial ban on any sales and liquor traders and bars fired workers.The ban could start on Tuesday and last through Jan. 10, said the person, who requested anonymity because the information is not public and a final decision hasn’t been made.“Government continuously monitors all dimensions of the Covid-19 pandemic and as and when decisions are taken they are communicated publicly,” Tyrone Seale, acting spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa, said by text message in a response to questions.The government’s National Coronavirus Command Council is expected to discuss a potential ban on alcohol, said Lucky Ntimane, convener of the Liquor Traders Formations, which represents liquor outlets.“We do not think that a total ban on alcohol sales will be a solution either in the short or long term,” the industry group said in a statement.The coalition of liquor traders proposed curfew measures and alcohol restrictions, if any, that still allow off-premises sales to allow for home consumption. A complete shutdown of liquor sales would mean “an end to the tavern market and the 250,000 direct jobs linked to the sector,” it said.Liquor companies that operate in South Africa include Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, Diageo Plc and Distell Group Holdings Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-may-ban-alcohol-as-virus-cases-breach-1-million/story-71JU5a3qPTYTfB28Jf1f8N.html

He called Trump “angry” and “crazy.”The Iran backed Hezbollah is a sworn enemy of Israel, with which it has had a series of confrontations, including a full-scale war in 2006.Nasrallah repeated vows that Iran and its allies will avenge the US killing of the commander of the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Qassim Soleimani, in a drone attack a year ago in Iraq.“That revenge is coming no matter how long it takes,” he told Al-Mayadeen TV, sitting with a picture of Soleimani to his left.Nasrallah also vowed to avenge Israel’s killing of a Hezbollah fighter in Syria earlier this year.Addressing the incoming US administration of President Joe Biden, Nasrallah said Iran would not negotiate with the US on behalf of its allies or discuss conflicts in the region. He said Tehran would talk with Washington only about the Iranian nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hezbollah-says-it-has-doubled-its-arsenal-of-guided-missiles/story-bFRiWQtB4J5gfN6PTvDaTP.html

28-12-2020||World||UK poised to clear AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot as need for vaccines grow||The UK is poised to approve the Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, giving the country another powerful tool to fight the pandemic as concern mounts over rising infections.Britain’s drug regulator could clear the shot for use as early as this week, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Pascal Soriot and UK health officials had previously said they hoped for approval by the end of the year.The go-ahead would come about three weeks after the UK became the first western country to begin vaccinations, using a shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that’s been administered to more than 600,000 Britons. Still, virus cases have surged in Britain amid concern about a new strain of the coronavirus that officials have said is more contagious.That prompted the government to reverse plans to ease restrictions over Christmas and tighten lockdowns across large parts of the country. Those measures could be eased at the end of February as the imminent approval of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot permits the vaccination of as many as 15 million of the country’s most vulnerable people, the Mail on Sunday reported. The country’s health service would no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by virus cases once that threshold is met, the newspaper said.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will need time to carry out a review of the vaccine data, the Department of Health and Social Care said by email. Representatives for the MHRA and AstraZeneca declined to comment.The AstraZeneca vaccine could facilitate a rapid ramp-up of vaccinations because it’s easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing. It’s also less expensive to produce, so many developing countries -- along with the US and the European Union (EU) -- have also signed deals for doses. The vaccine could be rolled out across Britain from Jan. 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported.Trial questionsUK approval would provide vindication for the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot, which has been slowed by questions about discrepancies in the trial results. Overall, these studies showed that the vaccine was less effective than shots from Pfizer and another developer, Moderna Inc. But a subset of the trial that showed better results resulted from a dosing mistake.The UK has more riding on the domestically developed shot than the US and some other countries because it won’t be able to get any of the Moderna vaccine until well into next year.Soriot told the Sunday Times that new data will show the AstraZeneca vaccine is comparable to the 95% effectiveness rate reported by the rival developers.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” he told the newspaper. “I can’t tell you more because we will publish at some point.”Soriot had previously said the vaccine was on track for large-scale vaccinations by the end of the year. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had said he expected the MHRA to act by early next year or perhaps sooner.Vaccination sitesThe final cut of data was submitted to regulators last Monday and the National Health Service has enlisted more than 10,000 medics and volunteers to administer the shot, the Telegraph reported. Mass vaccination centres at sports stadiums and conference venues are expected to begin in the second week of January, according to the paper.Government officials will hold a meeting on the pandemic Monday after scientists warned that school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the new Covid-19 variant, the newspaper said.The country has been one of the hardest hit in Europe with more than 70,000 deaths, the most in the region after Italy. Much of the UK has been moved into the harshest Tier 4 restrictions, which prohibit household mixing and forced the closing of pubs, restaurants, and many businesses, after the discovery earlier this month of the more contagious strain.The rate at which the virus is increasing, known as the R number, is estimated at 1.1 to 1.3 as of December 24, according to the latest government data. A reading above 1.0 indicates the spread of the virus is accelerating. The UK reported 34,693 more cases and 210 deaths on December 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-poised-to-clear-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-as-need-for-vaccines-grow/story-ndo1ylKJQwFZqqQ2PWYdNL.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump defies Chinese warning, signs off on law on next Dalai Lama||US President Donald Trump has signed off on the legislation that reaffirms the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama, a move described by the Tibetan government-in-exile as a “powerful message of hope and justice” to Tibetans living in Tibet.The United States Congress had passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act last week, provoking howls of protest from the Chinese foreign ministry that calls the legislation as an attempt to meddle in China’s affairs.“We urge the U.S. side to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs and refrain from signing into law these negative clauses and acts, lest it further harms our further cooperation and bilateral relations,” Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said last week after the legislation was approved by the US Congress.As news of the new law emerged on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing had firmly rejected the US legislation and “Tibet-related issues are domestic affairs”.The legislation, which calls for the establishment of a US consulate in Tibet’s main city of Lhasa, also asserts the absolute right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the 14th Dalai Lama and the preservation of Tibet’s environment.The US law that aims to build an international coalition to ensure that China does not interfere with the selection of the next Dalai comes against the backdrop of Beijing appointing its own Panchen Lama after arresting a boy Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in May 1995 who was identified by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism’s largest school. Human rights groups had called the Panchen Lama as the world’s youngest political prisoner. He was just six when he disappeared.President Xi Jinping’s China, which regards the exiled Dalai Lama as a dangerous “splittist”, or separatist, claims that Beijing’s approval is a must for choosing the successor to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.Tibetans have rejected this claim.“This legislation sends a powerful message of hope and justice to the Tibetans inside Tibet and bolsters US support for the protection of Tibetan people’s religious freedom, human rights, environmental rights and exile Tibetan democracy like never before,” said Lobsang Sangay, president of Central Tibetan Administration in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala said in a statement.China’s deep interest in projecting its successor to the Dalai Lama and other spiritual leaders is driven by its objective to divide the world of Tibetan Buddhism, where religious leaders of all the four major schools have sought refuge sometime or other in India. The American legislation, in coordination with other countries, will try to build pressure on China to wait for the 14th Dalai Lama, who turned 85 this April, to identify his reincarnation, rather than come up with its nominee to split Tibetans.India had settled the Dalai Lama in April 1959 and the thousands of Tibetans who followed him in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala where he has been living in exile after escaping from Tibet when it was invaded by the Chinese.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would cost USD51 million over five years.In 2009, late Congressman John Lewis led a congressional delegation visit to India to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dr King’s pilgrimage to India.Inspired by his visit, Congressman Lewis created the Gandhi-King Exchange Act to seek to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr to conflict resolution efforts and current policy challenges.The Act, among other things authorises the State Department, in cooperation with the Indian government, to establish an annual educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the legacies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr.It also authorises to develop a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of nonviolence; and establish a foundation to address social, environmental, and health priorities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-into-law-gandhi-king-scholarly-exchange-initiative/story-NAu0i1mxOrpok5F7erQcTL.html
28-12-2020||World||Authorities identify Nashville bomber, motive remains unknown||With federal officials having identified the man believed to be behind Nashville’s Christmas Day bombing, authorities now turn to the monumental task of piecing together the motive behind the explosion that severely damaged dozens of downtown buildings and injured three people.While officials on Sunday named Anthony Quinn Warner, 63, as the man behind the mysterious explosion in which he was killed, the motive has remained elusive.“These answers won’t come quickly and will still require a lot of our team’s efforts,” FBI Special Agent Doug Korneski said at a Sunday news conference. “Though we may be able to answer some these questions as our investigation continues, none of those answers will be enough by those affected by this event.”In just a few days, hundreds of tips and leads have been submitted to law enforcement agencies. Yet thus far, officials have not provided information on what possibly drove Warner to set off the explosion.David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters on Sunday that Warner had not been on the radar before Christmas.Furthermore, officials have not provided insight into why Warner selected the particular location for the bombing, which damaged an AT&T building and continued to wreak havoc on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states as the company worked to restore service.Forensic analysts were reviewing evidence collected from the blast site to try to identify the components of the explosives as well as information from the US Bomb Data Centre for intelligence and investigative leads, according to a law enforcement official who said investigators were examining Warner’s digital footprint and financial history, as well as a recent deed transfer of a suburban Nashville home they searched.The official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said federal agents were examining a number of potential leads and pursuing several theories, including the possibility that the AT&T building was targeted.Korneski said Sunday that officials were looking at any and all motives and were interviewing acquaintances of Warner’s to try to determine what may have motivated him.The bombing took place on a holiday morning well before downtown streets were bustling with activity and was accompanied by a recorded announcement warning anyone nearby that a bomb would soon detonate. Then, for reasons that may never be known, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast.Warner, who public records show had experience with electronics and alarms and who had also worked as a computer consultant for a Nashville realtor, had been regarded as a person of interest in the bombing since at least Saturday, when federal and local investigators converged on the home linked to him.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image captured in May 2019 had shown a recreational vehicle similar to the one that exploded parked in the backyard, but it was not at the property on Saturday, according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene.On Sunday morning, police formally named Warner as being under investigation.Officials said their identification of Warner relied on several key pieces of evidence, including DNA found at the explosion site. Investigators had previously revealed that human remains had been found in the vicinity.In addition, investigators from the Tennessee Highway Patrol recovered parts from the RV among the wreckage from the blast, and were able to link the vehicle identification number to an RV that was registered to Warner, officials said.“We’re still following leads, but right now there is no indication that any other persons were involved,” Korneski said. “We’ve reviewed hours of security video surrounding the recreation vehicle. We saw no other people involved.”Police were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Suddenly the warning stopped, and “Downtown” started playing.The RV exploded shortly afterward, sending black smoke and flames billowing from the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene, an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops.Buildings shook and windows shattered streets away from the explosion near a building owned by AT&T that lies one block from the company’s office tower, a landmark in downtown.But on Sunday, just blocks from where the bombing took place, tourists had already begun to fill the sidewalks on Lower Broadway, a central entertainment district. Some took selfies while others tried to get as close as possible to the explosion site, blocked by police barricades.Earlier Sunday, the officers who responded provided harrowing details, at times getting choked up reliving the moments that led up to the blast.“This is going to tie us together forever, for the rest of my life,” Metro Nashville police Officer James Wells, who suffered some hearing loss due to the explosion, told reporters at a news conference. “Christmas will never be the same.”Officer Brenna Hosey said she and her colleagues knocked on six or seven doors in nearby apartments to warn people to evacuate. She particularly remembered a startled mother of four children.“I don’t have kids but I have cousins and nieces, people who I love who are small,” Hosey said, adding she had to plead with the family to leave the building as quickly as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authorities-identify-nashville-bomber-motive-remains-unknown/story-FAKzdUPSOQZHCb95Bmox3K.html

But that idea has now been axed over fears the celebrations could turn into a super-spreader event.“We’ve abandoned our plans in terms of any foreshore viewing of the fireworks from the Sydney CBD, so that won’t be allowed,” the state leader of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, Gladys Berejiklian, said.Permits will also be required to enter some parts of the city as celebrations will be limited to controlled, socially-distanced events and small gatherings at people’s homes.“We do recommend very strongly that people watch the fireworks on TV or go to a local venue outdoors which is not on the foreshore and doesn’t have that cramped crowding,” Berejiklian said.The decision to tighten restrictions comes as a cluster of cases on the city’s northern beaches grew to 126 and a lockdown for several suburbs was extended until January 9.Before the cluster, which emerged earlier this month, life had been returning to relative normality around the country as the number of daily virus cases slowed to a trickle.Australia has recorded over 28,300 cases and 909 deaths linked to the virus in a population of about 25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-bans-new-year-crowds-as-coronavirus-cluster-grows-in-australia/story-GZTPing0LH2SXqBYjmJEiM.html

Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), that has infected over 80 million people worldwide and killed 1.76 million, has changed the way of life across nations.Along with masks and social distancing, another new normal that is likely to emerge is the vaccine passport application, according to a CNN report. As the name suggests, the mobile app, with proof that the user has been tested negative for coronavirus, will be their passport to concert venues, stadiums, movie theaters, offices, or even countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, has said that these passports may not be helpful in reducing transmission as there was always a possibility of second infection.  Here is all you need to know about vaccine passports:- Individuals will be expected to upload details of their Covid-19 tests and vaccinations on the applications being developed by some companies and technology groups, and produce these digital credentials on being asked.- An example of this is the CommonPass app, created by the Common Trust Network, which allows users to upload medical data such as a Covid-19 test result or proof of vaccination. A pass is generated in the form of a QR code which can be presented to authorities. Common Trust Network is an initiative by The Commons Project and the World Economic Forum. These organisations have partnered with airlines such as Cathay Pacific, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin Atlantic for the same.- IBM has also developed an app called Digital Health Pass. This app allows companies to scan for their requirements of entry, such as coronavirus tests and temperature checks.- The WHO reacted to some countries’ suggestion that vaccine passports be used to allow individuals entry to their workplaces or other countries and said that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.- “At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate,” the WHO said, adding that the use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-may-need-vaccine-passport-for-travel-next-year-all-you-need-to-know-about-it/story-STrkJrxlEfu0FhCZFqPDGI.html

She thinks she will die in prison,” Ren said before the trial.“It’s an extreme method of protesting against this society and this environment.”China’s communist authorities have a history of putting dissidents on trial in opaque courts between Christmas and New Year to minimise Western scrutiny.The trial comes just weeks before an international team of World Health Organization experts is expected to arrive in China to investigate the origins of Covid-19.Another lawyer said Zhang’s health was in decline and she suffered from headaches, dizziness and stomach pain.“Restrained 24 hours a day, she needs assistance going to the bathroom,” Zhang Keke, who visited her on Christmas Day, wrote in a note circulated on social media.“She feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment.”Zhang was critical of the early response in Wuhan, writing in a February essay that the government “didn’t give people enough information, then simply locked down the city”.“This is a great violation of human rights,” she wrote.The court said she had spread “false remarks” online, according to Zhang Keke.Rights groups have also drawn attention to her case.Authorities “want to use her case as an example to scare off other dissidents from raising questions about the pandemic situation in Wuhan earlier this year”, said Leo Lan, research and advocacy consultant at the Chinese Human Rights Defenders NGO.Zhang is the first to face trial of a group of four citizen journalists detained by authorities earlier this year after reporting from Wuhan.Previous attempts by AFP to contact the other three -- Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua -- were unsuccessful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-jails-citizen-journalist-for-four-years-over-wuhan-virus-reports-lawyer-says/story-5CssaWvSKz7LDlV7oYa2aO.html

And come January, there will be no time to waste. That’s why my team and I are hard at work preparing to take action on day one,” Biden tweeted.Hours after Biden’s tweet, President Trump officially signed the trillion dollar coronavirus relief and government spending bill, The Hill reported.On Saturday, Biden had accused Donald Trump of “abdicating responsibility” and had pressed the outgoing President to immediately sign the Covid-19 relief bill that was pending.“It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,” Biden said in a statement.Members of both parties had urged Trump to sign the USD 2.3 trillion packages, The Hill reported. Earlier, the bill was passed with bipartisan support in US Congress.Earlier today, top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the United States is headed for the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic in the upcoming weeks as Americans will see the effects of the holiday season.“The reason I’m concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s, surge,” CNN quoted Fauci as saying. “We are really at a very critical point.... So I share the concern of President-elect Biden that as we get into the next few weeks, it might actually get worse,” Fauci added.President-elect Biden last week had said that “darkest days” against coronavirus “are ahead of us, not behind us.”The Covid-19 case total in the United States surpassed 19 million-mark on Sunday (local time), according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University, which tracks and compiles data from various sources including local authorities and media outlets.As of 6:35 IST on Monday, Johns Hopkins University had registered 19,107,675 positive tests for the coronavirus disease in the United States.

28-12-2020||World||Sydney told to watch its famous New Year’s Eve fireworks from home||Sydney, one of the world’s first major cities to welcome each New Year with a public countdown featuring a fireworks display over its well-known Opera House, has banned large gatherings that night amid an outbreak of the coronavirus.A mid-December resurgence of COVID-19 in the city’s northern beach suburbs has grown to 125 cases after five new infections were recorded on Monday. About a quarter of million of people there must stay in strict lockdown until Jan. 9That has led to further restrictions of the already toned-down plans for the New Year’s Eve. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian banned most people from coming to Sydney’s downtown that night and limited outdoor gatherings to 50 people.“We don’t want to create any super-spreading events on New Year’s Eve, which then ruins it for everybody across the state moving forward,” Berejiklian said at a news conference, adding that watching the fireworks from home was the ‘safest’ way to do so.“On New Year’s Eve we don’t want any crowds on the foreshore around Sydney whatsoever,” she said.Only residents with permits for hospitality venues downtown will be allowed there on New Year’s Eve. Households across Sydney are only allowed to host 10 people until further notice.NSW Police have issued 15 notices for breaking public health orders since Christmas Eve in Sydney, including to 11 people at a house party at North Bondi on Saturday.“When most of New South Wales, indeed most of Australia, is doing the right thing, I would say to those people half contemplating doing anything stupid in the next few days, forget it,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.Australia as a whole, has avoided the worst of the pandemic due to swift border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing and social distancing. It has recorded just over 28,300 infections, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 908 deaths. (Reporting by Lidia Kelly.

28-12-2020||World||2020 weather disasters ‘boosted’ by climate change, says report||The ten costliest weather disasters worldwide this year saw insured damages worth $150 billion, topping the figure for 2019 and reflecting a long-term impact of global warming, according to a report Monday.The same disasters claimed at least 3,500 lives and displaced more than 13.5 million people. From Australia’s out-of-control wildfires in January to a record number of Atlantic hurricanes through November, the true cost of the year’s climate-enhanced calamities was in fact far higher because most losses were uninsured.Not surprisingly, the burden fell disproportionately on poor nations, according to the annual tally from global NGO Christian Aid, entitled “Count the cost of 2020: a year of climate breakdown”.Only four percent of economic losses from climate-impacted extreme events in low-income countries were insured, compared with 60 percent in high-income economies, the report said, citing a study last month in The Lancet.“Whether floods in Asia, locusts in Africa, or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said Christian Aid’s climate policy lead, Kat Kramer.Extreme weather disasters, of course, have plagued humanity long before manmade global warming began to mess with the planet’s climate system.But more than a century of temperature and precipitation data, along with decades of satellite data on hurricanes and sea level rise, have left no doubt that Earth’s warming surface temperature is amplifying their impact.Massive tropical storms -- variously known as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones -- are now more likely, for example, to be stronger, last longer, carry more water and wander beyond their historical range. 2020’s record-breaking 30 named Atlantic hurricanes -- with at least 400 fatalities and $41 billion in damages -- suggest the world could see more such storms as well. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) had to use Greek symbols after running out of letters in the Latin alphabet.- Extremes, not averages -Intense summer flooding in China and India, where the monsoon season brought abnormal amounts of rainfall for the second year running, are also consistent with projections on how climate will impact precipitation.Five of the most costly extreme weather events in 2020 were related to Asia’s unusually rainy monsoon. “The 2020 flood was one of the worst in the history of Bangladesh, more than a quarter of the country was under water,” said Shahjahan Mondal, director of the Institute of Flood and Water Management at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Wildfires that scorched record areas in California, Australia and even Russia’s Siberian hinterland, much of it within the Arctic Circle, are also consistent with a warmer world, and a predicted to get worse as temperatures climb.The planet’s average surface temperature has gone up at least 1.1 degrees Celsius on average compared to the late 19th-century, with much of that warming occurring in the last half-century. The 2015 Paris Agreement enjoins the world’s nations to collectively cap global warming at “well below” 2C, and even 1.5C if feasible. A landmark report in 2018 from the UN’s IPCC climate science advisory panel showed that 1.5C is a safer threshold, but the likelihood of staying below it have grown vanishingly small, according to many experts.“Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not average changes,” noted Sarah Perkins-Kilpatrick, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales’ Climate Change Research Centre. If the growing frequency and intensity of natural weather disasters is consistent with modelling projections, the new field of attribution science is now able to put a number on how much more likely such an event is due to global warming. The unprecedented wildfires that destroyed 20 percent of Australia’s forests and killed tens of millions of wild animals in late 2019 and early 2020, for example, were made at least 30 percent more likely, according to research led by Friederike Otto at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute.In Europe, meanwhile, the chance of deadly heatwaves occurring has risen nearly 100 fold compared to a century ago, according to recent research.“Heatwaves and floods which used to be ‘once in a century’ events are becoming more regular occurrences,” noted WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.mh/spm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-weather-disasters-boosted-by-climate-change-says-report/story-A6TAHz3cRlH8TSpCuUGSPP.html
28-12-2020||World||British tourists, forced into quarantine, sneak out of Swiss ski resort||Hundreds of British tourists forced into quarantine in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier fled in the night rather than seeing their holidays go downhill, the local municipality said Sunday.Around 200 of the 420 or so affected British tourists in the luxury Alpine ski station quit under the cover of darkness, the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported.Switzerland’s ski resorts were set to boom with snow-seeking British tourists -- but a flight ban due to the new Covid-19 variant raging in England put those plans on ice.The drastic ruling by the Swiss government also included a 10-day retroactive quarantine for anyone who arrived from Britain since December 14, following the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus which experts fear spreads more quickly.Some of the British tourists affected in Verbier left immediately, while others stuck it out for a bit before quitting.“Many of them stayed in quarantine for a day before they set off unnoticed under the cover of darkness,” Jean-Marc Sandoz, spokesman for the wider Bagnes municipality, told SZ.He called the whole situation “the worst week our community has ever experienced”.British tourists normally make up 21 percent of the Verbier clientele, and most start pouring in just after Christmas.Voted Switzerland’s best ski resort for the past two years, Verbier markets itself as offering “adrenaline-packed thrills, simple pleasures and a chic lifestyle”. The Verbier Tourist Office has been holding daily crisis cell meetings to try to deal with the ever-changing coronavirus picture.- Breakfast untouched -“It was when they saw the meal trays remained untouched that the hoteliers noticed that the customers had gone,” Sandoz told ATS news agency.He said that according to a Saturday survey of the ski resort’s hotels, fewer than 10 people would still be in quarantine.The rest would either have left or their quarantine time would have expired.“We can’t blame them. In most cases, quarantine was untenable. Imagine four people staying in a hotel room of 20 square metres,” Sandoz said.He said the tourists left feeling “a little angry with Switzerland” and with the sense of having been “trapped”.Flights between Switzerland and the two countries were halted on Monday, but the first outbound flights from Zurich to Britain resumed on Thursday.Two cases of the new British coronavirus variant have been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein, the Swiss health ministry said Sunday.Two cases of the new South African variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, have also been detected, the ministry said.rjm/spm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-tourists-forced-into-quarantine-sneak-out-of-swiss-ski-resort/story-2F3anKkB228eFV5kI7ny7M.html

The government says obesity is one of Britain’s biggest long-term public health problems with almost two-thirds of adults in England overweight and one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese.The measures will also restrict where in a store promotions on such products can be advertised, and unhealthy promotions will not be allowed at checkouts, shop entrances or at the ends of aisles.“We are restricting promotions and introducing a range of measures to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice. Creating an environment which helps everyone eat healthier foods more regularly is crucial to improving the health of the nation,” public health minister Jo Churchill said. Britain first proposed restricting “buy one get one free” deals on junk food in July, and also announced measures such as banning TV and online adverts for junk food before 9.00 p.m.Last month the government went further and proposed a total ban on online advertising of unhealthy food. Being overweight has been shown to increase the risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19 - a fact highlighted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has publicly talked about his own need to lose weight since being hospitalised with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-restrict-promotion-of-unhealthy-food-from-april-2022/story-s6QkTZ3cDpq8MtpMmGr6AL.html
28-12-2020||World||Donald Trump signs massive measure funding government, Covid relief||President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion pandemic relief package Sunday, ending days of drama over his refusal to accept the bipartisan deal that will deliver long-sought cash to businesses and individuals and avert a federal government shutdown.The massive bill includes $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September and contains other end-of-session priorities such as money for cash-starved transit systems and an increase in food stamp benefits.Trump announced the signing in a statement Sunday night that spoke of his frustrations with the Covid-19 relief for including only $600 checks to most Americans instead of the $2,000 that his fellow Republicans rejected. He also complained about what he considered unnecessary spending by the government at large. But Trump’s eleventh-hour objections created turmoil because lawmakers had thought he was supportive of the bill, which had been negotiated for months with White House input.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,” Trump said in the statement.While the president insisted he would send Congress “a redlined version” with items to be removed under the rescission process, those are merely suggestions to Congress. The bill, as signed, would not necessarily be changed.Lawmakers now have breathing room to continue debating whether the relief checks should be as large as the president has demanded. The Democratic-led House supports the larger checks and is set to vote on the issue Monday, but it’s expected to be ignored by the Republican-held Senate where spending faces opposition.Republicans and Democrats swiftly welcomed Trump’s decision to sign the bill into law.“The compromise bill is not perfect, but it will do an enormous amount of good for struggling Kentuckians and Americans across the country who need help now,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “I thank the President for signing this relief into law.”Democrats are promising more aid to come once President-elect Joe Biden takes office, but Republicans are signaling a wait-and-see approach.In the face of growing economic hardship, spreading disease and a looming shutdown, lawmakers on Sunday had urged Trump to sign the legislation immediately, then have Congress follow up with additional aid. Aside from unemployment benefits and relief payments to families, money for vaccine distribution, businesses, cash-starved public transit systems and more is on the line. Protections against evictions also hung in the balance.“What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “So many people are hurting. ... It is really insane and this president has got to finally ... do the right thing for the American people and stop worrying about his ego.”Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayRepublican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he understood that Trump “wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”Toomey added: “So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make the case for subsequent legislation.”The same point was echoed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who’s criticized Trump’s pandemic response and his efforts to undo the election results. “I just gave up guessing what he might do next,” he said.Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said too much is at stake for Trump to “play this old switcheroo game.”“I don’t get the point,” he said. “I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election.”Washington had been reeling since Trump turned on the deal. Fingers pointed at administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as lawmakers tried to understand whether they were misled about Trump’s position.“Now to be put in a lurch, after the president’s own person negotiated something that the president doesn’t want, it’s just — it’s surprising,” Kinzinger said.Kinzinger spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union,” and Hogan and Sanders on ABC’s “This Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-massive-measure-funding-government-covid-relief/story-uD02AZ1Y86rLSX0kXzvPyO.html
28-12-2020||World||Nashville blast suspect died in explosion, say police||The 63-year-old suspect in the bombing that rocked Nashville on Christmas Day morning was killed in the blast that destroyed his motor home and damaged more than 40 businesses, authorities said on Sunday.FBI forensic experts matched DNA samples recovered from the scene to that of Anthony Q. Warner, whose home in nearby Antioch was searched on Saturday by federal agents. “We’ve come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber and he was present when the bomb went off and that he perished in the bombing,” Donald Cochran, US Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, told a news conference. Officials said it was too early in the investigation to discuss the suspect’s motives. Also Read: FBI at home of possible person of interest in Nashville bomb explosionWarner’s motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee’s largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday moments after police responding to reports of gunfire noticed it and heard music and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb. The explosion in the heart of America’s country music capital injured three people and damaged businesses including an AT&T switching center, disrupting mobile, internet and TV services across central Tennessee and parts of four other states. As investigators followed up on hundreds of tips from members of the public, they searched Warner’s home on Saturday and visited a Nashville real estate agency where he had worked on computers. The owner of Fridrich & Clark Realty, Steve Fridrich, told the Tennessean newspaper that for four or five years Warner had come into the office roughly once a month to provide computer consulting services, until this month when Warner told the company in an email that he would no longer be working for them. He gave no reason, according to Fridrich. “He seemed very personable to us – this is quite out of character I think,” Fridrich told the newspaper. Also Read: Explosion in Nashville believed to be ‘intentional’, say policeNashville Mayor John Cooper said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” program on Sunday that local officials felt there had to be some connection between the bombing and the AT&T Inc building. Damage to the switching center was so extensive that AT&T teams had to drill access holes into the wreckage to connect generators to critical equipment, as well as pump three feet of water from the basement. The company said in a statement on Sunday that it made “significant progress” overnight and had restored power to four floors of the building.At a news conference on Sunday, five Nashville police officers who were on the scene early on Friday recalled the dramatic moments ahead of the explosion, as they scrambled to evacuate homes and buildings and called for a bomb squad, which was en route when the motor home blew up.“I was thrown forward, knocked to the ground,” officer Brenna Hosey told reporters about the moment of the explosion. “But I was able to catch myself, I was fine.” The officers have been hailed as heroes by city leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-blast-suspect-died-in-explosion-police-say/story-WD43JzeVWz1kkNoq7dk6KK.html
28-12-2020||World||Shot will be effective against Covid-19 variant: AstraZeneca||The head of drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine widely expected to be approved by UK authorities this week, said Sunday that researchers believe the shot will be effective against a new variant of the virus driving a rapid surge in infections in Britain.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot also told the Sunday Times that researchers developing its vaccine have figured out a “winning formula” making the jab as effective as rival candidates.Some have raised concern that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being developed with Oxford University, may not be as good as the one made by Pfizer already being distributed in the UK and other countries. Partial results suggest that the AstraZeneca shot is about 70% effective for preventing illness from coronavirus infection, compared to the 95% efficacy reported by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” Soriot said. “I can’t tell you more because we will publish at some point.”Britain’s government says its medicines regulator is reviewing the final data from AstraZeneca’s phase three clinical trials. The Times and others have reported that the green light could come by Thursday, and the vaccines can start to be rolled out for the UK public in the first week of January.Asked about the vaccine’s efficacy against the new variant of coronavirus spreading in the UK, Soriot said: “So far, we think the vaccine should remain effective. But we can’t be sure, so we’re going to test that.”British authorities have blamed the new virus variant for soaring infection rates across the country. They said the variant is much more transmittable, but stress there is no evidence it makes people more ill.Prime Minister Boris Johnson sounded an urgent alarm about the variant days before Christmas, saying the new version of the virus was spreading rapidly and that plans to travel and gather must be canceled for millions to curb the spread of the virus.Authorities have since put increasing areas of the country — affecting about 24 million people, or 43% of the population — in the strictest level of restrictions. Nonessential shops have closed, restaurants and pubs can only operate for takeout and no indoor socializing is allowed.Many countries swiftly barred travel from the UK, but cases of the new variant have since also been reported in a dozen locations around the world.Public health officials said on Dec. 24 that more than 600,000 people had received the first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.Britain recorded another 30,501 positive Covid-19 cases and a further 316 deaths on Sunday, bringing the country’s total death toll to 70,752. Many hospitals are under pressure, including the largest hospital in Wales, which issued an urgent appeal on Saturday for health care staff or medical students to help care for coronavirus patients in intensive care.The health board that runs University Hospital of Wales said Sunday that the situation has improved, but its critical care unit remains extremely busy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shot-will-be-effective-against-covid-19-variant-astrazeneca/story-P9tgpvzTbnMBwZekmSLNJP.html
28-12-2020||World||US government heads toward chaotic end to 2020 as Trump fights Congress||The US government headed toward a chaotic last few days of the year as President Donald Trump’s refusal to approve a $2.3 trillion financial package caused millions of jobless Americans to lose benefits and threatened to shut down federal agencies due to lack of funding.Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after losing November’s election, came under pressure on Sunday from lawmakers on both sides to stop blocking the pandemic aid and government funding bill which was approved by Congress last week.The Republican president has demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2,000 from $600.Many economists agree that the financial aid in the bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by coronavirus lockdowns is still urgently needed.Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted until mid-March if Trump signs the bill.Adding to the uncertainty, the package includes $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump does not sign the legislation, then a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday that would put millions of government workers’ incomes at risk, unless Congress steps in with a stop-gap measure the president accepts.Republican Senator Pat Toomey told “Fox News Sunday” that Trump should approve the bill now, then push for more unemployment money later.“I understand the president would like to send bigger checks to everybody. I think what he ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case. Congress can pass another bill,” Toomey said.“You don’t get everything you want, even if you are the president of the United States,” he said. After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in coronavirus financial relief, despite offering no objections to the terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the standoff with Congress as he spent several hours at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He has also complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid.A bipartisan group of lawmakers who were involved in crafting the relief bill urged Trump to sign it immediately. But, they added, if he is determined to veto it, he should do so quickly to “allow those in favor to act before it is too late.”“This act will show your support for the American people who are in need of emergency lifelines like food, shelter, unemployment benefits and small business relief during these challenging times,” they said in a statement.Senator Bernie Sanders said of the delay: “What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel.” “We are dealing with an unprecedented moment in American history. So many people are hurting,” he told ABC News’ “This Week” show. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, urged Trump to “finally do the right thing for the American people and stop worrying about his ego.” Benefit paymentsAmericans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began.The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution.Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, said Trump’s refusal to sign the economic stimulus bill was difficult to fathom.“I don’t get the point,” Kinzinger told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Unless it’s just to create chaos, and show power, and be upset because you lost the election.”The US Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, is preparing to return to work.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives plans to vote on Monday on legislation providing one-time $2,000 checks to people, but Republican lawmakers are already concerned about the cost of the larger package.Without enactment of the broad relief and funding bill, the US government runs out of money at midnight Dec. 28. If the battle with Trump is not resolved by then, Congress must either pass a stopgap funding bill or federal agencies will not have money to fully operate beginning Tuesday. That scenario could be avoided if both the House and Senate pass a funding bill that is separate from the pandemic legislation and the president signs it by midnight Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-heads-toward-chaotic-end-to-2020-as-trump-fights-congress/story-PL0y2d9DLJ1XTVKU6R6g3N.html
28-12-2020||World||Despite hi-tech advances, many Europeans wary of taking Covid shot||Europe rolled out a huge Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday to try to rein in the coronavirus pandemic but many Europeans are sceptical about the speed at which the vaccines have been tested and approved and reluctant to have the shot.The European Union has secured contracts with a range of drugmakers including Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, for a total of more than two billion doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated next year.But surveys have pointed to high levels of hesitancy towards inoculation in countries from France to Poland, with many used to vaccines taking decades to develop, not just months.“I don’t think there’s a vaccine in history that has been tested so quickly,” Ireneusz Sikorski, 41, said as he stepped out of a church in central Warsaw with his two children.“I am not saying vaccination shouldn’t be taking place. But I am not going to test an unverified vaccine on my children, or on myself.”Surveys in Poland, where distrust in public institutions runs deep, have shown fewer than 40% of people planning to get vaccinated, for now. On Sunday, only half the medical staff in a Warsaw hospital where the country’s first shot was administered had signed up.In Spain, one of Europe’s hardest-hit countries, German, a 28-year-old singer and music composer originally from Tenerife, also plans to wait for now.“No one close to me has had it (Covid-19). I’m obviously not saying it doesn’t exist because lots of people have died of it, but for now I wouldn’t have it (the vaccine).”A Christian Orthodox bishop in Bulgaria, where 45% of people have said they would not get a shot and 40% plan to wait to see if any negative side effects appear, compared Covid-19 to polio.“Myself, I am vaccinated against everything I can be,” Bishop Tihon told reporters after getting his shot, standing alongside the health minister in Sofia.He spoke about anxiety over polio before vaccination became available in the 1950s and 1960s.“We were all trembling in fear of catching polio. And then we were overjoyed,” he said. “Now, we have to convince people. It’s a pity.”GREAT LEAP FORWARDThe widespread hesitancy does not appear to take into account the scientific developments in recent decades. The traditional method of creating vaccines – introducing a weakened or dead virus, or a piece of one, to stimulate the body’s immune system – takes over a decade on average, according to a 2013 study. One pandemic flu vaccine took over eight years while a hepatitis B vaccine was nearly 18 years in the making.Moderna’s vaccine, based on the so-called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology, went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.“We’ll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: ‘That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward’,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust.The Pfizer/BioNTech shot has been linked with a few cases of severe allergic reactions as it has been rolled out in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has not turned up any serious long-term side effects in clinical trials. Independent pollster Alpha Research said its recent survey suggested that fewer than one in five Bulgarians from the first groups to be offered the vaccine - frontline medics, pharmacists, teachers and nursing home staff - planned to volunteer to get a shot.An IPSOS survey of 15 countries published on Nov. 5 showed then that 54% of French would have a Covid vaccine if one were available. The figure was 64% in Italy and Spain, 79% in Britain and 87% in China.A later IFOP poll - which did not have comparative data for other countries - showed that only 41% people in France would take the shot.In Sweden, where public trust in authorities runs high like elsewhere across the Nordics, more than two people in three want to be immunised. Still, some say no. “If someone gave me 10 million euro, I wouldn’t take it,” Lisa Renberg, 32, said on Wednesday.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged Poles on Sunday to sign up for vaccination, saying the herd immunity effect depended on them.Critics have said Warsaw’s nationalist leaders have been too accepting of anti-vaccination attitudes in the past in an effort to garner conservative support.

28-12-2020||World||US Army sergeant charged in Illinois bowling alley shooting that killed 3||A US Army special forces sergeant based in Florida has been charged in an apparently random shooting at an Illinois bowling alley that left three people dead and three wounded, authorities said Sunday.Winnebago County State’s Attorney J. Hanley said Duke Webb, 37, has been charged with three counts of murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder in the shooting at Don Carter Lanes, in Rockford, on Saturday evening. While no bowling is currently allowed due to state-imposed coronavirus restrictions, a bar linked to the business was legally open.Webb was taken into custody shortly after the shooting at around 7 p.m., Rockford Police Chief Dan O’Shea said at a news conference Sunday morning.“I am very confident the officers that were on the scene in the building were able to stop further violence,” O’Shea said.He said the three who died were all men, aged 73, 65 and 69, but did not provide names.Additionally, he said, a 14-year-old boy was shot in the face and airlifted to a hospital in Madison in stable condition, and a 16-year-old girl who was shot in the shoulder was treated at a hospital and released. A 62-year-old man underwent surgery overnight after suffering multiple gunshot wounds and is in critical condition, the chief said.The suspect has no known ties to the victims, O’Shea said.“We believe this was a completely random act, and there is no prior meeting or any kind of relationship between the suspect and any of the victims in this case,” O’Shea said. He did not provide information on what led up to the shooting.The US Army said Webb is a Special Forces Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant assigned to 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), located at Camp Bull Simons, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. He joined the Army in 2008 and was on leave Saturday.“We are shocked and saddened to learn about this tragic event and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded,” Col. John W. Sannes, commander of 7th Special Forces Group, said in a statement.The bowling alley was closed at the time of the shooting, in accordance with restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, O’Shea said. But a bar upstairs was open. The chief said the upstairs venue has double doors that open to the outside, ensuring the bar is in compliance with Illinois’ Covid-19 mitigation guidance.Up to 25 people were at Don Carter Lanes when the shooting happened, but most of them escaped or hid, O’Shea said. He declined to say whether the shootings happened in the bar or elsewhere in the building, saying those details would come out in court. The teens who were wounded were picking up food at the carryout section of the bowling alley, he said.He said the suspect tried to conceal his weapons before his arrest, and that he was apprehended without officers firing a shot.“Most of the incident was captured on surveillance video from inside the business,” O’Shea said, adding that investigators are studying captured images.O’Shea said investigators are in touch with the Army. He didn’t explain why the Florida man was in Illinois. The Army said it will provide full assistance in the police investigation.The Rockford Register Star reported that 2020 has been the deadliest year on record for homicides in the city of about 170,000 residents about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. Thirty-five people have been killed in the city this year, breaking the previous record of 31 in 1996.“As we come to the end of this most difficult year and we look ahead at this New Year upon us, we know that this type of violence needs to stop,” Mayor Tom McNamara said. “... And today, with the eyes of the country upon us, we need to show as Rockfordians how we respond to an incident such as this, as one Rockford, supporting one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-army-sergeant-charged-in-illinois-bowling-alley-shooting-that-killed-3/story-SOzUdo8rz1uQQIyeV3DPSK.html
28-12-2020||World||Chinese official holds talks on Nepal crisis||A senior official of the Chinese Communist Party on Sunday met Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari as part of efforts to resolve a rift between factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Guo Yezhou, vice minister in the international department of the CPC, is the most senior foreign official to visit Nepal since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli last Sunday dissolved parliament and called for early parliamentary election.Oli’s shock move triggered deep political unrest and street protests in Nepal and left the NCP on the verge of a split. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, is expected to meet Oli, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali, leaders of the party faction led by Prachanda, and Janata Samajwadi Party leader Baburam Bhattarai. His visit follows unsuccessful efforts by Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi to resolve the impasse. Guo will assess the situation and encourage NCP leaders to seek “some kind of common ground for party unity”, The Kathmandu Post reported citing political leaders. China’s efforts are in marked contrast to the position taken by India on Oli’s decision to dissolve parliament and call snap elections. New Delhi has said this is an internal matter that should be handled in keeping with Nepal’s democratic processes. China has poured millions of dollars into Nepal as aid, and infrastructure investment as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.

28-12-2020||World||As end approaches, Trump gets doses of flattery, finality||President Donald Trump’s administration is ending how it began, with over-the-top declarations of praise for the chief executive.But now the flattery is mixed with a sense of finality as key people in the president’s orbit are beginning to turn the page and acknowledge his defeat. Trump himself keeps to the Oval Office, still fighting the Election Day results and offering scant acknowledgement of the death and suffering Americans are bearing in the darkest hours of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a week when the Electoral College made official President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, Trump remained out of sight, staying late in the Oval Office and working the phones and television remote in his private dining area just steps from the Resolute Desk.While he made not one public appearance, some of those who have been his most influential allies and loyal defenders gave up the fight, letting the president down as gently as possible.Attorney General William Barr offered his resignation last Monday after weeks of tension with Trump brought about an early exit from his post. Long seen as one of Trump’s most supportive Cabinet members, Barr in recent weeks and months had drawn Trump’s wrath for not supporting the president’s baseless claims of election fraud or for not publicly pursuing an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter.But when Barr stepped aside, he did so with flowery language reminiscent of the compliments that were tossed as verbal bouquets at Trump during early Cabinet meetings.“Your record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance,” Barr wrote in his resignation letter. Trump promptly tweeted it out, adding his own words of praise for the attorney general.In the six weeks since his defeat by Biden, Trump has been increasingly disengaged from his job. The virus has killed more than 300,000 Americans and is now claiming more than 3,000 lives a day, but the president has offered barely a word about the deaths or the development of the vaccine that could bring an end to the pandemic.At the same time, he has relentlessly tweeted conspiracy theories and false claims about the election, incorrectly insisting it was stolen from him while taking steps to undermine the Biden administration before it begins. Most Republicans went along, refusing to push Trump to stop or work with the president-elect.Many in the GOP took their cues from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refused to stand up to Trump, instead making the calculation that an outraged Republican base — and an angry president — could help produce victories in a pair of January runoff races in Georgia that will dictate control of the Senate. But this past week, even McConnell, R-Ky., bent to reality, declaring that the Electoral College “had spoken” and that Biden was the victor.McConnell’s acknowledgement that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris had won came only after a long public recap of Trump’s accomplishments on the Senate floor. McConnell spoke about Trump for nine minutes, declaring that “many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result.” He discussed Biden for one minute.Some more of Trump’s fiercest allies also appeared to give credence, albeit briefly, to the electoral result. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a cable television appearance that Trump was in strong position for a possible 2024 campaign — a roundabout acknowledgement that he won’t be president come next year.Others close to Trump also marked the looming end. His daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump began tweeted photos of moments throughout the term. His son Eric Trump and his family posed for photos just outside the Oval Office. West Wing staffers put up photos on Instagram of White House Christmas parties, and most of those pictured weren’t wearing masks.Vice President Mike Pence continued his role as Trump’s biggest hype man, even as the cheerleading came with a whiff of nostalgia. Pence in a ceremony Friday marked the first anniversary of the US Space Force, which he framed as a major part of Trump’s legacy.But with Trump largely in hiding, it fell to Pence to make a public show of meeting with those distributing the vaccine. And on Friday, he was the one who rolled up his sleeves and took a public shot in the arm as part of a campaign to convince Americans the vaccine is safe.Trump has been happy to bask in praise throughout his presidency. His Cabinet meetings at times resembled “Dear Leader” sessions in authoritarian nations where officials gush compliments for the man in charge.The tone was set at the president’s first Cabinet meeting, in June 2017, when the only subject for debate appeared to whether Trump was a great president or the greatest. With the media invited to watch, Trump extolled the achievements of his young administration, asserting that he had accomplished more than any president in his first six months — with “few exceptions,” like President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Pence that day declared his job was “the greatest privilege of my life.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was “thrilled,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry gave his “hats off” to Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered thanks “for the opportunity” to work for the president.Perhaps the strongest words came from chief of staff Reince Priebus: “On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.”On Wednesday, Trump convened his 25th and perhaps final Cabinet meeting. Much had changed.Several top officials were not there, including Barr, whose resignation was pending; acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who had tested positive for Covid-19; and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was quarantining because he had been exposed to someone with the virus.Whether there was effusive praise of Trump remains unknown.The president did not let the media in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-end-approaches-trump-gets-doses-of-flattery-finality/story-xNjv5MsglKIDULKtuH0BwN.html

The list included the names of Rajeev Mishra and Bholanath Pandey. Earlier this month, soon after the attack on Nadda’s convoy on December 20, the Union ministry of home affairs had posted three IPS officers from the state on central deputation for five years. The officers were responsible for Nadda’s security. The state, however, declined to release them leading to a tussle with the Centre. Chef Minister Mamata Banerjee had then tweeted saying that the Centre’s order was unconstitutional and completely unacceptable. According to top government officials, IG (south Bengal) Rajeev Mishra was posted as IG of Indo-Tibetan Border Police, DIG (Presidency Range) Praveen Tripathi was posted as DIG, Sashastra Seema Bal and SP of Diamond Harbour, Bholanath Pandey, was posted as SP of Bureau of Police Research and Development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-caught-in-centre-state-tussle-promoted-by-mamata-banerjee-govt/story-FWFFINYzD40HraLZpz5NCI.html
28-12-2020||India||NCW writes to Hyderabad varsity to probe complaints of sexual harassment on campus||The National Commission for Women has written a letter to the chancellor of the Maulana Azad National Urdu University in Hyderabad to probe a complaint that it has received about illegal activities such as alleged prostitution, running of a sex racket and drugs at the health centre in the campus. In a letter dated December 17, the NCW has said it received a complaint from a Telangana resident that the administration has not been paying any attention to a complaint about these activities and has not conducted any enquiry in the matter. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said, “We received a complaint from a resident and a member has written to university chancellor Feroz Bakht Ahmed to undertake an inquiry.” The complainant‘s letter which has also been sent to the Prime Minister’s Office claims that girl students who have in the past complained of sexual harassment by a professor are “threatened to take the complaint back or face the music”. The complainant has also alleged that a fact finding team set up by the UGC that had gathered complaints from students, had earlier given the vice chancellor a clean-chit. While Bakht could not be reached, MANUU in-charge vice chancellor Prof S M Rahmatullah did not take calls or respond to text messages. However, a senior faculty in the university, who refused to be quoted, said no such case of sexual harassment had come to light in the university in the recent past. “There was an instance of a girl student making such a complaint against a faculty member at least three years ago, but the issue was closed after a due inquiry. At least in public domain, there are no such complaints after that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-writes-to-hyderabad-varsity-to-probe-complaints-of-sexual-harassment-on-campus/story-d0hKzJ8hyvKfuid4H635NL.html
28-12-2020||India||Nitish became Bihar CM on NDA’s request: Sushil Modi||PATNA A day after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said he had expressed no desire to become the chief minister and that his Janata Dal (United) party’s ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party could have picked its own CM, former deputy CM of the state, Sushil Kumar Modi, of the BJP, struck a conciliatory note and said Kumar had been reluctant to accept the state’s top post after the recent assembly elections and relented only after all National Democratic Alliance constituents in the state requested him to do so.“It is true that Nitish Kumar showed reluctance to continue as chief minister after the assembly polls and said the BJP should stake claim for the top post,” Modi, now a Rajya Sabha member, said on Monday.Modi, who is known to have an excellent equation with Nitish Kumar, was responding to queries on the sidelines of a function organised here on the birth anniversary of former Union minister Arun Jaitley.Kumar, who was chosen as CM despite his party winning just 43 seats (the BJP won 74 in the 243-member assembly), said at the JD (U) national executive meeting on Sunday that he was pressured to become the chief minister. “I didn’t have any intention to become the CM, but was pressured into accepting the post,” he had said.“Whoever becomes the CM, it hardly affects me. I don’t have any urge to continue on this post. I wanted a BJP CM and am (still) ready to co-operate,” he said.Kumar’s statement, which came two days after six JD (U) MLAs defected to the ruling BJP in Arunachal Pradesh, points to a divide developing in the ruling alliance.JD (U)’s national principal general secretary K C Tyagi also expressed anguish over repeated references to Kumar being the CM despite his party’s diminished strength in the assembly. He underscored that Kumar had initially expressed the opinion that the BJP, on account of its superior numerical strength, should have its own chief minister.He also ruled out the possibility of deterioration in relations between the two parties following the en masse defection of JD(U) MLAs to the BJP in Arunachal Pradesh.Modi too expressed similar sentiments. “The JD(U) itself has said that events taking place in another state will not affect the party’s tie-up with BJP in Bihar. I am confident that the NDA will rule Bihar for another five years, with Nitish Kumar at the helm, without any problem,” he said. “There is excellent coordination between the two parties.”Remembering Jaitley, he said, “I am sure had he been around, he would have found a way out of the current deadlock around the farm bills.”BJP’s spokesperson Nikhil Anand said that Kumar has put Bihar on the path to development. “He was again elected leader by NDA legislators and we are sure that he will continue to take Bihar forward .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-became-bihar-cm-on-nda-s-request-sushil-modi/story-RIaOEUhh3k735Iiz9vysKI.html
28-12-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi not on holiday, has gone to meet grandmother, sick relative: Congress||After the BJP criticised Rahul Gandhi for his visit abroad, the Congress on Monday said he has gone to meet an ailing relative and his grandmother and is not on a holiday. Asked about Rahul Gandhi’s absence from the party’s foundation day function at the AICC headquarters, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala came out in defence of Gandhi, saying he is currently not the party chief and has performed all the duties entrusted to him by the organisation. The former party chief left for Italy on Sunday afternoon, a day ahead of the party’s 136th foundation day, prompting many BJP leaders to take a swipe at him and the Congress. “Rahul Gandhi’s holiday in India has ended and he has gone back to Italy,” Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh had tweeted. Surjewala said the BJP should not have any objection to Gandhi visiting an ailing relative. “Rahul Gandhi has gone out on a short personal visit to meet up with an ailing relative, who is seriously sick. He has not gone out on a holiday. He also meets up with his maternal grandmother this time of the year, every year. I don’t think the BJP should have objections to him visiting an ailing relative,” he told reporters. He said today the issue is not about Rahul Gandhi but of farmers protesting in the cold, and alleged that the prime minister or his ministers do not have time to meet them. “Why don’t the ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the prime minister of the country take care of the farmers? Instead of abusing the opposition, why don’t they pay attention to running the country? “Why doesn’t the prime minister and minister go 20 kilometers and talk to the farmers? Why is the prime minister so arrogant that he is not ready to talk to farmers,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-not-on-holiday-has-gone-to-meet-grandmother-sick-relative-congress/story-1U8ZhrdLzEsfrD4qR6otMP.html

28-12-2020||India||Goa arrivals at ‘near-normal’ ahead of New Year’s eve||Flight arrivals in Goa have touched the highest levels since the pandemic began with the once-busy airport handling 72 arrivals and departures on December 27, - highest since domestic flights resumed operation - in the strongest indication that year-end holidaying has not been dampened by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, this enthusiasm could be there only for the New Year celebrations which is the biggest attraction in Goa where tourism contributes to 18 per cent of the state gross domestic product (SGDP).“There has been a consistent increase in domestic operations at the Goa International Airport. We have now touched 85 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels when it comes to domestic air traffic,” Goa’s airport director Gagan Malik said.Trends across December, which has traditionally been the busiest month for the Goa Airport, have brought good cheer to Goa’s tourism industry that has felt the hardest blow of the lockdown in the summer.Arrivals have shown a marked increase in Goa across December.Also read: India’s first indigenous pneumonia vaccine by SII launchedTowards the end of November, the airport was handling 48 arrivals and departures which increased to 54 in the first week of December and further rose to 63 just ahead of Christmas on December 23.Goa’s roads and beaches, which earlier this year witnessed only thin traffic and few footfalls as people were hesitant to step out, are now witnessing crowds and traffic jams almost similar to pre-covid times.“Tourism has picked up and some hotels, especially the starred ones are witnessing 80 per cent occupancy. Some of the small and medium hotels are yet to reopen for business but things look positive. Credit to the Goa government for keeping a consistent policy and not introducing a fresh lockdown once we had reopened,” said Nilesh Shah, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa.“Goa is benefitting from being a safe destination to travel too since our Covid-19 cases have reduced significantly unlike Kerala which has seen a resurgence,” Shah added.According to the association, out of the 4,100 registered hotels in Goa, 1,300 are yet to reopen their doors indicating that the industry is still to feel the effects of the pandemic. Hotels have slashed rates by around 15-20 per cent in a bid to encourage people to travel. He added that certain sectors of the tourism industry, including mega-events, large have gatherings as well as the lack of foreign arrivals, has continued to hamper the industry.The industry is, however, keeping its fingers crossed over a possible resurgence in Covid-19 cases and is expecting a reduction in numbers across January and February.According to a report by KPMG Ltd, authored at the behest of the Goa government, Goa’s tourism industry may have suffered a loss of between Rs 2,000 to Rs 7,200 crore and job losses in the range of 35 per cent to 58 per cent on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-arrivals-at-near-normal-level-ahead-of-new-year-s-eve/story-DpmYTmJqRekMej1N4wFjmJ.html

28-12-2020||India||Karnataka cabinet passes ordinance to ban cow slaughter in state||The Karnataka cabinet on Monday passed an ordinance to ban cow slaughter in the state after the bill could not be passed in the upper house of the legislature where the ruling BJP does not enjoy a majority.Law minister J Madhuswamy was quick to clarify that beef consumption in the state was not banned as buffaloes will continue to be slaughtered.The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle bill was passed in the winter session of the assembly amid slogans of ‘Gau Mata Ki Jai’ and BJP members sporting saffron scarves but it was not presented in the legislative council. The regional JDS declared that it would not support the bill, unlike the support it extended in passing agricultural landholding reform bills.Madhuswamy also said that the government would look into establishing gaushalas (cow shelters) across the state to take care of old and infirm cows in case they are abandoned by their owners. “The law itself is not new. Earlier there was a ban of the slaughter of cows under the age of 13. Now there is a blanket ban on the killing of any cow. However, buffaloes can be slaughtered.” The ordinance will be sent to the Governor for his assent in a day the minister added and after his consent will become law.Meanwhile, leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramiah while speaking at the Congress foundation day event said “I had once said in the assembly that I like eating cattle meat. Who is anybody to question us? Food habits are my right. If you don’t like it, don’t eat. I like to eat and I will. Does it need courage to say this?”Siddaramiah said that while farmers worshipped the cow as gau mata, he asked what should be done to old and unproductive cows as it costs Rs 100 per day per cow for a farmer to take care. “We should not be scared of expressing our feelings. We should come out of such confusion,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cabinet-passes-ordinance-to-ban-cow-slaughter-in-state/story-JiY4mdaxsDxdZTtauoddxO.html

Under the initiative, the weekly-offs would be provided to the head-constables and constables posted in the nine hill districts of Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Champawat, Pithoragarh, Uttarkashi, Almora and Bageshwar. Director General of Police Ashok Kumar said, the initiative has been started as an experiment in the hill districts in the initial phase. “The move will help in increasing their efficiency and morale while on duty. If successful, this would be extended in the four plain districts of Dehradun, Nainital, US Nagar and Haridwar,” said Kumar. The state police chief, however, informed that the “personnel on weekly-off would not be allowed to leave his police headquarters jurisdiction”. “In case of an emergency situation such as a disaster, an accident or a law and order situation, the personnel may be called to duty if needed by his police station in-charge or police check post in-charge,” Kumar said. The development has come days after Kumar announced a flurry of reforms for the “modernisation and increasing efficiency of the department” after taking charge as DGP of the state.

Principal secretary of law department Shashikant Mishra said since September this year, 33 departments in the state were asked to list the obsolete laws that can be repealed. “From the initial list of 699 laws, we have decided to repeal 206 laws in the first phase. After the State Law Commission recommended for their repeal, the Cabinet approved it. The laws would be repealed through Odisha Repealing Bill 2021 to be moved in the Budget session of the Assembly,” he said.Among the 206 Acts and laws that the Odisha Repealing Bill 2021 wants to scrap is the Odisha Motor Spirit (Taxationon sales) Amendment Act, 1974, Odisha Entertainment Tax (Amendment)Act, 1975, Odisha Electricity Duty (Amendment) Act, 2010, Orissa Police Amendment Act, 1976 - which regulates black-marketing in cinema halls - and Orissa Police Amendment Act, 1975 - which made it liable for people of an area to pay penalty if they failed to provide timely help in case of destruction of property - have also gone redundant. Similarly, Orissa Prevention of Gambling Act, 1955, would also be repealed.Orissa Eyes (Authorities for use for therapeutic purposes) Act, 1985, that is no longer valid after Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act was passed by the Parliament in 1994, and Orissa Fireworks and Loudspeakers Amendment Act 1979 that empowered the district collectors to stop the display of fireworks and use of loudspeaker in an area for six months, would be repealed. Similarly, at least eight Acts under Bihar Odisha Excise Amendment Act between 1974 and 1998 have become obsolete after the Odisha Excise Act 2005 was passed.The last time Odisha had repealed over 100 old and obsolete Acts was in 1978 when the Janata Party government, headed by the then chief minister Nilamani Routray, was in power in the state. In Centre, the Narendra Modi government has repealed more than 1,400 obsolete Acts after it came to power in 2014. The move came after the Law Commission found that a large number of Appropriation Acts passed earlier still continued.The Odisha Cabinet also approved a resolution proposing quota in medical and engineering courses for students of government-run schools in the state. As per the proposal, students completing their education in state-run schools will have a reservation during admission into medical and engineering courses.A high-powered committee will be formed under the chairmanship of a retired Orissa High Court judge to fix the modalities in three months for the effective implementation of the recommendations from the next academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-repeal-over-200-obsolete-laws-in-budget-session-next-year/story-XVH4DsPV43AqhEFn4i7ipM.html
28-12-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan takes the ordinance route against ‘love jihad’||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Monday that an ordinance to ban dubious inter-faith marriages would be brought on Tuesday after a discussion in a cabinet meeting. Chouhan’s statement came when journalists asked him whether the government would bring an ordinance on the inter-faith marriages after the state assembly’s winter session was postponed. “The state government will bring the Freedom of Religion ordinance on Tuesday,” Chouhan said.The government could not table the bill - the Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Bill, 2020 - on such marriages called “Love jihad” in the state assembly’s winter session as the three-day session scheduled to be held from Monday was postponed due to prevailing Covid-19 situation after an all-party meeting chaired by the protem speaker Rameshwar Sharma on Sunday evening. Though the CM did not elaborate on the ordinance, it is likely to have all the provisions of the bills, officials said. Governor Anandiben Patel reached Bhopal on Monday and is expected to sign the ordinance, according to officials. Notably, the bill approved by the state cabinet on Saturday provides for up to 10 years in jail for “forcing women, minors, and people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to undergo religious conversion” with a special clause on no punitive action against those returning to their original religion. As per the bill, the marriages solemnised in violation of the law would be deemed null and void and re-conversion to the ancestral religion would not be treated as a conversion and punishable offence. “Love jihad” is an imaginary the right-wing conspiracy theory that Muslim men seduce Hindu women and lure them into marriage with an intention to convert them to Islam.The proposed legislation was supposed to replace the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, according to Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra who briefed journalists after the cabinet meeting on Saturday. According to Mishra, the bill was different from the Uttar Pradesh government’s legislation promulgated through an ordinance on November 25. Unlike the MP bill, the UP ordinance does not provide for parental property rights to children of an interfaith marriage, monthly maintenance and a fine of Rs 50,000 for an inter-religion union without permission of the district magistrate.

The department has also sought an explanation from district-level teachers. “It was not intentional and it is being sorted out,” said a senior official of the department. “A teacher at the district level did not unfortunately understand the right image to use for a figure who is likely to be politicised.” The department convened a meeting on Monday with principals of the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) who have been given the task of digital content creation and broadcast material for Kalvi TV. “We have asked for an explanation. We have sensitized our people to be cautious about what they are doing because once it’s on air, we are accountable. The sensitivity of the people should be taken into account,” the official said. Thiruvalluvar is usually attired in white robes which is the image used widely and officially by the Tamil Nadu government. In a segment to explain Thirukkural, which is a collection of 1,330 couplets on life, ethics and morality, written by Thiruvalluvar, the channel had used an image of him clad in saffron with sacred ash on his forehead. Since schools are closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, students of low-cost private schools subscribe to lectures broadcast on Kalvi TV which was launched last August.This was brought to light after Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLA and former school education minister Thangam Thennarasu released a statement on Sunday condemning the ‘saffronisation’ of Thiruvalluvar. In 2019, a controversy erupted when the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Tamil Nadu unit tweeted a picture of Thiruvalluvar replacing his white robes with saffron drawing the ire of Dravidian and Left parties. “Though they are saying that it is a mistake, it shows the AIADMK in poor light,” said Thennarasu. “Thiruvalluvar’s appearance is known for ages. How does a lower-level staff have the courage to release this image unless the AIADMK is seen as adopting BJP’s thinking? BJP has used this image for political reasons but how can the government use a similar image on an educational channel?” He sought action against the person responsible. Following Thennarasu’s statement, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief TTV Dhinakaran tweeted that the ancient philosopher belonged to all notwithstanding religion. A person in the office of the school education minister, K A Sengottaiyan, said that he had communicated to the department to ensure that the ‘mistake is not repeated’. In public functions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often quoted from Thirukkural and in 2019 he released a Thai translation of Thirukkural from Tamil in an event in Bangkok which also showed Thiruvallur in a white dhoti and no holy ash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-govt-admits-using-image-of-saffron-clad-thiruvalluvar-was-an-error-seeks-answers/story-zjX6MupojWdhottXQYiecN.html

28-12-2020||India||BJP placates Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi says he will remain CM||A day after Nitish Kumar said he had no desire to remain Bihar chief minister and that his party JD(U)’s ally Bharatiya Janata Party could make its own CM, his former deputy Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP, struck a conciliatory note on Monday.Modi said Kumar was reluctant to accept the state’s top post after the recent Assembly elections and relented only after all NDA constituents in the state requested him to lead the state.“It is true that Nitish Kumar had shown reluctance to continue as chief minister after the Assembly polls and said the BJP should stake claim for the top post,” Modi, now a Rajya Sabha member, said.Modi, who is known to have an excellent equation with Nitish Kumar, having worked as the CM’s deputy for long, was responding to queries on the sidelines of a function organised here on the birth anniversary of former Union minister Arun Jaitley.Nitish Kumar, who was elected the NDA leader despite his party winning just 43 seats, had said at the JD (U) national executive meeting on Sunday that he was pressured to become the chief minister. “I didn’t have any intention to become the CM, but was pressured into accepting the post,” he had said.“Whoever becomes the CM, it hardly affects me. I don’t have any urge to continue on this post. I wanted a BJP CM and am ready to cooperate,” he said.Kumar’s statement, which came two days after six JD (U) MLAs defected to the ruling BJP in Arunachal Pradesh, points to a divide developing in the ruling alliance.JD (U)’s national principal general secretary K C Tyagi also expressed anguish over repeated references to the chief minister continuing in his chair despite his party now having far fewer MLAs than the BJP.He underscored that Kumar had initially expressed the opinion that the BJP, on account of its superior numerical strength, should have its own chief minister.He also ruled out the possibility of deterioration in relations between the two parties following the en masse defection of JD(U) MLAs to BJP in Arunachal Pradesh.Modi too expressed similar sentiments. “JD(U) itself has said that events taking place in another state will not affect the party’s tie-up with BJP in Bihar. I am confident that the NDA will rule Bihar for another five years, with Nitish Kumar at the helm, without any problem,” he said. “There is excellent coordination between the two parties.”BJP’s spokesperson Nikhil Anand said that Kumar had been the leader of alliance since 2005 and taken Bihar on roads of development. “He was again elected leader by NDA legislators and we are sure that he will continue to take Bihar forward further,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-placates-nitish-kumar-sushil-modi-says-he-will-remain-cm/story-XfzaJouUeiKGmplIGoj7PL.html
28-12-2020||India||Congress seeks Smriti Irani’s resignation over charges levelled by shooter||The Congress on Monday demanded the resignation of Union minister Smriti Irani over charges of corruption levelled against her by an international shooter, and said a thorough probe should be initiated to ascertain the truth.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference that the charges levelled are serious and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should order an independent judicial probe to punish the guilty.International shooter Vartika Singh had recently moved court accusing the Union textile minister and two others for demanding money to make her a member of the central women’s commission, days after she was herself named in a police complaint.The MP-MLA court in Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur has fixed January 2 for a hearing after which it will decide if the case falls under its jurisdiction, according to her lawyer.The shooter has alleged that people close to Irani issued her a fake letter, appointing her as a member of the central women’s commission, a possible reference to the National Commission for Women.Surjewala said serious charges of corruption have been levelled against the Union minister. If such charges would have been levelled against a minister during the UPA, Smriti Irani would have sat on a dharna outside the Congress office, he said. “Smriti Irani should resign and face an independent probe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should ask her to resign. Why does he not order an independent judicial inquiry against her, as no ordinary person but an international shooter and a decorated daughter has levelled the charges,” he told reporters.This is also Prime Minister’s test and he should order a judicial probe in the matter. We expect Smriti Irani and the PM to reply to the charges, the Congress leader added. Irani’s legal counsel Kirat Nagra had said the case filed against her by shooter Vartika Singh was based on “the most bizarre and mischievous set of falsehoods” and that “political patronage” was writ large on the matter.Nagra said the case was a concerted attempt to bring disrepute to and defame the minister, adding that she will take legal recourse against the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-seeks-smriti-irani-s-resignation-over-charges-levelled-by-shooter/story-NSlZFxPXxqZgsfvAVf8yuL.html
28-12-2020||India||Top Chinese official continues talks, tries to heal rift within Nepal’s ruling party||A top Chinese official met leaders of a faction of the Nepal Communist Party opposed to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday even as Beijing called on the leadership in Kathmandu to manage differences and ensure political stability. Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the international department of the central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), who arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday afternoon, met separately with former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Madhav Kumar Nepal, both rivals of Oli in the ruling party. The meetings came a day after Guo held talks with President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Oli as part of China’s efforts to broker a rapprochement between the two factions of the Nepal Communist Party, which has been split by Oli’s decision to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections next year. Prachanda’s office said the meeting focused on the political situation, especially the aftermath of the dissolution of Parliament by Oli and unity between the factions of the Nepal Communist Party, according to reports in the Nepalese media. The Chinese delegation urged Prachanda and Nepal to maintain unity within the ruling party, the media reports said. The leaders reportedly told the Chinese delegation that a lot would depend on Oli’s stance, including whether he would be willing to withdraw the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The Chinese officials also met former Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal and Speaker Agni Sapkota, and will hold talks with Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba on Tuesday. The Indian side has maintained a studied silence on the visit by a four-member Chinese delegation led by Guo, seen as an old South Asia hand, with people familiar with developments saying on condition of anonymity that New Delhi has decided not to play any role in addressing the political uncertainty in Kathmandu. The external affairs ministry has already said that Oli’s actions were an internal matter and the situation should be handled in line with Nepal’s democratic processes. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing that China, as Nepal’s “friend and close neighbour”, hopes that the relevant parties in Kathmandu “can take into account the national interests and the big picture, properly manage internal differences and commit themselves to political stability”. He was responding to a question on whether the Chinese delegation will try to promote reconciliation between the factions in the Nepal Communist Party. Asked about the purpose of Guo’s visit, Zhao said the Communist Party of China has “maintained close and friendly exchanges” with major political parties of Nepal for a long time, and this has “played a positive role in enhancing political mutual trust, deepening mutual learning of state governance, promoting cooperation, and consolidating traditional friendship”. Noting that 2020 marks the 65th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Nepal, Zhao said the Chinese delegation’s visit to Kathmandu is aimed at exchanging views on issues of mutual interest and strengthening cooperation between political parties of the two countries. The Communist Party of China adheres to “non-interference in each other’s internal affairs” in inter-party relations, and stands ready to work with Nepal’s political parties to promote strategic cooperative partnership for the development of the two countries, he added. Guo was despatched to Nepal after Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi didn’t have much success in efforts to engineer a patch up between Oli and Prachanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-chinese-official-continues-talks-tries-to-heal-rift-within-nepal-s-ruling-party/story-vt5qhcLtyJKQhLzqtOK5xM.html

28-12-2020||India||CM Mamata pulls up bureaucrats for delay in govt projects in poll-bound Bengal||With less than five months left for the crucial West Bengal assembly elections, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday seemed to be visibly peeved with some of the state’s bureaucrats and pulled them up over delay in government projects. The chief minister directed the officers to send daily updates on some of the government schemes and services to the chief minister’s office (CMO) at the state secretariat and asked the chief secretary of the state to monitor the developments. The government also launched an outreach program Paraye Paraye Samadhan (solution in every neighbourhood) on Monday to address smaller issues and problems neighbourhoods usually face, which could be fixed at the local level without any major intervention by the state government. But even as the chief minister was launching the outreach program in Birbhum and directing government officials to expedite government services, back in Kolkata a few hundred Self Employed Labour Organisers staged a protest at a program which was attended by three ministers. The SLOs alleged that they were not getting the commission due from the government for the last seven months. Flexes were torn and chairs were hurled at the meet.“The government is repeatedly giving instructions but you are interpreting them in a different manner. People are being turned away. I don’t want to see this. If the lower-level officers do not get proper instructions from the top, how can they be blamed? I want daily reports at the CMO,” Banerjee told the secretary of one of the government departments. The chief minister was holding an administrative meeting in Birbhum district with top bureaucrats from various departments of the state government and district administration. Union home minister Amit Shah, who had held a mega roadshow in the same district on December 20 during his two-day visit to the state to bolster the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election campaign, was impressed with the huge turnout. Banerjee is scheduled to hold a roadshow on the same route on Tuesday. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-member legislative assembly. While the BJP has been targeting the Mamata Banerjee government over lawlessness, stunted development and unemployment in the state among other issues, the ruling Trinamool Congress has been trying to counter them with achievements made by the Banerjee-administration in the last ten years and has launched some outreach programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-pulls-up-bureaucrats-for-delay-in-govt-projects-in-poll-bound-bengal/story-JwObNXQfi2SLjcuKsaqFYM.html

The explosives and the arms were for bomb blasts in Gujarat and Maharashtra on Republic Day in 1997.“Majeed has been hiding here for the past one and half year – first in Telco Barinagar and then in a duplex bungalow in an apartment complex in Mango. He was earlier staying in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Dubai and came after his visa term expired in Malaysia.

He told the police that his other daughter died in March 2019. “He also said that he was doing the export-import business of rice, pulses and dry fruits from Jamshedpur.

Pratyusha, a nurse, married Charan Reddy, a software engineer, at Lourde Matha Church at Patigadda of Kesampet block in Ranga Reddy district in the afternoon in a grand ceremony.The marriage was attended by several politicians including minister for women development and child welfare Satyavathi Rathod, Shadnagar MLA Anjaiah Yadav, zilla parishad vice-chairman Ganesh, commissioner of women development Divya Devarajan and several officials of the department. On Sunday evening, the chief minister’s wife K Shobha attended the pre-wedding ceremony of Pratyusha held at the IAS Officers’ Association Club in Begumpet. She presented a diamond necklace and other jewellery, besides silk clothes to the adopted daughter and wished her a happy married life. KCR, as the chief minister is known, took personal interest in arranging the marriage. When the women development and child welfare department authorities played matchmaker and selected Charan Reddy as the groom a few months ago, he called him to the Chief Minister’s Office and spoke to him. He attended their engagement ceremony held in October. “I have forgotten the past and am ready to lead a new life. It’s an arranged marriage and I am happy about it. I am really blessed to be the adopted daughter of the chief minister and happy that the marriage has taken place with their blessings,” Pratyusha said. She said she had completed her graduation in nursing and acknowledged that got a job in state-run Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences because of KCR. Pratyusha was rescued by the women development and child welfare department authorities in July 2015 from her house at L B Nagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad under shocking circumstances. Pratyusha, who was 19 years old then, was in a frail condition with cuts, burns and bruises all over the body, when the department authorities rescued her with the support of AP Child Rights Association. The L B Nagar police arrested her father C Ramesh, a BSNL employee and step-mother Shyamala and shifted Pratyusha to a corporate hospital. On coming to know about her pathetic condition, Rao along with his wife and daughter K Kavitha, visited her in the hospital and declared that he was adopting her as a second daughter. After she was discharged from the hospital in the last week of July, Pratyusha was taken to KCR’s residence, where she had lunch with the chief minister and his family members. He gave her Rs 5 lakh and got her admitted in a hostel under the department’s surveillance. Later, the department got her a seat in a private nursing college, where she completed her degree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescued-from-torture-5-years-ago-kcr-s-adopted-daughter-pratyusha-marries/story-9YgNeny4hR7bjGZHjbAGYO.html

28-12-2020||India||People with severe Covid-19, secondary blood infections may have worse health outcomes: Study||People with severe Covid-19 who also had secondary infections in the bloodstream were sicker, had longer hospital stays, and worse health outcomes, according to a study that may lead to new treatment strategies. The research, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, is the first to assess the microbiology, risk factors, and outcomes in hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19 and secondary bloodstream infections. In the study researchers from Rutgers University in the US assessed 375 patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 from March to May 2020. They sampled 128 cases from the group that had secondary bloodstream infections -- 92 percent of which were bacterial infections. “These patients were more likely to have altered mental status, lower percent oxygen saturation, septic shock and to be admitted to the intensive care unit compared to those without bloodstream infections,” said study co-lead author Pinki Bhatt from Rutgers University. According to the scientists, patients who needed more advanced types of supplemental oxygen upon hospital admission had higher odds of secondary bloodstream infections. The researchers said the in-hospital mortality rate for these patients was more than 50 per cent, but added that these deaths were associated with -- not caused by -- the condition. They believe these infections in Covid-19 patients may have contributed to the severity of illness, or it may reflect other underlying physiological and immunological complications of Covid-19. According to the study, 80 per cent of all the patients in the study received antimicrobials at some point during hospitalisation, including those who did not have bloodstream infections. “This likely reflects clinicians’ inclination to administer antimicrobials given the limited information on the natural course of this novel disease,” Bhatt said. However, she added that further studies are needed to better understand when to suspect and treat secondary bloodstream infections in severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-with-severe-covid-19-secondary-blood-infections-may-have-worse-health-outcomes-study/story-Rk97IQ3lWPVf6NrEtGCkkN.html
28-12-2020||India||Assam says neighbouring states encroached on its land 56 times in 2020||The Assam government on Monday informed the assembly that the state has faced 56 instances of land encroachment by the neighbouring states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram in 2020.In a written reply to a query by Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said that these 56 cases of land encroachments were reported across 11 districts since January 1 this year.The highest 17 cases were reported from Cachar, which faced violent clashes between the people of Assam and Mizoram, Patowary said on behalf of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who also holds the Home portfolio.One person was killed in clashes in Cachar, he added.Cachar is followed by West Karbi Anglong and Kamrup districts that reported seven instances of land encroachment, the minister said.Other districts where Assam’s land was encroached on are Lakhimpur (six cases), Dhemaji and Karbi Anglong (five each), Jorhat (four), Karimganj (two), and Sadiya, Tinsukia and Sivasagar (one each), Patowary said.To recover the encroached land, the Assam government has written a number of letters to the respective states and the Centre, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-says-neighbouring-states-encroached-on-its-land-56-times-in-2020/story-pEjFQPAuybHeKJgJjdmEqI.html
28-12-2020||India||Bhutanese engineers to train with ISRO for satellite launch next year||Four Bhutanese space engineers arrived in India on Monday to train with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for the launch of their country’s satellite next year as part of New Delhi’s efforts to build space infrastructure under its “neighbourhood first” policy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced during a virtual meeting with his Bhutanese counterpart Lotay Tshering on November 20 that India would launch the small satellite next year. Bhutan’s first nano-satellite Bhutan-1, built with Japan’s assistance, was launched on a SpaceX rocket in 2018. The space engineers from Bhutan’s department of information technology and telecom will undergo the first phase of training at ISRO’s UR Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru from December 28 to February 25. This training will cover theoretical and technical aspects and include visits to laboratories and test facilities, officials said. The Bhutanese team will also work with ISRO to draw up the second phase of training, which will include activities aimed at developing INS-2B satellite for Bhutan. The launch of the satellite is part of India’s efforts to back Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck’s plans to use advanced technology, including ICT and space technology, for developing his country. It also fits in with India’s “neighbourhood first” policy, that has gained fresh impetus amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the border standoff with China. India has been closely working with Bhutan in space technology. In August 2019, Modi and Tshering jointly inaugurated a ground earth station for the South Asia Satellite (SAS) in Thimphu, which was built with ISRO’s support. SAS was launched by India in 2017 for countries in South Asia, and currently provides frees services for television broadcasts and VSATs to members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc). In view of the impact that SAS has on Bhutan’s socio-economic development, especially in areas such as communications and disaster management, the Indian side had offered increased bandwidth on an additional transponder in line with Thimphu’s requirements. The decision to collaborate on the development of a satellite for Bhutan was made during Modi’s visit to Thimphu in August 2019. A joint working group was formed for the project and other activities, including developing a geo-portal system for Bhutan for natural resources and disaster management, using remote sensing and geo-spatial data. “Cooperation in new frontiers such as space technology has been given an impetus by the leadership of the countries and will be bolstered further through the joint development of the small satellite for Bhutan,” the Indian embassy in Thimphu said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhutanese-engineers-to-train-with-isro-for-satellite-launch-next-year/story-x0CZlniVCM9dbV8LdghBuM.html
28-12-2020||India||‘Not stopping our agitation against farm laws’, say Uttarakhand farmers||The intensity of farmers’ protest in Uttarakhand against the three new farm laws is increasing with the protesters insisting that they will march to the borders of New Delhi to join protesters from other states. The intensity of the protest has increased especially in the US Nagar district which has a sizable number of Sikhs, many of whom are farmers. The farmers’ passion was evident on December 25 when more than 1,000 farmers heading towards the Delhi border clashed with a heavy police force that was deployed to stop them at Bazpur. The farmers broke through the barricades on their tractor injuring some policemen. The videos and photographs of the incident made rounds on social media. Later the district police booked about 1,500 unidentified farmers on charges of rioting and stopping police from doing their duty. However, no arrests have been made so far. Many of the farmers who broke through the barricades eventually reached Ghazipur on Delhi’s eastern border where a large number of protesters have already pitched camp.Farmers and Sikh organisations supporting them have now decided to join the agitating farmers near Delhi in larger numbers. “In no way we are going to stop our agitation against the farm laws. After a call by the farmer organisations to head Delhi on December 25, we did that by breaking the police barricades. Now, soon again a similar call is going to be given on which more number of farmers are going to head towards Delhi,” said Gurbaz Singh Virk, US Nagar district president United Sikh Federation who is agitating with the farmers of the district at Ghazipur on Delhi’s border since December 25. Virk said the farmers have drawn a strategy on “how to gather more farmers from all over the state to head to Delhi.” “We have divided all the 13 districts into sectors. From there the farmers would gather in US Nagar and prepare to head to the Delhi border while waiting for the next call of our leaders,” he said. Gurinder Singh Sahni, another farmer from US Nagar agitating against the farm laws, expressed his anger against the government for deploying a large number of police to stop them. “First this government tried to threaten the farmers against the protest by filing a case. Then they deployed a significant police force at the state border with barricades to stop us. What does all this signify? Are we criminals?” said Sahni. Lashing out at the BJP government in Uttarakhand, he said, “When even the Supreme Court had said that the farmers should not be stopped from protesting then why is the government stopping us using the police? We are not going to stop our protest and soon head towards Delhi again.” Sahni said that the Gurudwara management committees or Gurudwara prabandhak committees of the local gurudwaras in US Nagar have also extended their support to the protesting farmers. “We farmers have a very pious relation with Gurudwara because as per Sikhism’s teachings we offer about 10% of our total produce to the Gurudwara’s langar service. Citing this tradition, the Gurudwara prabandhak committee members said that they would fully support us wherever we go,” said Sahni. Amid the ongoing protest by farmers, the Opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Uttarakhand have also put their weight behind the farmers to attack the ruling BJP. On Sunday, Congress state unit in-charge Dushyant Yadav, party state president Pritam Singh and party MLA and All India Congress committee secretary Qazi Nizamuddin joined the agitating farmers at Delhi’s Ghazipur border. The leaders also addressed the farmers’ gathering there. “Since the day the three laws were passed, we have been saying that these are black laws to kill the farmers’ rights. We are against them and fully support the farmers in their protest till they would be repealed,” said Pritam Singh.AAP’s MP from Punjab and senior party leader Bhagwant Mann is scheduled to arrive in Uttarakhand on a two-day tour which begins on Tuesday. He is scheduled to hold a rally and address farmers in US Nagar district where the protest has been intense.The ruling BJP however, accused both the parties of “misleading the farmers and trying to find oxygen for themselves through the farmers’ agitation.” “Both the parties are trying to involve in the farmers’ protest because they don’t have any political ground left in Uttarakhand. Hence, using the protest they are trying to find oxygen for their political lives here,” said Rajendra Bhandari, BJP state general secretary. “As far as the farm laws are concerned, PM Modi on December 25 cleared many misconceptions regarding it. Government is even talking to the farmer organisations on the issue but these two parties are misleading them,” Bhandari added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-stopping-our-agitation-against-farm-laws-say-uttarakhand-farmers/story-RENz4Gf5O1v5GTAIgEPUdM.html
28-12-2020||India||Speeds on Delhi roads drop after lockdown as congestion returns: Report||The mean travel speed on some Delhi stretches dipped from 46 kmph during the lockdown period to 29 kmph after it as the reopening of the economy led to a rebound in congestion, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in a report on Monday.The report is significant as the level of congestion on roads has a strong bearing on vehicular pollution.“The rebound of congestion post-lockdown indicates Delhi is not prepared for transformational changes to cut down the volume of traffic,” the CSE said.It tracked this change with the help of data from the Google Mobility Report on different categories of visits classified as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. It also analysed traffic speed data from Google as a proxy to understand the level of congestion that has a strong bearing on vehicular pollution, which is significant in Delhi. The selected 12 major roads included the MG Road, NH44, Sardar Patel Marg, Outer Ring Road, Dr KB Hegdewar Marg, Sri Aurobindo Marg, NH 9, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, GT Karnal Rd, Lal Bahadur Sha, Dwarka Marg and Najafgarh Marg.The CSE’s travel speed data analysis shows that the mean travel speed on the selected stretches increased from 24 kmph pre-lockdown to 46 kmph during lockdown -- a 90% increase -- when fewer vehicles came on the roads as only essential travels were allowed.But the mean speed reduced again to 29 kmph post-lockdown, it shows.During peak hours, the travel speed on the selected stretches increased from 23 kmph pre-lockdown to 44 kmph during lockdown. But this again reduced to 27 km per hour post-lockdown, it says. The CSE said the rebound of congestion is happening when the public transport ridership in Delhi is still low due to the fear of contracting the virus and the scale of public transport options is still very inadequate to meet the demand. “Public transport is expected to be further constrained by the social distancing norms. This is already encouraging people to shift to private modes of transport,” it said.“Delhi cannot meet its clean air targets if overall traffic and vehicle numbers are not controlled. Delhi Master Plan 2020-21 had set a target of 80% public transport ridership by 2020 that has been missed,” the report reads.The CSE said an 87% drop was recorded in visits to transit stations for different purposes during hard lockdown as compared to the baseline levels or the pre-lockdown phase.“Trips to grocery stores and pharmacies were reduced by more than 70%, but were still higher than all the other visits, as people were trying to restock and prepare for the lockdown. “Workplace trips reduced by as much as 65% during the weekdays as work from home was widely practiced… The change in traffic pattern has also shown up in the air quality data. In fact, the hourly change in nitrogen oxide levels that are more strongly correlated with the traffic nearly flattened during this period,” the CSE said.“Post-lockdown, the travel pattern was close to normal but did not fully regain the pre-lockdown level. Grocery trips and workplace trips recovered maximum by the end of November and were now only about 15% lower than the pre-lockdown phase,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speeds-on-delhi-roads-drop-after-lockdown-as-congestion-returns-report/story-devPca8zgOJeElkYdR59hN.html

Meanwhile, the early harvest proposition will help the two partners grab the low-hanging fruits within the framework of a comprehensive trade agreement, they said requesting anonymity.“The two sides are working on the finer details pertaining to about five-six sectors as some announcements are expected during UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s India visit in January 2021,” one of the officials said.Also Read: Brexit: India could gain as of nowJohnson is the chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebration on January 26, which is a significant development in terms of strategic relations between the two countries especially after Brexit, he said.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Prime Minister Johnson on November 27, where the two leaders hoped for a quantum jump in overall India-UK partnership post-Brexit as they saw huge potential for enhancing collaborations in areas of trade, investment, scientific research, energy, defence, security and climate change,” a second official said.The officials mentioned above said that while some key trade deals are expected by 2021, a comprehensive trade deal between India and UK is expected in two-three years.“India is very cautious while signing any FTA because of its past experience. Various FTAs signed in hurry by the previous governments, particularly with the Asean, are under review as these deals are heavily tilted against Indian interests,” the second official said.Co-chairing the 17th Asean-India Economic Ministers Consultations on August 29, commerce minister Piyush Goyal had said that FTAs had to be “mutually beneficial”. He had asked for an early review of the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) as the trade pact was hurting India’s interest, as HT reported on August 30.According to officials, trade negotiations with UK are based on the principle of mutual benefit and arriving at an agreement is relatively easy because of the bilateral nature of negotiations. Negotiations of multilateral trade deals are cumbersome and time-consuming, they said.Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, said India should be careful of larger and long-term implications of FTAs. “The agreements [with UK] should clearly mention the aspects related to the country of origin of the goods and the percentage of value addition as these issues have been subject matter of debate,” he said.“At the very inception, both the countries should have clear understanding with respect to bilateral investment treaty, which allows for an alternate dispute resolution outside the host state jurisdiction. The relevant clauses should not be legally open ended... [to encourage] investments in both jurisdictions,” he said.Sanjay Aggarwal, president at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said this is the “right time” to move forward with an early harvest deal between India and UK. “India is always keen to move from a bilateral trade agreement to FTA... I believe, post Brexit, the complementarities between the two dynamic economies will rise exponentially,” he said. “The areas such as drugs and pharma, fintech, chemicals, defence manufacturing, food and beverages, petroleum products and natural gas are the most growth promising areas of Indian economy and have strategic competitive advantages in the international market for trade and attracting investments,” he added.The trade relations between the two countries have severely stagnated during the last decade, he said. “The bilateral merchandise trade between India and UK increased only from $11 billion during 2009-10 to around $16 billion during 2019-20. We have to scale up the volume to a trajectory with the exploration of untapped potential,” he said.India’s main exports to the UK are articles of apparel and clothing accessories, power generating machinery and equipment, petroleum, petroleum products and related materials, miscellaneous manufactured articles, textile yarn, fabrics, made up articles, footwear, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, road vehicles and other transport equipment.The main imports from the UK to India are power generating machinery and equipment, non-ferrous metals, ferrous ores and metal scrap, general industrial machinery and equipment and machine, transport equipment, beverages, electrical machinery and appliances and electrical parts, professional, scientific and controlling instruments and appliances, chemicals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-and-uk-to-finalise-early-harvest-trade-deals-by-2021-ahead-of-comprehensive-fta/story-5uJXlXlae71Xqdg9Zcei6J.html
28-12-2020||India||Problem not with plastic: VP calls for responsible use of plastics||Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asked research institutes like the CIPET to focus on the development of eco-friendly products like biodegradable plastics as durability and longevity of plastics have posed several challenges to the environment.Addressing the faculty and students of the Central Institute for Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology at Surampalli near Vijayawada, the Vice-President noted that avoiding (use of) plastic was not the solution but ensuring its responsible use and recycling were important.He said plastics played a significant role during the Covid-19 pandemic through their wide use in medical protection equipment and PPE kits.“Plastic has been a saviour in preventing the spread (of coronavirus). The disposable plastic syringes, blood bags, gloves and other medical solutions with enhanced features and functionality have proven their worth during this difficult time,” he observed.“The problem is not with plastic. The problem lies in our attitude towards handling plastic. Improper littering habits and lack of awareness on plastics waste management have resulted in many hazards,” he pointed out.The “3Rs” Reduce, Reuse, Recycle with segregation were the key to recycling and realising “waste to wealth,” he said, adding the waste management mark in India was expected to be worth USD 13.62 billion by the year 2025.The plastics recycling market alone was expected to grow at 6.5 per cent to attain a market size of USD 53.72 billion by the end of 2023, he added.Venkaiah Naidu noted that the growth of petrochemicals and chemicals has become inevitable as the demand in India was expected to grow at 7.5 per cent by the financial year 2023.Demand for polymers, an integral part of the petrochemical sector, was also growing at eight per cent.Polymeric materials were also being widely used to create medical tools and devices like insulin pens, catheters, implants and tissue engineering as well.Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions were being set up in coastal states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha to promote the use of polymers and allied materials for various high-end applications, Venkaiah Naidu said.Expressing happiness over the functioning of CIPET-AP, for which he laid the foundation-stone four years ago, Venkaiah Naidu said the premier institute’s pattern already fell in line with the requirements of the National Education Policy-2020 that focused on skill and application-based learning.The research and development wings of CIPET catered to aerospace, automotive, agriculture, construction, healthcare, energy and packaging sectors with a focus on development of sustainable materials, recycling strategies and energy storage.“The R and D wings have close alliance with major players like Boeing, Ford, Pepsi, BEL, HAL, NTPC and others for development, implementation and validation of futuristic ideas. CIPET has so far completed 50 major research projects and 12 patents were filed,” the Vice-President said.State Minister V Srinivas, Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals Joint Secretary K N Jha, CIPET Director General S K Naik and other officials were present.On the occasion, the Vice-President inspected an exhibition of products manufactured by CIPET students and lauded their efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problem-not-with-plastic-vp-calls-for-responsible-use-of-plastics/story-F2pfmQch4xVje6GKHeTQ2H.html
28-12-2020||India||‘One nation, one mobility card’: All you need to know about NCMC||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched the ambitious National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) service for the Delhi Metro’s Airport Express Line. This latest inauguration falls under the umbrella of the Prime Minister’s ‘One Nation One Card’ initiative. NCMC can be used at all transit locations making all new metro and transit payments interoperable via one card. The idea of NCMC was floated by the Nandan Nilekani committee set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The five-member committee under Nilekani, the former chairperson of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIAI) has also proposed a host of measures, including all payments by the government to citizens through the digital mode, to reduce the number of cash transactions in the country.Here’s all you need to know about NCMC:1. NCMC will allow passengers with RuPay debit card, issued in the last 18 months by 23 banks, including SBI, UCO Bank, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank etc, to be swiped for Metro travel. “This facility will become available on the entire Delhi Metro network by 2022,” a DMRC spokesperson said.2. NCMC is an automatic fare collection system. It will turn smartphones into an inter-operable transport card that commuters can use eventually to pay for Metro, bus and suburban railways services.3. NCMC service is slated to cover the entire 400km stretch of Delhi Metro.4. It will allow entry and exit from Metro stations with the help of a smartphone, known as the automatic fare collection (AFC) system. In the upcoming Delhi Metro Phase-IV project, the AFC system will fully accept NCMC, which can also be used in any city across the country. 5. To make AFC compliant indigenous gates for metro stations the government has engaged Bharat Electronics Limited. Eventually, all Metro stations will be fitted with AFC gates.6. The Nilekani committee had suggested that NCMC should contain two instruments – a regular debit card which can be used at an ATM and a local wallet, which can be used for contactless payments, without the need to go back to the server or additional authentication. 7. Banks mandated by the department of financial services have been asked to make their debit cards NCMC compliant, to ensure availability of service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-nation-one-mobility-card-all-you-need-to-know-about-ncmc/story-NafU1DgPbIhScJadOe68EI.html
28-12-2020||India||Ratan Tata turns 83. Here is what the businessman is known for||A Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awardee, philanthropist and one of the most successful businessmen the country has ever produced, Ratan Tata’s legacy speaks for itself. The business tycoon turned 83 on Monday.Born on December 28, 1937, Tata graduated from the Riverdale Country School in New York City and received a degree in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University, US. He later enrolled at the Harvard Business School and completed an Advanced Management Program in 1975.He began his journey to the top with Tata Steel division in 1962 and was appointed the director-in-charge of the National Radio & Electronics Company Limited in 1971. Two years after completing his course from Harvard, Tata was moved to Empress Mills, a struggling textile mill under the Tata Group. It was in 1991 that JRD Tata stepped down as chairperson of Tata Sons, naming Ratan Tata as his successor.Under his leadership, Tata Sons’ revenue grew over 40 times and profit over 50 times. He was instrumental in the business’ expansion and conceptualisation of popular cars like the Tata Nano and the Tata Indica. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus and in 2004. Tata Motors was even listed on the New York Stock Exchange.As a philanthropist, Ratan Tata’s reputation is unmatched. Sixty-five per cent of his shares are invested in charitable trusts including the Tata Education and Development Trust, an affiliate of the Tata Group which provided a $28 million Tata Scholarship Fund to Cornell University to provide financial aid to undergraduate students from India.Tata donated $50 million to his alma mater, Harvard Business School, for the construction of an executive centre.

28-12-2020||India||We want to make India a superpower, says defence minister Rajnath Singh||India has the potential to become a superpower and it needs significant achievements in the fields of education, health and industry to make the cut, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday as he mentioned the country’s glorious history including major discoveries by ancient scientists like Aryabhata ahead of their western counterparts. In an online address at the convocation of IIM Ranchi, Singh delved into India’s rich contribution in the field of scientific research in the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy and noted that “Aryabhata confirmed the round shape of the Earth and its rotation on its axis about 1,000 years before famous German astronomer Copernicus did”. “We want to make India a superpower. To make the country a superpower, we need even bigger achievements in the fields of education, health and industry, etc. The potential in these areas is within our country. It is not yet fully utilised,” Singh said. “When we talk about making India a superpower, then we also have to take care of the development potential in all the states of the country,” he added. The defence minister said the youth of the country has the ability to face any challenge and can turn them into opportunities with the help of “invention, innovation and ideas”. Encouraging students to play a key role in making of a ‘New India’, Singh said modern education should not deter them from taking inspiration from the country’s glorious history, adding it set new standards of knowledge and discovery for centuries in the fields of physics, social science, spiritual knowledge and economics. “Modern education should not be a hurdle in taking inspiration from your glorious past. Just like studying science does not mean that you do not believe in God,” Singh said. He also mentioned mathematician Ramanujan and added: “He said ‘an equation is meaningless to me unless it expresses a thought of God’“. Urging students to work towards nation-building, the defence minister cited the contributions of renowned ancient Indian scientists and said “no success is final and no failure is fatal”. “India has been a witness to a long tradition of scientists from Aryabhata, Varahamihir, Brahmagupta, Bodhayan, Charak, Sushruta, Nagarjuna to Sawai Jai Singh.,” said Singh. “Before Isaac Newton, Brahmagupta had confirmed the law of gravitational force. It is a different matter that Western scientists got credit for all these discoveries for some reason,” Singh said, adding he is talking about it as he himself was a student of physics. He said ancient Indian scientist Baudhayan discovered the ‘Pythagoras theorem’ years before Pythagoras did. The defence minister said according to a famous Russian historian, India had mastered plastic surgery before Christ was born and that it was the first country to set up a hospital. Singh also mentioned a specific contribution to astronomy by 12th-century scientist Bhaskaracharya and suggested that he rehearsed one of the theories relating to orbital periods of the planets that was discovered by German scientist Kepler. “Secondly, he gave birth to the theory of gravitation about 500 years before Isaac Newton who was born in the 17th century,” said Singh. The defence minister said the list of India’s achievements in science is very long, at the same time added that the country was not behind in other fields like economics, history, political science and public administration. “Today, when we are all working for the creation of New India, it is important for all of us to understand our heritage,” he said. Talking about the coronavirus pandemic, Singh said India effectively confronted the crisis despite having limited resources and that the country turned the disaster into an “opportunity” under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Asking students to work hard to achieve their goals, Singh said, “We have to understand that the road to success often passes through the streets of failure. There will be no successful person in the world who has never faced failure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-want-to-make-india-a-superpower-says-defence-minister-rajnath-singh/story-mF7c8Q8QDXD3TUdfbzcJRI.html

The 100th run of the Kisan Rail was flagged off from Sangola in Maharashtra to Shalimar in West Bengal virtually. Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal were also present at the event.Currently, of only a handful of trains plying across the India connecting states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Nagpur, there are nine Kisan Rail running on nine routes. “I congratulate crores of farmers of the country. Despite Covid-19 challenge Kisan Rail network has expanded in the last four months,” PM Modi said, adding that Kisan Rail is a big step towards empowering farmers and increasing their income.The Prime Minister also said that farmers and farming of every region of the country are being connected by Kisan Rail. “More than 80 per cent of the small and marginal farmers of the country have got great power through Kisan Rail,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister said there is no minimum quantum for farmers as a farmer can also send a parcel of 50-100 kg. “The farmer used to spend a lot on rent for transporting his crop to distant markets. In view of this problem, three years ago our government gave 50% subsidy on transportation of tomatoes, onions and potatoes,” PM Modi said during the launch.Stating that more than 6,000 projects have been approved under mega food parks, cold chain infrastructure, agro-processing cluster under the PM Krishi Sampada Yojana, the Prime Minister said Rs 10,000 crore have been sanctioned for micro food processing industries under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-flags-off-100th-kisan-rail-in-maharashtra-congratulates-crores-of-farmers-of-the-country/story-rB59IIpXQDnd764COiLn3L.html

Of the 65 patients in ICU, 45 need no ventilator support.“We get very less Covid patients now. In our Out Patient Department (OPD) we used to get more than 40 patients every day but now that has reduced to 2-3 cases. Similarly at one time we had 100 patients in Covid centre which has now reduced to less than 10,” said a senior doctor of Government Medical College Baramulla in north Kashmir.The highest contributing districts Srinagar and Jammu are the only ones where the patients are present in some measure in the main Covid centres.The total active cases in J&K till December 27 have dropped to 3,282 which account for 3.73 % of the total 1, 20,137 cases. The last time active cases were hovering around 3,200 was in the first week of July after which the cases had shot up.A total of 1, 14,986 people have recovered from the disease while 1,869 people have lost their lives, some 1.55 percent of the total cases.A total of 1,178 people have succumbed to the disease in Kashmir and 691 in Jammu.The average cases and deaths have witnessed a significant decrease in December as compared to the past five months. For the past one week the fresh cases have mostly remained below 300 per day.As many as 175 people lost their lives from December 1 to 27 in the pandemic while the month’s cases so far reached 9,913 (at 367 average cases per day) which are much less than 15,434 Covid infections in November and 19,619 cases in October. The month of September had recorded the highest number of cases - 37,372 - which was substantially more than the 17,339 infections in August.Dr Qazi Haroon, officer on special duty with the health department to assist the government with corona mitigation efforts, agreed that most of the Covid centres are empty.“It is because we have very less Covid patients daily now which are mostly asymptomatic and most of the positive patients are put at home,” he said.He said that in very rare cases they have to hospitalize the patient. “Mostly patients who have comorbid conditions and whose oxygen saturation levels dip, are hospitalized,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centres-empty-as-cases-dip-in-jammu-and-kashmir/story-Lz0mGwhqyk689j6ilAruDM.html
28-12-2020||India||In Kerala, 41 held for promoting child pornography||In a state-wide crackdown on child pornography, the cyber wing of the Kerala police on Monday, arrested 41 people including IT professionals and registered 339 cases, Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham said. He said 596 locations were raided and 392 computer devices and phones were seized in the last couple of days. Most of those arrested were under observation for some time and in most cases there were exclusive groups on the dark net helping each other. “Our statistics show there has been a sharp increase in child pornography cases during the pandemic. Lockdown has increased digital surfing and this also spiked use of pornography, especially involving children,” he said adding many users often think that use of the dark net will go unnoticed but they are mistaken. “In many cases it looks like sickness and addiction that require medical treatment. And in many cases there are repeat offenders also,” said Abraham, a decorated officer specialising in cyber crime. The cyber wing has nabbed many online cheating cases and ATM frauds recently. He said the cyber wing was planning a directory of repeat offenders. “We have zero tolerance towards such offences. We have tied up with many organisations including the Interpol and International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to detect child pornographers. It is a big concern that such cases are on the rise. Child security is the responsibility of every member of the society,” he said. The Kerala police had constituted a special wing-- Counter Child Sexual Exploitation Unit-- in last January and started a crackdown on offenders. He said 428 people were arrested and 525 cases registered in a year. Most of the arrested were found to be using all kinds of encrypted handles to upload and download such material and circulating them on social media platforms, he said. He said most of the seized material belong to children between 6 and 15 years of age. Officials have code-named the operation ‘P Hunt 20.2. During the raid it was also found that some of the users format their smart phones every three days to avoid detection. Use of malwares to activate the webcams of the victims and to steal information of children was also detected. “Many obscene pictures, videos inside household, flats etc have been uploaded in recent times, which clearly show that most of the pictures have been taken from Kerala,” he said adding abuse of children locked up in their homes was quite evident in some cases. He said in some cases offenders were married and have children. Watching and sharing child pornographic images, videos and literature are a crime in the country and any offence can invite a five-year jail term and a maximum fine of Rs 10 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-41-held-for-promoting-child-pornography/story-DnTZydkkR5GtAcWHerzKkM.html
28-12-2020||India||‘Not getting GST dues, even BJP-ruled states unhappy’: Hemant Soren||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said his state has issues with the GST but claimed that he was not alone and that even BJP-ruled states have problems with the GST compensation but they are quiet for obvious reasons.Despite the talk about cooperative federalism, Soren, citing his experience as CM over the past year, said that the relationship between the Centre and the state is not healthy. The leader, whose government completes one year tomorrow, also lamented the poor state of opposition in the country and called for “collective responsibility” to take on the BJP.The CM, in an interview to HT’s Vishal Kant, maintained that Jharkhand has done better on mortality and positivity rate ranking in coronavirus management as compared to other states.Admitting that work on the development front has been slow, the CM pointed to restrictions on movement of labour amid coronavirus. Besides mines and mineral sector, the CM stressed that he was looking at other avenues to usher in development in the state.Here are edited excerpts from the interview: Q. You complete one year in office tomorrow. How do you assess your government’s performance during this period, which was also hit by a global pandemic?It was a very challenging period. It was quite a learning experience as in how we should go about handling such a crisis. As a result, it is for all to see that we (state) are in a better position in containing the pandemic. Be it mortality rate due to Covid-19, or the positivity rate, we are placed higher among the states (in terms of Covid management) in the country.Q. And performance on the development work front, despite all the challenges?On the work front, I admit it was very slow paced. If performance is to be analysed on parameters of setting up industry, job creation, then there is nothing much to show. Industry needs labour but there were several restrictions in terms of movement. Therefore, we could not do much there. However, we ran several programmes to ensure people do not get depressed in such a scenario. For example, we performed the best in terms of generating maximum man days under MNREGA as compared to previous years. On an average, we used to generate around two to 2.5 crore man days every year. This financial year we have already generated over 7 crore mandays so far.Q. But some of the new schemes you are talking about did not yield result. For example, the urban job guarantee scheme on the lines of MNREGA.Yes, not many people turned up to avail that scheme. We are reviewing it, identifying the loopholes. These things are related to financial availability as well. We are relooking into the daily wage rates. Also, we need to factor in that even in urban areas most of the labour comes from nearby rural areas. We are relooking into the entire scheme. Q. And how would you compare your current one year with your first stint as CM in 2013-14 when you held the chair for about 14 months?The current term is very different. My first stint was a very short one. In the language of cricket, it hardly mattered then which part of the park the ball was to be hit? It was like playing T20. All we had to do was score maximum runs. This term is like a test match, where we need to dig in and strategise. We are moving ahead with a sustainable model. And in fact, this is what we have done this year. The pandemic year gave us an opportunity to plan to give the state a sustainable direction. Because even after 20 years (of Jharkhand’s creation), we are still dependent heavily on the Centre for finances. We now have a plan how to become self-dependent.Q. Could you elaborate on this further, especially when you say you give a certain direction to the state?A: What I assess, till now all plans for the state only had mining at its core. We are a mineral-rich state, but there are other sectors in the state which could generate jobs as well as revenue. Besides mines and minerals, now we are including other potential sectors in our development plan. For example, education, information technology sector, tourism and sports. We are coming up with the new tourism and sports policy. To add to that, the locals also have had bitter experience in terms of mining activities despite this economic activity going on in this part for around a century now.Q. You came to power with a slew of electoral promises. Despite all challenges, people expect their delivery, be it job creation, unemployment allowance or increased quota for reserved categories.I totally agree with that. People gave us a big mandate. We had an election manifesto as well. However, experience of being in a situation while contesting the election and being in this government is quite a contrast. It’s like black and white; we need finances to deliver on the promises. However, the fiscal health of the state has been an open secret. When we took over, it was difficult to even the salaries. Many times, our treasury pressed the red button that we don’t have funds. The state is heavily dependent on the Centre for finances.Q. GST is a major source of revenue for the state. In the past one year, we have seen lots of words and letters exchanged between the state and the federal government over such issues. A: It is not that only we have issues with the Centre on the GST issue. Even BJP-ruled states have issues. Just that they are not speaking due to obvious reasons. The union finance minister has said it on record that everything is in the hands of god.Q. The DVC issue also came where the funds were deducted from the state’s consolidated fund?If you analyse such issues, we are not getting our GST dues. Cutting dues from our consolidated fund was unconstitutional. Such issues should not be dealt with on the basis of a simple agreement done by the previous government. DVC here often threatens to load shed power supply. We had issues with the coal auction. The Centre did not heed to our suggestions. We ultimately knocked the doors of the court. Based on my experience over the past one year, I won’t hesitate in saying that the relationship between the Centre and the state is not healthy, which is not good in a federal set up.Q. Today’s political space in the country is dominated by the BJP. There are few states where opposition leaders are still standing strong. You are one among them. How do you assess the future course of politics in the country, especially in states where non-BJP parties are ruling?I am not very clear at this stage in commenting on the Central politics. But yes, we can surely admit that the opposition is weak at the Central government level. In such a scenario, state governments and the state leadership have a very critical role to play. I think the opposition needs to move forward with a collective responsibility. If we move collectively, I am confident that we can find a way going forward.Q. Do you advise an anti-BJP front?A: Yes, because every strategy, every decision of the BJP and its government is political in nature. Be it GST implementation, demonetisation, farm laws or land acquisition - all the decisions have been political. GST was implemented with the idea of One Nation One Tax. Every state cooperated and surrendered our backbone in terms of revenue generation. But how has GST been implemented? And see how that has adversely impacted the country’s economy.Q. So, what is your take on the One Nation One Election issue being championed?The blueprint is yet to come out. But the BJP thinks, preaches and practices differently. They have a hidden agenda in everything they do. We need to decipher what they have on offer because they don’t want to listen to alternate voice. They are fond of calling names. They don’t hesitate in branding protesting farmers as terrorists and Khalistsanis.Q. BJP’s state unit has already gone belligerent against you. Its leaders have been repeatedly claiming that your government would fall soon. JMM also filed a case in Dumka against BJP leaders during the bypoll. Now, some personal allegations have also been made against you.They are not trying this only here. From the very next day they lose the election, they start making efforts to come to power through the backdoor. We have already seen that in other states. As far as personal allegations are concerned, it’s an old saying that if you spit into the sky, it falls into your eye. We are already seeing how names of some of their several stalwarts are coming out for being involved in this conspiracy. Q.You are seeing a conspiracy against your government?Absolutely. If we don’t speak, it does not mean that we are in a sleeping mode. I am very much watchful. We believe in the concept of “sau sonar ki ek lohar ki (one powerful blow is comparable to a hundred smaller blows)”. They are hatching a conspiracy, but they won’t succeed. It’s not necessary that people would always fall into their trap. I have an eye on everything.Q. But certain political developments here also raise eyebrows. All legislators of ally Congress came to see you recently and reportedly placed certain demands.No other government in the state in the past has come up with such a big mandate, with so many MLAs in treasury benches. Even the previous government had got numbers due to defections. Since the number is high, few voices here and there are not unnatural. But there is nothing to worry. We are taking everyone along. Q. There are several key appointments pending, like chairman in boards, corporations and information commissioners.All appointments would be made soon. As far as information commissioners are concerned, there is an issue due to non-availability of the leader of opposition. So that’s a making of the BJP that they have not chosen the right person as LoP. Now we are taking legal advice and would make appointments. We will approach the court, if required.Q. Effectively, there are three vacancies in your cabinet as well.Technically, we can’t say there are vacancies now because one seat has been vacant since the beginning. One of our colleagues is unwell and undergoing treatment. We are expecting him to be healthy soon. One vacancy was created due to the demise of one of our ministers. The required changes will be made in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-getting-gst-dues-even-bjp-ruled-states-unhappy-hemant-soren/story-tefPXUVW9tQKUxVUCQLdpJ.html
28-12-2020||India||Assam government tables bill to abolish all state-run madrassas||The Assam government on Monday tabled a Bill in the Legislative Assembly to abolish all state-run Madrassas by converting them into general schools from April 1 next year.Despite an united opposition raising objections on tabling of the Bill, Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma introducted The Assam Repealing Bill, 2020 on the first day of the three-day winter session.The legislation proposes to abolish the two existing Acts -- The Assam Madrassa Education (Provincialisation) Act, 1995 and The Assam Madrassa Education (Provincialisation of Services of Employees and Re-Organisation of Madrassa Educational Institutions) Act, 2018.“This bill is not to control and repeal the private Madrassas,” Sarma said, adding inclusion of the word “private” in the ‘statement of objects and reasons’ of the bill was a mistake.The Assam cabinet had on December 13 approved a proposal to close down all Madrassas and Sanskrit Tols (schools) however, the legislation brought in the assembly during the day did not contain anything related to the Sanskrit tols and the education minister also did not mention anything about it.The minister said in the bill that all Madrassa institutes will be converted into upper primary, high and higher secondary schools with no change of status, pay, allowances and service conditions of the teaching and non-teaching staff.There are 610 state-run Madrassas across Assam with the government spending Rs 260 crore annually, Sarma had said earlier.In April 2018, the Education minister had brought many private Madrassas under the government ambit by introducing The Assam Madrassa Education (Provincialisation of Services of Employees and Re-Organisation of Madrassa Educational Institutions) Act, 2018.The BJP-led alliance-controlled Assam assembly had enacted the law unanimously in 2018.Regarding Sanskrit tols, Sarma had said in October last that they would be handed over to Kumar Bhaskar Varma Sanskrit and Ancient Studies University and its infrastructure would be converted into centres of learning and research, where Indian culture, civilisation and nationalism would be studied.As soon as Sarma sought permission to introduce The Assam Repealing Bill Monday, Congress and AIUDF members objected to tabling of the proposed law and questioned the intention of the government.Congress MLA Nurul Huda said Madrassas teach Arabic language apart from other general subjects and learning a language cannot be termed communal.Because of learning Arabic, many youths have got lucrative jobs in Arab countries and they are contributing to Indian economy by sending foreign exchanges,” he added.His party colleague Sherman Ali Ahmed said learning of Arabic will open job opportunities in 52 countries and already many Hindus from other states like Kerala are earning lakhs of rupees by working in such places.Another Congress member Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested modernisation of Madrassas and not abolishing them.“I don’t know why this bill is brought. It will change the atmosphere of Assam. This bill is aimed at polarisation of votes on religious lines,” he alleged.AIUDF MLA Rafiqul Islam said Sarma himself had provincialised these Madrassas in 2018 and now “he is killing his own baby”.“Even Modi ji has said there should be computer in one hand and Quran on the other. Yogi (Adityanath) is doing the same in UP and allotted hundreds of crores for Madrassas,” he added.Senior AIUDF member Hafiz Bashir Ahmed said winding up all government Madrassas is a big decision and it should be sent to the select committee of the house for discussion with all the stakeholders.Countering all objections, the Education minister said he also believes in spiritual education like learning of Quran, Gita and Bible, but the proposed bill is not related to stopping such education.“Madrassas teach theology as a subject. If only Arabic is taught, no issue would have been there. But, as a government we cannot allow teaching of the Quran on public funding.“Then tomorrow, Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Jains and other people will also come seeking support to teach their religious books,” he said.Sarma tried to alleviate fears of stopping Arabic language and said teaching of the particular language will continue once the Madrasssas will be converted into general schools.“Many Islamic scholars have opposed government support to teach the Quran. It was a wrong practice and we want to end this wrong practice,” he added.When Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami allowed to introduce the bill and Sarma tabled it, the opposition created a noisy scene and raised objection by shouting slogans inside the house.However, with the Speaker asking them to raise their points during discussion on the bill Wednesday, the Congress and AIUDF members settled down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-goverment-tables-bill-to-abolish-all-state-run-madrassas/story-XrDnZqSb9N6WPrZqjv4IcN.html

For the first time since it was opened for vehicular traffic, the tunnel witnessed a record single-day inflow of 5,450 vehicles on Sunday.About 2,800 vehicles travelled towards Lahaul from Manali while 2,650 vehicles came from Lahaul.On Monday, over 5000 vehicles crossed the Atal Tunnel Rohtang (ATR) from both ends.Superintendent of Police (SP) Kullu Gaurav Singh said that it was bumper-to-bumper traffic on the route. For every thousand vehicles at Manali Bailey Bridge, delay was introduced from the Green Tax Barrier so as to manage the pace and crossing at the Bailey Bridge connecting the left bank“All vehicles going beyond Solang Nala towards the tunnel were compulsorily headed for Atal Tunnel Rohtang South Portal and then U-turns were facilitated there,” said the SP.He said that more than 30 drivers who were overtaking the queue were challaned and fined for disturbing traffic movement. They were allowed to move only after the rest of the traffic was cleared. No overtaking zone was implemented between Palchan and the South Portal.At least 15 people in two vehicles were arrested and fined Rs 40,000 for obstructing the traffic in Atal Tunnel and for violating Covid-19 protocols. Seven of these tourists were from Delhi while eight belonged to Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atal-tunnel-sees-highest-single-day-traffic-5-450-vehicles-cross-from-both-ends/story-fJPyq5Q83R8Xe1425Beb7H.html
28-12-2020||India||La Nina influences 2020 as India records above normal rains, harsher winter, reduced heatwave||La Nina seemed to have played a critical role in influencing the country’s weather in 2020 which was a second consecutive year of above normal rainfall with below normal temperatures in the winter and less occurrence of heatwaves.The year also saw formation of five cyclones in the seas along eastern and western sides. Of the five, four were ‘severe cyclonic storms’ and above.La Nina conditions played an important factor in having a good monsoon and severe winter conditions in parts of north India. La Nina is associated with the cooling of the Pacific waters -- El Nino is antithesis to it. It is generally observed that a La Nina year also receives good rainfall and winter temperatures are lower than normal.December to February are peak winter months in the country. The severe cold day conditions in parts of north India that began in December of 2019 also continued in January this year, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General M Mohapatra said.The trend of cold to severe cold day conditions also continued later in October, November as well December. Several parts of north India recorded below normal temperatures from October to December, he said. On the other hand, the summer also saw few instances of heat waves that affect large portions of the country from April to June, Mohapatra added.He attributed the low frequency of heatwaves to frequent Western Disturbances -- cyclonic circulation that originates in the Mediterranean Sea, traverses across Central Asia, and brings non-monsoon rains to northwest India during the winters.This year, the frequency of western disturbances was unusually high and continued even during the summer. 2020 was also the third to record highest precipitation in the last 30 years.Southwest Monsoon arrived over Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date. The official monsoon season starts from June 1 to September 30. The country received 109 per cent rainfall of the Long Period Average (LPA) with three of four months -- June (118 per cent), August (127 per cent) and September (104 per cent) -- witnessing above normal rainfall, while July recorded (90 per cent) deficient rainfall.Generally, the country receives maximum rainfall in July and August.One of the main features of the monsoon was the rainfall in August. The month saw five low pressure areas (cyclonic circulations) that brought large amount of rainfall over central India.The total number of low pressure days was 28 against the normal of about 15 in August.It caused two-three spells of riverine floods over Odisha, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, south Gujarat and south Rajasthan.The IMD said it was a record rainfall in August 2020, when all-India rainfall was 127 per cent of LPA. It was the highest in the last 44 years, after August 1976 (128.4 per cent) of LPA. It was also the fourth-highest in the last 120 years.Overall, during the monsoon season 2020, a total number of 12 low pressure system formed.Nineteen states and union territories received normal rainfall this year, while nine states and union territories saw excess rainfall. Bihar, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Lakshadweep islands recorded excess rainfall. Sikkim recorded large excess rainfall.However, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir recorded deficiency. Ladakh recorded large deficiency. Delhi also received deficient rainfall.“Considering the recent years since 1990, the all India seasonal rainfall this year was third highest, after 112 per cent of LPA in 1994 and 110 per cent of LPA in 2019.“It is consecutively for two monsoon years, when India received good rainfall of 9 per cent of the LPA or more. Thus, 2019 and 2020 are the two consecutive above normal monsoon rainfall years, after 1958 (110 per cent of LPA) and 1959 (114 per cent of LPA),” the IMD had said after the end of the monsoon. Southwest Monsoon covered the entire country on June 26 against the normal date of July 8, 12 days before its normal date. The withdrawal was also late. It retreated from west Rajasthan and parts of Punjab on September 28, 11 days after its normal withdrawal date.Overall, the Northeast Monsoon too has been good so far, Mohapatra said. The Northeast Monsoon brings rains to Tamil Nadu, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka from October to December. “The year 2020 was a good rainfall year. The country also received good rainfall during the winter months. The Southwest Monsoon as well as the Northeast Monsoon was good,” Mohapatra added.Three of the storms (Amphan, Nivar and Burevi) formed in the Bay of Bengal and the other two (Nisraga and Gati) in the Arabian Sea. Amphan, Nivar and Nisarga hit the Indian coasts as cyclonic storms.After nearly two decades -- 1999 Super Cyclone of Odisha that killed thousands of people --, the Bay of Bengal saw formation of another super cyclonic storm Amphan in May. However, as it pummelled the West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, its intensity had reduced marginally.But will a similar weather pattern continue in 2021? Mohapatra said La Nina conditions are likely to prevail for the next six months.The IMD in its winter forecast for December 2020 and January February 2021 also predicted below normal temperatures in north India.And how will La Nina affect the Southwest Monsoon and the summer? “It is difficult to predict the weather for the entire year at this point of time. But La Nina is generally associated with good monsoon and below normal temperatures during the winters. We are continuously monitoring the situation,” Mohapatra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/la-nina-influences-2020-as-india-records-above-normal-rains-harsher-winter-reduced-heatwave/story-4cqKXDxPnK1I2iVqkGXGQL.html
28-12-2020||India||EC preparing for polls next year after Covid safe Bihar elections: CEC||The Election Commission successfully held assembly polls in Bihar, one of India’s most populous states despite the Covid-19 pandemic and is now preparing to conduct polls in states and union territories as per schedule next year, its chief Sunil Arora said summing up 2020.The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) pointed out that the exercise involved nearly 7.3 crore voters and over 1.06 lakh polling stations.“We were able to conduct a Covid-safe election, with a voter turnout of 57.34%, which was higher than the 56.8% turnout recorded during the previous election in 2015,” Arora told PTI.This was also an election marked by enthusiastic participation of women voters, who outnumbered men at the polling booths, he said.The facility of postal ballots was extended to citizens above the age of 80 years and persons with disability. Besides this, the EC also conducted elections across several states for Rajya Sabha seats, and by-elections for nearly 60 legislative assembly constituencies, he observed.“All this was made possible through the zeal, commitment and dedication of lakhs of officials, security personnel, civil society organisations and individuals, and the support of all stakeholders, including political parties, and above all, the voters themselves,” he said.“As I have already mentioned, it was a leap of faith for the Commission, and not a leap in the dark,” Arora said, referring to the decision of holding polls as per schedule.Some political parties had earlier urged the EC not to hold elections amid the pandemic.Bihar assembly elections were the first full-fledged polls to be held amid coronavirus. Over 4 crore of the total over 7 crore voters exercised their franchise. To ensure distancing norms, the EC restricted the number of voters per polling station to 1,000 from 1,200. This led to the increase in the number of polling stations.Similarly, in West Bengal, where elections are due along with Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry next year, the number of polling stations would go up by nearly 28,000.Details of other poll-bound states are being worked out.In August, the poll panel had come out with broad guidelines to hold polls amid the coronavirus pandemic.When the campaigning was in full swing, it issued an advisory for parties noting that Covid norms and health protocols were not being followed.According to data made available by the Election Commission here and the office of the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar, 156 cases were registered against “organisers” of rallies and meetings of various leaders and candidates for violating Covid-19 norms. Cases were registered against organisers as they had sought permission to hold rallies or meetings in which following health guidelines was mandatory, explained an official. Ahead of the three-phase elections, the poll panel had made it clear that violation of Covid-19 guidelines during election period would be deemed as a violation of section 144 of the CrPC. Nearly 160 tonne of biomedical waste in the form of gloves, face masks and empty sanitiser bottles used by polling personnel and voters was generated during the Bihar assembly polls held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The poll authorities also relied on an inexpensive but effective technology used to track EVMs to ensure that the waste reached public health centres for its onward journey to the incinerator.To ensure safety of voters, polling staff and security personnel, the EC had procured 18 lakh face shields, 70 lakh face masks, 5.4 lakh single use rubber gloves for polling and security personnel and 7.21 crore ‘one hand’ single use polythene gloves for voters to press the EVM button and sign the register at the polling stations.This year also saw another interesting development related to electoral reforms.Following a Supreme Court direction in February, the EC in March asked political parties to justify why they chose candidates with criminal history to contest elections.Assembly elections in Bihar were the first full-fledged polls where such details of their candidates were made public by parties.Out of a total of 1,197 candidates with criminal antecedents who contested the recently-held Bihar assembly elections, 467 were fielded by recognised national and state parties, according to the EC.The remaining 730 were either fielded by registered but unrecognised parties or had contested the polls as independents.Meanwhile, the EC has also proposed to the government to extend the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) facility, so far available to service voters, to eligible overseas Indian voters.In a letter to the legislative secretary in Law Ministry on November 27, the Commission said with the successful execution of ETPBS in case of service voters, it is now “confident” that the facility can also be extended to the overseas electors.“The Commission is technically and administratively ready to extend this facility in general elections to legislative assemblies of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” the poll panel said.But the government is yet to take a decision on allowing the use of postal ballots for eligible overseas Indians to cast their votes as the move will need wider consultations with all stakeholders before a final call is taken, according to sources.They also said that the Election Commission’s proposal to amend election rules to allow the use of postal ballot by overseas Indians, whose names figure in electoral rolls in India, is still at a bureaucratic level and is yet to be discussed with the political executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-preparing-for-polls-next-year-after-covid-safe-bihar-elections-cec/story-vpQbwRt8jDosEMXHqBI13J.html
28-12-2020||India||‘Not scared of anyone’: Sanjay Raut calls ED summons to wife ‘act of cowardice’||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to his wife Varsha Raut was an “act of cowardice” and hinted that several political leaders are being targetted by the investigative agency. The central agency has summoned Raut’s wife in connection with the PMC Bank money laundering case on December 29. The summons for questioning has been issued to her under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), officials said.“Targetting women of a household is an act of cowardice. We are not scared of anyone and will respond accordingly. ED needed some papers and we have submitted them in time,” the Shiv Sena MP was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha summoned by ED in PMC Bank scam caseThe ED action, Raut said, reflected “frustration” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against him, owing to his role in the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government last year and because he didn’t yield to the pressure to make it unstable, news agency PTI reported. The Shiv Sena will respond in equal measure, Raut said.“In the last one year, Sharad Pawar, Eknath Khadse and Pratap Sarnaik got notices and now you all are discussing my name. All these people are crucial for government formation in Maharashtra,” Raut said. The Shiv Sena leader also dubbed the notices as “pieces of paper, nothing else”.Alleging that ED has woken up after 10 years, Raut said his family is from a middle-class background and his wife is a teacher. “We are middle-class people. My wife had taken a loan from a friend 10 years ago to purchase a house. Details have been given to the income tax (department) and also mentioned in my Rajya Sabha affidavit. The ED woke up to this deal after ten years,” he said.Raut also suggested that some BJP leaders speaking against him since December 27 used to frequent the ED office (in south Mumbai) and “have taken away some papers from the office”.Also read - Time has come to expand scope of Congress-led UPA: Sanjay RautThe summons has set off a wave of political reactions from Maharashtra government who have said that Central agencies are being misused to settle political scores. Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday said the summons issued by ED to Raut’s wife was “politically motivated”. “The ED move is politically motivated. We are not scared. The MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government is stable,” Aaditya, who is also the son of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, told reporters when asked about the ED summons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-scared-of-anyone-sanjay-raut-calls-ed-summons-to-wife-act-of-cowardice/story-N0afjXnloe58JUom6RYxdN.html

28-12-2020||India||Forces pressurised Manmohan Singh, Sharad Pawar not to implement farm sector reforms, says Union minister Tomar||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday said that even former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and Nationalist Congress Party supremo Sharad Pawar -- who served as the Agriculture Minister during the UPA government -- wanted to implement reforms in the farm sector but could not due to ‘external forces’. Tomar stated that many Chief Ministers had tried to implement the same farm laws that the Narendra Modi government has formulated for agriculture sector reforms in the country but could not implement them due to these external pressures.While addressing farmer unions on Monday, Tomar said, “Many commissions, ministers, chief minister’s and governments have made an effort to work in the direction of farm sector reform. During the UPA regime Dr Manmohan Singh and Sharad Pawar wanted to implement these reforms. However, due to some pressure, they couldn’t implement these laws.”The statement came a day before the government is set to resume talks with farmers’ unions protesting against three Central farm laws. A joint committee of various farmers’ unions also met Narendra Singh Tomar to extend support to the farm laws on Monday. “Now our Prime Minister is Narendra Modi. His only mission is development. His only mission is the well being of people. Any kind of force or pressure can not pressurise our Prime Minister. When these forces fail, they get frustrated,” the Union Agriculture Minister added.Tomar cited examples of demonetisation, GST, abrogation of article 370 and article 35A and Citizenship Amendment Bill while explaining how various forces and some elements tried to use these to attack and criticise PM Modi.On the issue of farm laws, Tomar said, in Punjab, these ‘forces’ tried to use the shoulders of farmers for their motive. “Prime Minister Modi got 303 seats in Lok Sabha because of your blessings. Can PM Modi make such a decision that will adversely impact farmers and villagers?” the Minister asked.“The Prime Minister implemented demonetisation. There were elements who used to stand in queue and criticise the government. On GST, late Pranab Mukherjee praised the PM. Those forces again came in to being and started saying bad things about Modiji that his days were numbered. People said the BJP would lose Gujarat, which is a state dominated by industrialists. In Surat, GST had the most impact and by this logic we should have lost, people voted for Modi on every seat and for GST,” said Tomar.If 370 abrogation was an election issue, our government would have done it in 2023 and not in 2019, argued the Union Agriculture Minister. He added that during the passage of Triple talaq and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the country stood in support and anti-India forces remained ineffective. In a clear indication that laws will stay, Tomar said that talks are going on with protesting farmers. “We want to resolve this by discussion. We respect our Annadatas. We will become self-reliant only when farmers become self-reliant,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-pressurised-manmohan-singh-sharad-pawar-not-to-implement-farm-sector-reforms-says-union-minister-tomar/story-A6n6TZpWPk4VKHe7dqAfHK.html

28-12-2020||India||‘Victory in recent polls shows support, trust for BJP’: Smriti Irani||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) victory in the Bihar assembly election, by-polls in 11 states and 8 local bodies is a testament of the support that people of the country, especially in rural India, have shown for the Narendra Modi government said Union minister Smriti Irani on Monday. The minister, who is also a Lok Sabha MP from Amethi, said the outcome of elections that were held between September and December are an indication that PM Modi and the BJP have been able to secure the trust of the people. The BJP, which is facing criticism from a section of farmers in Punjab and Haryana and the opposition parties over the recently framed farm laws, has been referring to its performance in these elections as evidence of not having lost its popularity. A section of farmers who are upset with the laws have been sitting in protest near the Delhi border, demanding that the laws be repealed. The BJP for its part has blamed the opposition for creating misinformation about the laws and instigating farmers, who it says stand to gain from the new laws. Irani, said support for the news laws and the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which was carried out simultaneously with the Modi government’s development agenda has played a key role in scripting the party’s performance. “Ever since the agriculture reform bills have been passed in Parliament the opposition parties have been trying to create misinformation that the people in rural areas are unhappy with the Union government. But the democratic process shows the truth ...how in the rural areas whether it is farmers or ordinary people, especially women have shown their faith in PM Modi and the BJP,” she said. To support her claims she said since September 27, 2020 and till December 22, the BJP won the Bihar assembly elections, by polls in 11 state; and eight local body elections. She said in Arunachal Pradesh of the 242 Zila Panchayats, the BJP tasted victory in 184 Zila Panchayats. “While the Congress has been able to deliver in only 11 such Panchayats in Arunachal Pradesh...in Manipur, Congress could not win a single seat and there was a clean sweep in the state of Gujarat where the BJP won all eight with 55% plus vote share.” She went on to add, “When the by-election was held in Telangana, the BJP won the election by defeating the representative of the state government there. In Karnataka, BJP won the by-election with 51% votes. In Manipur it won the by-election with more than 40% votes.” Irani also referred to the party’s performance in Uttar Pradesh by poll, where the BJP won 6 out of 7 seats and in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation where the party “created history by winning 48 seats up from last time’s 4”. “The DDC election created a unique history on the soil of Jammu and Kashmir. In this election, BJP won 75 seats,” she said to indicate support for the BJP in the union territory that was carved out a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/victory-in-recent-polls-shows-support-trust-for-bjp-smriti-irani/story-nl9LwyoKJTaDP0Ks4yPBdP.html

28-12-2020||India||Punjab probes if protesting farmers sabotaged telecom infrastructure||Authorities in India’s northern state of Punjab are investigating whether protesting farmers were disrupting power supply to hundreds of telecom towers, a state official said on Monday, amid ongoing protests against contentious new farm laws.“We have told the police to track all those involved in sabotaging the infrastructure,” a senior official in the Punjab state government told Reuters on condition of anonymity.A senior Punjab state police official said the power was disrupted to several telecom towers in the state, mainly ones owned by Jio, the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries.Jio could not be immediately reached for a comment.Representative from two of the 31 farmer unions protesting against the laws rejected the allegations when contacted by Reuters. They asked to remain unidentified pending a formal statement from all of the unions.Tens of thousands of farmers continue to camp out on highways near the capital New Delhi in protest against three new laws implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that they fear will dismantle regulated agricultural markets, threaten their livelihood and benefit large companies.But Modi and his cabinet ministers say the laws would increase farmers’ income as it links potential bulk buyers, such as WalMart Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd, directly with farmers, bypassing wholesale markets and commission agents.Punjab’s state government is opposed to the new farm laws and a seventh round of talks between farmer unions and federal government officials is scheduled on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-probes-if-protesting-farmers-sabotaged-telecom-infrastructure/story-aXVnox2zL25yts1K66kSaJ.html

The September 3 order, was operational on all lending institutions and banks throughout the country and was passed in the favour of all borrowers accounts to grant relief from financial stress during Covid-19, the petitioner claimed.The contemptuous act of the respondents has not only disobeyed the court’s order but has also caused “severe irreparable damage” and loss to the petitioner. The petitioner has lost its market value and credit. It cannot make supply, all supplies have been on hold after the account has been turned NPA, the petitioner claimed.“The contemptuous act of the respondents has shaken the confidence of the public and has degraded the trust of the borrowers. In this pandemic, where all borrowers are passing through the worst scenario. That this stay order was operational throughout the nation and was in the Public Interest,” the petition stated.The stay order was operating as the life-saving drug to the petitioner but the contemptuous act of the respondent has brought a major setback to the firm and its survival has become critical, the petitioner claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-filed-over-punishing-sbi-officials-for-violating-sc-s-order/story-lQkGIchcYESdCf9eIREv9J.html
28-12-2020||India||Centre identifies 10 labs for monitoring genomic variations in Sars-CoV-2||The Centre has identified 10 advanced regional laboratories to serve as regional hub laboratories for genome sequencing as part of its surveillance strategy to monitor the genomic variations in the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The union health ministry’s guidance document on genomic sequencing released on Monday.The ministry has also established Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) which will oversee the surveillance work on a regular basis and also assist in developing potential vaccines in future.All the genomic sequencing data will be maintained in a national database at two sites, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani (West Bengal), and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Also Read: Centre forms genomic surveillance consortium to check spread of new coronavirus variantApart from ascertaining the current status of the new variant of Sars-Cov-2 virus, the project also aims to establish sentinel surveillance for early detection of genomic variants with public health implications and to determine genomic variants in unusual events or trends such as super-spreader events.While it is known and expected that viruses constantly mutate leading to the emergence of new variants, preliminary analysis based on epidemiological and mathematical models in the UK suggests that this variant is significantly more transmissible than previously circulating variants, with an estimated potential to increase the reproductive number (R0) by 0.4 or greater with an estimated increased transmissibility of up to 70%.However, there is no experimental evidence or indication at this point of increased infection severity associated with the aforementioned new variant. Also, few cases with the new variant have to date been reported by Denmark, Netherlands and Australia.Belgium has also reported the new UK variant of Sars-Cov-2, according to some unconfirmed reports.“Also, very recent media reports revealed the emergence of a second variant in UK (contacts with travellers from South Africa) and a third variant in Nigeria, suggesting continuous virus evolution,” said the health ministry document.“In case the UK variant or any other variant mutation is detected in any sample, it will be sent to any of the two notified Covid virus repositories at RCB, Faridabad or NIV, Pune for isolating and culturing. This can then be shared as per notified guidelines for development of assays, which will help in validation of diagnostics and also testing of the vaccines under development…,” it said.National Centre for Disease Control’s nodal unit will maintain a database of all samples of the new variants of public health significance. The data will be epidemiologically analysed, interpreted and shared with states for investigation, contact tracing and planning response strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-identifies-10-labs-in-india-for-monitoring-genomic-variations-in-sars-cov-2/story-1a4hiaVuOFkYFsiqRMMfzJ.html

According to Rawat’s personal physician, Dr NS Bisht, chief minister’s health is fine and his fever has also come down to some extent. “The CM has got a mild infection in his lungs. After consulting with AIIMS doctors, they advised he be brought to Delhi for tests,” he said. Dr Anurag Agarwal, nodal officer for Covid-19 at Doon hospital, said. “His health condition is fine but as a precaution, we had advised him to get admitted.”. Earlier, the CM was in home isolation. In September, Rawat had isolated himself after his Officer on Special Duty (OSD) had tested positive for Covid-19. That time the CM himself had tested negative, but as a precaution, he had decided to isolate himself. Earlier on August 26, the chief minister had gone into self-isolation after three of his staffers tested positive for Covid-19. Earlier this year on June 1, Rawat and two of his cabinet ministers had decided to quarantine themselves after cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj tested positive for Covid-19. Rawat had attended a cabinet meeting with Maharaj. Later on June 6, Rawat had tested negative for Covid-19. Uttarakhand has so far reported over 8,9000 Covid-19 positive cases and 1,483 Covid deaths. The positivity rate in the state stands at 5.20% and case fatality rate at 1.65 %. Dehradun district has so far reported the maximum 26,806 Covid-19 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-ve-uttarakhand-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-flown-to-delhi-for-treatment/story-NKXaoRbL1FkSNF8HhsBj6L.html

In this PTS, passengers are counted and tracked anonymously using the ceiling-mounted sensors. The PTS receives data streams from the sensors and provides the airport operator with valuable key performance indicators (KPIs) such as waiting times, process times and passenger throughput.“The KPIs are visualized on an intuitive dashboard, enabling airports to quickly identify crowded areas and bottlenecks,” the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said.The operator has put PTS display screens at various points of Terminal 3: check-in hall, arrival pier junction, etc.The DIAL said it has installed Xovis PTS after successful trials to “ensure better management of passenger flow and adherence to social distancing norms as a part of Covid-19 protocol”. The Civil Aviation Ministry had resumed scheduled domestic passenger services from May 25, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, airlines are permitted to operate maximum 80 per cent of their pre-Covid flights. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-airport-s-terminal-3-installs-new-passenger-tracking-system/story-6Xt3ofxJ5OkAoKzCA125IM.html

When our government was formed in 2014, only five cities had metro services and today 18 cities have metro rail service. By 2025, we will take this service to more than 25 cities,” said PM Modi. “Make In India is very important for the expansion of metro services. It reduces cost, saves foreign currency and provides more employment to people,” he added. The Prime Minister inaugurated India’s first-ever driverless train on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line and launched National Common Mobility Card on the Airport Express Line today, via video conferencing.“We noted that the expansion of the metro, modern modes of transport should be used according to the needs of the people of the city and the professional lifestyle there,” the PM added.This is the reason why work is being done on different types of metro rails in different cities, he said. “Delhi-Meerut RRTS will reduce the distance of Delhi and Meerut to less than an hour. MetroLight - In cities where passenger numbers are less, work is being done on MetroLite version. It is prepared at 40 per cent cost of the normal metro,” said PM Modi. “Work is also being done on Metro Neo in the cities where the ridership is less. It is built at the cost of 25 per cent of the normal metro. Similarly, water metro - this is also an example of out of the box thinking,” he added. Today, four big companies are manufacturing metro coaches in the country and dozens of companies are engaged in the manufacture of metro components. This is helping Make in India as well as the campaign for self-reliant India, the Prime Minister stated. “We are also using a braking system in which 50 per cent of the energy goes back into the grid when the brakes are applied. Today 130 MW of solar power is being used in metro rail, which will be increased to 600 MW,” said PM Modi. “Providing the same standards and facilities for modernisation is very important. The Common Mobility Card at the national level is a major step in this direction. Wherever you travel, whichever public transport you travel, this one card will give you integrated access,” he added. Today, by consolidating all the systems, the strength of the country is being increased. Like One Nation, One Mobility Card, our government has done many things in the past years to integrate the systems of the country, the Prime Minister said. “One Nation, One Fastag has made travel seamless on highways across the country. One Nation, One Tax i.e. GST has ended the tax net across the country. One Nation, One Power Grid, is ensuring adequate and continuous power availability in every part of the country. Power loss is reduced,” said PM Modi. One Nation, One Gas Grid, is ensuring Seamless Gas Connectivity of the parts where gas-based life and economy used to be a dream earlier, the Prime Minister said. One Nation, One Health Assurance Scheme i.e. millions of people from Ayushman India are taking advantage of this anywhere in the country, he further stated.“Citizens moving from one place to another because of One Nation, One Ration Card, have got freedom from the cycle of making new ration cards. Similarly, the country is moving in the direction of One Nation, One Agriculture Market with new agricultural reforms and arrangements like e-NAM,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-services-to-reach-over-25-cities-by-2025-says-pm-modi/story-sCEwFthsog2tByYmd2O1SK.html
28-12-2020||India||‘Took urbanisation as opportunity not challenge’: PM Modi on India’s first driverless Metro||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday flagged off India’s first driverless train on the Magenta Line of Delhi Metro. Delivering a virtual address at the ceremony, which also witnessed the launch of the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), PM Modi said that this was possible because “we took urbanisation as an opportunity, not a challenge.”“Today’s ceremony is an attempt to turn urban development, urban ready and future ready,” the prime minister said. He, however, added that till a few years ago, when it came to urbanisation, no attention was paid to its future needs, people worked half-heartedly and there was confusion all around. “Urbanisation was taking place rapidly but our cities were not equipped at the same speed to deal with its after effects,” PM Modi said, adding that this led to a huge gap between the demand for urban infrastructure and its delivery.He then recalled how it was only under his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart and former prime minister Atal Vihari Vajpayee that Delhi’s first-ever Metro was flagged off in 2002. PM Modi also noted how when his first government came to power in 2014, only five cities had Metro services as compared to 18 today. “By 2025, we will expand Metro services to more than 25 cities,” he vowed.PM Modi then compared Metro-related statistics from today to those earlier. “This isn’t just an infrastructure made of bricks, stones and concrete. This, in fact, is the evidence of the fulfilment of the ambitions of the country’s middle class,” he remarked.How did this change come about when the bureaucracy and the people are the same, PM Modi questioned. This, he said, was because his government treated urbanisation not as a challenge, but as an opportunity. “In our country, there was never a policy for the Metro,” the prime minister remarked.India’s first driverless Metro will run on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line, between Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden. Monday’s inauguration also came just days after PM Modi laid the foundation stone of the construction work of the Agra Metro, in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-urbanisation-as-opportunity-not-challenge-pm-modi-on-india-s-first-driverless-metro/story-jRXZFqB9DRjJ5ZrCBeDbgI.html

The total solar eclipse on December 4, the last of 2021, will, however, not be visible from India,” he added.This year, there were two solar and four lunar eclipses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-eclipses-in-2021-two-to-be-visible-in-india/story-WXAcKi6FJfWIQBvy2PzAhI.html

28-12-2020||India||50 panchayat body representatives resign over 2 BSF camps in Chhattisgarh||At least 50 representatives of panchayat bodies, including 38 sarpanchs, have resigned protesting against the opening of two Border Security Force (BSF) camps in Koliabeda area of Kanker district on Sunday. They have been protesting against the camps since Wednesday. Thousands of people from about 103 villages started a protest in Pakhanjore in Kanker, demanding that the BSF camps be moved out. The tribals allege that the area falls under the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act and permission of gram panchayat was not taken by the government before establishment of these, also that it encroaches upon the place of local tribal deities. “Since Wednesday, we have been protesting here but nothing positive came out. Senior officials came for talks but they have not given any assurance. On Sunday, at least 38 sarpanchs, seven Janpad panchayat members, one deputy sarpanch and one zila panchayat member submitted their resignations and demanded action,” Tillu Ram Usendi, a tribal leader, told HT. The villagers claimed that they have no problem with the camps, but they are being put up at a place where their deities reside. “The camps of Katgaon and Kamdera are affecting the tribals’ faith. We are demanding that the camps should be removed from the area because it comes under the PESA Act and permission of villagers is needed,” said Lachhhu Gavade, a villager protesting in Pakhanjur. The villagers also submitted a memorandum to the Governor and local administration, demanding removal of the camps. Bastar police claimed that the Maoists are forcing the innocent tribals to protest against camps because they are losing their ground. Senior officials said that in the year 2020, the government established 16 new base camps in the erstwhile stronghold areas of Maoists in Bastar Range. The BSF camps in Katgaon and Kamdera are among these 16 newly established camps, which they say would be a game changer for peace and development of the region. “Out of fear of losing ground in the core area, Maoists try to misguide the local population and pressurise them to protest against the security forces. But people have started realising that the security forces are there for the well being of the native population. During camp establishment, we take care of all local sentiments and gradually bridge the gap between the security forces and the local population,” said IG Bastar Sunderaj P in a statement issued to the media. “Surely people for whose ‘security’ these camps are ostensibly set up should have a say in the matter? The protesters are right in reminding the government that their land falls under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India and the spirit of the PESA Act of 1996 clearly gives them a right to say ‘No’ through gram sabhas,” said Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist, based in Bastar. Kanker Collector Chandan Kumar said the issue would be resolved soon and claimed that “prima facie, it seems the villagers have been staging protesting under pressure from “violent forces”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-panchayat-body-representatives-resign-over-2-bsf-camps-in-chhattisgarh/story-PReGZdRc31HXFu5OsdSkEP.html
28-12-2020||India||PM Modi flags off India’s first driverless train on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday flagged off the country’s first ever fully-automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line of the Delhi Metro.With the commencement of these new-generation trains, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has entered the elite league of “seven per cent of world’s Metro networks” which can operate services without drivers, according to DMRC.“This shows how fast India is progressing towards a smart system. The Delhi metro is now connected through National Common Mobility Card (NCMC),” PM Modi said on the occasion.“A few years ago, there was not much focus on smart systems. There was lackadaisical approach, so we saw a huge difference between urbanisation and technological development. Our government changed that,” he added.PM Modi further said that urbanisation should be considered as an opportunity to fulfil the goal of ease of living.NCMC, dubbed as ‘One Nation One Card’, is an inter-operable transport card that allows the holders to also pay for their bus travel, toll taxes, parking charges, retail shopping and even withdraw money.These innovations are going to herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility for the residents of Delhi and other cities in the National Capital Region.The commercial operation of these new-generation trains, set to be a major technological feat, will begin later the same day, after the event, news agency PTI quoted a DMRC official as saying.This was the first major event of Delhi Metro in 2020 which saw an unprecedented lockdown in the earlier months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Delhi Metro had resumed services with curtailed operation on the Yellow Line from September 7 after being closed for over five months. Its currently operational network spans about 390 km with 285 stations across 11 corridors (including Noida-Greater Noida line).Delhi Metro had begun its commercial operation on December 25, 2002, a day after the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had inaugurated DMRC’s first stretch, spanning 8.2 km from Shahdara to Tis Hazari, with just six stations.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-flags-off-india-s-first-driverless-train-on-delhi-metro-s-magenta-line/story-jJlgY4dOiCf7wmK6Wme5SJ.html

They have sought time for a month, so I have given them time till January-end. If my demands are not met, I will resume my huger strike protest. This would be my last protest,” the 83-year-old said.On December 14, Hazare wrote a letter to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar warning of a hunger strike if his demands like the implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations and granting autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), were not accepted.Senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagade recently met Hazare to explain him the details of the three farm laws introduced by the Centre.Hazare observed a fast on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by farmer organisations demanding a repeal of the agri laws.Farmers have been protesting at borders of Delhi for over a month against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting tillers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

The state government has initiated strict action against 900 farmers in the last three months post paddy harvesting season by blocking government incentives and subsidies paid through direct benefit transfer( DBT) for three years in 11 districts.Bihar is the only state in India where such a system has been put in place since last year, linking government incentives for farmers with compliance to the ban on stubble burning – seen as a major contributor to air pollution.The officer also said that the huge cut in subsidy was also attributed to the financial strain the state was suffering due to the impact of coronavirus pandemic.“The state plan head size for subsidy on farm mechanisation has been reduced to Rs 23.69 crore in 2020-21 against Rs 163 crore in the last fiscal. While the state government is offering subsidy on 17 equipment, the central government is providing subsidy to farmers on 16 other implements under different schemes,” said the officer.The state government has already discontinued subsidy on combine harvester, which left the straw on the field after cropping of wheat. Now, farmers would not be getting the financial support to purchase power tillers, power threshers, etc. However, subsidy would continue on purchases of brush cutter, super seeder, happy seeder, self-propelled ripper, straw ripper, straw management system and mini rice and oil mills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-government-ends-subsidy-on-63-farm-implements/story-8mUX6e9QDgmLRIpXl3YTgJ.html

Ground frost and dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region,” the IMD had said on Sunday.It said that a western disturbance led to rise in temperature in the region, but once it withdraws, cold wave to severe cold wave conditions will prevail in the region.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh; scattered rainfall/snowfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and isolated rain/thundershowers over northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on 27th-28th December,” the IMD said in its all-India weather bulletin on Sunday.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’, the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake, as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-knocks-in-delhi-and-parts-of-north-india-temprature-falls-by-1-2-c-imd/story-L5TMsvC3rLeYIxDrClLqpM.html

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala confirmed that Gandhi has left the country, but did not disclose the location. “Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has left for abroad for a short personal visit and will be away for a few days,” Surjewala told PTI.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party questioned the timing of Gandhi’s visit. So much of noise was made for farmers protest by the opp, where is #RG now? Short holiday? Seriously?

He maintained it was nothing in comparison to what lord gives us.“It is not at all a waste as in Gujjar community we pour some milk on deity Devnarayan as it protects our cattle,” said Ramlal on being quizzed if the exercise did not seem like a gargantuan waste of resources.We owe everything to the lord so we donated milk products to him for the foundation ceremony, he said.The temple, being built at a cost of Rs 1 crore, will be ready in two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-000-litres-of-milk-curd-poured-in-foundation-pit-for-rajasthan-temple/story-VKjZ05LZ3llF6IqHY9nIQP.html

This took the nationwide tally to 10,207,871.The trend of falling active cases of the disease continued with the number further coming down to 2,77,301. The number of patients discharged from hospitals between Sunday and Monday stood at 97,82,669, according to health ministry update.The country recorded 279 fresh fatalities in the said period, which took the nationwide death toll to 1,47,901.According to health ministry update on Sunday, India recorded the lowest single-day rise in Covid-19 cases in nearly six months at 18,732. The active caseload also dipped to 2.78 lakh, the lowest after 170 days, the health ministry said.Meanwhile, the health authorities are set to hold a two-day dry run from Monday in four states for its proposed ambitious vaccination drive likely to be kicked off in January. The states where this drive will be held are Punjab, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.The exercise will include necessary data entry in Co-WIN, an online platform for monitoring of vaccine delivery, testing receipt and allocation, deployment of team members, mock drill of session sites with test beneficiaries, the Union Health Ministry had said.As part of the strategy that has been put in place to detect and contain the mutant variant detected in the UK, five per cent of the positive cases of Covid-19 from all states and union territories will be tested for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), the health ministry had said on Saturday after a meeting of the National Task Force (NTF) on Covid-19 on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-021-new-covid-19-cases-take-india-s-tally-to-10-2-million-death-toll-at-147-901/story-7l1KhJcInqTx9sgLcjzTEL.html
28-12-2020||India||Expert panel may convene this week to examine Oxford vaccine emergency-use authorisation||The subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to meet sometime this week to examine Serum Institute of India’s (SII) emergency-use authorisation (EUA) application for Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to government sources.SII, which is manufacturing and testing the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in India, last week had submitted additional data to the national drugs regulator that it had sought for its EUA application in its last meeting on December 9. “The subject expert committee is likely to be convened this week to go through the application. Since Pfizer had also sought a fresh date to present its case on its EUA application of its anti-Covid-19 vaccine, the committee is likely to give them time the same date,” said an official in the government in the know of things, requesting not to be identified. Also Read: Shot will be effective against Covid-19 variant: AstraZenecaThe UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is also considering data for grant of EUA to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and its approval for the vaccine candidate will provide an added advantage to receiving the regulatory approval in India.It is likely that Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate may be the first anti-Covid-19 vaccine to be granted emergency-use approval in India. Pfizer may be asked to conduct a small bridging study among the Indian population to know the vaccine candidate’s effect among local population. “Since Pfizer has not conducted a clinical trial in India for its vaccine candidate, the company may be asked to do that first. They could also get a waiver from trials as they already have EUA from other national regulators such as in the US and UK. The ultimate call, however, will be of the experts,” the official added. CDSCO’s SEC had last convened on December 9 to examine three applications for grant of EUA—SII and Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate as well as the Bharat Biotech-Indian Council of Medical Research vaccine candidate.During the last meeting, the SEC indicated it may wait till MHRA’s assessment was complete and it had decided on whether to clear the vaccine in UK before the data presented by SII was reviewed. The SEC asked the Hyderabad-based company to present efficacy data, which is likely to take longer to derive since its late stage trials began in mid-November. Bharat Biotech is yet to reply to the regulator, the official quoted above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cdsco-expert-panel-may-convene-this-week-to-examine-covid-vaccines-emergency-applications/story-JiRqmhI0Ii2sQSGV7pGJJP.html

This comes on a day when protests against the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws entered day 33.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railway minister Piyush Goyal - two of the three central ministers who have represented the Centre in its talks with the farmers’ unions - will also be present on the occasion.“Kisan Rail has been a game-changer in ensuring fast transportation of agricultural produce across the nation. It provides a seamless supply chain of perishable produce,” the prime minister’s office (PMO) had noted in a statement on Saturday. The 100th ‘Kisan Rail’ will run between Sangola in Maharashtra and West Bengal’s Shalimar and, the PMO statement said, will carry vegetables such as cauliflower, capsicum, cabbage, drumsticks, chillies, onions, and fruits like grapes, oranges, pomegranate, bananas, custard apples etc.The first service of the “multi-commodity” Kisan Rail was launched on August 7 by Tomar via video conferencing. The service was launched between Maharashtra’s Devlali and Danapur in Bihar and was later expanded to Muzaffarpur in the eastern state following a good response. Also, it was made a weekly service instead of the initial thrice a week frequency. Since its launch, the Kisan Rail service has transported 27,000 tonnes of agro-services. The Centre has also extended a subsidy of 50% on the transportation of fruits and vegetables.The launch of the 100th Kisan Rail comes a day before the sixth round of talks are likely to take place between the government and the farmers’ unions. The unions on Saturday proposed that the talks take place at 11 am on December 29, in their response to the government’s invitation to hold the dialogue at a time and date of their choosing. Earlier, the unions had rejected the government’s initial proposal in this regard.Five earlier rounds of talks, including one each on December 1, 3 and 5, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-flag-off-100th-kisan-rail-today-as-anti-farm-law-protests-enter-day-33/story-8Yraulabg0sC0ikkkG4PMN.html
28-12-2020||India||Will snatch Rae Bareli as well in 2024: Smiti Irani warns Congress||The BJP will snatch Rae Bareli too in the next Lok Sabha elections, declared Union minister Smriti Irani in Uttar Pradesh while she was visiting her constituency Amethi - where the BJP leader proved to be a giant slayer when she beat Rahul Gandhi during the 2019 general elections.Irani, who began her three-day Amethi tour on Friday, made a quick visit to Rae Bareli, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s Lok Sabha constituency since 2004.The minister had also visited Lucknow for a meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath before heading back to her constituency to make the statement about “wresting Rae Bareli”.“Remember, if you continue to harass BJP workers, then in 2024 we will snatch Rae Bareli, too,” Smriti said at a public meeting.Keeping up the attack on the Gandhi family, Irani dared Rahul Gandhi for a debate on the farmers’ issue and raised questions about Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s proposed Kisan Yatra in UP, describing it as a stunt. The union minister for textiles and women and child development also tagged a tweet by BJP chief JP Nadda to question Rahul Gandhi’s opposition to farm laws. She tweeted that Amethi’s farmers, fed up with the Congress, voted for the BJP in the last Lok Sabha polls.The farmers, camping on the Delhi borders for a month, have been demanding a total repeal of the new reforms-oriented laws that provide for setting up of private markets outside of designated mandis, allow contract farming without government regulation and also lift stockholding limits for farm produce.The Congress termed Irani’s statement as political posturing. Local BJP leaders said her statement reflected it had the backing of the top party leadership.Congress lawmaker Deepak Singh, who hails from Amethi, released a letter to Smriti Irani, seeking her response to five queries that included charges against her family. “Unless you respond to these queries, it would be presumed that all the charges against you are true,” Deepak Singh wrote to Smriti.The Congress MLC had previously described Smriti as a “political tourist” in Amethi. The union minister also spoke of projects rolled out for Amethi since she became the local MP in 2019 but party leaders said that the Yogi Adityanath government had sanctioned big ticket projects for Rae Bareli, too. Apart from AIIMS-Rae Bareli, the Ganga Expressway, which would connect Meerut to Prayagraj, will pass through Rae Bareli. Pacts with private investors for fabricators and feeder factory for rail coach, a spice park for research on mint have been sanctioned for the only surviving Congress bastion in the state, party leaders said. This was evident when deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who also heads state’s public works department (PWD), dedicated schemes worth Rs 79.5 crore for Amethi even as Smriti Irani pushed for more roads worth Rs 112 crore for her constituency. After Amethi, Maurya visited the Bachhrawan assembly segment, part of Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency, and announced schemes worth several crore rupees. This assembly segment was won by the BJP in 2017 polls.The minister ended her visit by listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio programme Mann ki Baat in the Salon assembly segment of Rae Bareli. Like Bachhrawan, Salon too was won by the BJP. Of the five assembly segments that make up Rae Bareli, the BJP had won three in the 2017 UP polls before Smriti Irani’s impressive victory in Amethi two years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-snatch-rae-bareli-as-well-in-2024-smiti-irani-messages-congress/story-nB2TkK8gKKKotcOIutrV5J.html

He is a part of the 30-member stage management committee at the protest site. For Singh, the day starts at 4 am when the committee members gather and start setting up the stage for the day. They first lay down the carpets on the stage and the sitting area in front. He also checks microphones, speakers, and lights around the stage.All the team members carry walkie talkies throughout the day to stay connected and help each other in managing the work efficiently. “Our friends who sit near a mall (situated at the highway) keep on informing us about the celebrity speakers or prominent personalities visiting the protest site via walkie-talkie. We then facilitate their entry into the stage area as it is not open to everyone. If anyone wants to address the gathering from the stage they can also approach us. We ask them about their political affiliations and the content they intend to speak about before allowing them to go to the stage,” he said.After 7:30 pm, he and his team members wind up the work. They roll up the carpets with the help of volunteers, remove all the microphones, lights, and chairs. “We make sleeping space for farmers on the stage and provide blankets. While some of the committee members sleep inside the tent set up behind the stage, many of us go back to our trolleys. Even during the nights, we keep our walkie-talkie on so that any of our team members can reach out to us in case of emergency. Ours is a 24*7 job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-leave-walkie-talkies-on-at-night-too-ours-is-a-24x7-job-how-devinder-singh-ensures-farmers-stir-keeps-going/story-Iet3cbe8ELzkmRtZvRXSSO.html

The forecast comes at a time when several places in the region, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, are recording minimum temperature below the five-degree Celsius mark.Though the mercury rose slightly in Delhi due to a western disturbance, the department said the relief will be short-lived as cold and dry northerly and northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas are likely to bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius.The IMD has issued health warning and suggested action to minimise the impact of severe cold.According to the weather department, the likelihood catching illnesses like flu, running nose or nosebleed will increase in case of prolonged exposure to cold. It further said that in case the body starts shivering, it is not something to be ignored and the affected person should immediately get indoor.“Frostbite can occur due to prolonged exposure to cold. The skin turns pale, hard and numb and eventually black blisters appear on the exposed body parts such as fingers, toes, nose and or earlobes. Severe frostbite needs immediate medical attention and treatment,” the IMD said in its health warning.And in case a person is exposed to severe cold, here are the actions suggested by the IMD:• Moisturise your skin regularly with oil/cream• Eat vitamin C rich fruits and vegetables and drink sufficient fluids, preferably warm fluids to maintain adequate immunity• Don’t drink alcohol, it reduces your body temperature• Avoid or limit outdoor activities• Keep dry, if wet, change clothes immediately to prevent loss of body heat. Wear insulated/water-proof shoes• Warm the affected area of the body slowly with lukewarm water; do not rub the skin vigorously• If the affected skin area turns black, immediately consult a doctor• Maintain ventilation while using heaters to avoid inhaling toxic fumes• Take safety measures while using electrical and gas heating devices||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-imd-issues-health-warning-suggests-action-in-case-of-prolonged-exposure/story-ZIlppiQGN3TDIa9mRylssJ.html

But the task wasn’t like anything they expected. “On the first day we brought 500 large dustbin bags, but they were grossly inadequate. Next day we had to equip ourselves with 1,000 bags,” said Jaggi, adding that the cleaning exercise involved fixing these bags outside trucks and trolleys to ensure farmers did not dump garbage on the roads.

28-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Seven months after fleeing lockdown, migrant worker says ‘don’t have courage to go back to city’||It’s almost seven months since B Ajurm Patro fled Chennai for her home in Manapalli village in Odisha’s Ganjam district with her three-year-old daughter and husband. Patro accompanied her husband B Ghana Patro to Chennai, accompanied by 30 other women of Manapalli in February this year. Ghana and the couple’s 20-year-old son Kailash worked at a construction site.Ajurm lifted bricks and carried mixture of cement and sand for Rs 350-400 a day in a construction site in KK Nagar area of Chennai. Her mason husband earned Rs 700 and son another Rs 400 as a painter.When the lockdown was clamped on March 25, all three lost their jobs. Worried for their survival and the health of her three-year-old daughter Smrutilekha, the couple pooled in their life savings and paid Rs 9,000 for two seats on a bus back home in May.Covid-19 cases have abated considerably across India, but Ajurm and Ghana aren’t keen to go back, despite their depressed incomes back home. “Life is tough here with all the money that we make working in others fields spent on filling our stomach. But I don’t want to go back to Chennai where life is tougher. The money that we made in Chennai was more than what we earn. But I don’t think I am ready to go there with my three-year-old daughter to an alien city,” said Ajurm.Ghana was the first migrant worker in the family who, in 2015, travelled to Ahmedabad for work at a construction site, then moved to Mumbai and finally Chennai. His son Kailash joined him after finishing high school in 2019. Since their return from Chennai, the landless Patro couple work in fields as sharecroppers. The share of harvest that they get is barely enough for the family. Besides, work is not available every day. “Not much NREGS [National Rural Employment Guarantee Act] work is available too. Though some women and men from my village have gone to Chennai and other places after lifting of lockdown, I don’t have the courage to go back again after the frightful experience of May,” said Ajurm, referring to the national rural jobs guarantee scheme.Kailash, who took a flight back to the state in September to attend his uncle’s cremation, is also not in a mood to go back.“I went to Chennai to supplement my family income. But frankly I never liked painting walls in buildings like other migrant workers from my village. I want to join Odisha police or do some government job that would give me some stability. I will try hard to get a job in Odisha police over next 12 months,” said Kailash. He now worries that his savings of Rs 50000 might run out soon.In case, a government job does not materialise, Kailash wants to open a small shop like other migrant workers of his village. “I am not sure what to do next. Everything depends on my family’s financial stability.

The All India Congress Committee (AICC) members have instructed party state units to organise ‘Tiranga Yatra’ and run a social media campaign ‘Selfie with Tiranga’ in order to engage with the youth. They have also issued instructions to follow social distancing protocols in the view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The INC, formed on December 28, 1885, conducted its first session in Mumbai from the aforementioned date to December 31 of that year under the chairmanship of lawyer Umesh Chandra Banerjee.“December 28, 2020, marks the 136th year of the foundation of INC. On this day, the PCCs are requested to observe the party foundation day in state and district headquarters and instruct office-bearers, MPs, MLAs/MLCs to participate in the functions,” the AICC said in a press release. ”Tiranga Yatras and other such innovative campaigns may also be organised following the necessary social distancing protocols,” it added.The party, which has been speaking up in support of the farmers agitating against the three farm laws on the borders of the national Capital, will also focus on extending solidarity with them as part of its foundation day celebrations. “The PCCs are also requested to pay solidarity to our fighting farmers who are sitting in an indefinite protest against the farm laws,” the release read.“INC has been at the forefront in the efforts to forge a secular, democratic and united India, an India which is a world leader in all fields and has always put India first despite all odds and obstacles. The INC fought for and won India’s independence, forged the constitutional idea of India, built up the nation from one of the poorest (when India gained independence) in the world to a global superpower,” AICC said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will not attend the programmes organised by the party as he will be on a personal trip abroad. Party general secretary  Randeep Surjewala confirmed this on Sunday. ”Rahul Gandhi is currently travelling on a short personal trip,” he said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-foundation-day-show-of-solidarity-with-farmers-protest-tiranga-yatra-on-the-cards/story-EclBDjKn0ITFxrxF8wEwuK.html
28-12-2020||India||‘Covid crisis pushed us to the very limit’, says the woman who took the pandemic head on||In her maroon and yellow salwar kameez, Laxmipriya Sahoo is an unlikely fighter against the Covid pandemic. The 36-year-old from Bhubaneswar’s Subas Nagar slum in Dumuduma area is one of the state’s 150,000 anganwadi workers manning the 72,000-odd anganwadi centres that function as the nodes of healthcare and education for the poor.Mother to a seven-year-old girl , Sahoo spent 2020 fighting the twin battles of undernutrition and the virus, all at a paltry monthly salary of Rs 7,500. In normal times, Sahoo and her colleagues have their hands full. They distribute eggs to families, take a ration of Chhatua(a powder of roasted Bengal gram, wheat, groundnut and sugar), suji halwa, maize halwa, ragi halwa, jaggery laddoo and besan laddoo to the newborn, those between 3 and 6, and pregnant and lactating women. After March, Sahoo and others were asked to join a new battle: Against Covid-19. “While the work at anganwadi centre was challenging enough, Covid-19 pushed us to the limit,” she said.With anganwadi centres shut in the nationwide lockdown from March 25, Sahoo had to go to the houses of children and pregnant mothers to distribute ration and eggs. “Babies were still being born, pregnant women needed regular health check-ups, and new mothers needed to be supported with breastfeeding and feeding young children,” added Sahoo, who works as an anganwadi worker in Ward No 65 of Dumuduma area under Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.As the months went by, the workload piled up as they were designated Covid warriors and asked to supervise quarantine centres and containment zones. Earlier, work at the anganwadi centre used to finish by 3 pm, leaving Sahoo enough time to look after her small family. But once the pandemic started, she could couldn’t take a break even as her family income dwindled after her husband’s betel shop shut during the 68-day national lockdown.“After the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation started containment of areas where more and more Covid cases were reported, I had to visit each of the houses in my area to check on suspect cases. I had to inform the BMC about any person entering the area from outside, meet that person and advise them to stay in quarantine for 14 days. This did not go well most of the time as people fought with me,” said Sahoo.Sahoo’s work was anything but smooth. In March, soon after she was deployed on Covid-19 duty, a 26-year-old man from her area tested positive for the virus. As a frontline worker, she was supposed to locate him and help BMC officials admit him to hospital. But the man had intentionally misrepresented his address and age. Sahoo was further alarmed after she found the man participated in a community feast after developing Covid-19 symptoms. The address he provided turned out to be an abandoned site, but when Sahoo traced his real home and reached there to get the family quarantined, they fought with her and accused her of misappropriating government money. Luckily, no one from his family tested positive, though seven of his friends developed symptoms and had to be hospitalised. Sahoo said she was lucky compared to other anganwadi workers, such as Rama Sundari Panda in Jajpur district, who was thrashed when he attempted to put some people under quarantine. Sahoo’s other challenge was ensuring a regular supply of provisions in a local containment zone for 14 days and also look after the quarantine centre. Especially sticky was ensuring people didn’t jump quarantine.“Many people jumped quarantine centre for which we had to lodge complain before the police. Many times, the stickers that we put up in front of the house of Covid positive patients were torn . We had another problem in distribution of rice and pulses that was announced for people during lockdown. People who had ration cards got the rice and pulses. But those who did not have cards verbally abused me accusing me of gobbling up their share of rice and dal,” said Sahoo. In the middle of this crushing schedule, she had to visit the houses of 72 children to train their mothers on starting pre-formal education and carrying on the vaccination drive.Sahoo alleged that despite the dedication and commitment, they did not get masks and sanitisers regularly. “We had to buy our own masks and sanitisers. In Odisha, 18 anganwadi workers died while doing Covid duty…I had my husband, daughter and mother at home and would feel scared when I returned home after doing Covid duty,” said Sahoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-crisis-pushed-us-to-the-very-limit-says-the-woman-who-took-the-pandemic-head-on/story-Bs0ShISmjixMYPCTAlEx2N.html

28-12-2020||India||2020: A year of great volatility in commodity and financial markets||2020 saw perhaps the most bizarre economic event in the history of modern capitalism when the price of the futures contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the benchmark for US crude oil prices, turned negative on April 21. To be sure, WTI crude falling below zero that day had a technical aspect to it. “The price plunge was partly due to the way oil is traded. A futures contract is for 1,000 barrels of crude, delivered into Cushing, where energy companies own storage tanks with roughly 76 million barrels of capacity. Each contract trades for a month, with the May contract due to expire on Tuesday (April 22). Investors holding May contracts didn’t want to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs, and in the end had to pay people to take it off their hands”, a Reuters story explained. This otherwise bizarre event is also the best illustration of the importance of future expectations in a lot of transactions in commodity and financial markets in today’s world.As the global economy moved between bouts of pessimism and optimism in a pandemic-ravaged year, driven by developments on the virus and vaccine fronts and the policy response to the pandemic, expectations and markets also suffered great volatility. Here are four charts which capture these swings.2020 was the most volatile year for oil prices since 1987US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has daily data on Brent crude prices since May 20, 1987. An HT analysis of this data shows that 2020 saw the highest intra-year variation – the minimum and maximum daily price in a year – of 670.3% in oil prices during this period. This is more than twice the second highest intra-year fluctuation of 326.8%, which happened in 2008, the year when the global financial crisis broke out. 2020 also saw the highest number of instances when inter-day movement in Brent crude prices was more than 5%. To be sure, the EIA data excludes the period of the oil-shock of 1973, when oil prices jumped in a big way. Indian stock markets suffered their biggest inter-day fall in 2020The BSE Sensex, India’s benchmark stock market index, suffered its biggest ever inter-day fall of 13.15% on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown. The Sensex fell from its previous day’s close of 29,915.96 to 25,981.24, the lowest value since 26 December, 2016. The year 2020 included 3 trading sessions -- 12, 16 and 23 March that saw among the top 10 biggest inter-day falls in the index history. Daily BSE indices are available from April 3, 1979 on the BSE’s website.Markets were quick to recover though. By March 26, the BSE Sensex was back at the March 22 level. It maintained its upward trajectory since then and crossed the pre-lockdown all-time high of 41,952.6 on January 14, 2020 by closing at 42,597.4 on November 9, 2020. The BSE has increased further since then and was at an all-time high of 46,973.5 on 24 December 2020.The largest inter-day gain in BSE was seen on 18 May 2009 when it rose by 17.34%. For 2020, the highest inter-day rise was on 7 April 2020 when the index values gained 8.97% which was also the 10th highest historically. Apart from these two instances of high inter-day increases, all the other top 10 biggest inter-day gains for the BSE Sensex are from 1992 or earlier years. There were nine days in 2020, when the inter-day change in the BSE Sensex was 5% or more. The most volatile year on this count was 2008, the year of the global financial crisis. A comparison of intra-year variation of high and low values at the BSE puts 2020 at the ninth rank, with 2008 topping the charts once again.Volatility in US Stock marketsBloomberg has daily data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), US’s primary equity index, since 30 January 1895. The DJIA suffered its fourth highest inter-day fall of 12.9% on March 16 this year. It is the biggest inter-day fall since the Black Monday crash of 19 October 1987, when it fell by 22.61% which was also its biggest inter-day fall in the history of the DJIA. Like in India, equity markets recovered quickly in the US as well. The DJIA closed at 30,303.37 on 17 December 2020, its highest ever value. If one were to look at the intra-year variation in the DJIA’s values, 2020 is ranked 11th. However, except in 2008, all other years of higher intra-year variation happened before the Second World War. Global Policy Uncertainty also peaked in 2020While commodity and financial markets are driven by speculation to a large extent, not all of the volatility in 2020 can be blamed on profit-driven speculation. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which quantifies newspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty, reached an all-time high of 423.84 in May this year. This suggests that the uncertainty in markets and policy-making circles perhaps fed into each other. While it has come down significantly since then, the latest available value for October, 2020 was still higher than what it was in the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-a-year-of-great-volatility-in-commodity-and-financial-markets/story-ZYKrcwAQlLX8shKWW3YsRM.html
28-12-2020||India||Green activists must work on reducing Carbon footprint||In the last five years, Indian middle-class environmentalism has been amplified significantly. You’ll see this trend on social media and in many mainstream news reports. The question I ask is this : how do these campaigns shift the needle to reduce climate change and leverage social justice?Research by Jemyung Lee and others, and the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, Japan, published, in the Journal for Environmental Change suggests middle class environmentalism will serve the planet best by reducing its own carbon footprint. The paper examines 203,313 households in 623 districts of India. Consider this finding : “Almost a tenfold difference is observed between the highest carbon footprint district, Gurgaon (2.04 ton CO2/capita), and the lowest carbon footprint district, Baudh (0.21 ton CO2/capita)”Today, Gurgaon’s most privileged residents are fighting for protecting the Aravallis and preventing a waste-to-energy plant. Both are important campaigns. Yet, this demographics likely causes untold harm elsewhere to maintain lifestyles. This is likely harming the poor whose access to clean water, open lands for grazing and other resources are often compromised by projects to service the wealthy.Gurgaon is not unique in its over-consumption. “Residents in Mumbai (1.76 ton CO2/ capita), New Delhi (0.98 ton CO2/capita), Bangalore (1.13 ton CO2/ capita), Chennai (1.11 ton CO2/capita), or Kolkata (1.56 ton CO2/capita) have a carbon footprint above the national average (0.56 ton CO2/ capita),” underscores the research.Charity begins at home, they say. Contradictions of middle class green action must be addressed by consuming much less, to scale, quickly.The writer is the founder and director of Chintan Envronmental Research and Action Group||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-activists-must-work-on-reducing-carbon-footprint/story-1QfbexaXqeT4tndGfwfo6H.html
28-12-2020||India||Terror plot to attack temple in J&K’s Poonch foiled; 3 militant associates arrested||The Jammu and Kashmir Police Sunday said it has arrested three Pakistan-linked militant associates and recovered six grenades from them, foiling a terror plot to attack a temple in the border district of Poonch and disturb communal harmony. Poonch Senior Superintendent of Police Ramesh Kumar Angral said the arrested persons were planning to carry out a grenade attack on a temple at the behest of their Pakistani handler to disturb peace and communal amity in the district. The officer told reporters in Poonch that the ploy was revealed after Special Operations Group (SOG) of the local police along with troops of the 49 Rashtriya Rifles detained two brothers -- Mustafa Iqbal Khan and Murtaza Iqbal of Galhuta village -- from their vehicle near Basooni in Mendhar sector at around 8 pm on Saturday.He said their interrogation was conducted at the 49 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion headquarters, Basooni, and it was found that Mustafa had received a call from a Pakistani number and was directed to execute the grenade attack. “On being questioned further, he admitted to have been tasked with throwing a grenade at a temple in Ari village. A video on how to use a grenade was also found in his phone,” the SSP said.The SSP said it came to light that Mustafa was involved in militant activities, and on his confession two of his associates -- Mohammad Yaseen and Rayees Ahmad of Dabbi village of Balakote near the Line of Control (LoC) -- were also apprehended. Another police official said the three were arrested later, while Murtaza Iqbal is still in custody and is being questioned. The SSP added, “Vital clues were obtained during the questioning of the trio and searches were conducted in the house of Mustafa from where six grenades, some balloons with Pakistani marking and a few posters of hitherto unknown J&K Ghaznavi Force were recovered.” He said the arrested persons were in regular contact with their handlers in Pakistan who were instructing them to carry out terror strikes.Terming the arrest of the trio as a “major success” for the security forces, Angral said a terror plot to incite communal violence has been averted with their arrest.“If they had succeeded in their designs, we would have faced a lot of problems because they were intending to harm the brotherhood and communal harmony in the district,” Angral said. Asked about the link between the arrested persons and the December 13 encounter in Dogrian village of Poonch which left two Paksitani terrorists dead, he said it is the follow-up of that very operation. “We are investigating the route which they (the slain terrorists) used (to enter into this side from across the LoC) and the persons whom they had contacted. Whether these persons have any direct link with them is part of the investigation,” he said. Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said that with the arrest of the terrorists, the security forces have unearthed a nexus involving local terrorists which were involved in ferrying war-like stores and narcotics after smuggling them from across the border. “It was an intelligence-based well-coordinated joint operation of the Army and police. The apprehended terrorists are likely from terror outfit Jammu and Kashmir Ghaznavi Force,” he said, adding the search operation is still on. “These terrorists were likely to carry out a blast with the intention to disrupt the communal harmony prevailing in the region. Their connection to Pakistani handlers is also being probed,” he said. Other officials said some posters of Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen terror outfit were also recovered during the operations, threatening to intensify attacks on the security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-plot-to-attack-temple-in-j-k-s-poonch-foiled-3-militant-associates-arrested/story-8HfZ1cYtVpb1tMhf2xNUjM.html
28-12-2020||India||Migrant crisis holds lesson for Covid-19 vaccination, PDS effort||She pedalled across north India with her injured father in tow, making international headlines and becoming the face of the plight of migrant workers struggling with a raging pandemic and a nationwide lockdown. Today, cycle girl Jyoti Kumari and her family are worried again. The money they received from politicians and philanthropists is dwindling, a film deal is stalled, her school education hasn’t resumed, and no one in the family has a permanent job. “I am worried. I want to continue my education, but I am uncertain about the future,” said the 17-year-old, a resident of Sirhulli village in Bihar’s Darbhanga village. On May 8, Kumari jumped on her purple cycle, put her father, e-rickshaw driver Mohan Paswan, on the carrier seat and started pedalling from Gurugram. He couldn’t walk due to a road accident in January and their rations were fast dwindling because of the lockdown. With help from another group of migrant workers, short lifts from truck drivers and food from local people along the way, they reached their village in the impoverished northern fringes of Bihar around 9pm on May 17. A tweet from Ivanka Trump and national media attention brought her accolades, an offer of a biopic and a trial at the cycling federation of India. It also improved their social status in a village where caste hierarchies are invisible but sharp, and the Dalit families live in a backward cluster. “Our family has a new social acceptance, which we did not have earlier,” Kumari said. Earlier, higher-caste people would avoid the family in public spaces. Now, they often invite their guests to the Paswan house and refer to the teenager as the pride of the village. “Those who never bothered to visit us, now come over for tea. There is a big change in their attitude and the manner in which they treat us now,” said her mother Phulo Devi, 40, an anganwadi worker. Kumari is scared of Covid-19, but knows little about the infection except that it is highly contagious; she wears a mask, but almost no one else in the village does. She has heard almost nothing about a vaccine. “I don’t know about it. I am not sure if we will get it,” she said. She rejected the cycling trial and has now joined a coaching institute to clear Class 10 examinations that she failed once before. Her film deal is stuck in contract complications. With her cash rewards and presents – many of which are locked in a steel trunk – her family has paid off debt, financed Paswan’s medical treatment, added a second floor to their house and inscribed her name in big gold fonts on the gate. But with no one in the family of seven working, Paswan fears he may have to go back to Gurugram soon. “With no job in the village, I am facing immense financial hardship …I could not even complete the construction work of our house as funds dried up,” said Paswan, 45.Reverse migration in distress The Paswans are the best-known example of the millions of migrant workers who poured out of India’s cities shortly after the lockdown was announced on March 25. They walked for miles, took buses, hitched rides on trucks, and finally took trains back to their countryside home, their plight spotlighting the perils and precarity of economic migration in India. The tragedy held crucial lessons for the country’s public and policymakers. It showed the uneven pace and geographical spread of economic development, and made even clearer by the routes taken by 3,800 Shramik Special trains, announced for migrant workers from May 1, from cities in the west and south to the eastern and northern districts. Even the return of workers starting in August showed that there still weren’t any real jobs to tie them to their homes in the countryside. The crisis also showed the problems with social security and the public distribution system and how workers didn’t feel at home despite living in the cities for decades. In a moment of great stress and crisis, they chose their traditional networks of family and community over institutional delivery. To resolve this, the government announced a raft of measures, including priority credit, jobs in rural districts and bolstering village infrastructure. But the most important among this, according to author and Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad professor Chinmay Tumbe, is the “one nation-one ration” card programme that promises holders to draw benefits from any fair-price shop in the country regardless of their home state. “This is a big deal and its policy architecture is coming in place. It has to be better communicated, that you can get the benefits anywhere. The portability of social security benefits is a longstanding demand and it needs to be fast-tracked,” he said. The programme is expected to be rolled out in the first quarter of 2021. “We can be more ambitious. It is now about PDS but we should be able to access public health services anywhere in India,” Tumbe said.Jobs vanish The crisis also underlined a dearth of data. Eight months after the first migrants appeared on highways, there is little data on their exact number and estimates vary between 30 and 150 million. The labour ministry has ordered a survey, whose fieldwork is expected to start in February. The economic contraction – 23.9% in the April-June quarter and 7.5% in the July-September quarter -- also meant that many jobs vanished, especially in the informal sector. So the neighbourhood carpet seller or the chatwallah in the corner didn’t come back to the city from their villages. Tumbe believes this is temporary and the economy will rebound. But key to accelerating the recovery process will be a robust vaccination programme targeting migrant workers. “The key is for migrant workers to be vaccinated. Its important to think of them as a target group because they will keep going back and forth, and if anyone is affected, it can spread the virus,” said Tumbe. Three separate vaccine candidates are seeking regulatory approval in India and the government has announced plans to vaccinate at least 300 million high-risk people by July, including about 30 million health care and frontline workers, in the first phase. But Tumbe believes migrant workers should also be considered a target category, and logistics tweaked accordingly – both in the home and destination state of the labourers. “There needs to be a foolproof mechanism. For example, if Bihar says vaccines are free, what do millions of Bihari workers outside the state do? There needs to be a clever way.” With literacy and Covid-19 awareness low among many migrants, building communication channels and boosting trust in the efficacy of vaccines will be key. In the West, prominent politicians and celebrities have taken the shot to dispel myths, and India should follow suit. “There is a role for the government to actively step in and target migrants,” added Tumbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-crisis-holds-lesson-for-covid-19-vaccination-pds-effort/story-njkZfhDvAsQwit524fxqQO.html
28-12-2020||India||How India was governed in 2020||India’s governance paradigm has often functioned in a somewhat paradoxical manner on the ground. On one hand, the State is heavily present in regulating everyday life, but on the other, the State is often absent, leaving citizens to their own devices for survival. The Covid-19 pandemic brought both these features to the forefront in 2020 — marking both the absolute centrality of the State, as well as its staggering absence. And it was in between these two extremes that citizens had to find a way to navigate the most devastating pandemic in a century. First, the presence of the State. If there was any doubt about how government and politics affects your life, 2020 should dispel all doubts. And this is not necessarily a negative feature, for those governments which stepped back from fulfilling their responsibilities at a time of a grave health and economic emergency saw adverse results. The United States is a primary example of this grave irresponsibility. In India, it was the State that decided that the country would be locked down to curb the spread of the pandemic; it decided international and domestic travel would be prohibited; it decided which organisations and units, as “essential services” could continue working and which would shut down; it decided how educational institutions would function and when examinations for millions of students from schools to colleges would be held; it determined when mobility would be allowed and when it would be constrained. But it was not just the manner of how one lived that was dictated by decisions of the political leadership and the bureaucracy. It was the manner in which one coped with the health and economic emergency. The State decided what would be the protocol for testing citizens for Covid-19, who would be prioritised in terms of treatment, what would be the manner of differential treatment, who got admission to hospitals and who had to wait. It ramped up health infrastructure (critics have pointed out this was delayed and India should not have had such a deficit of hospital beds, personal protective equipment, ventilators in the first place) and it is now close to determining which vaccines would get approval and which citizens will access vaccines first. It is the State which decided the nature and sequence of economic relief, providing free ration and cash assistance to those it identified as vulnerable, credit to sectors which it believed needed it most, and framing rules and regulations about the kind of economic activity that would be permitted. And therefore, 2020 was the year when it became clear that the governance structure in India was integral to everyday life in ways that citizens had perhaps never experienced before. Governments in India are extraordinarily powerful — a moment of crisis like the one presented by the pandemic allows them to exercise this power and make choices with long term implications. Within the State, it is the Centre that remains way more powerful than the states, the executive that remains way more powerful than either the legislature or the judiciary, and often, the local bureaucracy that is more powerful than the local elected institutions. In 2020, the State also displayed that its coercive power was firmly intact, based on a degree of democratic consent and voluntary cooperation of citizens — only this mix of coercion, consent and voluntarism could have helped sustain the lockdown for as long it as lasted. But there was another side to India’s governance story of 2020 — the life of citizens was not just marked by the presence, but also the absence, of the State. The abiding memory of India’s pandemic will actually not be the images from the hospitals or testing labs. It will not be the data-point of over 10 million people infected over the year. It will the image of citizens — millions of India’s poorest and most vulnerable citizens — walking hundreds of kilometres, on the highways, with their families, clutching their negligible belongings, surviving on a meal or two for days, to return home. It will be the story of the biggest internal migration the country has witnessed in decades, if not since the Partition. And there was only one reason for it — the fact that for these millions of citizens, it was not the sarkar, the government, but their samaj, the community, back home which inspired hope. The government, to be fair, had a genuine dilemma — enable people to return home and risk the spread of the infection, or seek to confine people to wherever they were at the time of the onset of the lockdown. The State veered towards the latter option, but it did little to assure citizens that it would provide then the security — both emotional and financial — that required them to stay away from home at a moment of great panic. This was then not tenable and citizen pressure meant that 36 days after the lockdown, the government had to open up trains to allow migrants to return home. It would always be a blot on the record of the Indian State that this indecision, poor planning and delayed execution meant a large scale exodus of citizens in distressing circumstances from India’s cities, particularly in the west and south and urban centres such as Delhi, to the hinterland in India’s north and east. While the State was present when it came to providing ration, free gas cylinders, income assistance, additional employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and ensuring the portability of the ration card (after much delay), it was absent when it came to actually putting money where it said it would. As Avani Kapur of the Centre for Policy Research has shown, in many key areas, public expenditure in India dipped in this crucial period. The fiscal stimulus was less a stimulus and more a credit guarantee scheme. The problem of low demand persisted, which in turn, had a multiplier negative effect in disrupting profitability of firms, supply chains, and livelihoods. And the government’s conservative fiscal stance — despite assurances that it would not take a hawkish position on the deficit — continued to keep the economy tied to the ability of the private sector to spend. Those in the private sector who did survive — and even flourish — did so either because the disruption made their sectors even more crucial (think digital services) or because of liquidity infusion in the markets or because of severe wage cuts. The government was able to do little to those who lost out in this process of destruction, which was not all that creative. 2020 brought to the fore both the strength and weakness of India’s governance structures. The State is powerful. The State can achieve what would seem unattainable if it puts political will, coercive instruments, resources and energy into achieving a particular aim. But this is also a State that is often unable to anticipate the hopes and fears of its citizens, plan accordingly, and provide the cushion that it needed to help Indians live through difficult times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-was-governed-in-2020/story-FSuseNyUmMXCHiwXf3RN2N.html
28-12-2020||India||BJP, Congress in war of words as Nadda shares old Rahul Gandhi video||Attacking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for opposing the new agricultural laws , Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Sunday posted an old video on social media that shows the Wayanad MP speaking in favour of weeding out middlemen so that farmers get fair remuneration for their produce. The BJP and the Congress have been at loggerheads over the contentious farm bills that farmers from northern India are demanding be repealed, saying they would reduce the bargaining power of cultivators and leave them at the mercy of corporate entities..The BJP has accused the opposition party of politicizing the issue and criticising measures the Congress itself had proposed when it was n power. In the video posted on microblogging site Twitter, which is from a portion of a speech made by Gandhi in the Lok Sabha in May 2015, the Congress leader is seen supporting the removal of middlemen and allowing farmers to sell directly to buyers. “A few years back, during my trip to Uttar Pradesh, a farmer asked me to explain the magic behind a packet of potato chips costing Rs 10 while they sell potato for Rs 2 per kg. I asked what they thought was the reason for this; the farmer said factories are located very far from us and if we could sell our produce directly there, we will get all the money without middlemen earning any cut,” Gandhi is heard saying in the video and explaining the rationale for setting up a food park. Using the video to alleged double-speak by the Congress leader, Nadda tweeted: “What is this magic happening, Rahulji? What you were earlier advocating, now you are opposing. You have nothing to do with the interest of country or farmers. You want to play politics. But your hypocrisy will not work... the people and the farmers have realised your dual character.” The Congress said the video did not show the speech in its full context. Congress leader Ravneet Singh Bittu told a television channel that Gandhi was talking about states such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, where minimum support prices were not paid to farmers. “…This is what we have been saying that in states such as Bihar, FCI does not buy (farm) produce; this is what we are trying to tell Mr Nadda. FCI gives proper rates for produce in Punjab, in Haryana and some parts of UP,” Bittu said. FCI is short for the Food Corporation of India, the government’s food procurement agency.Thousands of farmers have camped on Delhi’s borders since November 26 to protest against the farm laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-in-war-of-words-as-nadda-shares-old-rahul-gandhi-video/story-CBGf1BMozUf0T3i9h8QYiJ.html
28-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The number of countries that now have Covid-19 cases where the infection is caused by the new variant first spotted in the UK in September has increased. In addition to the UK, and assuming the variant in South Africa is entirely different, the list now includes Japan, France, Spain, Sweden, Canada , Germany, Singapore and Denmark. Once India tightened its screening process for passengers flying in from the UK, it identified a bunch of positive cases — one of whom jumped into a train after testing positive and was finally apprehended in Rajamundhry, Andhra Pradesh — but the genome sequencing of these cases was still underway on Sunday as this article was being written.There is growing evidence that the new variant is more infectious than the older version of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Last week, scientists, including some from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study (under the aegis of the institute’s Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases; the study is yet to be peer reviewed) that showed the new variant to be 56% more infective. But there is still no evidence of it causing more severe Covid-19 cases, or resulting in more deaths.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageTo repeat something I wrote last week, given that most of the coronavirus disease cases in the UK are now being caused by the new variant, and given that there have been around 70 flights a week between India and the UK since May— they were temporality halted last week, and will not resume before the end of the year — it is very likely that the variant is already here.This columnist learns that India may have made the mistake of going slow on sequencing viral genomes over the past four months, with a majority of the whole viral genomes sequenced in the country dating back to earlier in the pandemic’s run. That will now change with India deciding that at least 5% of all positive cases from every state and Union territory will undergo genome sequencing. And much like the UK, India has finally formed a consortium of several Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laboratories and institutions and the National Centre for Disease Control, called Insacog, and put it in charge of the country’s genomic surveillance efforts. A country with over 10 million cases of the coronavirus disease should have sequenced more than the few thousand cases India has, although, as Dispatch 232 pointed out on December 24, India isn’t the only laggard when it comes to this — the US, with close to 20 million cases is also one.Now that India has addressed the question of genome sequencing — it still has to follow up; a previous ICMR guideline, on weekly antibody tests across each of India’s 700-plus districts has been ignored — it should also turn its attention to other questions related to the pandemic’s run in the country.Primary among these is one on India’s unique trajectory of Covid-19 infections. To date, it is among the only countries to have seen a significant number of cases, to not witness a second wave of the pandemic. Interestingly, even large gatherings in India in recent months have not turned into superspreader events of the sort seen in the US and Europe. And October, November, and December have been the coldest in years, even decades, in North and Northwest India (in the northern hemisphere, cases were expected to surge as winter set in, and that was what happened in the US and Europe). Understanding why this hasn’t happened in India is just as important as celebrating the fact that it hasn’t. And it may just provide some insights on managing the pandemic in the months ahead as India embarks on its vaccination drive.It’s been clear for a long time that more science, not less, is needed to address the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-14rri4dSyCKB4eGjmXXeVN.html
28-12-2020||India||PM invokes Sikh gurus, calls for self-sufficiency||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged Indian manufacturers to measure up go global standards as the country focuses increasingly on enhancing self-reliance and boosting domestic production at the end of a pandemic-ravaged year. In his last monthly radio broadcast, Mann Ki Baat, of 2020, Modi said manufacturers should make products that have a “zero defect,” and again reached out to the Sikh community amid the ongoing farmers’ protest against a set of three contentious farm laws.“Vocal for local is reverberating in each and every household,” the prime minister said. “in such a scenario, it is time to ensure that our products meet global standards. Whatever is the global best; we should make it in India and prove it. For that, our entrepreneur friends have to come forward. Startups too have to come forth,” he said. Also Read | ‘Time to ensure our products are world class’: Modi on last ‘Mann ki Baat’ of 2020In an attempt to to give a fillip to indigenous production and help the poor cope in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the government announced a Rs. 20 lakh crore economic package under the AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan (Self-Reliant India initiative). The PM has also urged the nation to go “vocal for local” to reduce dependence on imports. A growing trend of customers demanding India-made toys, for instance, marks a transformation of the traditional mindset, Modi said. “A huge change has begun in the minds of our countrymen…that too within a year. It is not easy to gauge this change. Even economists would not be able to assess it on their parameters,” he said. Geographical Indication, or GI tagging for agricultural products will also aid in the making of a self-reliant India, the PM said, citing the example of saffron from Kashmir. “After obtaining the GI Tag, Kashmiri Saffron was launched in a super market in Dubai. Now its exports will get a boost. This will further strengthen our efforts to build an Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”The PM also referred to the need to preserve India’s culture and heritage and recalled how the sons of the Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, Sahibzade Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, sacrificed their lives to protect the country’s “millennia-old culture, civilization and traditions from the cruel misdemeanours of tyrants and tormentors,” a reference to the Mughal rulers.. “The tyrants wanted sahibzade to renounce their faith, abandon the teachings of the great Guru tradition. But our sahibzade showed amazing courage and determination even at that tender age. During the immurement, as stones began piling up, gradually raising the height of the wall, death staring them in the face. Despite that, they did not budge even a bit. It was on this day itself that Guru Gobind Singh ji’s mother -Mata Gujari attained martyrdom,” he said. He also referred to his visit last week to Gurudwara Rakabganj in New Delhi where he paid tribute to Guru Tegh Bahadur. The visit came in the midst of the ongoing protests by a section of farmers from Punjab and Haryana against three contentious agricultural laws. “During this very month, inspired by Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji, many people sleep on the floor. People reminisce about the supreme sacrifices made by family members of Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji with immense reverence,” he said. Farm unions protesting against the agricultural laws on Saturday agreed to restart negotiations with the government, ending a stalemate in talks to resolve a month-long, politically challenging agitation by tens of thousands of farmers.Farm unions, who have hunkered down at the capital’s borders, on Saturday sent a letter to a senior bureaucrat of the agriculture ministry in which they agreed to hold delegation-level talks with the central government on December 29 at 11am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-invokes-sikh-gurus-calls-for-self-sufficiency/story-PnsfQofP023qd5UWuxIzkK.html
28-12-2020||India||Covid-19: India’s daily cases, deaths hit lowest level in half a year||The rate of daily deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India has dropped to the lowest level in over 200 days, or since early June, while the rate of new infections is at the lowest since early July, shows data analysed by HT.These statistics indicate a slowing of the outbreak in the country, and come at a time when states have scaled up efforts to trace if a new and more transmissible virus variant from the UK has reached Indian shores.In the past week, India has, on average, reported 299 new Covid-19 deaths a day, and 21,785 new infections daily. The last time India’s daily death rate was below this mark was on June 9, or 201 days ago, while the last time the case rate was this low was on July 6, or 173 days ago, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageIndia’s infection rate peaked in the middle of September, with the seven-day average of daily cases touching 93,617. This means that currently the case rate has dropped over 76% from the peak level.This drop in the spread becomes particularly apparent when seen with new cases and deaths reported on Saturday – 18,595 new cases and 284 new deaths were reported. On Sunday, 20,346 new cases were reported in the country, while 276 new fatalities were lodged, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.While the last two days’ figures may be attributed to lower-than-usual testing levels on account of the Christmas holiday and the weekend, the larger trend cannot be explained by a drop in testing. India is conducting more than four times the number of daily tests than it was doing in the first week of July, when cases were this low previously – in the past week, over 986,352 samples were tested for Covid-19 on average in the country, while this was 228,920 tests a day for the week ending July 6. Daily recoveries, meanwhile, have outnumbered new infections over the past month, data shows. The last time daily cases were more than daily recoveries was on November 27. On Sunday, 21,117 patients recovered across the country. The total number of cases in India on Sunday stood at 10,208,712, the death toll at 147,953, while 9,781,856 people have so far recovered, according to the data.Also Read | Covid-19: These states have renewed restrictions ahead of new year celebrations “The exponential rise in recoveries in tandem with lower daily new cases has resulted in consistent decline in the active cases and low mortality… India’s cumulative recoveries are highest in the world. The rising recoveries have also improved the recovery rate to 95.8%,” said the Union health ministry in a statement on Sunday.Meanwhile, states across the country are tracing travellers from the UK who have entered India in the last few weeks to test them for Covid-19 and carry out genome sequencing to determine if anyone has been infected with the new viral strain that is believed to be more infectious.India has imposed a temporary halt on flights from and to the UK from December 23 till December 31 following the detection of the new virus strain.The government has kicked off a massive exercise to track all UK passengers who have arrived in India in the past four weeks. All samples of passengers who arrive in India from the UK that test positive are being re-tested through a spike gene-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test over the past week to look for the new virus variant, according to the Union health ministry. Separate isolation facilities have been created for those who test positive after returning from the UK.While a combined official figure of the number of passengers from the UK who have tested positive was not released as of Sunday night, several states have identified such infections and have reported numbers – 21 people who recently returned from the UK have tested positive in Delhi, 18 infections were detected among UK returnees in Telangana, 16 in Maharashtra, 13 in Tamil Nadu, four in Andhra Pradesh and three in Karnataka, based on data released by the respective state governments.On Saturday, the Union health ministry said that at least 50 samples were undergoing genome sequencing to check for the new variant in several laboratories across the country; none have so far tested positive.“As part of the strategy that has been put in place to detect and contain the mutant variant detected in the UK, five per cent of the positive cases of Covid-19 from all states and UTs will be tested for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS),” the health ministry said on Saturday after a meeting of the National Task Force (NTF) on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-s-daily-cases-deaths-hit-lowest-level-in-half-a-year/story-OF3IB9zjPfuiV5J3ryvleJ.html

The police said Bilal Ahmed Lone had turned approver in the case.A police statement said an investigation had revealed that captain Bhoopendra Singh, Tabish Nazir and Bilal Ahmed Lone had hatched a plot to abduct the three men and stage a fake encounter.“They deliberately and purposefully chose not to follow SOPs {special operating procedures}, they planted illegally acquired weapons and material on their dead bodies after stripping them of their identities and tagged them as hardcore terrorists in possession of war-like stores and deliberately providing false information to colleagues/seniors,” the statement said.The charge sheet was filed after the army on Thursday said that it had completed its summary of evidence against its men.“The summary of evidence is being examined by the authorities in consultation with legal advisers for proceeding further. The Indian Army is committed to ethical conduct of operations,” army spokesman Colonal Rajesh Kalia said.The three Rajouri residents were killed in an encounter on July 18 in Shopian. While the army initially said that the three were “terrorists,”it later admitted that the powers vested under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1990, had been exceeded by its men, who also breached the dos and don’ts of the chief of army staff and approved by the Supreme Court.Three families of Rajouri had identified the slain men from their pictures on social media and alleged that the army had killed them in a fake encounter in Shopian where they had gone to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopian-fake-encounter-army-captain-among-3-named-in-charge-sheet/story-tSEYmSElUg4Pu2lZ4QnmYP.html

He arrived in the state on Sunday to lay the foundation stones for various development projects. On his arrival at Imphal international airport, Shah was received by chief minister N Biren Singh,minister of state in the Union ministry of development of north eastern region Jitendra Singh, speaker Y Khemchand and others who presented him a bouquet and the Lengyan,a traditional stole, each.Recalling various initiatives taken up by the Modi government since it came to power, Shah said: “Inner Line Permit was the biggest gift to the people of Manipur by the Prime Minister Modi as he felt that it would be injustice (to the people of Manipur) as other surrounding states had it.”In his speech, Shah said the development of the northeast was a priority of Modi. Recalling the time when Manipur was known for insurgency, blockades and strikes, he said:”In the last three years, we’ve not seen any Bandh. I would like to congratulate chief minister Biren Singh as he has given the state a new face of progress.”The visiting minister was also welcomed and greeted by artistes performing cultural dances on his way from airport to the Hafta Kangjeibung grounds where he laid foundation stone for seven projects including a medical college and an information technology special economic zone. He also inaugurated the Rs 1,998 crore Thoubal multi-purpose project and Rs 475 crore Bishnupur-Tupul-Thoubal-Kasom Khullen road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-hails-ilp-as-modi-s-biggest-gift-to-manipur/story-vNJePU03rSyorQKroYInIL.html
28-12-2020||India||Govt expedited reforms by Narasimha, says vice-president Naidu||Hyderabad Affirming that the reforms initiated by late former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao were irreversible, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday that the process of economic policy changes had been accelerated by the Narendra Modi government.Rao and then-finance minister Manmohan Singh in the early 1990s initiated the reforms that dismantled the so-called License Raj of approvals and red tape that stifled businesses for much of the first four decades of independence, and opened India up to foreign investment. “The bold economic reforms launched by Rao had accelerated the country’s development on various fronts. It was during his regime that reforms in agriculture sector were introduced and restrictions on transportation of foodgrains were removed,” Naidu said, releasing a book titled Viplava Tapasvi  PV, written in Telugu by senior journalist A Krishna Rao on the different facets of the former Prime Minister. The name of the book translates as Revolutionary Sage PV The reforms process was carried forward by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government later and is now being implemented even more vigorously by the Modi government, Naidu said. “He {Rao} had removed license raj, took up banking reforms, electricity privatization, telecom modernization and took steps for boosting exports and attracting foreign investment. He facilitated the entry of India into the World Trade Organization,” Naidu said. The vice president said Rao had a firm belief that the government should not be in business, but focus on the welfare and development of the nation. “The objective of the economic reforms was to involve private sector in the development process. He liberalised the economy and involved the private sector in key areas,” he pointed out. He noted that when Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991, the country was experiencing a severe economic crisis and political uncertainty. “He surpassed the expectations of many political pundits and effectively steered the country through many challenges during his tenure,” Naidu said. Describing the former Prime Minister as a multi-faceted personality, he said Rao was a great scholar and litterateur who knew multiple languages. “Unfortunately, he did not get due recognition in his own party and also as an administrator,” Naidu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-govt-expedited-reforms-by-narasimha/story-vXgPng715QFwS1DERiEjHM.html
28-12-2020||India||Mann ki Baat: Farmers bang plates to drown out PM’s speech||Farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders against a set of contentious new agricultural laws enacted by the government marked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat monthly radio address on Sunday by clanging utensils -- the way in which the PM had asked people to show their gratitude to medical personnel and other staff at the frontline of the fight against Covid-19 on March 22, the day of the Janata curfew.At the Singhu and Tikri borders, farmers picked up and banged steel plates, used tin cans and canisters and even metal pots used for cooking. “We did not want to hear the prime minister’s Mann ki Baa’. By beating plates, we ensured no one would hear his talk,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dakonda (Punjab) unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. To protest against the government for not repealing the three farm laws, many farmers’ group gathered on Delhi’s borders had earlier announced that they would clang utensils when the PM makes monthly radio address. The farmers last Sunday had given a call for the plates to be beaten during the PM’s radio programme to drown out the speech. The farmers said this may be the first time that they greeted the programme that way, but certainly not the last. “As long as we stay here, we’ll greet his programmes the same way,” said Balwinder Singh, president of the Majha Kisan Sangharsh Committee. Sunday’s protest at the borders was also marked also by loud slogan chanting against the government. “We knew the timeframe from when the prime minister’s speech would be delivered. We didn’t even need to switch on the radio. We kept beating the metal items. We had enough utensils and sufficient wooden logs here to go about the clanging and raise our protest,” said Harbhajan Singh, a farmer from Agwan village in Gurdaspur, who is camping at the Tikri Border. Jagmohan Singh said that while a dialogue with the government is scheduled for Tuesday, the farmers will organise a procession of tractors from Delhi’s borders to places like Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan and Palwal in Haryana.Thousands of farmers have camped on Delhi’s borders since November 26 to protest against the three farm laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-farmers-bang-plates-to-drown-out-pm-s-speech/story-ZOJV21DOVX6XosyqWAhysI.html

Naturally, customs dictate that one should not cut their hair when executing the Sankalpa and that (maybe) the reason for his (long) hair.”Also read: 136th foundation day of Congress - Rahul absent, farmers’ protest in focusStating that the entire temple construction project and development of the place may take about three and a half years, Swami Vishwaprasanna Teertha said that the current estimate of the total cost is around Rs 1,500 crore. “This includes about Rs 500 odd crores for the temple itself and the rest for developing the surrounding area,” he added.The Pejawar Matha is among the Ashta Mathas (eight monasteries) established by Saint Madvachaarya. It is held in high esteem especially by Sangh Parivar leaders.

The farmer groups proposed December 29 as the date for the sixth round of talks. Earlier, five meetings were held between Union ministers and farmer groups which remained inconclusive. The farmer groups also placed four point agenda on Saturday and asked the government to adopt the modalities for the removal of the reforms and incorporate changes in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 so that the interests of the farmers are protected. They further warned that a tractor march will be held from the Singhu border on December 30 if the government does not talk of removing the reforms during the December 29 meeting.Also Read: Agitating farmers from western UP stay put in Noida at nightIt has been over one month, since farmers have been camping at border points in Delhi and protesting against the agriculture reforms passed by the Parliament in September.

28-12-2020||India||12 years, 50 victims: The making of a molester||In one corner of eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand lies the pilgrim hub of Chitrakoot, whose name translates as “the hill of many wonders.” Temples dot the banks of Mandakini river that flows through Chitrakoot, which finds a mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana as the place where Ram, his brother Lakshman and wife Sita lived for much of their 14 years of banishment. . Roads in the town of 70,000 people are narrow and auto-rickshaws, sometimes carrying as many as a dozen passengers, are the principal means of transport. Men and women line the streets, hawking wares spread on tarpaulin sheets. Incomes are low and monkeys are everywhere.In a corner of the town lies SDM colony, formerly an enclave of government officers that grew in the past decade as the district headquarters drew workers from the poorer hinterland. A narrow road just ahead of the bridge over Mandakini leads to the colony, home to roughly 100 lower-middle class families. Walk down a dusty, unpaved lane wide enough for a small car and you reach a pair of imposing black gates with faux gold engraving. They enclose a two-storey house whose first floor is unfinished. Inside, the rooms are separated by a long and dimly lit passage that leads to a courtyard in the back, and a place to house cattle.For the last eight years, the house was occupied by Ram Bhavan Singh, who worked as a junior engineer in the UP irrigation department and rented the place from a local doctor.Singh, 40, lived with his wife Durgawati and was known to the neighbours as a quiet man who stuck to his schedule: Leaving for office at 8am in his Bolero and coming back at 2pm for lunch. “His schedule was like clockwork,” said a neighbour on condition of anonymity.They only remember one thing vividly: Groups of poor children playing in front of his house, and him inviting them in. “I heard he gave them mobiles to play games and make TikTok videos,” said a second neighbour.On November 16, it became clear why. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Singh for allegedly sexually abusing at least 50 children, a majority of them boys between five and 16, and filming and selling child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the dark web to racketeers across the globe. It is by far the biggest child abuse scandal to hit UP and one of the largest organised child abuse rackets ever busted in India.“Nithari was a case of necrophilia or someone attracted to corpses; here we were onto someone preying on male children, and frankly no one thought of the scale it was on,” said a senior CBI official, referring to the 2006 serial murders in Noida. In conversation with 30-odd friends, teachers, local government, child protection and police officials, HT traced his decades-long journey of impunity, the many times he came close to getting caught and the toxic cocktail of new-age technology and old-school social power he wielded.THE BEGINNINGSingh was born in 1980 in Naraini, a small town famous for its rock sculptures. His father, Chunna Lal, was a mason of high repute and an expert in fashioning temple columns. He has two older brothers, Ram Kishore and Raja Bhaiyya, who joined his father’s profession. Singh was encouraged to study. “He never failed in any subject and kept clearing classes,” said the family doctor who didn’t want to be named. After finishing high school in 1998, Singh moved to Attara, a larger town, for college studies. After graduating, he started tutoring school students for extra cash while preparing for government exams. He also enrolled himself in a civil engineering course at a polytechnic in Banda, a much larger town an hour’s bus ride away.The first complaint against Singh came in 2008 from a student he was tutoring. The boy told his parents that Singh sexually abused him. Furious, the parents met Singh’s father. “Singh’s father managed to convince the family not to press charges, and he went on an overdrive to find a suitable match for his son,” said a close family friend of Singh’s, requesting anonymity. CBI confirmed the incident and said it was looking to convince the victim to join the investigation.In 2009, Singh married Durgawati and was appointed in the irrigation department. Singh’s wife remained at home, and he moved into a two-room tenement for Rs 6,000 close to his office. In 2010, there was a second complaint. “I got a complaint from a couple that their son was harassed by him. I asked him to leave and told them to inform the police; they never did,” said Kakkoo Singh, his then landlord.The next year, local officials said, there was another complaint. That, too, was not legally pursued, but pressure from neighbours forced Singh to move house.After this, relations between him and his father were strained. “He forced Singh to keep his wife with him in Chitrakoot,” said the family doctor cited above. Lal died in 2014, snapping Singh’s ties with the family. His brothers said he never visited the home after that and communication was minimal. “We led our separate lives,” said Ram Kishore.In the winter of 2012, Singh and his wife moved to their home in SDM Colony. Throughout his stint, Singh never asked for the government accommodation he was entitled to, said Santosh Kumar, an official at the irrigation department. The office of the executive engineer of Chitrakoot division, Arvind Kumar, confirmed this.THE HIDDEN WEBShortly after moving into the SDM Colony house, Singh began dabbling in the dark web, helped by some people the CBI is yet to charge. By most accounts, the dark web represents a large subset of the internet just like anything else we are familiar with: forums, blogs, shops. But there is one crucial difference: everything is anonymised so no one can be tracked, and therefore, nothing is indexed on search engines we are familiar with. Accessible through special browsers such as Tor, the dark web today is used by people who want to dodge surveillance. “The primary value of dark web is its anonymity. Typically you are given a link to a forum or group for your interest and you find more people there to take your business forward,” said Yash Kadakia, founder of ShadowMap, a digital risk management company that tracks the dark web.For more sensitive and illegal transactions, one needs three things: a personal introduction, a financial commitment and a strategy to win the trust of other criminals or consumers.“You have to do a lot of social engineering and win their trust by buying or selling something. This process often takes weeks and months,” said Ritesh Bhatia, a Mumbai-based cyber crime investigator.Investigators assume someone introduced Singh to the dark web, and he used his cache of CSAM to gain followers and entry into a more exclusive crime forum. “In many cases, we have seen these criminal activities starting on Facebook, telegram groups where CSAM is exchanged, and then someone suggesting a dark web forum,” said Ritesh Bhatia, a Mumbai-based cyber crime investigator.What further helped Singh, investigators think, was the lowered barrier to access the dark web. “In India, dark web has become incredibly easy to access. Adding someone on Telegram or any other chat app is about as easy as how to get on the dark web today. It’s as easy as installing any app on your phone,” explained Kadakia. LURING THE CHILDRENSingh developed a two-pronged modus operandi.The first was to target low-income families, luring children with gadgets and electronics, and paying off or pressurising their parents not to file a police complaint. A member of the government-appointed Child Welfare Committee (CWC) who spoke to the victims and their parents on behalf of CBI investigators said Singh first began preying on the children of a friend. He then moved on to young boys who played outside his house. “Those children visiting his house told that he had an expensive gaming console at his house. He would encourage the children from his locality to play games on this console, which he had in his room with a double bed,” said the CWC member, requesting anonymity. “He would often pay the children’s school fee and gave the parents money to keep a lid on his activities.”Singh made sure to rent houses near low-income neighbourhoods, said the investigating officer quoted above.HT spoke to two of Singh’s alleged victims, aged six and eight – one loves to play PUB-G and the other is a pro at making TikTok videos. They said they visited the house almost daily, and Singh’s wife showered kindness on them. “We always get the mobile he used to keep in the house for us; everyone of us played at least an hour a day,” said the older child.Their aunt, who takes care of them after their father died in a freak accident in 2017, said Singh would often visit their shack and watch the children bathing. Durgawati was with Singh whenever the children were in the house, she said.The second step was to leverage his position as a government official in a small town where a government car, and a permanent job are signs of power.Singh chose two sites he was overseeing as project manager to prey on the children of poor labourers engaged in construction work. At one of these spots, CBI identified two boys, 8 and 12, who live with their parents in a makeshift hut.The older brother said he recognised Singh as the one who brought a laptop with him and taught them to play video games and gave them a mobile phone, before inviting them to his house. He insisted they call him sahib, the boy added. Both irrigation projects assigned to Singh are running years behind schedule.ZEROING INIn September, a small, five-member unit of CBI was alerted about some CSAM of Indian origin floating on the dark web. An anonymous source directed the 13-month-old Online Child Sex Abuse Exploitation, Prevention and Investigation (OCSAE) to the videos – many of which were paywalled.In a month, the team found embedded geo-location on the videos and photos that helped them track the CSAM to Chitrakoot. Some other transactions listed a phone number registered to Singh and an address in Banda district. In a few of the videos, Singh’s face was partially visible.In the second week of October, the team reached Chitrakoot. They used cell phone numbers and IP addresses to triangulate Singh’s location, and identified him through the partial grabs from videos. “We didn’t know we were on the cusp of busting such an enormous case; we thought it was limited to 2-3 children,” said a second CBI official.With the help of local officials, CBI began reaching out to local children and identifying which of them appeared in the videos. Midnight knocks on the doors of many of Singh’s colleagues, and multiple interviews of his driver Abhay helped them gain more evidence. By then, the team had 100 videos, 679 pictures and testimonies of 25 alleged victims.On November 16, Singh was arrested under the Indian Penal Code, Information Technology Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Investigators found Rs 8.27 lakh in cash, 10 mobile phones, two laptops, six pen drives, six memory cards, one digital video recorder, a spy cam and sex toys. “The real scale emerged only when we reached out to the children,” said a third CBI official.CBI found 10 empty boxes of mobile phones in the house and is certain these were used to lure children. Singh drew a salary of around Rs 60,000 and also leased his car to the department for another Rs 22,000 – most of this income appears to have been used to buy gadgets and phones, said investigators.Legal experts say the proceedings in the case can set a precedent for child abuse cases in a country where a crime against a child is committed every four minutes, according to 2019 statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau. Singh also mirrors a trend seen among 90% of child sexual abuse perpetrators, according to the NCRB report – they are known to their victims.“We know that there is a problem in POCSO cases, that parents don’t like to reveal such complaints from children, for fear of a bad name. There is little reporting,” said Karnika Seth, a Supreme Court advocate and expert on cybersecurity and children.She pointed out that social media and rising internet penetration, along with poor digital literacy, had made it more easy for young children to be exploited. “This is problem especially in rural areas where communication and knowledge may be much less,” she added, pitching for training of the police and judiciary, secure and confidential dealing with children and counselling to mitigate harm.What investigators are still unclear on is the role of Durgawati – children confirmed she was present in the house when they visited but also describe her as a warm person. A local official said it was unlikely that over seven years, she wouldn’t have known what was going on. She has refused to leave the house in SDM Colony, but hasn’t stepped out since November. “I will speak about the case at the time and place of choosing,” she said. Singh’s lawyer Anurag Singh Patel said CBI’S charges were trumped up. “I ask what is his crime, where are the children he abused, where are their statements indicting him?” he said. “We will fight tooth and nail.”But CBI is confident. “CBI is searching his victims and the list is getting longer each day. They will all come to the court if need be,” said a member of the agency’s legal team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-years-50-victims-the-making-of-a-molester/story-wEsrnvcJxX67MywtS0dW0L.html
28-12-2020||India||One limb is good enough to shoot for the stars: Pooja Agarwal||It was New Year’s Eve the next day. The newly married woman, totally in love with her bright lipsticks and waist long hair had gone to New Delhi railway station to see off her husband. As she was walking on the platform, a crowd she had never harmed suddenly pushed her towards the railway track. Within seconds, Pooja Agarwal was crushed by a roaring train. Three of her limbs had to be amputated to save her life.It has been eight years to the accident. Pooja now sports a short flip haircut. On a bright winter morning, she meets us near Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, flashing a brilliant smile. She tells us her day started at 4:30 am with yoga and exercise, and she is feeling quite energetic. In a few hours, she will leave for Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range in Tughlakabad to begin her shooting practice.Pooja Agarwal, 35, is a para shooter who currently ranks 14th in the world and 11th in Asia. “I want to win a medal for India at the Paralympics someday,” says Pooja, who won her first International medal at the World Shooting Para Sport World Cup in Al Ain, UAE in 2017, a silver for the 10m air pistol event. When the pandemic struck, Pooja had to stop training for a few months. Employed as a probationary officer in a bank, she was working from home. That’s when she came up with the idea of launching a Youtube channel that could help specialty-abled people do tasks that they thought were impossible. “I had learnt using my right hand for everything. So I decide to demonstrate through videos how someone who has just one hand can easily do everything from chopping vegetables to yoga,” says Pooja, as we settle down for a long chat. Pooja was 27 when the tragedy struck. After finishing Masters in Information Technology, Pooja was working as a lecturer in a college in Meerut. In December 2012, she had come to Delhi where her husband worked. She had been married for six months. After the train accident, Pooja was admitted in ISIC (Indian Spinal Injuries Centre). After the saving triple amputation, Puja came to her in-laws’ home. Her mother moved in with her to help her with daily chores. Soon, Pooja sensed a drastic change in the behaviour of her in-laws and husband. They became so indifferent towards her that she could no longer bear to live with them. Within months, her marriage fell apart. She separated from her husband and filed for divorce.Pooja moved into a rented accommodation in the city along with her mother. Confined in her room, she found it excruciating to carry out day to day activities. Pooja had to cut her waist long hair as it was becoming tough to manage. “I had learnt to tie perfect plaits as a kid…I loved long hair, so my mom had told me to learn making plaits to be independent. Now, once again, I had to be independent, so I had to cut my hair short,” she says with a tinge of pain.But instead of accepting that destiny had mercilessly written her off, she fought back. “The teacher in me gradually motivated me to move forward in life with whatever I was left with. I realised that I still had my right hand with me, so everything was only going to be right,” she says.Pooja started preparing for competitive exams and struggled to fit into her prosthetic limbs. Soon, she managed to walk without bleeding. She prepared for IBPS and cleared the exam. Pooja got a job in Allahabad bank as a Probationary Officer. “I badly needed a routine, a job and financial independence to get a grip on life,” she says. An athlete friend encouraged Pooja to get into sports. “I got to know that I could take part in para sports. I began with table tennis but soon lost interest. And then I took up shooting in 2016 and there was no looking back. I had found just the sport that kept me totally hooked,” she says. She borrowed shooting equipments and a shooting wheel chair from others to fulfil her dreams and made a place for herself in the sport. In the pandemic, her YouTube channel - Pooja Agarrwal PCreations, took shape. One of her school friends who lives in the US encouraged Pooja to shoot videos to help out so many others who could be facing challenges due to amputation. “I had no idea how to go about it. My mom who had never ever taken a photo before learnt how to record videos using the phone. Sometimes, I shot the videos myself and I also learnt how to edit them,” she says. Pooja’s videos show how the specially-abled can do most of their day-to-day tasks independently. How to exercise at home, fold clothes, chop onions and tomatoes, peel almonds, sew with one hand – there’s a lot that Pooja teaches people through her videos to make their lives easier. “One subscriber recently asked me to demonstrate how to shift from the wheelchair to the bed with ease. It feels great to be able to help out others,” she says.Every pain leaves you with a lesson that helps bring out the best in you, believes Pooja. “It’s for you to turn the mess into success. One you decide you won’t sink into gloom despite how unfair life has been to you, you see that so many doors open up for you. You just have to make a beginning,” she says. Pooja’s inspiring journey vividly exemplifies this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-limb-is-good-enough-to-shoot-for-the-stars-pooja-aggarwal/story-Vbz4BXKrrZDERnK8q8QEQP.html
28-12-2020||India||Addressing pre-Covid issues to be crucial for India’s recovery||The Covid-19 pandemic has infected at least 6 million people and killed over 395,000 across the world. It has also created a huge economic disruption. An April 2020 estimate by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said global gross domestic product (GDP) would contract by 3% in 2020. Even in 2009, the year after the global financial crisis, world GDP contracted by only 1.7%. The economic pain of the pandemic will be felt the world over. But it will play out differently. How it does will depend on three factors. First, the economic situation before the pandemic hit. Second, how the pandemic interacts with existing economic and social fault lines. And third, the policy response to the pandemic.What will be the pandemic’s impact on India? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the Indian economy to contract in the current fiscal year. But given the recent release of GDP numbers for the quarter ending March 2020, a big-picture analysis may be needed. In a three-part data journalism series, of which this is the first, HT attempts to do exactly that. The first part will look at the economic situation before the pandemic and dwell on its nature and causes. The second will look at the immediate effects of the crisis and their macroeconomic consequences. The third part will argue that the existing policy response may not be enough. ALSO WATCH | Modi govt’s mega MSME boost: First step to self-reliant India?Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndia’s GDP growth has been declining since 2017-18. Such a prolonged slowdown is unprecedented in India . Why did this happen? Will this affect our ability to deal with the economic disruption caused by the pandemic? Any modern economy is a giant market. Everybody is a buyer or a seller. Workers sell their labour, businesses their products and services. Essential and non-essential spending decisions feed into each other. And everything is linked.Consider an economy made up of shirt sellers and hoteliers. If all shirt sellers do not take a vacation, the hotel industry will face a severe squeeze. If the hotel business enters bad times, its workers will not buy shirts. This will hurt the shirt sellers. If the crisis in the shirt and hotel industry is prolonged, it will lead to a fall in demand for sewing machines (used in making shirts) and bed linen (used in hotels). If left unaddressed, this will unleash a vicious cycle of sorts. This is what makes the role of the government important. So what should be done to prevent a cascading impact of shirt sellers’ decision to not take vacations? The answer depends on the nature of the problem confronting the shirt industry. Economists classify all such problems into two categories: demand side versus supply side, and structural versus cyclical.In the demand-supply binary, if all people who were buying shirts suffered a pay cut, or worse, lost their jobs, they would buy fewer or no shirts at all. This is a demand-side problem. Any resolution has to be focused on boosting the incomes of those who buy shirts.But if the shirt factory is using old machines and does not have enough money to buy modern ones; it cannot supply enough shirts to the shirt seller. This is a supply- side problem. What is needed in this case is cheap credit to make the modern machine affordable. It is important to get the intervention right. A problem of fewer shirts being produced cannot be solved by a government payout to shirt buyers. This will only lead to more competitive bidding for shirts. Shirt prices will go up further. Similarly, availability of cheap credit will not help if shirt buyers do not have money to buy shirts. The shirt factory will either not take credit, or accumulate more debt, as revenue remains stagnant. Then there is the structural vs cyclical aspect. A shirt seller might suffer a slowdown in sales during winters. The demand will revive once summer starts. The shirt seller might need some short-term credit during winters. However, if climate change were to lead to a prolonged winter, then annual shirt sales may suffer a permanent hit. Waiting for summer will not fix the problem. A short-term loan will only make matters worse.Why did India’s economy start slowing? At an event in December last year, chief economic advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian claimed that “the current (economic) slowdown is a lot more on the cyclical side”. We now have GDP data up to 2019-20. The Indian economy has been losing growth momentum for three consecutive years beginning 2017-18. GDP growth was 8.3% in 2016-17. It fell to 7% in 2017-18, 6.1% in 2018-19 and 4.2% in 2019-20. The economy has never lost growth momentum for three consecutive years since 1991-92. And it has happened only twice before. Between 1989-90 and 1991-92, and before that from 1970-71 to 1972-73. The year 1990-91 saw massive disruptions due to the first Gulf War. And 1971 was the year of the Bangladesh war. These are extraordinary shocks. To be sure, the Covid-19 pandemic did disrupt economic activity towards the end of the last quarter of 2019-20. However, even earlier estimates had projected slower growth for the year than 2018-19. That India’s growth momentum slowed for three years without an external shock, raises doubts on the validity of claims of a cyclical slowdown. (See Chart 1)  The government’s policy response until 2019-20 was largely a supply-side response. In September 2019, the government slashed corporate tax rates. This was expected to promote investment and boost the economy. RBI has mostly either reduced interest rates or kept them stable. This was expected to reduce the cost of capital and promote investment. The investment component of the GDP, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), has been contracting for three consecutive quarters now. A comparison of capacity utilisation levels with GFCF shows why. Capacity utilisation levels in industry have been significantly lower since the last decade. They touched an all-time low in December 2019, the latest period for which data is available. Investment demand follows capacity utilisation levels. Firms will only invest if they can utilise the existing capacity. The trend in the last few years shows that businesses did try to invest even when capacity utilisation levels were low. Such investments have proved to be unwise. Demand did not grow and capacity utilization levels plummeted further. The fact that core (non-food, non-fuel) inflation has been slowing during this period, suggests that even with falling capacity utilisation, there is no scarcity of goods in the market. (See Chart 2) That misplaced optimism in investing might have extracted a cost from companies. In a paper published in March in the Economic and Political Weekly, Zico Dasgupta from Azim Premji University has highlighted the deteriorating financial health of Indian companies. Dasgupta used the Centre for Monitoring Economy’s Prowess database to calculate interest coverage ratio (ICR) for India’s non-financial firms. ICR is the ratio of a company’s profits and interest payments. If profits are not enough to even cover interest payments, ICR falls below one. In December 2019, this ratio was less than one for almost a fourth of India’s listed non-financial firms. The corresponding proportion, till March 2013, was less than 10%. The paper argues that the current policy regime has been trying to relax the solvency condition of firms through various measures such as corporate tax cuts and interest rate reductions.Meanwhile, consumer sentiment seems to be weakening, dragging down demand. RBI’s consumer confidence surveys show that current perceptions on income and non-essential spending have collapsed in the recent period. (See Chart 3) All this suggests that the Indian economy was likely facing a demand-driven, perhaps even structural slowdown before the pandemic. The policy response most likely misjudged it for a cyclical supply-side problem. To be sure, RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee pointed to weak demand as a problem in its resolutions last year. Unfortunately, the only policy tool available to the committee, interest rate cuts, can do little to boost demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/addressing-pre-covid-issues-to-be-crucial-for-india-s-recovery/story-KA18SAGU9Uvt0X4pCqAi6H.html
28-12-2020||Editorials||Modi’s clear message | HT Editorial||Being “vocal for local” co-exists very uncomfortably with “zero effect, zero defect.” In every public speech these days, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has spoken of the need for economic self-reliance, embodied in the slogan Atmanirbhar Bharat. His latest radio address was no different. He praised individuals who had purged foreign-made items from lists of daily-use products. This was blended with his larger vision of national revival, speaking of “things manufactured abroad” having “shackled” Indians. But the PM went on to demand “a clear message for our manufacturers that they should not compromise on the quality of the products.” Made in India products, he insisted, must “meet global standards.” It may not be obvious, but these two imperatives do no align with each other. If Indian consumers were to move en masse to only products made in their country, they would give domestic manufacturers a captive market. The impetus for an Indian factory-owner to then invest in improving his products would largely evaporate. Modi has remarkable powers of persuasion, but even he cannot change basic economic behaviour. The most important driver of innovation for a corporation is competition. Without the sense that a product is losing out to rivals, there is no incentive for a firm to invest in research or create a managerial environment conducive to change. Domestic competition is not enough. Cartelisation is almost inevitable in such situations, especially when regulators are weak. Price tags become inflated and global standards are sacrificed. Reviving the manufacturing sector would help create the jobs that would, in turn, feed a post-pandemic domestic recovery. Additionally, there is a strategic need to reduce China’s economic footprint in the country – the country is the single largest source of imported goods into India. There is a strong case for putting up barriers to Chinese products given deteriorating relations and their restrictions on Indian imports. The real danger is that the idea that pushing Indian products will help long-term growth will come to permeate policy-making. This could not be further from the truth. Any reduction in competition in a market economy can be guaranteed to ensure economic mediocrity. What Indian firms need is help to become globally competitive, not captive nationalistic consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/modi-s-clear-message-ht-editorial/story-1WtPgtO0QhbEOrpYxstPgK.html
28-12-2020||Editorials||Brexit: India could gain as of now||The longest political divorce in recent history is near completion, with the United Kingdom (UK) and European Union (EU) agreeing to a minimalist Brexit treaty. The treaty still needs acceptance by a slew of governments across Europe. But since the alternative is divorce without mitigation at year-end, green signals are inevitable. Indian industrial firms will be relieved that the Brexit agreement will allow them to continue to treat the UK as their investment gateway to Europe. London’s plans for becoming the financial gateway for the large capital flows coming into India are less certain. New Delhi was never enthusiastic about Brexit, seeing it as a weakening of western unity and a geopolitical gain for a rising China. More recently, however, it has seen opportunity in Britain’s desire to orient itself away from Europe and take a hard stand against China. The real test for India will be whether it can leverage the UK’s desire for some quick trade agreement successes and put together a 21st century economic partnership deal that stresses services, aligns data standards, and incorporates immigration. Brexit has given India an opportunity to show that it is not protectionist as much as forward-looking when it comes to trade, technology and investment. The question is whether the Modi government has a strategic enough sense of trade policy to grasp this chance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/brexit-india-could-gain-as-of-now/story-7NOMKrij5BFDo1I5rCwZeL.html
28-12-2020||Editorials||Farm talks: No end in sight yet||The major farm unions protesting a set of agricultural reforms have agreed to restart negotiations with the government. This comes as a relief, but not a breakthrough. Of the four demands of farmers, two are easier to accede to, while the other two are tricky and these are the ones that will determine the fate of these talks. Let’s look at the easier ones first. The farmers want changes to be made in the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 to protect their interests. The bill proposes to provide cash instead of subsidised power for agricultural use. The farmers say the switch from subsidy to cash transfer could increase power costs for them. They also want amendments in an ordinance so as to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of air pollution. Both these demands are likely to be met whenever they come up on the table. The government has, in no uncertain terms, said it will make appropriate changes to laws to ensure both issues are addressed. It’s the other two demands — the farmers want these discussed first — that pose the real test. The farmers are adamant that when they meet the government’s negotiators again, the talks must be geared towards a complete repeal of three agricul-tural laws that farmers say will hurt their livelihoods. The laws essentially change the way the country’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government market places, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Farmers say these laws will allow big corporations to dictate prices and erode their bargaining power. The Modi government is unlikely to scrap the laws altogether, but has advanced a clutch of amendments. These include some mechanism of regulating proposed free markets so that farmers feel more secure as they face big buyers and a written assurance on minimum support prices (MSPs). The unions have spelt out why the assurance on MSPs was not enough. Indian farmers receive lower prices for most produce than global averages. Farm unions want the government to adopt a comprehensive measure of cultivation costs that includes the imputed cost of capital and the rent on the land, called “C2” in economic parlance. Since both these demands are unlikely to be met, according to most economists, the government should keep a less market-distorting model of compensating farmers ready. For instance, some suggest India should move towards direct income support to farmers. A lucrative income support programme that can be funded by consolidating all subsidies into cash may do the trick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farm-talks-no-end-in-sight-yet/story-ZokoEfONAokvm7gdufOmXK.html
