29-12-2020||News||For the BJP, it has been a productive year||For historians in the future, 2020 will always be marked as the year of the Great Pandemic, a year when the whole world took refuge behind masks and economies took a spectacular beating. Since last March, normal life as we have known it either came to a halt or was spectacularly redefined. In time to come, the story of the recent past will be divided by pre-Covid and post-Covid. Yet, an aggregate view that highlights change and transformation often obfuscates the deep continuities between two otherwise distinct chapters. This came to the fore during the elections to the Bihar assembly two months ago. The fear that traditional campaign methods would become irrelevant in the face of a fear of the pandemic and that turnout of voters would see a sharp decline turned out to be unfounded. All the preparations for a virtual campaign conducted through smart phones and tablets came to nought as campaigners and voters indicated their clear preference for politics as usual, including mass rallies where social distancing was illusory. Covid should have been the Great Fear, but the political world chose to confront it fearlessly. The year of the pandemic began with a flurry of excitement over the repeal of Article 370 and the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that fast-tracked Indian citizenship for those who fled religious persecution from neighbouring countries. It has ended with well-off farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh trying to overturn a range of agricultural reforms. Both movements witnessed a significant mobilisation of sectional interests and both were romanticised by the Opposition parties that had emerged from the 2019 general election battered and bruised. Naturally their target was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) whose lotus was in full bloom after outright victories in successive general elections. How the BJP has conducted itself in the past year, even as it faced sustained challenges from disparate movements is worth a serious look. The most important aspect is the orientation of the BJP as a party in government at the Centre. The period after 2014 is not the first occasion the BJP has been in power with a charismatic leader at the helm. It was in power between 1998 and 2004, although never with an outright parliamentary majority. On both occasions, the Prime Minister of the day had maintained aloofness from day-to-day politics. Atal Bihari Vajpayee liked to project himself as the great consensus builder, balancing between different pulls and pressures and on a number of occasions taking positions that offended the BJP rank-and-file and the leadership of the RSS. Although Vajpayee was routinely wheeled out during elections, his enduring popularity in the Indian Establishment lay in the belief that he was ‘the right man in the wrong party.’ An unintended consequence of Vajpayee’s projection as a non-partisan leader was the party’s loss of focus. With no real experience of the art of combining its responsibility in government with its role as a political party, the BJP emulated the Congress experience of subordinating the party to the government. Consequently, party units were often reduced to the role of patronage facilitators, resulting in the creation of a large body of disappointed BJP workers. The sangh parivar in turn was miffed that the Vajpayee government left many of its core concerns unaddressed. These were factors behind the listlessness of BJP units during the 2004 election campaign and the consequent defeat. It is to the credit of Narendra Modi that he imbibed the lessons of the 1998-2004 experience and sought to inject the party with a new sense of purpose even while wielding power at the Centre. First, there was a conscious attempt to draw in the party units in the initiatives of the Modi government. During the lockdown and beyond, the entire party was mobilised to disburse relief to the vulnerable sections and even facilitate the evacuation of migrant workers to their home states. This may explain why, despite the magnitude of economic dislocation in the wake of the lockdown and after, the BJP wasn’t a victim of any backlash during the Bihar elections. Secondly, in addressing some of the party’s core concerns such as the repeal of Article 370 and the enactment of CAA, the Modi government was able to establish a very strong emotional connect with the larger saffron parivar. This has ensured that predictable disappointments over patronage have not translated into bitterness against the Centre. Unlike the Vajpayee government which—despite the personal respect the Prime Minister commanded—was viewed with a tinge of detachment, the BJP units all over India view the Modi government as their very own. This profound sense of ownership has contributed to energetic political activity, even during non-election seasons. It is highly significant that Modi’s innings hasn’t recorded any serious spat between the RSS and the government. This was a recurrent feature of Vajpayee’s term.Finally, the tenure of Amit Shah as party president witnessed the transformation of the BJP into a vast election machine. Shah ensured that the BJP treated every election, including local body and panchayat polls, as equally important. More important, equal importance was attached to elections being fought in areas which were outside the BJP’s traditional areas of influence. It is this sustained focus on weak areas that has seen the BJP extending its footprint to West Bengal, the North-east, Telangana and Kerala. To cap it all, the BJP under Shah and now JP Nadda has made it quite apparent that it is willing to enlarge its own political space by accommodating defectors from other parties. This doesn’t mean the BJP has shed all ideological pretensions. It merely indicates that its quest to consolidate its status as the new dominant party is unending. For the BJP, 2020 was just another year in its long march.

29-12-2020||News||2020: When people spoke truth to power||The year 2020 has ended and Covid-19 is getting the better of us. We have yet to see whether we can reduce the impact of its onslaught and save lives in 2021. The virus is unrelenting and mutates to scare us with yet further onslaughts. It has changed the way we live and interact with each other. The elderly are most vulnerable and quarantined children are forced to grow up in isolation away from school. While the rich and the prosperous carry on their everyday lives, albeit somewhat constrained, the less privileged and the poor do not have this luxury. Quarantine for them has had disastrous consequences.We saw in 2020, the spectacle which shook the conscience of the nation, migrant labourers stoically making their way home. The government stood by watching, oblivious of the consequences and at one time, informed the Supreme Court that there was no one on the streets walking home; that hapless migrants were being taken care of in every way. The reality was different. Our citizens’ outreach, along with that of NGOs, should have shamed the government’s unpreparedness and inept handling of the sudden lockdown and its fallout. Only an insensitive government could have boasted of distribution of free ration for survival of migrants on their long journey home. The painful images of migrants ready to endure extreme adversity will stay with us for long, their stories untold for years to come.The year also saw the president of the most vibrant democracy in the world, Donald Trump, doing his utmost to denigrate the fundamentals of democracy, in a desperate bid to stick to power after losing to president-elect Joe Biden. What goes to his credit was his commitment to change the terms of trade with China. Trump recognised that the global balance of power had shifted and that America needed to protect its national interest by embracing the slogan — “America First”, modifying or rejecting bilateral treaties that, in his perception, hurt America. But in the process, American democracy was diminished. It brought about a Right-wing culture with Trump blaming “them” for the country’s inability to ensure that the fruits of the liberal economic order reach ordinary Americans. Immigrants, who empowered the United States (US) were suddenly portrayed as ones who took away jobs. Though consumers enjoyed the privilege of a variety of choices in accessing goods and services, it also resulted in the US losing its manufacturing capacity to China. Minorities felt uncomfortable and black Americans were targeted. Countries around the world became increasingly Right-wing and the level of tolerance within societies diminished. Those not part of the domestic cultural milieu were viewed with suspicion.Nearer home, 2020 witnessed the juggernaut of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strangulating institutions. We saw the alacrity with which their well-oiled electoral machinery, by means fair or foul, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, decimating the opposition state after state. We saw elected governments fall by means that were clearly foul, with those targeted resigned to the inevitability of such an outcome. We saw governors attempting to destabilise elected governments. Eyebrows were raised when courts prioritised certain cases and pushed under the carpet issues which needed urgent attention. On many occasions, the cause of liberty did not find a door to knock at. The police functioned in tandem with their political bosses ensuring that some investigations resulted in the victims being targeted as accused and the accused kept away from the radar of investigating agencies. We are witnessing the National Investigation Agency, the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the income tax department going after those who chose to raise their voice. We saw an 83-year-old, Stan Swamy, perceived as a threat to the State, being charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and denied essentials for survival by relying on colonial era jail manual prescriptions. We saw justifiable alacrity in dealing with the cause of liberty for some and a lackadaisical and insouciant shrug when dealing with the liberty of others.We also saw the government issuing ordinances in matters of great public importance. The arrogance with which the government discarded the opposition’s demand for a more thorough scrutiny of significant legislations surprises none. Indeed, it is taken to be part of the privilege of a party that dominates the Lok Sabha and has the ability to manipulate parties in the Rajya Sabha. In a sense, the people of India have taken this to be the new normal.The farmers’ agitation that has erupted, raises complex issues that need to be debated and addressed. Protesting students occupying part of a public road were arrested and prosecuted under UAPA. However, in the case of agitating farmers, the government realises that they are not easy targets. This agitation will impact 2021. Its political ramifications will be felt in the years to come. The government has shown no signs of relenting and farmers too are not backing off. The prime minister has stated that we can’t claim that god has made us perfect. That is a rare confession. We know that those who say so, play god and consider themselves infallible as they seek to charter the destiny of 1.2 billion people. Ultimately, it is these people who will determine the destiny of those who have never acknowledged their fallibility. Farewell 2020 with new hopes for 2021.

29-12-2020||News||2021 strategic outlook: India must not yield any ground to China||As the New Year dawns after what seems a long 12 months wracked by death, devastated economies and uncertainty, the global landscape remains in flux. Rivalries between global players will, however, get enhanced. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused anti-China sentiment to soar worldwide, highlighted the need for diversified sources of vital supplies such as pharmaceuticals and rare earths. This has prompted countries to accelerate geo-political realignments and develop new supply chains. For India especially, the coming year heralds a phase of new uncertainties, necessitating deft diplomacy accompanied by a firm resolve not to yield ground on issues of sovereignty and national interest. An aggressive China, a malevolent China-Pakistan relationship and the growing strategic cooperation between Russia and China, with its attendant implications, will all be central to India’s strategic policy. Globally, the China-United States (US) relationship is perhaps the most crucial today. How it evolves during Joe Biden’s term will be minutely watched. Any easing of policies followed by the earlier two US administrations will be oxygen to Chinese President Xi Jinping and make him more aggressive. Despite considerable US pressure, Xi has not wavered in his quest to make China a global power rivalling — if not surpassing — the US. Though the incoming Biden Administration is yet to formally articulate its policies, the President-elect has made clear that restoring the relationship with Europe will be a priority. This sentiment has been quickly reciprocated by European capitals. Biden and his nominees for the posts of secretary of state and national security advisor, Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan respectively, have also indicated that with China they would prefer talks to confrontation. Beijing has responded cautiously, but positively. Several Chinese officials and academics, including China’s foreign minister Wang Yi and ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, have in past weeks reiterated the need to repair Sino-US ties, treat each other with “respect” and address common issues like the pandemic and climate change. They, and other Chinese interlocuters, have nevertheless held firm to Beijing’s position on issues where differences exist. Whether this portends a shift in the Biden Administration’s focus away from the Indo-Pacific should soon be visible. Capitals in Asia, and some in Europe, will closely monitor if America reduces its security presence in the Indo-Pacific, decreases engagement with the Quad, and whether it dilutes support to Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines on security issues. Many Chinese experts hold a thinly concealed view that Beijing wields considerable influence among the US power elite, which will again be revived. Recent US media reports mention that China is establishing contacts with persons close to the Biden camp and point to Beijing’s longstanding financial links with the Democrats, including with Biden’s son. Thus far, China’s aggressive foreign policy, its efforts to establish dominance over the South China Sea and the degree of military pressure it exerts to achieve its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, is limited by US policy. Beijing is upgrading relations with Moscow to form a strong pro-China power bloc in Asia. For India, China is the biggest military, diplomatic, economic and environmental challenge. It is also encroaching on India’s strategic space to establish itself as the pre-eminent power in Asia. China’s leadership, which since 2014 has viewed India as aspiring for a place at the international high table, will increasingly harden its position. Pressures, like the ongoing military confrontation, will continue until Beijing perceives India is willing to acquiesce to its diktat. Beijing will also try to persuade Biden to soften US policy towards Pakistan. As India strives to ensure good relations with the US and Russia, revive its economy and build indigenous capabilities, it is vital that it does not yield ground to China and assertively raises issues that impact its core national interests.Jayadeva Ranade is former additional secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, and president of the Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/2021-strategic-outlook-india-must-not-yield-any-ground-to-china/story-Olnd9D2TUs9z4lOvNQMcWN.html
29-12-2020||News||In between manhole and machine hole||Workmen, collectively, are indispensable because within their union lies the power of bargain. Sanitation workers not only need new systems of mechanisation but also economic, social and political tools to have an upper hand on the contractors.With the surge of mechanisation, sanitation workers need to be reorganised on a large scale to reinstate a permanent structure in the system. This labour concentration is required to weaken the solidarity of the oppressors who also need severe mechanisation to fix their caste bias.The first question is whose capacity will the Centre build when it seems they don’t even know who these sanitation workers are? Their lack of sociological understanding is evident in their failure of inclusion of sanitation workers in proposed plans devised for their benefit. Another aspect is that if the number of workmen is unknown, any plans of direct monetary support is far away from reality. On the ground the states have always refused to recognise the existing categorisation of sanitation workers, therefore, when it comes to the work of scavenging only sewer cleaners come to mind. Therefore, the missing link between manhole to machine hole transformation is a need for a mobilisation movement so that sanitation workers of different categories can be at the front and centre of decision making. An alliance of all categories will not only help in their realistic recognition but also protect their interests.The second question is what are the concrete steps that the Centre and state will be taking in improving the lives of the one who will be using these machines? How will a minimum standard of the wages be insured? It is true that sanitation workers have fought for themselves through unionisation even before this new introduction of machinery but now it is the time for them to reinstate themselves into a labour movement immediately otherwise the Centre will take over the real social function of their unionisation.Mechanic output realisation has historically given the employers the ability to own the employee. It is also true that when the mass mobilisation of the sanitation workers will become visible political parties will understand the value of taking sanitation workers on board. The fist agglomeration of workmen by NM Lokhande was in response to the draconian Factories Act of 1881 by the British government. It was at this time that the working class realised how strikes can be held to gather actualised concessions. The success of these opened the way for many types of mobilisation.The formation of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and Trade Unions Act in the 1920s and then the starting of All India Trade Union Federation mobilised many labourers altogether but rapid politicisation also confused them. Also, when the leaders will become powerful, stained tactics will be used to lure them like the Cawnpore conspiracy case. In the post independent era trade unions in India had a linear weave along with socialist and communist tendencies but post-liberalisation the actual membership tally also started becoming complicated because of the rise of workforce from the informal sector.Sanitation workers in that case will also suffer the same complications as within different categorisations the number of people entering into the septic tanks have many other seasonal occupations. The nature of the Indian labour is that it does not remain in one job for very long. The Indian labour is rooted in the village who migrate heavily to the cities to become a sanitation worker. Therefore, the third question is: To whom the Centre will give training if the sanitation workers who used to enter the septic tanks do not come out in the open? Large degree of labour turnover and lack of adequate provisions for the sanitation workers will start an effect that there will be a possibility that the upper caste men will begin occupying these machines and force the sanitation workers to assist them through manual jobs.Similarly, the fourth question is whose job it will be to ensure the implementation of the usage of this machinery? To whom the training will be given to also fix the machinery? The fifth question is whose insurance it will be that the contractors will not force sanitation workers in semi-urban and rural areas to enter into the septic tanks? Unionisation in this regard has the power to not only protect the sanitation workers but also improve their political standing. This in turn will free them from contractual exploitation and ownership. Sanitation workers will have to take the strict compliance of legal regulation in their own hands.They will have to be more than strike committees and refrain from multiplicity of unions and inter union rivalries only then every death case will haunt the lawmakers for posterity. Now, the Centre will have to understand that India’s sanitation workers need a ‘safai karmachari mitra’ more than a ‘safaimitra.’ Till that time sanitation workers will have to protect their own interest themselves through responsible trade union leadership.Pragya Akhilesh is the secretary of Bhim Safai Karmachari Trade Union and the national convener of Rehabilitation Research Initiative, India(The views expressed are personal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-between-manhole-and-machine-hole/story-LFzxiU2GBpYCElzarq0LtK.html
29-12-2020||City||Panchkula and Ambala set to get new mayors, councillors||The six mayoral candidates and 83 others in the fray for 20 councillor seats along with around 1.03 lakh people who voted for them in the Panchkula municipal corporation elections will come to know the outcome on Wednesday.District election officer Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said the counting of votes will start at Government Post Graduate Women’s College, Sector 14, at 8 am. The results are expected to be declared by 1pm.“Necessary arrangements have been made. Separate tables have been set up for counting votes polled for the mayor and councillors. No agent can carry mobile phone, stationery or other items in the counting hall,” he said.Meanwhile, all candidates have been directed to disclose their total expenditure in the election process within 30 days from the date of declaration of results.Elections to the Panchkula MC took place two years after the first House was dissolved. It is for the first time there is a direct contest for the post of mayor, and elections are taking place in a bifurcated MC, as Kalka and Pinjore were separated from its limits earlier this year.In is mainly a two-cornered contest for the mayoral post with former incumbent Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia of the Congress taking on the BJP’s Kulbhushan Goyal. The contest is expected to be a close one due to a low voter turnout. Of 1.86 lakh voters, only 55.9% turned up on Sunday, the lowest turnout among the three MCs in Haryana that went to the polls.In the first election held in 2013, the Congress won the mayor’s post and majority in the House with 12 seats. The BJP and INLD won three each and two seats went to Independent candidates.In Ambala, counting of votes will start around 8am at OPS Vidya Mandir in Sector 9. Polling on Sunday saw 56.3% of the electorate coming out to vote for the six mayoral candidates besides 101 in the fray for 20 councillor’s seats from as many wards. Returning officer Sachin Gupta said 24 tables have been placed for counting of votes. Votes polled for the mayor will be counted on 14 tables and the remaining will be used for counting councillors’ votes.The city witnessed a multi-cornered contest as BJP-JJP coalition’s mayoral candidate Vandana Sharma and Congress’ Meena Aggarwal faced challenge from Shakti Rani Sharma and Amisha Chawla, candidates of parties floated by former ministers Venod Sharma (HJP) and Nirmal Singh (HDF), respectively. Rural booths saw nearly 70% turnout, and political analysts feel the ongoing farmers’ protests might have an impact on the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-and-ambala-set-to-get-new-mayors-councillors/story-50MHveGcsZ8X3iC4RxtDmJ.html

While visiting Rakh Bagh, the most frequented of vehicle lifters’ haunts, commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal said, “We studied the pattern of vehicle lifting in Ludhiana and identified locations from where 80% of the thefts took place in 2020.” Most people haphazardly parked their vehicle in Rakh Bagh, Rose Garden and the bus stand, making them easy targets for vehicle lifters, he said.Vehicles parked along markets such as Ghumar Mandi and outside shopping malls are also frequently stolen. “We have asked market associations and municipal corporations (MC) to install CCTV cameras on these locations,” said AgrawalHe said, “In most cases it was found that drivers had randomly parked their vehicles to avoid parking fee. In some cases it was found that residents had left their keys in the vehicles, making the theft all the more easy. Four cases were reported where occupants forgot to roll up the windows.” Agrawal advised residents to install GPS devices in their vehicles as a safety measure. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Samer Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Jatiner Chopra and Division 8 station house officer (SHO) Jarnail Singh were also present during the time of inspection.The 34 hotspots include Leisure Valley, the Zone-D office, MBD Mall, Urban Estate Phase I Market, Urban Estate Phase II Market, Kipps Market, Gurudwara Shri Alamgir Sahib market, Punjab Agricultural University hostels, cremation ground behind KVM School, Samrala Chowk (near division 3 ), Mata Rani Chowk, Feroze Gandhi Market Court Complex, Civil Hospital, railway station parking, Western Mall, Silver Arc, Deep Hospital, vegetable market, Rishi Nagar Near Abiss Restaurant, Apollo Hospital, Outside Gurudwara Shri Dukhniwaran Sahib, JMD Mall, CMC Hospital, Krishna Sweets Chawni Mohalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/80-vehicles-lifted-from-34-hotspots-in-ludhiana-cops/story-Wr4jobFbofsFZoV14ZTuVM.html

29-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Night curfew-hit hospitality sector wants curbs eased on New Year eve||With New Year’s Eve around the corner, the hospitality sector is in a tizzy over the imposition of night curfew in the state, which is expected to play a spoilsport during the celebrations.Ruing losses, the sector has demanded the withdrawal of night curfew in the state on December 31, to revive the sector, which has already suffered a lot during the lockdown. Hotel and restaurant owners say only 35% people have booked afternoon parties as compared to last year. Punjab Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said, “The sector will suffer losses amounting to crores unless night curfew restrictions are withdrawn. We had also approached the government but we haven’t got a positive response so far.”Vishal Malhotra, owner, Flamme Bois restaurant, Pakhowal Road, said, “New Year revellers are not booking any night events due to the curfew and as December 31 is a working day, few people have made bookings for the afternoon.”Amarjit Singh, who owns a hotel at Railway Station Road, said, “It is a tough time for the hospitality sector, which has already suffered huge losses during the lockdown. The government should take note of our problems and lift night curfew restrictions on December 31 as all guidelines are being followed at restaurants and hotels.”Meanwhile, residents had mixed responses on the issue. Some said gatherings should not be allowed viewing the threat which looms over the city amid the pandemic, while others said exception should be made for a day. A resident of Model Town extension Arshdeep Singh said,”The government should abolish the night curfew so that residents can celebrate with their families. Huge gatherings can still be seen in market places and residents can take all the precautions while enjoying with their friends and family.”REVELLERS HEAD TO HILL STATIONS TO RING IN 2021 With night curfew set to play a party pooper, Ludhiana residents are heading to hill stations and vacations spots in other states to ring in the New Year. This has increased business for travel agents and taxi service providers, who say that they are getting a lot of inquiries for two to three-day trips to Manali, Dalhousie, Shimla and other hill stations.Punjab Taxi union president Jaideep Singh said, “Most of these inquiries are for December 31 as residents don’t want to celebrate New Year in the city due to the night curfew here. Although curfew has also been imposed in Shimla and other districts in Himachal, residents are still opting for these places.” He added that the snow-covered roads at the hill station may make travelling difficult. Munish, a travel agent from Brown Road in the old city area, revealed that residents are opting for short-duration trips of two to three days as hotels have hiked the accommodation charges in view of the New Year rush. Deepak Sharma, a city resident who is planning to spend the New Year’ eve in Dalhousie, says, “My wife and I normally celebrate with friends and family in the city. But this time, we planned to go out of station due to the night curfew here.” With fewer bookings for New Year parties this time around, luxury hotels are offering staycation packages to customers so that people can ring in the New Year without worrying about the curfew.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-night-curfew-hit-hospitality-sector-wants-curbs-eased-on-new-year-eve/story-BgwjnbgkHp7GYbnqj9TH0L.html
29-12-2020||Chandigarh||Hourly parking rates to be enforced in Chandigarh in phased manner||With contractors yet to fully install the mandated smart features in all parking lots, the imposition of hourly parking charges will be executed in a gradual and phased manner in Chandigarh.The municipal corporation had given the contractors December 31 as the deadline to start smart parking in all sectors, which was the prerequisite to impose hourly charges.SK Jain, additional commissioner, MC, said, “One of the two contractors has installed the smart features, and he will gradually start charging hourly parking rates. The second contractor hasn’t yet complied.”The MC will start the inspection of parking lots from next week to verify whether the smart features have been installed, said Jain, adding that soon a meeting will be held with the contractors to further assess the situation.The smart features include e-ticketing, HD night-vision CCTV cameras, smart card-based daily and monthly passes, provision for e-payment, LED display of real-time occupancy and online booking of parking space.After the new rates kick in, parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as the flat rates charged right now: ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹10 for four-wheelers.Thereafter, these will be doubled. The charges will further be doubled if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours.

29-12-2020||Delhi||Geared up to tackle new Covid strain, says CM Arvind Kejriwal as city witnesses 703 new cases||Delhi on Tuesday conducted more than 84,000 tests for Covid-19 and reported 703 new cases of the viral infection. This is the fifth consecutive day that Delhi has seen fewer than 1,000 cases, even as Delhi chief minister said that the city was ready to tackle the new variant of the viral infection that originated in the United Kingdom. The new variant, which has 23 known mutation, is thought to spread 70% faster sparking fears of super-spreading events. “There have been three waves of Covid infections in Delhi. Over 8,000 cases were seen in a day in Delhi, which was the highest in the world. But Delhi was able to control it. We are ready for any situation now,” said Kejriwal. The city has seen a positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – of around 1% for the last five days as well. The positivity rate had dipped below 5% on December 2, dropping constantly to 0.83% as on Tuesday.

The seven day CFR stood at 1.87% at the beginning of the month. “The new variant of Covid-19 is thought to be more transmissible, so if it reaches the susceptible population – which would probably be around 40% of Delhi’s population – it will spread quickly,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/geared-up-to-tackle-new-covid-strain-says-cm-arvind-kejriwal-as-city-witnesses-703-new-cases/story-3hwAPUdg74EpF8EHOcPAGP.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Mercury drops to 3.6 degrees, ‘feels like’ 2 °C in Delhi||‘Cold wave’ to ‘severe cold wave’ conditions have set in over several parts of northwest India on Tuesday with Delhi’s Lodhi Road and Ayanagar recording temperatures of 2.7 and 2.6 degrees Celsius respectively. The Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, recorded temperature of 3.6 degrees Celsius.Though, the minimum temperature was pegged at 3.6 degrees Celsius, on Tuesday morning the “feel like” temperature was as low as 2 degrees Celsius, weather scientists said. This is mainly because of strong, chilly winds blowing at 15 to 20 kmph, which makes the perception of cold stronger. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 18.1 degree C, two degrees below normal.The ‘feels like’ temperature takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body actually feels temperature. “For example, in winter a strong wind can feel much colder than the measured temperature would indicate. Conversely on a humid day in summer, it can feel uncomfortably hotter than the air temperatures would suggest on their own,” explains the UK Met Office.sMany stations in the northern plains recorded 0 degreez or near zero minimum temperatures. Hisar recorded 0 degrees Celsius; Narnaul was 0.3 degrees Celsius; Amritsar was 0.4 degrees Celsius; Bhilwara was 0.9 degrees Celsius; Pilani was 0.9; Sikar was 0.5 degrees Celsius and Churu was at 0.4 degrees Celsius.“Severe cold wave was recorded in many parts of Punjab and Haryana and cold wave conditions were recorded in Delhi. Extremely cold winds from snow-clad Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are reaching the plains now. The average wind speed was around 15 kmph in Delhi, which increased the feeling of chill so the feels like temperature was around 2 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperatures will be low for the next two days and may even dip further,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.There is likely to be relief from January 1, when minimum temperature is likely to rise to around 5 degrees Celsius and to around 7 degrees Celsius on January 2 and 3, Shrivastava said. A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the Western Himalayan region around January 4, which may bring light rain and thundershowers to the plains including Delhi.Under the influence of the strengthening of cold and dry northwesterly/ northerly lower-level winds, minimum temperatures are likely to fall by about 2 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest and Central India during next 3 days and rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius thereafter for subsequent 3 days (January 1 to 3). ‘Cold wave’ to ‘severe cold wave’ conditions are likely in many parts over Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Saurashtra and Kutch in the next 3-4 days according to IMD’s Tuesday bulletin.‘Cold wave’ conditions are very likely over Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha during December 30 to January 1. Dense to very dense fog is very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttarakhand during the next 3-4 days.A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains. Ground frost conditions are likely over north Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi during the next 2 days.“Many parts of northwest India are reaching the freezing point. We are expecting December 31 to be the coldest. Around January 2, a cyclonic circulation is likely to form over south Rajasthan and anticyclone over Chhattisgarh and Odisha. A confluence zone is likely to develop over Madhya Pradesh and east Rajasthan which is likely to bring rain to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.Highest weather station in India:• IMD established a meteorological centre in Leh in Ladakh on Tuesday. At 3500 m, it’s the highest met center in India.• Being located on a strategically important Western Himalayan region bordering China, Pakistan, Tibet and Afghanistan, IMD will be reporting daily weather parameters from the region.• Ladakh has a complex mountain terrain with little annual precipitation of only 10 cm/year making it a cold desert.• It often faces extreme weather events like cloud bursts, flash floods, glacial lake outbursts(GLOFs), avalanche, drought etc leading to loss of life and property.• Examples include severe cloud burst in August 2010 and 2015, avalanche at Khardongla Pass in Jan 2019 and frequent blockage of Leh-Manali and Leh- Srinagar Highways due to heavy snowfall on passes.• Meteorological (Met) Center at Leh is established to strengthen weather related early warning system in Ladakh.• To begin with, IMD has established a surface observatory at Leh for reporting daily meteorological parameters like pressure, humidity, temperature, snowfall, etc.• At present Ladakh has got 4 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), two each in both districts of which one is at Drass, the coldest place in India. Real Time weather data is available online on IMD website.• To improve the network of observations, IMD proposes to install more weather stations next year at the remotest of places like Nubra, Zanskar, Changthang, Parkachik, etc. thus covering the whole of Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mercury-drops-to-3-6-degrees-feels-like-2-c-in-delhi/story-rP4rZCOPyRcIU3KMlYMkaM.html
29-12-2020||City||Protests, national recognition: GADVASU saw it all in 2020||At the dawn of 2020, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) grabbed headlines after reshuffling of students to Khalsa College, Amritsar, triggered protests. However, as the year came to an end, the vet varsity was in the news for all the right reasons after the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) ranked it the best vet varsity in India.A ‘controversial counselling’ held at the eleventh hour on September 30 was challenged by students who said they did not get sufficient notice. The Punjab and Haryana high court asked the university to counsel the remaining students and reshuffle seats according to merit.On January 20, GADVASU issued a notice on its website saying counselling for reshuffling students will be held on January 23. As per the reshuffling list, nearly 24 students were to be shifted. The move triggered protests on the GADVASU campus with nearly 68 students camping on the university premises for a day.Students already enrolled at Government Veterinary College, Rampura Phul, Bathinda, staged a protest, saying they did not want to join the trust-run college in Amritsar, which charged ‘₹5 lakh as annual fee and ₹50,00 as hostel charges’ as opposed to ‘₹2 lakh and hostel fee and ₹10,000’ being charged by the government-run institution in Bathinda.The strike was finally called off after the vice-chancellor intervened and told them that the university was merely following the court’s orders.The university was in for another shock when renowned veterinarian Dr Kirti Dua passed away on July 1 after suffering a cardiac arrest. The 59-year-old author of ‘Veterinary Ethics And Jurisprudence’ was known across the state for his humanitarian work and at the time of his death was working on dispelling rumours about the spread of Covid among animals and to humans via animals.‘Murrah man takes varsity’s reins’On June 11, Dr Inderjeet Singh — popularly known as ‘Murrah Man’, for his research and expertise in breeding and management of the Murrah buffalo which is widely reared by farmers in Punjab and Haryana — replaced Dr AS Nanda as the vice-chancellor. The four-year tenure of V-C Dr AS Nanda had ended on February 15, 2019. However, he continued to remain on the position on ad-hoc basis as the government had not been able to decide on his successor. Inderjeet , who was chosen for the post on June 4, had been working as Punjab Animal Husbandry Department director since November, 2018.Top rankingGADVASU ranked first among veterinary universities of India as per the ranking of the agricultural universities and research institutes, taken out by the education division of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi, for the year 2019. GADVASU ranked seventh among all 67 agricultural universities,veterinary universities and research institutes of India.First blood bank for dogs in north IndiaPunjab governer VP Singh Badnore congratulated GADVASU officials on Twitter for setting up the first dog blood bank in north India where dogs’ blood, platelets, plasma will be stored and used to treat ailing or injured dogs. The university and veterinary hospital treats approximately 30,000 animals every year, including 20,000 pets.Covid reliefWith pandemic sweeping across the state, top scientists from the university offered their services to the government. Ten scientists from GADVASU were deputed to different medical colleges in the state to help with diagnosing Covid. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had recommended two diagnostic tests — Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus’ and ‘Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative’ for diagnosing the disease. The advanced tests could not be conducted in most medical laboratories in Punjab. In these circumstances, GADVASU provided two Real-Time PCR testing machines, and trained medical support staff for conducting the tests. GADVASU is already equipped with well-established research labs in the field of animal viotechnology, virology, cell culture and disease epidemiology. A Covid viral testing laboratory was also inaugurated at GADVASU in August. Medical education and research minister OP Soni and food, civil supplies and consumers affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu inaugurated the lab.New officers appointedThe board of management appointed deans of different colleges.

29-12-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER starts 3D exoscope surgery, a first in India||The department of neurosurgery of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has started operating patients with 3D exoscope, a minimally invasive technique.It is the first in the country to do so. A team of neurosurgeons, led by Dr Dhandapani, successfully operated upon two patients with brain tumour and orbital mass using this latest technology for brain and spine surgeries. “Many centres in India have 2D exoscopes, but 3D exoscope in PGIMER is the first in India. This is very helpful in dealing with problems on the surface of the brain, spine and orbit. Compared to a microscope, the system is lighter, occupies less operating room space and is ergonomically better,” said PGIMER in a release. The 3D visualisation is guided by a scope from outside while 2D visualisation is from inside the endoscope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-starts-3d-exoscope-surgery-a-first-in-india/story-jrhBLSKfyrEWm7mj5gKcqO.html

In this context, we would like to bring to your attention that the past experience of conducting online examinations for end semesters has been far from satisfactory,” the syndics have said. “Since you (VC) have failed to conduct any meeting of the Syndicate for the last five months, it is both inevitable and obligatory on our part to convey to you that we are of the considered opinion that in order to avoid the problems encountered during the conduct of semester examinations through online mode, all semester examinations scheduled for the ongoing classes, be conducted strictly in the physical/offline mode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-to-hold-re-appear-exams-from-january-15/story-nnwMqBw6pLtqoUSXY6a0uI.html
29-12-2020||Noida||Residents’ group urges authority to to install barriers at bridge over Hindon||Greater Noida residents have asked the authority to install barriers to prevent dumping of waste into the Hindon river.“A new bridge that connects Noida and Greater Noida over river Hindon has no barriers. We urge the authority to at least install the grills or a barrier, just like on the Yamuna Bridge so that illegal dumping of the garbage and construction waste would stop,” said a letter by city-based social group Progressive Community Foundation. They also urged the authority to clean the river. “Hindon doesn’t look like a river at all. It is a stinking untreated drain. If the authority cannot treat the river, the least that could be done is stop further damage,” said Amit Gupta, resident of sector-77 and member of the social group. Officials at Greater Noida authority have said that they have written to the bridge corporation. “The demand by the group is valid. We have asked the bridge corporation whether they have a proposal to build or install barriers. If not, then the authority will install one,” said Kaluram Verma, senior manager, Greater Noida authority. The Hindon originates from Saharanpur and reaches Gautam Budh Nagar (Greater Noida) after passing through Meerut, Shamli, Mussafarnagar, and Ghaziabad. It merges with the Yamuna at Momnathal in Tilwada village of Greater Noida. Throughout its 50 km of length through the district, the river is fed untreated effluent and non-degradable waste from industries and illegal colonies thereby worsening the situation and suffer a constant absence of the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) making it a virtually dead river. According to the UPPCB assessments, the Hindon at its entry point Chhijarsi was consistently zero throughout the year 2019 and 2020 till October, against a minimum requirement of 5 mg/ltrs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-group-urges-authority-to-to-install-barriers-at-bridge-over-hindon/story-2z2KnrsaqD3NKYuuRLH54N.html

29-12-2020||Noida||After peak in September, active Covid cases fall below 500 in Ghaziabad and Noida||Ghaziabad: Coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar are witnessing a declining trend as the number of active cases in both districts has fallen below the figure of 500. According to the state control figures of December 28, Ghaziabad had 397 Covid-19 cases while Gautam Buddha Nagar had 462. Both districts are in the list of top five in Uttar Pradesh which, combined, account for 32.44% of total cases in the state. Going by the figures, active cases in Ghaziabad peaked to 2,126 on September 14, and have been keeping below the 1,000-mark of active cases every day since December 16. Gautam Buddha Nagar, on the other hand, reached its peak of 2,008 active cases on September 13, and has been able to keep the daily active case count below 1,000 since December 7.Looking at state-wide figures, daily active cases in UP had peaked around the same time – 68,235 cases recorded on September 17. Since then, this number has been on the decline, with 14,710 active cases as on December 28.Experts are looking at the scenario in different ways. “I believe that we are on the descending arm of the epidemic curve, in which cases are on the decline, after a peak. We should see the picture in a larger perspective rather than focussing on small areas. It seems we are on the descending curve of the first wave. The wave got prolonged as we took precautionary lockdown,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). “Further, it will also depend on how fast the vaccine comes through so that we may avoid any possibility of a second wave. Hence, face masks and other precautions must continue in 2021 as well,” he added. Dr Ashish Agarwal, the president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad), said many patients are getting negative results in tests conducted.“The declining trend of cases or lesser number of active cases means that either the virus has slowed down or there is prevalence of immunity, due to which the disease came and went on without giving symptoms. There was an expectation that cases will spike in the winter season but the trend (we are witnessing now) is very different,” Dr Agarwal added.With the number of active cases going down, the recovery rate in the two districts has also increased. Ghaziabad, till December 28, had discharged 25,432 of 25,930 overall Sars-Cov-2 patients, with a recovery rate of 98.08%, while Gautam Buddha Nagar has discharged 24,294 of 24,845 total patients, with a recovery rate of 97.78%. Suhay LY, district magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagarm said that the trend of active cases has been on the decline for past 15-20 days. “In the previous months, the number of cases had declined but they again spiked around Diwali. So, irrespective of decline, we are continuing with our efforts against the coronavirus and also focussing on the new Covid variant. Two travellers from the UK have tested positive and their genome sequencing reports are awaited,” he added.Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, said, “Despite the declining trend, we are focussing on surveillance, focussed testing and contact tracing, which will continue further at the same level. We have also completed preparation for Covid vaccine. If the number of cases rises in future, our teams have proper systems and infrastructure in place to act accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-peak-in-september-active-covid-cases-fall-below-500-in-ghaziabad-and-noida/story-w2FiKorxjDHFE5JTRbHBgL.html

The teachers of government schools stated that testing is important to know the performance of students but there is a need to conduct classes for the students to clear their doubts so that they can enhance their performance in the final exams. Amandeep Singh Dadahur, president of SSA/RMSA teachers’ union, Ludhiana, said, “Students are under a lot of pressure as they are appearing in exams every month. There is a need to open schools for middle, high, and senior secondary students so that proper classes can be conducted. Concept clarity and revision is necessary to improve students’ performance while conducting online exams is like giving an open book test which will not help them in the future.” A teacher of a government school, who did not wish to be named, said, “I am a science teacher and am handling two classes 9 and 10. In the last four months, I have checked over 400 answer sheets per month and uploaded the marks online. I have also provided free coaching to the students preparing for the National Talent Search Exam for two months.” “There is a need to make the students attend classes so that they can work on the weak areas and can understand the topics,” the teacher added. Harjit Singh Bolari, president of Government School Lecturer Union, said, “Online education is an alternative of a textbook and not of a teacher. Testing is required to make the student get in touch with the syllabus, but at the same time, classes should be held for the students for doubt clearance. Earlier too, exams used to be conducted in September and December, but now due to the online mode, teachers have to put in a lot of time to evaluate the answer sheets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-too-many-tests-not-enough-learning-rue-ludhiana-teachers/story-Sbnu0rymkYfOkYguiSy1jI.html

29-12-2020||Ranchi||‘Running on posters and hoardings’: BJP slams Soren govt in Jharkhand||The opposition BJP on Tuesday alleged that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) combine government, led by chief minister Hemant Soren, was running on posters and hoardings with no actual development. The party said that its first one year of reign was marked with complete lawlessness as incidents of killings, rapes, extortion and corruption taking centre stage.The party released a 28-page report card highlighting the alleged failure of the Soren government, which is celebrating its first anniversary of being in office on Tuesday. It gave zero marks out of 100 to the incumbent government.Speaking to media, BJP’s state president and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Prakash said that Jharkhand government was trying to hide its story of unsuccess by making false claims on posters and hoardings with no real development on the ground level.“The one year rule of the incumbent government is marked with incidents of loot, rape, killing, extortion and corruption of all kinds. People are feeling deceived. It’s a government influenced by politics of dynasticism and familism where people’s aspirations take a backseat and family members assume importance,” Prakash said.He added, “The government has failed on all fronts. It had claimed to provide free 100 units electricity, 5 lakh jobs but nothing was done. Corruption through transfer and posting is rampant. Nearly, 1,700 people have been transferred in the last one year which ultimately posed extra burden to the exchequer.”Prakash pointed out that the government has miserably failed in handling farmers’ issues.Also read: ‘Chinese air force heavily deployed in Ladakh theatre in support of PLA’: IAF chief“Farmers are the most disgruntled lot in this regime. They have been purchasing urea from the black market. They are forced to sell their produce to middlemen at a much lower rate than the government’s minimum support price (MSP). These middlemen have direct links with people at the helm of power. The government also failed to fulfil its promise of farm loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh,” he said.The party’s state president also slammed the government allegedly for protecting and supporting mining mafia.“Illegal mining of minerals including coal, iron ore, stone chips and sand is being done openly under government’s support and protection,” Prakash alleged, charging chief minister Hemant Soren for supporting separatist forces of Pathalgadi movement.BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi too slammed the government for pushing the state back to 1990s era when law and order was hit maximum during unified Bihar.He said, “The deterioration in law and order in Jharkhand was felt maximum in the last one year. Similar situation that existed in the 1990s in unified Bihar, can now be witnessed here.”“Doctors, businessmen and many others are getting extortion calls. Loots, killings, kidnappings, rapes have become the order of the day in Jharkhand. While other states had witnessed a dip in crime graph during the lockdown, Jharkhand saw a spurt in these figures. The biggest victim of these crimes are women and girls. Left insurgency have resurfaced with the support of people in power,” Marandi added.He said, “The government utterly failed in providing a fearless and peaceful atmosphere to the people. Common man issues are not being addressed.”BJP’s reminds govt about its unfulfilled promisesGrant of Rs 72, 000 to all poor familiesThree-room furnished flat worth Rs 3 lakh to poorFree 100 units electricityRs 2500 pension to old, disabled and widowSetting up of farmer’s and women’s bank in all villagesCreation of warehouse and cold storage in all blocksFree education to students up to class 12thJobs to Jharkhandi under new industrial policyFree 35 kg rice per month to all familiesBicycle to all girl studentsEstablishment of Women’s college in all sub-divisions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/running-on-posters-and-hoardings-bjp-slams-soren-govt-in-jharkhand/story-P9AAzD40epxUIUHlw8cyLJ.html

29-12-2020||Gurugram||Woman robbed at gunpoint at her home in Sushant Lok-1||A 55-year-old woman was held hostage at gunpoint inside her house and robbed in Sushant Lok-1 on Monday afternoon, the police said. According to the police, Sumitra Vishwas, the victim, was alone at home on Monday when two men on a motorcycle approached her and asked her if any of the houses in the vicinity are vacant and available for rent. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram Police, said that the incident took place around 2pm on Monday. Vishwas told the suspects that an accommodation on the first floor of her building is vacant and invited them to view it to check if it met their needs. “The woman took them to first floor and showed all the rooms and the kitchen. The suspects, claiming that the kitchen was not fine, called her to the area, held her at gunpoint and robbed her of her ornaments. They snatched her two bangles, earrings and one ring and then placed a tape on her mouth . They threatened her not to inform the police and warned her of dire consequences,” he said. The suspects then fled the spot on their motorcycles, said police. The victim then raised the alarm following which a neighbour came to her rescue and freed her. Later, she got down and went towards her daughter’s house in Block C. Vishwas told the police that she narrated her ordeal to a friend near her daughter’s house, following which he informed police and reported the incident. “I have one daughter who lives in Block C with her family. She was away at Rajasthan on a vacation,” she said. The victim told the police that she can recognise the suspects if required. Senior citizens in the area are living in fear now and have requested the police to ensure cops are on day and night patrolling. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that special teams have been formed to visit senior citizens in the area and have alerted the neighbours and domestic helps to take care of them. “We will hold regular meetings with the residents and will deploy extra force on the roads to ensure safety and security of the residents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-robbed-at-gunpoint-at-her-home-in-sushant-lok-1/story-vvpK8SdkiKVtmXtm6YIKSI.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||Family IDs mandatory to avail of schemes, utility connections||More than 500 government schemes and services provided by at least 38 government departments, including the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), have been linked with Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) or Family ID Card scheme. The Haryana government on Tuesday released the gazette notification, making Family ID Card mandatory to avail of any government service in the state, including water and sewer connections, town planning schemes, construction of a building, arms licence, tenant and domestic help verification, among others.The departments covered under the PPP are agriculture, education, power, employment, food supplies, finance, health, housing board, backward class and economically weaker sections, agriculture marketing board, women development, labour, scheduled caste finance and development corporation, home, horticulture, industries and commerce, police, public health engineering, new and renewable energy, revenue, social justice, sports, tourism, sainik and ardh sainik welfare, and town and country planning, among others. It is the fourth notification in a year by the Haryana government under PPP to collect details of the people who are domicile to Haryana. In 2019, the state government introduced the PPP — an eight-digit ID for every household in the state — for automatic delivery of services and devising public policy.The data verification process has been ongoing for months now, covering those who are availing of subsidies or benefits under various government scheme. The state, however, did not receive a good response from the other sections, who are not availing of any government subsidy. Also, the enrolment process remained slow due to Covid-19 lockdown.Until now, over 452,000 households in Gurugram have enrolled under the PPP. In a statement issued by the district administration Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner and nodal officer for PPP in the district, said, “Gazetted notification on linking government schemes and services with the PPP has been issued by the citizen resources information department. Citizens should get their details verified for the ID card.” The Family ID Card form contains details of all the members of a family, from their age to Aadhaar card number, Voter ID, date of birth and contact number. An official, who is part of the Family ID Card scheme, preferring anonymity said, “Those above the age of 18 will have to give Voter ID card, a document to prove their date of birth. On the other hand, those who file for income tax return will have to give their Permanent Account Number (PAN) number.” According to him, the Aadhaar number is mandatory for the PPP. As reported by HT on December 8, senior state officials confirmed that PPP will be linked with all government services and schemes, even as people took to the social media to oppose linking Aadhaar with the scheme.Increasing EnrolmentOn Tuesday, Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner of the municipal corporations of Gurugram and Manesar, said, “All the councillors are advised to promote PPP in their respective wards and hold camps.”In each Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) ward, at least two camps are being held, at the councillor’s office of the respective ward and a community centre in that area, said Jai Singh, part of the PPP scheme team. “More than 65 camps are being held across the city,” he said. According to him, the data is uploaded only after the personal details are verified and signed. According to the details shared by the district administration, people can update the data on meraparivar.haryana.gov.in portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/family-ids-mandatory-to-avail-of-schemes-utility-connections/story-LVZmnPZhAdbKExFNa753IN.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG’s territorial jurisdiction expanded||The Haryana government in a notification on Monday night extended the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), bringing a large number of new sector areas located along Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) and Dwarka Expressway under the civic body. This had been a longstanding demand of the residents, as civic amenities, such as lack of streetlights, drainage system, and road connectivity, have been a major issue in these areas.With the takeover by the MCG, the panchayat system will be abolished and all 16 villages falling within these areas will immediately come under the MCG’s ambit. The 16 villages to be included are Bajgehra, Babupur, Mohammadheri, Dharampur, Daultabad, Kherki Majra, Dhankot, Palra, Ullawas, Nangli Umarpur, Behrampur, Dhumaspur, Bhondsi, Nayagaon, Kadarpur, and Maidawas.According to MCG officials, the stamp duty collected from the 16 villages for the 2019-2020 year was Rs 41.32 crore, while the 16 villages also have a fixed deposit of Rs 181 crore.The report prepared by the MCG’s electrical division revealed that the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) gets around Rs 29.50 crore per year in billing amount, of which the MCG is entitled to 2% of the, as per the Haryana government. This amounts to Rs 59 lakh per year.From the 16 villages, MCG is also expected to earn around Rs 1.8 crore in property tax, around Rs 2 crore in trade licences and Rs 1.5 crore through advertisements.As per MCG officials, the entire process of taking over the 16 villages is expected to be completed by next April. In the interim, the civic body will be floating multiple tenders for more manpower and machinery to execute developmental works in the area.Besides the villages, multiple agencies, such as Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), Public Works Department (PWD), and Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), look after the development of the remaining residential and industrial areas located along the GCER and Dwarka Expressway.Although the GMDA will continue to look after master roads and master drains in the area, the MCG will gradually take over amenities from the remaining bodies, sector wise, said officials privy to the matter.Similar to the MCG taking over around 50 sectors of HSVP following its formation in 2008, the process of taking over residential and industrial areas located along the GCER and Dwarka Expressway can take from one to five years, said officials.“The territorial expansion will be beneficial to lakhs of residents living in the newer sectors of the city. We are aiming to start delivering civic amenities in the 16 villages by early 2021 and subsequently, take over the charge of civic amenities of remaining areas falling within MCG limit, gradually. Our main objective is to provide civic coverage to all parts of the city so that development is done in a comprehensive manner rather than a lopsided one,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.With new sector areas, in sectors 77 to 93, also coming under the ambit of the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), new sector areas (sectors 58-115) located within Gurugram district have all been assigned to civic bodies finally.“We are looking forward to the MCG taking over our sector as there are many prevailing civic issues that need immediate attention. Among them, the lack of streetlights in the area is the main point of concern for residents, from both a security point of view as well as illumination. We are hoping the MCG’s resources will be able to solve the nearly decade-long problem in quick time, whenever our sector is taken over by them,” said Alka Sinha, a resident of Sector 58.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-s-territorial-jurisdiction-expanded/story-xeQYvGSg0ceW6919jRTfDN.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||Cop booked for bribery, extortion on the run||A day after the Haryana State Vigilance Bureau arrested the head constable of Kherki Daula police station and booked its station house officer(SHO) for accepting bribes, the SHO remains untraceable, said officials. According to the Faridabad vigilance department, one Naveen Bhutani, who runs a call centre and sells religious products in the UK and Australia, had approached the senior officers of the department with a complaint against two officials of the Kherki Daula police station for allegedly extorting Rs 57 lakh from him and demanding another payment of Rs 10 lakh.In his complaint, Bhutani alleged that he had started a business with the owner of a Karnal-based school, as he had a payment gateway for easy transactions. “My Faridabad based friend had introduced me to these people who run this school. Together, we earned Rs 1.2 crore, of which they were supposed to give me Rs 80 lakh, but they started avoiding me and wanted the entire money,” he said in his complaint. The complainant said that after several complaints, they asked him to meet them at a resort near Kherki Daula, on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. When he reached there, two policemen in uniforms and seven others in plainclothes quickly forced him in their vehicle and drove him to the police station. The incident is alleged to have taken place on October 29.Bhutani said that the SHO, Vishal Kumar, assaulted him in his office and got his laptop data scanned, following which he allegedly asked for Rs 1 crore for his release. PK Aggarwal, the director general of police (DGP), Vigilance, said that the policemen threatened the complainant and told him they would put him behind bars for his lifetime. “They got him to make calls to his family members, friends and relatives to arrange money,” he said. Around 12.15am on October 30, the SHO took him to a farmhouse 12 kilometres from the police station and the next morning, three policemen escorted him to his car and kept on driving around the area until he arranged money, the complainant told vigilance officials.A friend of the complainant, who was bringing the money, was met by the head constable, Amit Kumar, near Panchgaon on the Western Peripheral Expressway and collected the same. The police dropped them near Rajiv Chowk around 6.30pm, but took his car documents, laptop, cheque book and asked him to remain in touch.Bhutani did not leave his house for a few days. He said he was regularly in touch with the head constable and started recording all calls. The head constable told Bhutani over phone that each currency packet was short by around Rs 5,000. When Bhutani asked the police to return his laptop as it has entire business data, they asked him for Rs 10 lakh more, said officials, following which the complainant approached the Vigilance Bureau. Aggarwal said the policemen called Bhutani to an eatery, Vishal Dhaba, where he paid the head constable Rs 5 lakh. Accompanying officials caught Kumar red-handed. “A case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 384 (extortion ), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code has been registered against the police officials. Meanwhile, the investigation is in progress,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cop-booked-for-bribery-extortion-on-the-run/story-jhRKF8lJlFJUfRJ5pKdufO.html

In January 2020, the MCG had announced that the 45-year-old pool will be renovated for Rs 2 crore and redesigned according to international standards.The committee members asked Azad if the foot tracks of the adjoining Kamla Nehru Park that will be removed to facilitate the expansion of the swimming pool or if it would be constructed at a different location within the park. The committee also sought parking facility at the park.The committee also asked that the MCG clear the waste collected from around the park and the initiation of programmes at the park’s recently opened open-air theatre.Azad assured committee members she will take up all the matters with the MCG officials and direct them to address the issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/finance-committee-approves-five-developmental-works/story-HDX9F9tT6jkEDvtwlWrayK.html

Gurugram’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not capture the maximum temperature on Tuesday, but the nearest AWS at New Delhi’s Palam observatory showed a maximum temperature of 16.2 degrees on Tuesday.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, temperatures are set to increase over the next week, touching as much as a minimum of 9 degrees Celsius by January 4, and a maximum of 21 degrees Celsius. Dense to very dense fog with visibility under 50 metres is likely in some parts of northwest India on December 30 and New Year’s Eve, warned IMD officials. The IMD, in its impact-based bulletin released on Tuesday, said dense to very dense fog is likely over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, northwest Uttar Pradesh on December 30, 31 and January 1.Air quality in the city, meanwhile, remained in the poor category of the air quality index, with a reading of 224 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily AQI bulletin.

29-12-2020||Gurugram||DTCP prepares data on real estate in private colonies, to ease registration||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) is consolidating data on residential real estate developed in private licensed colonies that have been sold or are being developed by realtors across the state.The department has estimated that there are 350,000 such properties in Haryana and 81,000 such properties in Gurugram are under process. Apart from creating a centralised database, property owners whose details are fed into the system would not be required to obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) from the department for registration of property deed, required under section 7A of the Haryana Urban Development act. As per Act, an NOC has to be obtained from the enforcement wing of DTCP to register a plot of land less than two-kanals to ensure that the land would not be sub-divided to create smaller plots as part of unauthorised colonies.DTCP officials said that the depository will have data on details on licences, size of the property, land, location, ownership and history. “At present we are seeking details about residential projects that include flats and plots from developers. They have to submit this data in digital format for the department to upload,” said a senior DTCP official. Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram said that the work on creating the database is on full swing and they are holding regular meetings with the developers to expedite it. “This will create a very good knowledge database and help the home buyers in particular. After the residential segment, similar excercise would be carried out for commercial properties,” he said. DTCP officials also said that initially the focus would be to upload the data, which is available easily with the developers but later steps would be taken to ensure that information of properties sold even 30 years back are uploaded on the portal. “The depository will also help the home buyers to get information on actual size of the properties, the ownership history and bring transparency into the realty business as people will know what they are buying,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-prepares-data-on-real-estate-in-private-colonies-to-ease-registration/story-hUXg1g0CpM2OiI6helXIPL.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||GMDA brings out new bicycle scheme for city||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has proposed to set up a city-wide public bike sharing (PBS) system to ease commuter’s last-mile connectivity. The plan involves creating over 797 kilometres of dedicated bicycle lanes and deploying more than 8,000 bicycles in three phases by the year 2031. The project is estimated to cost ₹1,174.5 crore and will also involve strengthening pedestrian infrastructure in the city.The city’s Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan (CMMP), submitted on December 23, had said it had the potential to become a hub for non-motorised transport (NMT).A study by the Delhi School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), which forms the basis of the CMMP, however, had noted that Gurugram currently suffered from a lack of NMT facilities, including poor coverage of tracks, lack of parking facilities and encroachments. The plan added that the infrastructure made it unsafe for bicycles.SPA’s traffic surveys also revealed that over half of all trips undertaken in Gurugram were within a 5-km range.“This distance can easily be covered by cycles, but we are not seeing more people make the switch because streets are not designed to include them, and more importantly ensure their safety,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based mobility and transport planning expert. At present, bicycles serve as the preferred mode of transportation for just four percent of all daily trips made in the city. “We want to ensure that minimum 15% of the total trips are made using bicycles,” said a GMDA official in the mobility department.The 3-phase planUnder the PBS plan, the GMDA will connect transit nodes, commercial areas and residential areas through dedicated lanes in order to provide direct connectivity between various land uses and activity nodes.Phase-1, with a budget of ₹374 crore and a tentative deadline of 2023, will see retrofitting the core city network (Huda city centre, Rapid metro corridor and MG Road) for NMT infrastructure and provisioning of dedicated tracks on roads with a right of way (where GMDA can construct) of at least 45 m width. Phase 2, with ₹400 crore up to 2026, will have dedicated tracks in newly developed areas in and around Manesar. Phase 3, also with ₹400 crore and ending by 2031, will see NMT infrastructure beyond northern and southern peripheral roads.Roads more than 24 metres wide will have 2.5 m to 5 m-wide cycle tracks based on availability, while narrower roads will have a track with a minimum width of 2.1 m. A minimum requirement of 5,416 bicycles has been estimated for launch in the base year 2023 and later augmented to 8,139 and 12,209 docking stations.Earlier attemptsSimilar smaller pilot projects had failed to take off in recent years.Hindustan Times had reported in April last year that nearly 400 bicycles purchased by the municipal corporation of Gurugram in 2014 for Raahgiri (car-free days) in Gurugram were lying unused at the Sector 29 fire station.Similarly, In October 2017, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) built “open” cycle tracks on service lanes from Signature Towers to Rajiv Chowk to IFFCO Chowk without any fencing or physical demarcation. Officials simply painted a white line, along with few cycle symbols, on the road that sees heavy movement of motorised vehicles at high speeds, resulting in sparse usage of these tracks. Other dedicated cycle tracks, built along Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and St Thomas Marg as part of the Green Raahgiri initiative (in 2016), and Dundahera Chowk and Mahavir Chowk, have also found few takers.“This is largely because the infrastructure was developed in pockets. There is no interconnectivity or a city-wide network which would allow cyclists to travel beyond a certain area. That is what we are now aiming to create with the PBS proposal. We will initially be focusing on a catchment area of about 2kms radius around each of the Yellow Line and Rapid Metro stations in Gurugram in the first phase, and then expanding to other residential and commercial areas in the second and third phase,” said the GMDA official, preferring anonymity.GMDA chief executive officer VS Kundu could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-brings-out-new-bicycle-scheme-for-city/story-zxdKDKE38yqRMZTrqchrYK.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||Housing sale dropped 50% in Delhi-NCR this year: Realty report||Residential housing sale fell by over 50 percent in Delhi-NCR in 2020 compared to last year, said a report released by property consultant Anarock. Despite a lacklustre year for the realty sector, the last two months of the year did see some improvement and 2021 is expected to be better, said experts.As per the consultant, the situation was similar across the country. Housing sales in the top-seven realty markets saw sale of 138,350 units in 2020, almost 47 per cent lower than what was sold in 2019. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) saw the most sales of approximately 44,320 units, followed by Bengaluru with 24,910 units.In Delhi-NCR. 23,210 units were sold in 2020 compared to 46,920 units a year ago. Annually, the top-seven cities saw 1,27,970 new units launched in entire 2020, against 2,36,570 units in 2019 – reducing by 46 percent. NCR kept its new supply restricted to nearly 18,530 units in 2020 against 35,280 units in 2019 - a decrease of 47 percent in a year.The report further said that while residential real estate bottomed out in 2020 against the previous peak of 2014, there are strong revival signs in fourth quarter of 2020 - with home affordability being at its all-time best. Amidst varied offers and discounts, the top 7 cities saw robust sales of approx. 50,900 units in Q4 2020, rebounding to almost 86 percent of the corresponding period in 2019. Last year, the festive quarter saw total home sales of 59,160 units. MMR and Pune drove residential sales, with the two cities accounting for an over 53% total share, it added. “Data reveals that the festive quarter (Oct.-Dec. period) stood out among all four quarters in 2020, witnessing maximum sales due to multiple offers and discounts, low interest rates and limited-period stamp duty cuts in states such as Maharashtra. Buoyed by the rising sales, developers also saw it fit to unleash ample new supply into the market, leading to a 2 percent year on year jump in quarter four of 2020 against the same period in 2019,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock property consultants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/housing-sale-dropped-50-in-delhi-ncr-this-year-realty-report/story-1O1TFwiSkWGIODvxdm1lzK.html
29-12-2020||Gurugram||While pandemic makes history, other histories suffer||In a year defined by the pandemic, heritage conservation across Haryana also took a back seat causing a wide-ranging impact on research, and outreach and education efforts. The 68-day lockdown and subsequent Covid-19 restrictions slowed down conservation projects in Gurugram too as focus shifted towards containing the virus.Conservation work and educationBanani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the state directorate of archaeology and museums, said that timelines of various projects had been affected and on-ground conservation work were restricted. “Conservation work was not possible for the most part of the year due to physical distancing requirements. Be it site visits or material procurement, we faced a massive roadblock. A recalibration of the chain of heritage conservation activities needs to be undertaken in view of the pandemic,” said Bhattacharyya.She said that the impact of the initial lockdown months could still be felt. “Due to the restrictions on transport, raw materials could not be procured. The budget devoted to heritage conservation was also diverted towards containing the pandemic and affected our ability to purchase necessities,” said Bhattacharyya.Footfall across museums, libraries, and heritage structures dwindled as many patrons preferred to stay indoors. Neither the general public nor researchers could visit museums during the lockdown. “Since museums across the state were closed, heritage awareness programs were also affected. Exploration was not possible due to the combination of restrictions. The impact continues with lower footfall,” said Bhattacharyya.Monument protectionWithin Gurugram, no new monument could be taken for protection this year, said officials. Even monuments such as Qutab Khan Ki Masjid and Lal Gumbad tomb complex in Sohna, under protection since last year, did not see any progress with respect to conservation that the department had planned to undertake.“We were supposed to fence the perimeter around Qutub Khan ki Masjid and the Lal Gumbad, but that couldn’t take place due to concerns arising out of the pandemic. No one could visit the sites as frequently as it was required,” said Bhattacharyya.Besides the projects being helmed by the state department of archaeology and museums, heritage conservation projects under the district administration were also delayed. The deadline for the completion of the first phase of the restoration of John Hall near Civil Lines, scheduled for April this year, was delayed, officials helming the project said. Work is now expected to start only in January 2021, as per officials.The colonial structure, was built in 1925 in the memory of John Goble Brayne, the second son of FL Brayne, who was the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon in 1920. Over the years, it has occupied an important place in the administrative functioning of the city. In November 2019, the district administration had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a city-based firm as a funding partner for a three-year-long restoration project of the structure.Gaurav Singh, additional CEO and regional head of Haryana CSR Advisory Board (HCSRAB), Gurugram, said crucial clearances and approvals could not be taken earlier during the pandemic months. “Construction activity was shut during the lockdown period. The administration was completely devoted to managing Covid affairs. Necessary approvals could not be given to architects. All these factors led to delays in the project,” said Singh.He said that work was picking up gradually. “We have got the drawings of the proposed site made. They were placed before a committee, which has suggested some changes. The final changes will be approved soon and we can start work on the site,” said Singh.In November last year, the district administration had also shared plans of starting heritage walks across the district with the aim of promoting local history and culture. However, it couldn’t take off due to Covid-19 restrictions. “While various issues such as shortage of staff and budget often slow down the process of taking monuments under protection, the pandemic caused a massive setback this time. We, however, hope to expedite our efforts next year,” said Bhattacharyya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/while-pandemic-makes-history-other-histories-suffer/story-nVqmbiM3QmpUETGTYwjdxL.html
29-12-2020||Chandigarh||Fraudulent sale of property can now be cancelled by registration authority||In a decision aimed at protecting the rights of property owners, the Haryana government has amended the registration manual to ensure that persons with valid titles would not have to seek legal recourse to get deeds of the fraudulent sale cancelled. The property owners can continue to have the liberty to enjoy their property.Financial commissioner, revenue (FCR), Sanjeev Kaushal said a notification has been issued by the state government to amend the Haryana Registration Manual by insertion of paragraph 159-A.The FCR said the amendment will empower registration officers to accept and register cancellation of sale deeds registered fraudulently by a person who is not entitled to transfer of such property.“If a person has a right in the property and someone else transfers it without his consent, the right in that property will continue to subsist in genuine owner and the transfer will have no effect on such title,’’ he said.Section 23-A of the Registration Act, 1908, empowers the registration officer to re-register a document by ignoring the earlier registration. The amendment in the manual of rules done by the state government draws its power from Section 23-A.According to the amendment, if a document is registered at the instance of a person not duly empowered to present the same, any person claiming under the document, may, within four months from the date of knowledge that such document is invalid, present such document in such event.The registering officer, after following the same procedure contemplated under the Registration Act, 1908, can re-register the document, that is, cancellation deed, as if it has not been registered previously.If a document relating to transfer by way of sale, gift, mortgage, exchange, lease or otherwise, is registered for ‘Shamlat Deh’ land vested or deemed to have vested in the Panchayat Deh under the Punjab Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961, or in municipalities, including municipal corporations, under the Haryana Municipal Act, 1973, and the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, the block development panchayat officer, secretary, executive officer or commissioner, municipal corporation or district municipal commissioner, will get the cancellation deed registered after seeking approval of the deputy commissioner or other superior authority. This parameter will be applicable for ‘Shamlat Deh’ lands illegally partitioned and alienated in the past without getting the title adjudicated under the relevant statute by the competent authority or court, as applicable.In addition, there can be unimaginable number of circumstances when the executant himself, of his own volition, comes before the registering officer and desires to cancel the earlier document. In such cases, the registering officer could re-register (cancel the document, totally ignoring the earlier registration) under Section 23A of the Registration Act, 1908.The amendment also mentions that as per Schedule 1A, Article 17, as applicable to Haryana, of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, and the Indian Stamp (Haryana Amendment) Act, 2018, the cancellation deed, with a stamp fee of Rs 500, is recognised as a legal document in law and a transaction for transfer of immovable property is no exception.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fraudulent-sale-of-property-can-now-be-cancelled-by-registration-authority/story-4I0mgB03ZI1RcZJiw4edSL.html

This includes high yielding varieties developed by scientists and extended winter,” he added.Dr Narender Goyal of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Damla in Yamunanagar district, said the prevailing cold conditions in the northern states are very good for the wheat crop as it will help growth of the plant and boost germination, especially in the lateral varieties.As per agriculture experts, wheat production in country is increasing considerably over the past couple of years with the increase in minimum support price which was fixed at Rs 1,975 this year.“For the past few years, I was growing cauliflower and tomato, but this year, I have switched back to wheat cultivation as wheat has assured income and prices of vegetables keep fluctuating,” said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Dhanokheri village in Karnal.As per scientists, farmers have adopted high yielding varieties including HD-2967, HD-3086 and DBW-187 and this year and area under DBW 187 has reported a significant increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wheat-production-likely-to-reach-over-112mt/story-A2fFqRVK0DFhLVTfKirM1J.html

Earlier the alliance was planning to bag the post of chairperson in all ten districts. All the newly-elected DDC members took oath in their respective districts on Monday. On Tuesday, the NC and the PDP leaders held meetings with the newly-elected members at the party headquarters. However, the alliance leaders did not meet once after the results were declared to formulate the plan of getting its members elected as chairpersons and deputy chairpersons.“No date has been specified yet for the purpose but the alliance leaders will be meeting soon in a few days,” said People’s Conference spokesman Adnan Ashraf.PDP spokesman Tahir Sayeed said that the alliance leaders will meet and decide on the names once the dates for elections of chairman and deputy chairman for the councils will be announced. “From the past two days, the PDP president had been meeting elected DDC members and independent candidates who were part of the party earlier.”PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and NC president Farooq Abdullah who is also president of PAGD held a separate meeting with newly-elected DDC members in Srinagar. “This resounding success has come as a shock to those who wrote political obituaries of our party. In their arrogance they thought by not allowing me to the campaign, intimidating us, arresting our leaders PDP will not perform. Ours is not just a party but a movement which will never compromise on its ideals and core political philosophy of dialogue and reconciliation,” Mehbooba Mufti told the DDC members of the party at party headquarters.She said that for the restoration of lasting peace in J&K dialogue is pivotal. “We will not allow Kashmir to be a battleground but work relentlessly so that J&K acts as a bridge of peace between India and Pakistan. We will fight for our rights. We are not the ones who will raise white flags despite fatal blows being dealt with our economy and livelihoods.”Three to four independent DDC members had joined the Apni party in the past three days that has tilted the balance in favour of the party at least in the Shopian district. The party is also emerging as the front runner in Srinagar district to get the chairmanship and the party is eyeing Bandipore district where PAGD is short of a majority.On Monday, Altaf Bukhari said that newly-elected members especially independent DDC members are joining his party without any pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ddc-polls-in-j-k-pagd-yet-to-pick-chairpersons-deputies/story-WLqEGqHet2ixX62W6gff8K.html

Shirur Municipal Council (SMC), located around 70 kilometres from Pune has decided to implement an initiative to offer incentive of coupons for citizens, who can redeem them in restaurants and grocery shops for segregating plastic from waste and giving it to the local body separately. The project, currently on a pilot basis, will be launched in the entire town from New Year’s Day. Mahesh Rokade, chief executive officer of SMC and the scheme’s brain child said, “At present, the contractor is collecting and disposing off the garbage. We are appealing citizens to segregate dry and wet waste. However, very few people are following the instructions of the council. A maximum number of people are handing mixed garbage to the contractors. After that, the contractor segregates plastic, glasses, dry and wet garbage. It takes more time and effort to segregate and dispose the garbage. We have decided to give an incentive to citizens and encourage them to provide separate plastic waste to the contractor.” As per the Shirur Municipal Council (SMC) officials, the city has a total of one lakh population and it generates around 13 tonnes of garbage of which around 2 tonnes is plastic waste. According to Rokade, the SMC has set up two points in the city where residents can hand over the segregates waster to the contractor.“The contractor will weigh the plastic waste; decide the rate as per quality of plastic items and give one coupon mentioning the amount with his stamp. In this scheme, there are four traders showing positive response and ready to provide a cash discount on the purchase of items. Satguru restaurant, Sai darbar pan shop and Uttejan Kirana shop has have given a green signal to the council to redeem the cash coupons,” Rokade said. Suryakant Desarda, owner of Uttejan trading said, “It is social work. I am happy to be a part of this good scheme. It will help keep our city clean and neat as well as it will encourage people to do good things.” The decision was taken after Shirur faced a problem with disposal of plastic which is largely being used by public despite the state government’s ban in 2018. Shyamkant Warpe, owner of Satguru restaurant said, “When CEO Mahesh Rokade explained the scheme, I immediately said yes. We will provide snacks or food to people who will give us coupons. It will help to collect plastic waste which is lying across the city.” Wasim Sayyed, contractor of solid waste management said, “It is win-win situation for the administration, contractor, citizens and shopkeepers. At present, we are facing a problem to collect segregated garbage. We are utilizing more time and money on collection and segregation of waste. This scheme will encourage people to segregate waste such as plastic tins, wrappers, boxes, glass. We will pay them in the form of coupons to people who give us segregated waste. We have-not decided coupon cash back period at present. We will decide later.” The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to check the feasibility of the program and examine whether such an initiative can be implemented in Pune. On this scheme, Dr. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner of PMC said, “It is a good initiative. We will take information and study it. It will help us to encourage people to give us segregated plastic waste.” Laxmi Narayan, co-founder of Swach, India’s first autonomous cooperative of waste pickers said, “It is good from the point of view of consumers. However, it will not help buyers who will pay money in the form of coupons. They need high-quality plastic. It is okay for small areas. There will be less impact if we compare the problem of plastic waste.” ============================= BOX Where can Pune start? Plastic products have become an integral part of our daily life encouraging its production. 70 per cent of this production is converted to waste. -200 material recovery centres, to reduce, reuse, recycle and recover 170 to 180 metric tonnes of plastic waste generated per day -PET bottle crushing machines at 20 locations with high pedestrian footfalls||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/discount-coupons-to-segregate-plastic-waste-a-hit-in-shirur/story-LXQptigVIPFQKSX9tH7fPP.html

The sambar (rusa unicolor) is a large deer native to the Indian Subcontinent, southern China and Southeast Asia. The incident was reported to the forest department, who in turn contacted Wildlife SOS and RESQ Charitable Trust for assistance in conducting a safe rescue and relocation of the animal. A three-member team, along with a team of forest officers, rushed to the location. Meanwhile, a village rescue team, who have been trained in conflict mitigation, were on site to assist with the setting up safety nets along the periphery of the factory. Wildlife SOS veterinary officer Dr Nikhil Bangar immobilised the sambar, who had not sustained any injures, using a tranquilliser from a safe distance. The sambar is a vulnerable species under the IUCN Red Data List. This species is also protected under Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Jayaramegowda R, deputy conservator of forests, Junnar, said, “Sambar deer reside in the neighbouring forests and they often wander into farmlands to forage. The rescue was well coordinated and we are glad the animal was unhurt and was safely returned to its natural habitat.” “It took us several hours to carry out the rescue as we did not want to ambush the distressed animal. After waiting for it to settle down, we cautiously approached the sambar and used a safety net to carefully transfer it to the transport vehicle,” said Nikhil Bangar, Wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-officials-rescue-male-sambar-from-chakan-factory-in-midc/story-ZWtHT5wVVMsHZP6DlJL4LO.html
29-12-2020||City||PMC officers refuse to board Swargate-Hadapsar BRTS corridor||PUNE Officers are mum on the closed Bus rapid transit (BRTS) corridor running from Swargate to Hadapsar. Despite demand from the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) to open the BRTS route, work has not begun. The Hadapsar-Swargate-Katraj stretch is India’s first pilot BRTS route, erected four years ago. Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director, said, “We demanded the PMC restart the corridor between Hadapsar and Swargate which has been completely damaged. The corridor is not functional for the last many years.” Former mayor and NCP leader Prashant Jagtap blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) for no fund allocation for the BRTS corridor. Jagtap said, “ It was the responsibility of the ruling party to kick-start the project. The central government is also neglecting the BRTS. The central government had given almost Rs1,000 crore in funds to erecting the BRTS in Pune.” Officers from the PMC are not ready to speak on the issue. On condition of anonymity, one PMC official said that officebearers should take a decision on kick- starting the BRTS route. “It was demolished by an elected member but no action had been taken. If the funds get allocated, it would take at least one year to erect infrastructure on this stretch,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-officers-refuse-to-board-swargate-hadapsar-brts-corridor/story-vHAZWuX0RTr1ttnkBDPrZO.html
29-12-2020||City||UK variant more transmissible, but not more severe: experts||PUNE City scientists have opined that, so far, the information on the new variant of Covid-19 that has emerged from the UK, shows clearly that it spreads about 56% faster, which might lead to more positives and more deaths in absolute numbers. As six new cases of the new strain emerge in the country, experts say that although there have been thousands of mutations of the virus, like any other, mutations in the spike protein are worrisome. Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, who currently resides in the city, was the former head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and joined the prestigious Dr CG Pandit National chair at ICMR, explained that the much talked about new strain widely in circulation in the UK currently, is not a more severe one in terms of symptoms, but transmits faster, which could mean more number of deaths and more hospitalisations. He said, “Currently what is essential to understand is that the initial reports coming in from UK epidemiologists is that the transmission rate due to the new strain increases by 56%, which means that earlier if we reported 100 Covid-19 cases then 156 new cases would come out perhaps due to this new mutation. Does it result in severe diseases? It does not result in severe diseases. So as a country it means that if the new strain becomes widely circulated, the number of cases might increase and the number of people who could be hospitalised would also increase. The absolute number of deaths might also go up if this mutated virus tends to prevail in India. It does not have any implication on the vaccine as of now. Whatever data we have also says that the same neutralising antibodies which would be produced against the current strain in circulation perhaps will work similarly against the new strain also. These are preliminary findings.” Further elaborating on why this particular mutation has led to widespread discussion. Dr Aurnab Ghose, associate professor, Neurobiology department, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER) said, “Spike protein is the virus protein on the surface which will bind to the proteins in our cells. This is also the point where you want to interfere with neutralising antibodies to where their major functions would be to prevent interaction between spike proteins and our proteins. If the mutations now make the binding of the virus to our proteins much more stronger then it might infect our cells much more strongly. Secondly, if it changes the efficacy of the neutralising antibodies. Anything that changes the rate at which the virus enters our body is always worrisome.” However, Dr Gangakhedkar also said that ensuring Covid-19 protocols are in place would prevent a second wave. He added, “We need to remember one thing. With lockdown we ensured that the outbreak occurs late and we got an additional five months. Now the first wave is on a decline and we do not want the second wave. This does not depend on the virus or its mutation, but on the Covid-appropriate behaviour by people. The same hygiene protocols need to be followed. Mutations are so common because this is an RNA virus. It is just that earlier this information was only with the scientific community and now it is coming out in the public. The symptoms of the new virus are also the same. The fear is that it might go to the younger population who will then spread it to the more vulnerable population. About reinfection, too, due to the new strain, there are random cases of reinfections reported in the UK which should not be considered a trend as the numbers are so small.” This particular mutation has led to discussion among the scientific community. Dr Gangakhedkar said, “This mutation is worrisome for us as scientists because the mutation has also brought in 23 different mutations with it. The virus has mutated multiple times before, but not in the spike protein. Spike protein is the one we are using in the vaccine and it is the one which is highly immunogenic. This leads to our immune system to fight against the virus, so if that changes then we tend to get worried as scientists. There are only two major mutations that we are worried about, one in Denmark, the mink related one; and the UK one; both of which were reported in the spike protein region. It only means for scientists that we have to keep a watch on how this virus will evolve in countries by starting genomic surveillance, which the government has started.” He further emphasised that contact tracing and isolation is the only way to prevent the spread of this new strain, if it has not already spread in the population. This is even if did enter before, since the strain has been in the UK since September. He added, “Now that the number is low the government can efficiently contact trace every person who came in contact with these six cases who have tested positive for the new strain when the numbers increase then contact tracing and isolation would become difficult. The government is taking all required steps right from the ban on UK flights. The good thing about this virus is its short life span, so if we can isolate that one person for about 14 days then there is no need to worry. Even after the vaccine comes out we have to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour for quite some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uk-variant-more-transmissible-but-not-more-severe-experts/story-X1fQz1qXT1jW6JzZDm57gP.html

I pity the ED as it used to have some reputation earlier,” the Sena Rajya Sabha member told reporters here.“Now nobody respects these organizations. It is tragic to see these organizations being ordered around,” he said.The ED wants to question Varsha Raut with regard to a loan of about Rs 55 lakh she had taken from the wife of a person who is accused in the PMC Bank alleged fraud case.Saying that the ED generally takes up cases where the minimum amount involved is Rs 100 crore, Raut said, “Looks like there is no other issue before the country so such an old case has been brought up.“The loan and the reason for taking it have been mentioned in my Rajya Sabha affidavits. Whatever information is being fed (to media), is already mentioned in the affidavits,” the Sena leader said.He was aware of the “politics” being played through the ED, he said, adding that a response to the notice will be given soon.“Even if someone is using the law to settle a personal grudge, I respect the law of the land and consider it supreme,” said the Sena leader.Varsha Raut on Tuesday did not appear before the ED.Official sources said she asked for a new date of January 5 for deposing before the central probe agency in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sanjay-raut-slams-ed-says-harassing-those-against-bjp-its-national-duty/story-LjuhtJpV7GWviJzRqm7SwI.html
29-12-2020||Dehradun||‘Uttarakhand aims to certify 31% of agricultural land as organic in 2021’: Minister||The Uttarakhand government has a target to certify 31% of the total agricultural land as organic in 2021 to expand the area under organic farming, said state agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal on Tuesday in Dehradun. He informed about the same while addressing a gathering at the seminar on State Focus Paper 2021-22 by the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) with a theme of collectivisation of agricultural produce for enhancing farmers’ income. “At present, the total area certified for organic farming is about 23 per cent, which would be increased to 31 per cent by the end of 2021. This is a significant move because today, 40 per cent of the country’s total organic farming is being done in Uttarakhand which is also the first state in the country to have an act on organic farming,” said Uniyal. Enabling SHGs to sell their products directly to tourists On the steps taken by the government to improve agriculture, especially in the hilly areas of the state, he said, “The agriculture department is working on mechanisms to enable the self-help groups (SHG)s to sell their products directly to the tourists and to develop zone-based farming”. Also read: Scientists quell Covid-19 variant fears, say staying cautious sufficient“There are about 6,000 SHGs working in the state producing various products. We are working to develop a system in which they would be able to sell their products directly to a large number of tourists visiting the state every year without the involvement of middlemen,” said Uniyal. “We are also working to develop zone-based farming under which an area growing the same crop would be termed as a zone which would help in selling and marketing the produce in a much better way,” he said. Some people giving communal colour to farmers protest During the event, the agriculture minister also spoke on the ongoing farmers protest and said that “some people are giving a communal colour to it.” “It is very unfortunate that some people are giving communal colour to the protest of farmers. Religion and politics should always be kept separate. But some people for their vested interests are doing so which should be stopped,” said Uniyal, adding that “The farm laws are beneficial for the farmers and the Centre is ready to talk to the protesting farmers.” Some irregularities in giving farm loans in banks Uniyal, later while speaking on giving credit to the farmers under various initiatives of NABARD, raised the issue of “irregularities in banks while giving loans to farmers.” “It has come to our notice that there have been some incidents in which the bank staffers provided farm loan to landless people just for their own vested interests. While on the other hand, the deserving farmers had to move pillar to post for a loan. This should be looked into with strict action against those involved from the banks,” said Uniyal.

29-12-2020||Kolkata||Don’t like derogatory remarks being made against Visva-Bharati’: Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) charging it for spreading a divisive agenda in the state ahead of the assembly elections scheduled to be held in 2021. Banerjee, during her address at a public meeting in Bolpur, also lashed out at the BJP and said that she disliked the comments made against Visva-Bharati, the university established by Rabindranath Tagore in Birbhum’s Santiniketan.“Conspiracies are being hatched to destroy the culture of Bengal. Stop politics of violence and divisive politics,” the West Bengal chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. “I don’t like the derogatory remarks being made against Visva-Bharati,” she also said.Also Read: Amartya Sen urges people of West Bengal to reject communalismA war of words has broken out between the BJP and Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) since Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the university which was founded by Nobel laureate Tagore in 1921. The Trinamool Congress also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his speech at the virtual event to commemorate the centenary celebrations of the university.Banerjee also indirectly criticised Visva-Bharati chancellor after reports surfaced that the university has written to the West Bengal government alleging dozens of land parcels owned by the university were wrongfully recorded in the name of private parties, including Nobel laureate and noted economist Amartya Sen.“I congratulate those who are associated with this century-old institution. The legacy of Visva-Bharati is not bound by time. Those who are running it now will be here for a few days only. Their days are numbered,” the chief minister was quoted as saying during a press conference last week.The TMC also pointed out that there were some inaccuracies in the speech given by the prime minister during the centenary celebrations. “I could not understand why there were repeated references to Gujarat when he (Modi) was talking about Tagore. And, some of the things he said were factually wrong. For example, Satyendranath Tagore was not the poet’s eldest brother. Also, it was not from Gujarati women alone that Satyendranath’s wife Gyanadanandini Devi learnt to wear the traditional saree in a different way. She was inspired by Parsi women as well but the Prime Minister will not name Parsees for the same reasons that stop him from mentioning Dalits,” West Bengal minister Bratya Basu said last week.Also Read: West Bengal: Suvendu Adhikari targets Mamata Banerjee for cancelling Nandigram rallyThe heated debates between the TMC and the BJP are likely to increase as the state heads towards the elections.

Other villagers are in the process of relocation.The officials said a reason for the slow pace of relocation was the less attractive rehabilitation package.Also Read: Congress’ Rajasthan saga continues, Pilot maintains distance from Jaipur on Foundation DayBhagwan Sahay Gurjar of Dabli village said people have realised that they will have to leave the tiger reserve and have opted for the land exchange scheme of the government. “Also, our children will get schooling facility at Sariska Tiger Reserve and later employment there,” said Heera Lal of Kanpura, another villager who has opted for the package.Chief conservator of forests of Sariska Tiger Reserve RN Meena said that due to the government allotting a budget of Rs3.28 crore, the task of relocation of the villagers has picked up the pace.“The impact their moving out has already started showing as tiger sighting has increased,” he said.He said although the area of Sariska Tiger Reserve is around 1,213sqkm, tigers were not sighted easily earlier. “Now, we can spot tigers every day or on alternate days,” he said.That is not all as the reserve management has spotted four new tiger cubs in the recent months, especially from areas where villagers to used to live, taking their number to 22, including six cubs.Sariska had lost all its tigers in 2005 because of poaching. After eight years due to the efforts of then prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, tigers were relocated from Ranthambore National Park in the 2008 and the process continued till the year 2013. For over five years, the numbers did not increase. However, records show that the past year has been good as tiger numbers have improved because of better habitat and creation of inviolate conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sariska-tiger-reserve-revival-as-villagers-relocate-conditions-improve/story-rnKYYzyQJHjeceZRcJaGgM.html

29-12-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Suvendu Adhikari targets Mamata Banerjee for cancelling Nandigram rally||Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) drew flak from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday for cancelling the chief minister’s scheduled rally at Nandigram in East Midnapore district on January 7. Nandigram, where a three-year-long violent struggle against acquisition of farm land for industry played a key role in helping Banerjee oust the Left Front government in 2011, was the assembly constituency of former minister Suvendu Adhikari till he resigned from the state assembly and joined the BJP in presence of union home minister Amit Shah on December 19. “Those who talked of holding a rally in Nandigram have suddenly vanished. But I keep my word. I will hold a rally on January 8 and there will be more than 100,000 people,” Adhikari said at a rally in Nandigram on Tuesday. Also Read: Bengal assembly polls: Abhishek and Suvendu trade barbs as poll battle heats upAdhikari also took potshots at Abhishek Banerjee, the chief minister’s nephew, calling him a tolabaaj (extortionist). The reason TMC leaders cited on Monday for cancelling Banerjee’s January 7 rally was that Akhil Giri, the legislator from the district’s Ramnagar constituency and the event’s organiser, had tested positive for Covid-19. On November 10, Adhikari threw his first veiled challenge at the TMC while addressing a meeting in Nandigram. Till then, the differences between Adhikari and the TMC had not become public. Adhikari, who hails from East Midnapore and whose father and older brother represent two Lok Sabha seats in the district for the TMC, has claimed in his recent speeches that he played the crucial role in the Nandigram movement from the ground since it began in 2007 while TMC leaders based in Kolkata used to visit the disturbed zone only for media coverage. Engaged in an uninterrupted exchange of allegations and rhetoric since Adhikari’s defection, TMC and BJP leaders on Monday made the rally’s cancellation an issue. “We cannot hold the rally without Giri. A rally will be held later,” said panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee. “Giri is the legislator from Ramnagar. What has he got to do with Nandigram? He cannot even assemble 500 people. The chief minister should stop milking Nandigram for political gains,” quipped Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, referring to the decade-old land movement at a press conference. Significantly, Adhikari himself threw a challenge at the chief minister when he addressed a rally at Kanthi, his hometown, on December 24, a day after he was branded a “traitor” at a TMC roadshow in the same town. The TMC rally, which was addressed by Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and urban development minister Firhad Hakim, was also organised by Giri. “They (TMC) claim Mamata Banerjee will contest the coming assembly polls alone in the state and she has put in place the next generation of leadership. If that is true then why is she sending ministers to Midnapore? She will address a rally at Nandigram on January 7. I know what she is going to say. I will hold a rally in Nandigram the very next day and give her a befitting reply,” Adhikari said on December 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-suvendu-adhikari-targets-mamata-banerjee-for-cancelling-nandigram-rally/story-xEPwMEUdERGbbWn7rSP1CO.html
29-12-2020||Pune||For two weeks, Pune reports single digit Covid deaths a day||Pune city has reported single digit Covid-related deaths each day for the past two weeks as reported by the state health department. The city’s case fatality rate as of Sunday was zero per cent as no deaths were reported in 24 hours by the state health department in the city. The number of deaths due to the infection has come down drastically lately as the spread of the infection has slowed down.As per the report by the state health department, Pune city reported single digit deaths, the lowest being zero on Sunday, December 27, 2020. The highest was a total of eight deaths on December 22. For the second day in a row, Pune city reported zero deaths due to the infection. On most days, the city reported only one death due to Covid-19 infection. Pune district is also reporting a fall in the number of deaths reported every day. Doctors explain the fall in the numbers as the spread of the infection has gone down. Dr RP Karyakarte, head of the microbiology department at SGH and BJ Medical College, said, “The virus will never try to kill its host immediately as with the host the virus will also die. Like any virus, Covid-19 virus would also stay as long as possible in the host’s body and do maximum damage. Therefore, only that mutated strain of the virus will be transmitted which would be mild in terms of effect so that the host can spread it to a maximum number of people. Eventually, the mortality will come down unless there is severe mutation in the virus.” Even though the number of Covid-19 cases has been going down, Pune district continues to report the highest number of active cases in the district which was above 14,000 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment for the infection while the number of total cases in the city went up to 1,90,338 as of Monday with a total of 4,399 deaths reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/for-two-weeks-pune-reports-single-digit-covid-deaths-a-day/story-aFEzYF8hoMtuxZavVz1IiI.html

29-12-2020||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: It’s in the air||I’ve signed up for Safar’s email alerts. After enjoying clean air throughout the lockdowns, it’s dismaying to see the air quality index signalling orange, meaning ‘poor’ air quality in Pune. While northern India has it much worse, air pollution in Pune is a growing and serious health threat.Apart from gaseous pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide, the air we breathe has particles that cause breathing difficulties. These PM 2.5 or particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in size, are so tiny that they pass through the lungs to enter the bloodstream and harm the heart and brain. New studies show that air pollution worsens the health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.Air quality index apps and websites like Safar tell you what to do to avoid exposure when air quality is poor. The immediate thing is to reduce outdoor and heavy activity like exercise, jogging, travel, and morning walks. After months of suspended animation now we have to give in to these suspended particles!It does not have to be this way.Some years ago, the Japanese contributed the slogan “Build back better” to the UN’s efforts to recover from disasters and prepare for the future. How we adapt and recover from the effects of Covid-19 should help us be better prepared for such shocks.The good news is that the health impacts of air pollution are largely preventable. To understand this, we should go to the root of the problem. In Pune, as the PMC’s annual Environment Status Report tells us, tailpipe emissions from petrol/ diesel vehicles are among the largest causes of air pollution. Waste burning especially in the winters for warmth and to heat water is another.Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has prepared the Pune Air Action Plan. A public review should be done so that it sets actions to bring pollution down to safe levels. And be backed with political will, community support, and some humanitarian care.Good affordable transport helps in economic recovery as people can travel to work. For cleaner, healthier, safer travel, we need to ask our corporators and municipal officials, and work with them, for excellent footpaths, road crossings, safe, comfortable cycling facilities, bus services, and shared-rickshaw shuttles for local and last mile connectivity. Electric vehicles can help, but an electric car is still a car, occupying road and parking space pushing out shared rickshaws, buses, cycle lanes and footpaths. We may just end up stuck in ‘clean congestion’.As a cyclist, I find it ironic that bikers and car drivers honk at me to “get out of the way”. I feel my cycling T-shirt should say “road occupy karne wale, tera muh kala”. But, calling each other names does not really help. We need to rid ourselves of themistaken belief that wider roads and more flyovers for motorized vehicles will make our city better. Instead, can we try to build back better, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, ward by ward? Can our civic conversations be about making our streets safer and air cleaner for children, and elderly and everyone? It’s a choice we can make.On an ending note, it’s winter and it’s the season for giving – why not give out blankets, mufflers, caps to the hard-working people who watch over the neighbourhood at night. Dr Priyadarshini Karve, Samuchit Enviro Tech and Sharmila Deo, Parisar, are experimenting with the help of housing societies to provide cleaner stoves that use twigs and leaves to provide warmth for security guards at night while minimising emissions. I’d love to join. Roasting sweet potatoes could add some tasty fun to the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-it-s-in-the-air/story-JMmUXVx9bRIISyylNwFtpL.html

The party slammed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the posters, calling ED a puppet of the BJP. One such poster said the Shiv Sena respects ED even if ED supports BJP; the poster also had a large photo of Sanjay Raut. The posters also questioned whether ED had set up a cabin in BJP office.

29-12-2020||Kolkata||Amartya Sen urges people of West Bengal to reject communalism||Political parties sure have good reasons to pursue individual goals, but rejection of communalism ought to be a shared value without which “we shall not be worthy heirs of Tagore and Netaji”, Nobel laureate Amarta Sen has said.He said the Left and other secular parties in West Bengal have no less commitment than the ruling TMC to ensuring that communalism does not rear its ugly head in the state.“Secular parties can differ in their detailed programmes, but the importance of rejecting communalism must surely be a strongly shared value. The Left parties should have no less a commitment to that than the TMC (in keeping the state secular),” Sen told PTI in an email interview.The BJP, which has often been subjected to strong criticism by the celebrated economist over its policies, meanwhile, claimed the TMC’s communal side has long been exposed.Exuding confidence that the people of the state will reject non-secular forces, the 87-year-old Harvard professor said, “Bengal had in the past greatly suffered due to communalism.” “Each party may have a good reason to pursue its own goals without harming the overarching objective of keeping Bengal secular and non-communal. First things should surely come first. Otherwise, we shall not be worthy heirs of Tagore and Netaji,” he said.With Bengal’s icons occupying centre stage in political discourse in the run up to the assembly elections, Sen said one must remember that all luminaries “have wanted and argued” for unity.“Rabindranath Tagore, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda, all wanted and argued for a united Bengali culture, and there is no room in their social objective for trying to excite one community against another.“That is the Bengali culture that we have come to admire and support. Kazi Nazrul Islam is as big a Bengali leader as the others. Bengal has greatly suffered from communalism in the past and has learned to reject it firmly,” the Nobel winner, a known critic of the BJP, said.Asked about the recent row over his family allegedly being in “illegal” possession of land at Visva Bharati, the noted economist rejected the charge and said the vice chancellor of the hallowed institution has issued “false statements” to the media.“I am baffled by the way the Visva-Bharati VC is doing these very odd things, such as making false statements to the media about me allegedly occupying their land but never writing to me about returning any land to them. I am not sure if the VC is what can I say? - (is) intellectually well- coordinated,” he said.Asked if he feels that it was an attempt to malign him, the professor said, “Maybe, as you say, he (VC) is trying to malign me, but it would be hard to be sure given the lack of cogency in his actions.” Sen, however, declined to hold the BJP responsible for the row, as was suggested by many quarters.“Certainly I am critical of any political party that inflames communal and divisive sentiments particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Certainly, Bidyut Chakravarty, the Visva- Bharati VC, gives evidence of following the commands of the BJP. But it is a big jump from there to conclude firmly that the BJP is responsible for these false accusations,” he said.A controversy erupted last week when media reported that the central university has written to the West Bengal government alleging dozens of land parcels owned by it were wrongfully recorded in the name of private parties, including Sen.The Nobel laureate had said that the university land on which his house stands is on a long-term lease, which is nowhere near its expiry.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had offered an apology to Sen on behalf of the state and also wrote to him, asking him to consider her a “sister and friend” in his war against “intolerance and totalitarianism”.Reacting sharply to Sen’s assertions apparently targeting the saffron camp, BJP’s national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said his claims were bereft of truth as the “the communal side of the TMC government was exposed when immersion of Durga idols was stopped due to Muharram”.“People in Bengal have already voted in favour of the BJP in the last Lok Sabha polls. They will vote for us again in the upcoming assembly polls,” he asserted.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal assembly are due in April-May next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amartya-sen-urges-people-of-west-bengal-to-reject-communalism/story-3b14NiPzM9uKVdWXx0QumO.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Raghav Chadha urges CPCB to intervene as Yamuna pollution rises||Haryana has not stopped discharging industrial pollutants into the Yamuna despite repeated reminders, Delhi Jal Board Vice-Chairman Raghav Chadha said on Tuesday as he urged the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to take immediate remedial measures.Ammonia concentration in the river at the Wazirabad barrage has increased to 7 ppm (parts per million) against the permissible limit of 0.8 ppm which is likely to affect the water supply, he said.“Discharge of industrial pollutants in Yamuna through Rohtak X-Regulator and DD6 has not stopped despite repeated reminders to the Haryana govt,” Chadha said in a tweet.“Such irresponsible behaviour of Haryana govt adversely impacting the water supply in Delhi must be dealt with sternly,” he added.Chadha urged the CPCB and the Upper Yamuna River Board to take immediate cognisance of the “nonchalant” attitude of the Haryana government and take remedial measures.The DJB on Monday said water supply from Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants would remain affected till the ammonia level in the river reduces to a treatable limit. These plants supply drinking water to Central, North, West and South Delhi.The CPCB had earlier this month raised concerns over pollution and frothing in the river and asked Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ensure effective sewage treatment.According to a CPCB statement, the monitoring of 22 drains in Delhi has found 14 drains “untapped and discharging sewage”.In the past, the CPCB had observed froth formation and increase in ammonia levels in the Yamuna because of discharge of untreated sewage, non-operation of existing STPs, improper functioning of effluent treatment plants installed by the industries and common effluent treatment plants located on the banks of the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raghav-chadha-urges-cpcb-to-intervene-as-yamuna-pollution-rises/story-lKZee4R35ZfSEJ32sfeDaN.html

29-12-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: A dismal year for India, but even worse for Pune||The year-ender is a period when people normally take a review of things planned during the year. The last week of the year is the first instalment of this weekly column that also takes a review of how 2020 has been for Pune. For the city and citizens, the year brought disease and death that many had never seen before. But, it also brought disaster and dearth – on a scale Pune had not seen for decades. The limitations of Pune’s health capacity were exposed by the pandemic, that claimed over 4,400 lives and affected around 1.90 lakh people. Early September, Pune district earned the distinction of reporting the highest number of progressive positive and active Covid-19 cases nationally, surpassing India’s national capital, which has blocked the slot for long. The shortage of beds, unavailability of ambulances, fleecing by hospitals through overcharging of bills, and an overall absence of coordination among government machinery, were some of the highlights patients and their relatives, helplessly watched. The woes of Punekars were not just limited to health. In the penultimate week of 2020, the Pune Metro project completed four years of its foundation laying event that saw the Prime Minister in attendance. The hope offered by leaders was to start the operations by 2021. In reality, only 50 per cent of the work has been completed as the year ends. If operations on the priority stretch –Sant Tukaram nagar to Phugewadi -have been deferred twice due to the incomplete work; the mass exodus of migrant labours during May-June, has only delayed the project that promises to be a panacea for Pune city in absence of robust mass transport. For a city with a population of 50 lakh (including that of Pimpri-Chinchwad) commuting through daily traffic jams, inferior air quality and poor roads, are daily woes no less than a punishment. All this is aggravated when the city streets flood every now and then, even with a few centimetres of rain; something Puneites meekly watch – and move on. Moving a little further – in the first week of December – the long cherished dream of Puneites suffered another setback as the government reconsidered it decision and explored another site for proposed airport at Purandar. When it all looked certain that the project is coming up at Purandar amid notification of land acquisition also issued by the government, the resistance of farmers led by local MLA Sanjay Jagtap forced the powers-that-be to look for alternate land in the same tehsil. This is now the fourth site the government is exploring for the project, which many believe, may not be a reality in their lifetime. The joke now is – for a generation which first heard of the proposed international airport in Pune two decades ago - it will always remain “proposed”. Initially, it was in the Chakan industrial belt, that the government had zeroed-in on land to develop the airport. Opposition of local farmers and entry of politicians, forced the state conduct a feasibility survey at two other sites, including the Khed Special Economic Zone. However, this option also failed to take off, because 74 per cent of this land is under the ownership of the Kalyani Group, which refused to give it up. Fed up of hurdles, the then Devendra Fadnavis government shifted the site to Purandar and obtained clearance from key authorities like Defence, Civil Aviation and Environment. When the project looked to take off, a bunch of farmers protested, putting the proposal in cold storage once again, till the current Maha Vikas Aghadi explored yet another site. This wasn’t the last woe of the year for Pune. The three ring roads, including two passing from the outer parts of the city and one inner elevated road known as the High Capacity Mass Transport (HCMTR), are only on papers. There’s no sign they will kick start even in 2021. 2021 also offers a glimmer of optimism – that a vaccine is just days away and Pune can be an early beneficiary given that it is being manufactured in the city itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-a-dismal-year-for-india-but-even-worse-for-pune/story-VcOiEJiMELewQi4NqGKpMJ.html

First, the demerger will take place before September 2021.” Bahel said his predecessor, Raman Singh, in 2017 wrote to the Centre opposing the disinvestment citing Maoist insurgency in the state. “Singh had said that tribes have given land for the public sector unit. Even the legal advisor of the central government had suggested no for the sale.”Dharamlal Kaushik, the opposition leader in the House, said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will also raise the issue with Centre.Also Read: 50 panchayat body representatives resign over 2 BSF camps in ChhattisgarhState minister Ravindra Choubey said the land was acquired in Nagarnar for the plant and therefore people of the area had given their consent for it with a hope that it will generate indirect and direct employment. “But after knowing that the plant will be privatised, there is anger among local tribals,” he said.An official said around 2,000 people are to be employed in the plant.BJP lawmaker Ajay Chandrakar said the idea of disinvestment was introduced during the Congress’s rule at the Centre. He added during the disinvestment of Bharat Aluminium Company Limited in Korba district, then Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi had also proposed to the Centre that the state government will buy it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhattisgarh-ready-to-buy-nagarnar-steel-plant-in-bastar-if-disinvested/story-NONG3IDSZ7ZXKFIpc7m7qI.html

29-12-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh ordinance on interfaith marriages to be promulgated today||The Madhya Pradesh government will promulgate an ordinance to regulate interfaith marriages in the state on Tuesday after a Cabinet discussion, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Monday. Singh did not elaborate on the provisions of the ordinance.The ordinance is being introduced as the state assembly’s winter session was postponed and the government could not table the Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Bill on such marriages.The three-day session scheduled to be held from Monday was postponed due to the Covid-19 situation after an all-party meeting.Also Read: Uttar Pradesh: Allahabad HC reunites interfaith couple in EtahThe state Cabinet approved the bill on Saturday. The bill provides for up to 10 years in jail for anyone found guilty of “forcing women, minors, and people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to undergo religious conversion”. Under this legislation, the re-conversion to the ancestral religion will not be treated as conversion, said the draft law. It defines ancestral religion as the religion of the father of the person at the time of his birth.As per the bill, the marriages solemnised in violation of its provisions will be deemed null and void. The proposed legislation will replace the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act. The provisions of the ordinance are likely to be the same.Home minister Narottam Mishra said the bill is different from the Uttar Pradesh government’s ordinance promulgated on the same issue on November 25. Unlike the Madhya Pradesh bill, the Uttar Pradesh ordinance does not provide for parental property rights to children of an interfaith marriage, monthly maintenance, and a Rs 50,000 fine for an inter-religion union without permission of the district magistrate. In Uttar Pradesh, the fine is Rs 25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-ordinance-on-interfaith-marriages-to-be-promulgated-today/story-nN2mLa5mKShtWmzD1UiroI.html

We have seen the last rainy seasons when the entire town under MMC jurisdiction faced hardships due to heavy waterlogging. Not only this, the soaring price of the land would add to our woes. The agricultural land would be reduced due to urbanisation,” said Sunil Kumar Gupta, who led a meeting of residents against the move.Also Read: Bihar cabinet approves 111 new urban bodies, 5 more municipal corporationsSome residents have welcomed the move.

29-12-2020||Delhi||Teenager kills grandmother with hammer for not giving him money||Angry with his grandmother for not giving him money to return to his friends, a teenager in east Delhi’s Shahdara killed the 73-year-old woman with a hammer on Saturday night, left her body on a chair and then fled after stealing a few thousand rupees from her, the police said. Amit Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said that the teenager was nabbed on Sunday evening, but it is yet to be ascertained with documents whether or not he is an adult. The suspect lived with his parents on the second floor of their building in Shahdara. His father runs a general store in the neighborhood. His grandmother had rented out the first floor and lived alone on the ground floor. “She would receive pension as well as the rent money,” said the DCP. The teenager, meanwhile, was a college student and had borrowed thousands of rupees from his friend, but wouldn’t return much of it, the officer said. On Saturday, he was under pressure from some friends to return the money. “He quietly slid out of his flat that night. His parents thought he had gone out with his friends for the night, the way he usually did,” the officer said.But instead of going out with his friends, he walked into his grandmother’s flat and asked her to spare some money from her pension and rent amount. “When the elderly woman refused to give him any money, he picked up a hammer and struck her head of the woman who was sitting on a chair at that moment,” said the DCP. The woman died on the chair itself. Her grandson then locked her flat from the outside, picked up his scooter and left. That night, when the woman’s son tried to check on her, he found the house locked from the outside and thought she had gone to visit her son who lived in a different building in the same neighborhood. “The next morning, the teenager’s father called his brother to ask about their mother. When he got to know that she had never visited her other son, the lock outside her house was broken and her body found on the chair,” the DCP said. The police were subsequently involved. “We began by probing the role of an outsider. But the woman’s flat was locked from the outside. And the other door was locked from the inside. That made it clear that it was a friendly entry into the victim’s house,” said the officer. Since the teenager was the one missing, he was the prime suspect. “On Sunday evening, we caught him and recovered the hammer used in the murder. We have also traced his friend who he gave the money he stole from his grandmother,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teenager-kills-grandmother-with-hammer-for-not-giving-him-money/story-zLgxF8W7mZGK5Z93DYoVwK.html

Bhiwadi, Baghpat, Gurugram, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and others in NW India also recorded “poor” air quality. Air quality has improved compared to last week mainly due to moderate winds measuring 8 to 10 kmph across the cities, according to ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system.Under the influence of a western disturbance, there was snowfall over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

29-12-2020||City||Protesting farmers gherao Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal’s cavalcade in Fatehgarh Sahib||Protesting farmers on Monday gheraoed the cavalcade of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal at the Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib where he had gone to pay obeisance to commemorate the martyrdom of two younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh master. The security personnel had a tough time controlling the crowd that raised slogans against Sukhbir and his party besides showing him black flags over the farm laws passed by central government.  The police secured an alternative route for Badal’s motorcade to leave the area. Later, SAD district (rural) president Jagdeep Cheema tried to pacify the protesters who manhandled him. “We have come from Delhi and are boycotting political parties for not standing with the farmers over the agriculture laws,” said one of the protesters.Earlier, addressing a press conference, Sukhbir said the BJP betrayed its alliance partners by coming up with anti-farmer laws.“The people of Punjab will give a befitting reply to it. The Akali Dal is with the farmers of the state and will fight of their rights. More than 50 farmers have lost their lives during the ongoing protest at the Delhi borders,” he said.SAD had quit the BJP-led ruling alliance at the Centre in protest against the farm laws and has extended support to the agitating farmers. But the farmers alleged that the SAD and its erstwhile ally BJP have cheated the farmers of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-farmers-gherao-akali-dal-chief-sukhbir-badal-s-cavalcade-in-fatehgarh-sahib/story-jfyV43REO0zrhwtSSVnMBK.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The sound of music||Every morning, they are woken up by the music — and this is true on this chilly morning too, while pop star Honey Singh’s dated Punjabi hit is being played. Rag picker Salman and his wife Ruhana Begum are listening in. So is beggar Chand with his cousin Bablu. So is a woman, a bit farther, while washing some clothes in a bucket. And so are the kids playing around.They all live here, on this vast plaza located near central Delhi’s Subhash Park, with little camps of plastic or canvas by way of homes.But Muhammed Sameer, the owner of the “music deck”, doesn’t live here. “I have a house nearby, but I like coming here in the morning to play the deck music and listen to it with my friends.”Most of his friend here on the plaza work as beggars or rag pickers, he says. This morning, some of them have gathered with Mr Sameer about a little fire concocted from a pile of wood. In his 20s, Mr Sameer has a more professional use of his music system. He uses it in the chhole bhathure stall where he plays popular film songs. Intermittently, Mr Sameer’s recorded voice interjects through the songs, inviting passersby to try his dishes. In the summer, he sells rose sherbet.“Earlier, the speaker ran on a battery that would discharge within one hour only.” The outraged tone of his voice implies that it certainly didn’t do. So, he adds serenely, he has fitted the music system with a better battery, and “if I want, I now can listen to the music for two days nonstop.”The music system obviously commands a position of authority and reverence in the plaza. It is placed on a low table, slightly elevated from the plaza’s floor, looking like a stage. “I always sit beside the deck,” says Mr Sameer, pointing at the canopied bed on which he is sitting. He then explains that most people of the plaza have no mobile, nor TV, and that this morning music is their main source of entertainment while getting ready for the day. Pappu Bhai, a beggar sitting nearby, nods.Now Mr Sameer plays a song from an old Rajesh Khanna film. A lady who was warming her hands over a pot of boiling milk some distance away turns to look towards the “deck”, fascinated. While a majority of dwellers in the plaza are still in the process of getting up—the sun is barely rising—the music is so loud and pervasive that it appears to be part of the very texture of the air.Soon afterwards, Mr Sameer will leave to set up his stall and the plaza will be stripped of its music. Until tomorrow morning, that is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-sound-of-music/story-8y0aR8bLbwgtvgIeuTubIO.html
29-12-2020||City||Calendar row looms on Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 400th birth anniversary celebrations with different dates||The long-standing controversy over the Sikh calendar is all set to loom over ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 400th birth anniversary celebrations scheduled next year. While the event is being planned on a large scale by the Punjab government and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the Sikh community is divided over the issue of calendar. Whereas a section follows the original Nanakshahi calendar, the others observe the days as per its modified version. As per the original version, April 18 is the date of the birth anniversary while it varies every year as per the modified version which is basically existing Bikrami calendar. According to it, the anniversary falls on May 1, with a gap of 13 days between the two dates. Last year, the gap was only of five days.As the Akal Takht, the SGPC and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) recognise the modified version, the 400th birth anniversary will be celebrated on May 1 in major historic gurdwaras. On the other hand, most of the gurdwara managements abroad, including the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC), will mark the event as the date is as per the original version which they term a symbol of the distinct identity of the Sikh religion.Over this controversy, the SGPC and DSGMC always pass the ball in the court of the Takht, this highest temporal seat of Sikhism. However, Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh is silent over the issue. Former Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar Giani Kewal Singh, convener of Panthic Talmel Sangathan, an umbrella body of small Sikh outfits, said, “The SGPC president should come forward to re-implement the original Nanakshahi calendar as she took stand in its support during her previous tenure.” A similar controversy erupted during the celebrations of the 351st birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10nth Sikh master, in 2017, when Gurpurb, as per Bikrami or modified Nanakshahi calendar, fell on December 25, coinciding with the sombre occasion of martyrdom anniversaries of his family members. Thus an appeal was made by the Sikh bodies for extending the date of the birth anniversary celebrations to January 5, the date fixed for Gurpurb in the original version.The original version was introduced by the SGPC in 2003. However, SGPC rolled it back under pressure from Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa-led Sant Samaj, which was in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) during the gurdwara committee polls, in 2010. Citing amendments, the original version was replaced with the new one which was modified as per the Bikrami calendar, but its nomenclature ‘Nanaksahi calendar’ was not changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/calendar-controversy-looms-on-guru-tegh-bahadur-s-400th-birth-anniversary-celebrations-with-different-dates/story-5IhH15qZFggluJHjMejNEL.html
29-12-2020||City||Coronavirus vaccination dry run starts in Punjab with registration of 300 beneficiaries||The two-day dry run of the Covid-19 vaccination rollout began in Punjab’s Ludhiana and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts on Monday with the successful registration of 300 beneficiaries on the central government’s Co-WIN application, the online portal for monitoring the real-time vaccine delivery. There was no vaccine involved in the mock drill process, which only aimed at checking the feasibility of the programme involving monitoring through the app. Besides Punjab, the dry run started in Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat keeping in view their geographical locations. “Seven locations in Ludhiana and five in SBS Nagar were selected in Punjab for the dry run due to the spread of the virus in these districts. On the first day, 25 beneficiaries were called to each site to make data entry on the app,” said Punjab Covid-19 Punjab nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. The data of 300 beneficiaries was entered on the portal with all of them receiving messages on their mobile phones about the successful registration. “They will visit their assigned sites for online verification on Tuesday. Once they get shots, their details will be uploaded on the app to avoid any miss or repetition,” the nodal officer said. “The dry run exercise is to assess the entire vaccination process as how it will reach the end-user through our cold chains. Through it, we will identify the challenges and shortcomings,” he added. Besides, the state health department has claimed its readiness for vaccine transportation and storage. “We can store over 1 crore doses in our state-level vaccine store in Chandigarh and three regional stores in Amritsar, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur. Besides, the state has 729 cold chain points, 1,165 ice-lined refrigerators and 1,079 deep freezers to ensure the proper storage of the doses. Also, we are equipped with vaccine vans to transport the doses in each district safely”, Dr Bhaskar added. The state government is expecting to receive shots initially for nearly 1.5 lakh health workers (government as well as private) who have got registered for getting the vaccine in the first phase. About 4,000 vaccinators are being trained for the vaccine rollout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vaccination-dry-run-starts-in-punjab-with-registration-of-300-beneficiaries/story-L1b5agIhL4RAaBO7JCAawK.html
29-12-2020||City||23-year-old Delhi man lynched over business rivalry; 2 held||A 23-year-old man was beaten to death with iron rods by two assailants in Ankur Vihar area of Loni in Ghaziabad on Monday morning, police said.Two different video clips of the incident that were widely shared on social media shows passersby recording the attack on their phones as the assailants beat the victim mercilessly. The cops said the attackers, who were arrested later in the evening, held a grudge that the flower shop of the victim outside a temple in Loni was doing well while their business had slowed down.Police said the victim, Ajay Kumar, and the assailants, Govind Sharma, 21, and his friend, Amit Kumar, 22, lived in southeast Delhi’s Sarita Vihar. Superintendent of Police (Rural) Iraj Raja said Govind planned the murder with his friend. “Govind had been selling flowers outside the Loni temple for the past several years. However, his business was affected after the Ajay opened his shop there eight months ago,” said SP Raja while explaining the motive behind the crime.Police said the incident took place when Ajay boarded an auto to return home after closing his shop. The suspects pulled him out and started beating him with iron rods, investigators said. “They kept on hitting him for about 3-4 minutes. Passersby recorded videos of the incident but did not help the victim. Soon after getting the information, the police rushed to the spot and took the victim to a hospital where he succumbed to critical head injuries,” the SP said.Based on police complaint by the victim’s family on Monday, an FIR was registered against the two suspects under IPC section 302 (murder) with 34 (common intention). Police said that they will also add section 120b (criminal conspiracy) as the murder was planned. “We have also recovered the two iron rods from the suspects,” SP Raja said.Meanwhile, another video allegedly related to victim’s brother, Sanjay Kumar, also surfaced on the social media on Monday.

The door-to-door survey was conducted by the state school education department for tracking down such school children in December to bring them back into the mainstream education.Ludhiana district topped the chart with the highest number of dropouts at 395, followed by Jalandhar (239), Bathinda (190), Fatehgarh Sahib (105) and Hoshiarpur (103). The teachers who conducted the survey said most of these children did not take admission in the current academic session to continue their elementary education to join the workforce along with their parents as they come from marginalised sections or belong to migrant families. A senior education department official said, “The aim of this survey was to find out of school children up to 14 years. The government needs to set up boarding schools with hostels and food facilities for such children to get their studies resumed.” Amarjeet Singh, district education officer (elementary education), Patiala, said, “Most of the dropouts live in slums. Therefore, we visited such places and motivated the children and their parents to bring them back to schools. Also, teachers even took their class in the slum areas to check their learning level.”“However, the number of out-of-school children in Punjab declined this time against 3,205 last year as we have already admitted such children at schools,” he added. When contacted, director public instructions (DPI, elementary education) Lalit Kishore Ghai said, “The director of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) is the right person to speak on the matter.”Also, SCERT director Jagtar Singh refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-1-200-children-drop-out-of-government-primary-schools-in-punjab-this-year/story-RmQMkA1IbpcXwyxQOaM39I.html

The new station Chikhloli, which is expected to be completed in 2023, will initially operate as a halt station for long-distance trains, though it may later be converted to a suburban station. According to railway authorities, after examining the passenger count, the railways will decide on making the new station a suburban local train station. “Initially stations are introduced as halt stations [for technical halts or halts for long-distance trains], but when the passenger demand increases, the station is operated as a suburban railway station,” said a senior CR official. The construction work of Chikhloli railway station, which is expected to cost Rs10,947 crore, will be undertaken by the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC). The project is a part of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP)-3A. Land assessment and joint measurement surveys for the new station were conducted recently by the railway and civic authorities. Chikhloli’s construction will be carried out under the construction work of the third and fourth railway lines between Kalyan and Badlapur stations. Passenger associations have welcomed the move and have asked the railway authorities to introduce the station as a fully functional suburban station. “There has been a demand for the station for over 10 years. The station will reduce overcrowding from Badlapur as the distance between Badlapur and Ambernath is long. The station should not be introduced as a halt station but must directly be opened as a suburban railway station,” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-halt-station-between-ambernath-badlapur-gets-railway-ministry-nod/story-5eP4CD5F4ALuFSe29JySlK.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Bring in the New Year at home; seniors, kids stay indoors: Maharashtra government||Amid the fear of a new strain of the virus causing Covid-19, the state government on Monday issued an advisory urging citizens to stay at home on December 31 and January 1. Prohibiting cultural and religious programmes, the government has asked people to refrain from bursting firecrackers and avoid crowding at public places like Gateway of India and chowpatties. The guidelines issued by the home department said: “Though there will be no curfew on December 31 throughout the day, people are advised not to venture out of their houses and celebrate the New Year at home. They are expected not to gather at sea shores, gardens and on roads in large numbers. They should also maintain social distancing and wear masks at public places.” “In the backdrop of pandemic, citizens above 60 years and children below 10 years should refrain from stepping out of their houses. No religious and cultural programmes and rallies can be organised. On the first day of the year, many people tend to visit religious places where they are expected to maintain social distancing and follow Covid-19 appropriate protocols,” added the circular. The state has advised citizens to take care of their health and follow Covid-19 protocol while ringing in the New Year. The guidelines have clarified that other directives issued by the local and state authorities will continue to be in place. The government has already imposed a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 till January 5 in the jurisdiction of 27 municipal corporations and empowered the district collectors to impose similar restrictions if they deem fit to contain the Covid-19 spread. This has effectively imposed restrictions on New Year parties and celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bring-in-the-new-year-at-home-seniors-kids-stay-indoors-maharashtra-government/story-Hl4VFHou1zTBeetXekQkPN.html

The BMC has got only around 137 volunteers till now, even as two Mumbai hospitals, Sir JJ Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital) are going to conduct trails on 2,000 volunteers.Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital said, “We are taking help from all possible resources to get maximum volunteers for the trial. We are also taking help from corporators for getting in more volunteers.”Joshi added, “There is nothing like there is no response or low response. Citizens are coming ahead, but not all are eligible to undergo a trial. There are certain tests we conduct before the ethics committee approves them as a volunteer. Till now, around 137 volunteers already have been shortlisted.”The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in October 2020, had selected two hospitals – the Sion hospital and Sir JJ Hospital for the pan-Indian clinical trial of Covaxin, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.According to ICMR, 2,000 volunteers in the age group of 18-60 have to be a part of the trial. By December 31, the hospitals were supposed to complete the selection process. However, with insufficient numbers, the process of shortlisting is going to take more time, civic officials said.Apart from Sion hospital that has around 137 volunteers, JJ hospital has also shortlisted around 370 volunteers for the same. Other two civic-run hospitals namely Nair and KEM Hospitals are also conducting stage three trial runs for Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Serum Institute of India along with Oxford University.Meanwhile, Nehal Shah a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator from Matunga said, “The BMC should optimise the use of its resources to get volunteers for vaccine trials. It should give targets to corporators from each ward to get a given number of volunteers for vaccine trials. The civic body should also use social media widely to ensure proper publicity of the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-turns-to-corporators-for-help-in-finding-volunteers-for-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story-arPLsEIh6LuacMkufL64eI.html

29-12-2020||Mumbai||Seaplane operations may resume from December 30, aircraft to arrive in Ahmedabad on Tuesday||The much-talked-about seaplane service that was halted since November 26 due to technical reasons is expected to resume operations from December 30.In a statement shared with HT, SpiceJet on December 18 had announced that it would resume its seaplane operations between Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati Riverfront and Kevadia’s Statue of Unity from December 27, with two daily flights on the route. However, in a subsequent statement, the airline postponed the date of resumption of services.HT has learnt that the aircraft is yet to arrive at Ahmedabad from the Maldives, where it had to be flown for maintenance work. Top ministry sources said that the seaplane landed in Kochi around 11.30am on Monday and is expected to land in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. “The aircraft that landed in Kochi on Monday morning will continue its halt overnight and only take off for Goa on Tuesday morning. It has received landing permissions and it will arrive in Goa at 11.30am for refueling. It will then depart for Ahemdabad around 2.30pm,” said the source.SpiceJet spokesperson confirmed that the aircraft landed in the country. “SpiceJet’s seaplane has arrived in India today (Monday) morning,” the spokesperson said. The airlines, in a statement issued to a publication in Ahmedabad, insisted that the date of resumption of seaplane services would be December 30. “As clarified through a subsequent press statement, we had clearly stated that our seaplane operations would resume on December 30, for which bookings are already open,” said the spokesperson on Monday. The seaplane service commenced on October 31 after being inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was planned to boost tourism to the Statue of Unity. However, the services were shut since November 26 due to maintenance issues.The aircraft – a 19-seater Twin Otter 300 – was sent back to the Maldives as it is the property of a Maldivian company, said sources in the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA). It is the first seaplane to operate under the government’s Udey Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) project. The service is being operated by Spice Shuttle, a fully-owned subsidiary of SpiceJet, which wet-leased the seaplane from Maldives Island Aviation Services (MIAS). MIAS is owned by the government of Maldives, making both the aircraft and its crew the property of a foreign entity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seaplane-operations-may-resume-from-december-30-aircraft-to-arrive-in-ahmedabad-on-tuesday/story-D5vZ8dVrypTIQ4p3q9duBM.html
29-12-2020||City||Mumbai Congress vows to go solo in civic body polls||Days after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, comprising his Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), will contest all the civic polls unitedly, the Mumbai unit of the Congress vowed to contest the upcoming municipal corporation independently. The party also reiterated its disapproval of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s criticism of the Congress leadership and call for a need of change in the leadership of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). On the occasion of the party’s foundation day, newly appointed Mumbai Congress chief Ashok Jagtap and working president Charan Singh Sapra took charge at a function organised at YB Chavan centre on Monday. The function was attended by party’s state in-charge HB Patil, Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, state ministers Ashok Chavan, Aslam Shaikh and Varsha Gaikwad as well as city unit’s newly appointed manifesto committee chief Suresh Shetty, campaign committee chief Arif Naseem Khan, coordination committee chief Amarjeet Singh Manhas and other senior leaders. Most of the Mumbai leaders have thrusted upon contesting all the 227 wards in the city independently, without joining hands with Sena and NCP. Jagtap said the party needs to fight solo to give justice to the aspirations of its workers by giving them an opportunity to contest the civic polls. “They are the foot soldiers in Assembly and Parliament elections and ensure that party candidate wins. If they aspire to contest the civic polls, it would be wrong to limit the aspiration. I would request the party leadership to allow us to contest in all wards,” he said. Thorat said it is the time to give BMC a Congress mayor. “The party has capacity to elect its mayor in Mumbai if the elections are fought unitedly. We will leave no stone unturned to achieve this,” he said. Echoing his sentiment, Khan said, “All the party workers in the city want to fight the BMC polls independently and elect our mayor in Mumbai.” The leaders of the party’s Mumbai unit are wary that they may get fewer seats to contest on if the polls are fought in alliance with Sena and NCP. “Also, our traditional vote banks of Muslim and north Indian voters will deviate if we join hands with Sena. It will indirectly benefit the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party),” said a leader from the city unit. Patil, too, assured the unit that the decision to go solo or with allies will be taken only after taking local leaders into confidence. “There will be no final decision taken by the central leadership without consulting the leadership of the Mumbai unit,” he said. He also took a dig at Raut for attacking the Congress leadership. “Leaders or parties that are not part of UPA have no business to speak about the alliance,” he said. Raut had recently raised questions over the leadership of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and had also expressed the need for the change of guard in UPA leadership. Chavan said the state government exists only because of the Congress support, while Khan claimed that his party joined hands with Sena and NCP to keep BJP away from power, and it will operate on the basis of common minimum programme (CMP). “It is the responsibility of all the coalition partners to run the government and it should be based only on CMP. It was decided while forming the government that ruling parties will not weaken each other. Despite this, our corporators are poached [referring to NCP’s induction of 18 Congress corporators in Bhiwandi]. Now it is the responsibility of CM to ensure that ruling parties do not indulge in poaching each other’s leaders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-congress-vows-to-go-solo-in-civic-body-polls/story-dA9HoBJKays1kuC6gCWgyH.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid -19 case count now 1,922,048; active cases reduce to below 3%||With fewer cases recorded over the last few weeks, the number of active cases has reduced to 57,159 with their percentage against total cases dipping to 2.97%.Maharashtra recorded 2,498 cases on Monday, pushing the case count to 19,22,048.With 50 new casualties, the state toll reached 49,305. Of them, 22 occurred in the last 48 hours, five in the last week and the rest 23 deaths are from the period before last week, the health officials said.Maharashtra has been reporting fewer than 5,000 cases for the last 24 days. A comparison with the last two months shows an improvement as the average per day cases of this month has come down to below 4,000. In the last 28 days, it has reduced to 3,950 cases from 4,781 cases in November and 9,909 cases in October in the corresponding period.Health experts insisted upon ramping up surveillance in the wake of a mutant of Covid-19 discovered in the United Kingdom and many other countries, which is believed to be 70% more transmissible than the original strain.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state said that there is no need to panic but the surveillance needs to be ramped up as the virus is mutating but there are no major genome changes found in the state till date. He also said there is no need to change treatment protocol as of now.“The virus is changing. It is doing this even in Maharashtra but fortunately whatever changes took place have not resulted in a major change in virulence or its transmission capacity. We have not found any major genome changes in the virus till date but no one can guarantee that it won’t happen in the coming days,” Dr Salunkhe said.“Even in the UK, where the new variant was discovered, no change in treatment protocol has been made. Thus, there is no need to change it here even if it is detected. In the UK it was found in September and has already travelled to many countries in the last four months which means it is likely to be detected in the state hence we need to be very cautious,” he added.The public health expert also expressed his unhappiness over weak health infrastructure and facilities across the state and the country. “The major shortcoming we are facing is the inadequate number of virological laboratories having facilities for genome studies. It is because health infrastructure is being neglected by the central government in all these years. Only five laboratories in the country have the facility of genome study whereas we should have developed two to three virological study laboratories in every state. The public health capacity including viral diagnostic capacity in public as well as the private sector is too less and we feel ashamed about it,” Dr Salunkhe commented.Showing a decline, Mumbai has clocked 557 cases on Monday, taking the case count to 2,91,471. Of them, active cases are 8,862. There were 12 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 11,088.Nagpur city contributed the second-highest number of infections in the daily caseload and recorded 290 cases. Their tally reached 110,491.Pune city recorded 154 cases, third-highest number of cases. Its case count stood at 1,90,338.The state has completed a total 1,25,43,772 Covid tests with 41,218 tests conducted on Monday. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 15.32%.The number of recovered patients reached 18,14,449 with 4,501 recorded in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate remains at 94.4%.The state government has already imposed a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 till January 5 in all the major cities (municipal corporation areas) across the state, effectively meaning restrictions on new year parties and functions considering a mutation of Sar-CoV-2, which is believed to spread faster than all its previous strains. It has also empowered the district collectors to impose night curfew to contain the Covid-19 spread, with prior approval from the state government.It has urged the citizens to stay at home while welcoming the new year on December 31 and January 1 and avoid crowding at public places especially at seashores, gardens and on roads. It has also started keeping all the travellers coming from Europe, Middle-East and South Africa in compulsory paid institutional quarantine for seven days as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-case-count-now-1-922-048-active-cases-reduce-to-below-3/story-IIuJ67g1jiekMsyo5bWNIO.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Teachers’ body approaches UGC for postponement of first-year degree college exams in Mumbai||After repeated attempts to draw the attention of the University of Mumbai (MU) authorities over exam dates, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) has now approached the University Grants Commission (UGC) in the matter. This move follows a series of letters written to the MU vice-chancellor to point out that first-year degree college exams have been scheduled without complying with the mandatory 90-day working rule of the UGC.“Due to Covid-19, admissions to the first-year batches were delayed and most colleges managed to start regular lectures only by October, despite the university failing to share an official date of commencement of classes for the batch. As a result, online lectures for first-year batches started in a non-uniform manner,” reads the letter submitted by BUCTU. It further states that this has left the first-year batch in a tough spot as many are struggling to cope up with the study portion in order to be prepared for the upcoming exams.As per MU’s November-18 circular, affiliated colleges are supposed to hold online exams for the current batches of undergraduate courses by December, while post-graduate exams should be conducted in January 2021. However, in the first week of December, the varsity released a clarification that all affiliated colleges should complete examinations for their first-year batches by January 9, 2021.Despite repeated letters to the university vice-chancellor, BUCTU received no response in this matter. “Keeping in mind the welfare of students, we request the UGC to direct MU to confirm with the stipulated 90-day teaching rule, and postpone exams until the last week of January 2021,” added the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-body-approaches-ugc-for-postponement-of-first-year-degree-college-exams-in-mumbai/story-Tjeo0jEoeVbOqaZIN4cD0O.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Statements under section 67 of NDPS Act not admissible as evidence: Bombay HC grants bail to two||The Bombay high court (HC) recently granted bail to two persons who were booked and arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in April 2018 based on statements by two other accused, who later retracted their statements. The court held that statements recorded under section 67 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 were not admissible and as the bank statements and call records did not confirm the role of the two in the syndicate as alleged by the NCB. The court hence granted them bail. Section 67 of the NDPS Act states that any authorised officer may, during any inquiry, may call for information from any person to satisfy himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of the Act.The single bench of justice Prakash D Naik, while hearing bail applications of Shashikant Prabhu and Harshad Gawde, was informed by advocates Rajendra Shahasane and Vinay Nair that the evidence recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act was not admissible in the court as evidence. They further submitted that the statements under the said section had been retracted by the other co-accused, and as there was no corroborative evidence, the two should be granted bail. The advocates submitted that the bail applications of their clients had been rejected by the special court in December and October 2018, respectively.The first three accused had been arrested in March 2018 by the NCB, and recovery of 4kg of hashish was made from them. While recording the statements of the three accused under section 67 of the NDPS Act, the names of the current applicants came up. While Prabhu was arrested for selling drugs, Gawde was arrested for running the business of buying, selling and procuring drugs on behalf of accused No 2, who owned a restaurant.However, the special public prosecutor for NCB opposed the applications and submitted that the offences were of a serious nature and the applicants were part of the drug syndicate that trafficked hashish and other drugs since 2017. He also submitted that there was evidence in the form of bank transactions between Gawde and accused No 2, and call records between Prabhu and accused No 2.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “Prima facie, there is nothing to indicate that the amount was relating to sale or procurement of the drug. No other incriminating evidence to show involvement of the applicants is on record. There is no recovery from the applicants.” The court also referred to the October 2020 Supreme Court judgement in the Tofan Singh vs state of Tamil Nadu case wherein the Apex court had held that the statement under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be relied upon. “In any case, there is no corroborative evidence to substantiate the averment in the statements of the accused. Hence, the embargo under section 37 of the NDPS Act would not cause impediment for granting bail to the applicants,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/statements-under-section-67-of-ndps-act-not-admissible-as-evidence-bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-two/story-lAk0VcHKgosCGEnHyriVXJ.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two arrested for setting Charkop temple on fire||The Charkop police have arrested two persons including a minor in connection with the Sunday morning fire at Saibaba Temple at Charkop, that resulted in the death of three persons.Police said the fire was not caused due to electric short-circuit, but it was mischief committed by the two arrested accused. Police said the accused sprinkled petrol and set the temple on fire, to kill two of the three deceased, who were sleeping in the temple - Subhash Khode and Yuvraj Pawar- to settle their scores with them.Bhavesh Chandurkar, 20, is one of the arrested accused, whereas the other one is a minor. Both live in the vicinity of the Saibaba Temple at Bandar Pakhadi road, in Charkop, Kandivli (West). Chandurkar works as an office boy.The incident took place around 4.14am when the victims Subhash Khode, 26, Yuvraj Pawar, 27, and Mannu Radheshyam Gupta, 26, were asleep. The fire spread so fast that they could not escape and received 90 to 95% burn injuries. All of them were rushed to Shatabdi Hospital. Khode and Pawar died at the hospital, while Gupta was later shifted to Sion hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, on Sunday afternoon, said an officer.Locals informed the fire brigade. Police said Khode and Pawar took shelter often in the temple, while Gupta slept at the temple for the first time, the officer added.After questioning several people in the area, the Charkop police learnt that deceased Khode and Pawar had fought with Chandurkar two days ago. Khode and Pawar had assaulted him. Both had beaten Chandurkar, two years ago, added the officer.Fed up with the regular harassment by Khode and Pawar, Chandurkar decided to teach them a lesson and saw them sleeping in the temple. He removed five litres of petrol from his vehicle and poured inside the temple on Sunday, and set it afire. He also sustained burn injury on his hand while setting the temple on fire, said additional commissioner of police, Dilip Sawant of the North region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-two-arrested-for-setting-charkop-temple-on-fire/story-qVUNI4qw4iJ6ENlNKWe08L.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||FYJC special list: Cut-offs for arts, science seats across Mumbai see a dip||Cut-offs for the science and arts streams saw a substantial dip in the special merit list for junior college admissions which was declared on Monday evening. Prominent colleges saw a dip of 16 and 11 percentage points for the two streams respectively, as compared to that of the third merit list which came out on December 15. Of the 68,178 students who had applied for seats under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in the special round, 59,322 were allotted colleges on Monday. As per the rules laid down by the state education department, every student who wanted to participate in the round had to give consent through the portal which would ensure that students who have secured admissions elsewhere are not allotted seats again. Principals said that this might be a key reason for the dip in cut-offs, especially in the science stream. “Many students who had secured admissions in diploma programmes or other courses might not have withdrawn from the admission portal, thus leading to higher cut-offs in the three rounds. With the fresh consent, these names would have dropped leading to a dip in the cut-offs,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college. Especially in minority colleges, the cut-offs went down across streams, with vacant seats under the minority quota being surrendered for other students. As per the data shared by the education department, after the third admission round, nearly 62,000 seats were vacant in the three quotas, with the highest being from the minority quota – nearly 42,000. Overall, nearly 1.85 lakh seats remained vacant after admissions to the round concluded. With the state government’s decision to extend the economically weaker section (EWS) quota to students from the Maratha community, such students were allowed to change their quota preference from socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) to EWS or general category for the special round.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-special-list-cut-offs-for-arts-science-seats-across-mumbai-see-a-dip/story-DNL6Mnnz79zgG2vDHjQplM.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Putting Mumbai’s 30 dangerous spots on the road to safety||The 30 most deadly junctions and roads in the city that have claimed 501 lives and caused serious injuries to 1,172 people in the past three years are now being studied in detail by the authorities, and efforts are being made to make commute at these spots safer.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), traffic police and Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS) along with World Resources Institute (WRI) are preparing designs to change infrastructure of these junctions and roads and alter the black spots to reduce the fatal accidents and road mishaps to a great extent.According to a report released by Bloomberg and the traffic police, between 2017 and 2019, pedestrians in the 30-59 age group were the most vulnerable accident victims, followed by motorcyclists. In 2019, pedestrians and motorcyclists accounted for 90% of the total deaths and 83% of the injuries owing to accidents at these 30 junctions, the report stated.The traffic police also released a report on road crash deaths for for January-August 2020. During this period, the city recorded 172 fatalities, of which 47% victims were pedestrians.Experts analysing the black spots said Amar Mahal junction in Ghatkopar was found to be the most dangerous intersection where had 25 people died and 40 others were seriously injured between 2017 and 2019. Majority of the victims were pedestrians. The second highest number of accidents took place at Godrej Junction in Vikhroli, which had claimed the lives of 18 people.Minute study of the data revealed that of the 15 junctions and 15 road stretches spread over 184 kilometres, the maximum (210) deaths took place on roads and junctions in zone 4 (areas covering Sion, Matunga, Wadala TT, Antop Hill, Bhoiwada and Kalachowkie). Zone 10 (stretch from Kherwadi in Bandra East to Andheri East, mostly covering the Western Express Highway) witnessed the second highest number of deaths, as 18 pedestrians died in 2019. The accidents on these two stretches claimed the lives of 183 motorcyclists and 45 four-wheeler drivers and passengers. “The efforts we’ve taken over the years have led to a decline in accidents and deaths by 27% in 2019 as compared to 2015. We’ll continue working to bringing down the loss of lives by studying the pattern of road crashes and suggesting ways to curb them,” said Yashasvi Yadav, joint commissioner of police (traffic).Dr Sara Whitehead, public health and preventive medicine consultant of Vital Strategies, a partner of BIGRS, said, “The continuous decrease in road traffic deaths from 2015 to 2019 is an impressive testament to the hard work done by city officials and the police in Mumbai. But too many Mumbaiites are still at a risk of injury or death merely while walking on the streets. The data from reports point the way to where and how to prevent these needless mishaps.”Experts said more number of deaths and injuries took place on weekdays during peak hours — between 7pm and 9pm. On weekends, the must number of accidents took place between 10pm and 11pm. “Due to high density of traffic in peak hours, the risk of accidents increases,” said Yadav. After the data was released, WRI conducted a road safety inspection of these sites to understand the risks associated with every road. “Based on our assessment, we have suggested detailed design recommendations that can improve safety,” said Dhaval Ashar, senior manager of WRI. Some recommendations include improving pedestrian accessibility at the locations, streamlining traffic movement, traffic calming and improving pedestrian visibility. Ashar said if the authorities design the streets and intersections it will not only improve safety, but also help vehicular efficiency as each pedestrian and motorist will have a well-defined space to traverse. Pointing out an example, he said in 2016, WRI in partnership with BMC and the traffic police had carried out safety improvement on the HP petrol pump intersection in Bandra. The trial was carried out using temporary installations such as traffic barricades, cones and paint. The objective was to monitor operations during the trial period to make the case for permanent implementation. The larger objective was to create a scale-up plan for all high-risk intersections by documenting typical challenges and developing a toolkit with a template of standard solutions.Following the example set by HP junction, the experts are now working out plans to improve the deadly 30 spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/putting-mumbai-s-30-dangerous-spots-on-the-road-to-safety/story-3fGf6YqBeqctJP2XluY2hI.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 measures lead to dip in seasonal ailments in Mumbai||Cases of monsoon-related illnesses and swine flu have dropped by over 50% this year compared to 2019, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Officials attribute the dip to restricted movement during the lockdown and preventive measures taken by the civic body.As per data from the BMC, a total of 8,020 people have been diagnosed with malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis and swine flu this year (till December 20) in the city. In 2019, there were 15,328 cases of these seasonal ailments. Till December 20, the city has recorded 237 cases of leptospirosis; 128 cases of dengue; 2,478 cases of gastroenteritis; and 259 cases of hepatitis. Last year, there were 281 cases of leptospirosis; 920 cases of dengue; 7,785 cases of gastroenteritis; and 1,534 cases of hepatitis. There has been a dramatic fall in swine flu incidence in the city, with 44 cases this year till December 20 compared to 451 last year.Civic officials from the health department said the marked drop in numbers may be due to people remaining indoors due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“People didn’t step out much because of lockdown restrictions, which has helped to control the risk of exposing them to potential mosquito breeding sites,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The civic body also said it carried out extensive sanitisation and fumigation drives across the city, which also contributed to containing vector breeding. Many vector-borne diseases share symptoms similar to Covid-19 and consequently, doctors said it was fortunate that measures to contain the pandemic helped to tackle these other illnesses.“The Covid-19 preventive measures were initiated in March when the first case was reported. This included extensive disinfection work which was done in public places. Mosquito breeding grounds were also targeted. Last year, we had destroyed around 53,000 mosquito breeding grounds. But this year, we have destroyed over 62,000 breeding grounds,” said Dr Mangla Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. Another factor may be the adoption of better hygiene habits such as frequent washing of hands, use of sanitisers and eating home-cooked food, said city doctors. “Every monsoon, we get hundreds of people with gastroenteritis and hepatitis. Most of these are related to the consumption of contaminated water and outside food. But now, even with the relaxation of the lockdown, people are avoiding outside food,” said Mumbai-based epidemiologist, Dr Om Srivastava.The one cause of concern remains the number of malaria cases, which saw an increase compared to last year. Till December 20, the city had recorded 4,874 malaria cases while last year, there were 4,357 cases of malaria.“We are looking into the matter to understand the reason behind the growth of malaria cases,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-measures-lead-to-dip-in-seasonal-ailments-in-mumbai/story-UIhiX4NIu9kkstk1xWHNZP.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai experiences a chill as the temperature continues to dip||The city and its suburbs experienced a slight nip in the air on Monday as temperatures continued to drop for the second consecutive day.Santacruz recorded a minimum temperature of 16 degree Celsius, a sharp decline of 4.4 degrees from Sunday, and 1.4 degrees below normal. Colaba, too, saw the minimum temperature drop from 21.6 degree Celsius on Sunday to 18.8 degree Celsius, a 1-degree dip from normal.Maximum temperature also dropped slightly on Monday. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 27.6 degree Celsius, a drop from Sunday’s 29.4 degree Celsius and 3.1 degrees below normal. The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) also recorded a maximum temperature of 29.4 degree Celsius, down from 30.9 degree Celsius on Sunday and, a drop of 1.9 degrees below normal.“The fall in temperatures is mostly due to the cold northerly to north-westerly winds from the northern plains in association with the passage of western disturbance,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD.IMD had predicted a fall in temperatures for two to three days from Sunday.Meanwhile, the air quality in Mumbai and its surrounding areas improved marginally from poor to moderate on Monday. The overall air quality index (AQI) – a pollutant measuring indicator – of 180 (moderate) was recorded by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).A spokesperson for SAFAR said that the improvement in air quality could be attributed to increasing winds. “It’s a temporary improvement. With temperatures dipping, the air quality is expected to deteriorate further in the coming days,” he said.Even as the overall AQI improved, some pockets breathed poor quality air. The AQI at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) was 325 (very poor), while Andheri recorded AQI of 249 (poor) and the AQI in Navi Mumbai was 266.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-experiences-a-chill-as-the-temperature-continues-to-dip/story-vHhyx41BhDM7ql2z8Yr2DK.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||Fliers taking detours to evade quarantine, finds Mumbai civic body||Many passengers are taking flights to neighbouring states and then coming to Mumbai to evade the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) tracing and quarantining of returnees from the United Kingdom (UK), Europe, Middle East and South Africa, the civic body found.The civic body is quarantining fliers from these places to detect those infected by a new, more transmissible Covid-19 strain.In the wake of this, the BMC, along with airport authorities, are tracking the travel patterns of incoming passengers as they fear that by exploiting such loopholes, these fliers may end up spreading the new strain. “As there is no mandatory quarantine for domestic passengers, international fliers from these countries take connecting flights to states such as Goa or Kerala, where Europe, Middle East and South Africa fliers are not quarantined. They, later, either take another domestic flight or probably travel by road or train back to Mumbai,” said a BMC official. Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have alerted airport authorities and our own staff also to identify such travellers. We have come to know about such loopholes adopted by passengers to escape quarantine. Hence, we are going to find the travel patterns of passengers.”Gomare added, “We cannot stop any citizen from taking any detour, considering it is their personal liberty, but this issue definitely needs a policy decision from our end to put an end to this practice. But again, there is little that we can do. Citizens should act responsibly before it is too late.”According to BMC officials, passengers who are landing at Mumbai airport and seeking exemption from hotel quarantine, citing further travel plans, are allowed to go ahead via a quarantine stamp on their hand. However, BMC officials said there is only little they can do further from there, wherein authorities of their destination states are informed. But there is a chance of these passengers going to these destination states and mixing with others, considering other states are not having a rule of mandatory quarantine. According to BMC’s data, more than 1,500 passengers who have landed at Mumbai airport between December 23 and 26 have opted for travelling to other states, and due to this, BMC have exempted these passengers from hotel quarantine and have allowed them to take connecting flights by informing the destination state government authorities.Passengers on the other hand said they are using the loophole, considering quarantining themselves is a costly affair. Vikas Patil (name changed), a Mumbai resident said, “I landed at Mumbai airport on December 25, and BMC informed me to take up a hotel, wherein I would have spent around ₹50,000 if my quarantining would have extended to 14 days. I cannot afford so much, and hence I took a connecting flight to Goa. After spending a few days in Goa, I will start my journey towards Mumbai via road.”Patil added, “The BMC should rather than forcing passengers to take up hotels, pay for hotel bills or keep us in Covid-19 isolation facilities, considering not every citizen can afford hotels. The Covid-19 isolation facilities are vacant, and passengers should be isolated there.” According to BMC’s data, as of December 27, out of 16,437 beds for Covid-19, 12,470 beds are vacant.Meanwhile, Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task-force, said, “Mumbai has already gone through a lot, and citizens should adhere to all rules and regulations of quarantining now, rather than using loopholes in the system to escape quarantine. We need to avoid any surge due to irresponsible behaviour of citizens. The Central and state government have been very kind to take precautions and not go for a complete lockdown instead. Hence, citizens should ensure taking precautions rather than being super spreaders by using loopholes to bypass the system.”Meanwhile, the standard operating procedures (SOPs) unveiled by the state government for tourism destinations and tourists stressed on maintaining social distance and directed local authorities to set up a mechanism for crowd management and training of staff. Some of the measures include disallowing tourists from getting their guests in their hotel rooms and also restricting staff from coming into the rooms. “Tourists who have checked in at the accommodation unit should not allow guests into their rooms. Staff of accommodation units shall not enter the guest’s room unless necessary. The guests should ensure they follow social-distancing guidelines with any staff,” said the SOP. It also advises them to wear protective masks inside the tourist premises and adopt a zero-contact policy. With regards to tourist places, the authorities need to set up a Covid-19 team, which will have the responsibility of various functions such as crowd management, training of staff, compliance with hygiene and sanitation/ disinfection guidelines, social-distancing norms and coordination with the local health department.It advocates a physical distance of at least 2m (6 feet) should always be mandatorily maintained by all and a clear signages of this to be displayed at frequent places at the tourist destinations. It also disallows tourists from entering the kitchen area. However, tourist operators are not convinced with the SOPs. “The SOPs should ideally be prepared in consultation with representatives of the tourism sector. However, there are lot of grey areas which invite corruption,” said Subhash Motwani, founder, Namaste Tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fliers-taking-detours-to-evade-quarantine-finds-mumbai-civic-body/story-wSb0jPuIwa6dCqdo6p8cmM.html

29-12-2020||Chandigarh||PU senate elections: No relief to former senators from high court||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday refused to pass any directions on the plea by seven former Panjab University (PU) senators demanding directions for continuation of present varsity bodies, including the syndicate, till the senate elections are held.The former senators had moved an application over their December 22 plea seeking urgent intervention of the high court stating that in the absence of the senate and syndicate, there would be no administrative body left for decision making and the varsity administration would “collapse”.The high court vacation bench of justice Karamjit Singh has sought a response from the varsity on this application and adjourned the matter for January 12, on which date the main case is already fixed for hearing.The HC took note of varsity counsel’s submissions who had told court that there is no need to issue any interim directions and had referred to ‘Regulations of Panjab University Calendar’ which says “whenever there is an urgency, the vice-chancellor (V-C) may take such action as he deems necessary, and report the matter at the next meeting of the syndicate for approval.”The fresh plea had stated that the syndicate’s term would expire on December 31 and there would be no executive body left to administer the matters of the university. “As a matter of fact, all decisions are been taken by its V-C, in anticipation of approval of the syndicate and when there would be no authority, the entire functioning of the university would collapse,” the court was told adding that interim directions as per the existing arrangement be allowed to continue till the elections of the senate are held.The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31 and the syndicate’s term would get over on December 31. The varsity has not decided on holding elections due to the pandemic.In their December 22 plea, the former senators had demanded holding of senate polls and quashing August 15 orders of PU V-C whereby elections were deferred indefinitely. They had alleged that political party at the Centre and people affiliated with it were deliberately delaying the polls. It was also demanded to examine whether the V-C could defer the elections of the senate without approval of the syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-senate-elections-no-relief-to-former-senators-from-high-court/story-qtkn4CWWFB4rOU1pgzMSBK.html
29-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s road mishap deaths at 37-year low this year||In 2020, the city saw the least number of road accident deaths since 1983, registering a 37-year low, revealed the official traffic police data.This year, vehicular movement was restricted due to the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown as people preferred to stay indoors rather than venturing out unnecessarily.As per the data, there were 48 fatal road accidents this year and 51 deaths, less than half as compared to 2019, which recorded 104 deaths in 100 fatal accidents. Police records show that the number of FIRs registered under section 304-A (death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code is the lowest in the city since 1983, when 46 fatal road accidents were reported.A significant drop in non-fatal road mishaps was also witnessed this year. There were 109 non-fatal accidents in 2020 till date as compared to 205 in 2019. As many as 146 people were injured in these accidents this year, while this figure was 275 in 2019. During the lockdown, the number of road fatalities went down, and in April, there were zero road accident deaths as with the exception of essential services, vehicles weren’t allowed on the roads.Superintendent of police (traffic) Ketan Bansal said, “The decline can be attributed mainly to the traffic restrictions in place in the city due to the lockdown. However, we are also checking how effective our enforcement strategies were.”He added that the deployment of traffic cops to prevent accidents is done around the most accident-prone areas of the city. This targeted deployment will continue next year as well.Figures dip across country Speaking about the decline in road deaths, Chandigarh road safety panel member and Punjab traffic advisor Navdeep Asija said, “There has been a reduction in fatal accidents throughout the country owing to the pandemic. A 30-35% drop has been observed on average, but if Chandigarh has registered a drop of 50%, it is owing to the enforcement agencies here.”Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “This year, a trend for cycling began as Chandigarh residents are fond of exercising. This needs to continue in 2021 as well, The administration should ensure infrastructure and facilities for cyclists’ safety.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-road-mishap-deaths-at-37-year-low-this-year/story-fBOQjpkrHqauf3etMTqL1O.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||No decision on Pandharpur seat for Parth in Maharashtra by-polls, says Ajit Pawar||Deputy chief minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said that there was no decision taken by the party to field his son Parth Pawar in the Pandharpur by-polls after the Assembly seat fell vacant owing to the death of sitting party MLA Bharat Bhalke a month ago. Dismissing reports that Parth received the candidature, Pawar said that the candidate will be finalised after consulting with local party leadership and two other ruling parties in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). He said it is the first Assembly election after the MVA government was formed and the alliance will fight it with full strength. After the demand at the local level propped up for the candidature of Parth, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Maval constituency, speculations have been rife in the political corridors over the candidature. “The reports about Parth Pawar getting the candidature are unfounded. “The final decision over the candidature is taken by our state unit chief Jayant Patil and the selection committee after discussing it with local leaders and MVA allies. This is the first Assembly election after formation of the MVA government and its candidate will win with a huge margin of votes,” Pawar said. A local leader Amarjeet Patil had written a letter to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, demanding to field his grandnephew Parth as the party’s candidate from the seat. Patil on Sunday had said they have yet to decide in this regard.In August, Parth was publicly rebuked by the NCP supremo and his grandfather Anantrao Pawar for going against the party stand and demanding that the Central Bureau of Investigation look into Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. Pawar had called him “immature” and had also said he doesn’t give a damn about what Parth says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-decision-on-pandharpur-seat-for-parth-in-maharashtra-by-polls-says-ajit-pawar/story-TpByVlSsNmxYkleUMQsfwI.html
29-12-2020||Noida||Effigy rally irks farmers at UP Gate||The arrival of politician Pappu Yadav and a mock funeral at the UP Gate protest site on Monday was termed a “mistake” by farmer leaders there.Despite farmers deciding that no politician or political party will be allowed to use their dais, Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav on Monday addressed a gathering at UP Gate for 20 minutes, during which he accused the government of “favouring the corporates”.He was accompanied by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader and national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait.This is the second time Yadav has come to the UP Gate protest site – his previous appearance was on December 1 when he came along with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and lent support to farmers.Earlier in the day on Monday, a group of protesting farmers prepared an effigy and carried out a mock “shav yatra” (funeral procession) as a symbolic protest at UP Gate, after which police officers from Khoda and Kaushambi police stations intervened and snatched the effigy.“It was a small group which resorted to carrying out a ‘shav yatra’ but our officers intervened and took the effigy away. Their leaders have been informed of the incident and we expect that they will ensure no such unruly activity is carried out at the protest site,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), Ghaziabad. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and also part of a committee leading the protest at UP Gate said that those involved in the procession were a small group of protesters who had joined the UP Gate site only recently. “We will ensure no such activity takes place in future. No group will be allowed to carry any such activity out of enthusiasm. Our protest is peaceful and will remain peaceful. We had earlier decided that no politically affiliated person will be allowed to share the dais but this happened on Monday. When we came to the dais, he (Pappu Yadav) was almost ending his speech. It has now been decided and reiterated that no politician will make use of the dais,” Bajwa said.Leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, also reiterated said that Yadav delivering a speech there and the “shav yatra” were a “mistake.” “We know that such incidents have happened but they were a mistake. We will ensure that such incidents are not repeated. We will take up the issue when committee members at UP Gate sit down for discussions on Monday night,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Ghaziabad police on Monday took into preventive custody about 25 supporters and leaders of the Congress party and took them to police lines. “We were celebrating our party’s foundation day at our office (near Old Bus Stand) and thereafter heading to pay tributes to martyrs, but the police did not allow us and even used lathis to beat our supporters. They later brought us to police lines. Our office bearers had conveyed our program to district officials,” said Satish Sharma , a Congress leader and a former state minister. The police department, on their part, said that no force was used and that about 25 people were brought to the police lines. “They were bound down under Code of Criminal Procedure sections as about 100 of them were carrying out a procession without permission, with prohibitory orders already in place,” said Abhishek Verma, the superintendent of police (city 1), Ghaziabad.“Later, they were allowed to leave,” the superintendent of police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/effigy-rally-irks-farmers-at-up-gate/story-jD7QJnETjhBR2lckQEK0yJ.html
29-12-2020||Mumbai||16 UK returnees test positive for virus across Maharashtra||Even as Maharashtra recorded 2,854 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the count to 1,916,236, 16 people across the state, who have returned from the United Kingdom (UK) recently, have tested positive for Covid-19, as of Saturday.The local administration will be sending their samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to ascertain if they are infected with the new, more infectious strain, which originated from the UK.Of the 16, four are from Nagpur, three each from Mumbai and Thane, two from Pune, one each from Nanded, Ahmednagar, Raigad and Aurangabad.The state government has put the administration on alert after the discovery of the mutant strain, directing civic bodies and district collectors to trace and conduct tests of all those who came from the UK between November 15 and December 23.Meanwhile, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 toll reached 49,189 after 60 casualties were reported. Of them, 34 were in the past 48 hours, five in the past week and the remaining 21 were from before last week, officials said.A woman, 57, in Aurangabad, central Maharashtra, who had travelled to the UK, had tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. The local civic body has kept her in isolation.“This woman arrived in Mumbai on December 15 and reached Aurangabad by taking a connecting flight. Following the directives, we traced her and her RT-PCR report on Friday confirmed that she is positive to Covid-19. However, she is still asymptomatic,” said Dr Nita Padalkar, assistant municipal commissioner and medical officer of health, Aurangabad municipal corporation.Dr Padalkar said her RT-PCR test conducted in London on December 11 was negative and thus it is difficult to say if she is a carrier or she got infected in transit or after arrival in the country. To know the type of virus, they will send her sample to the NIV (Pune) on Monday,” she said.On Friday, another UK returnee tested positive in Pune. “This man returned to Pune on December 13 and tested positive on December 17. We are sending his swab samples to NIV to check if the virus is the same or is it the new strain,” said Dr Sanjiv Waware, assistant chief health officer, Pune Municipal Corporation.Dr Padalkar further said that there are many possibilities in such a case. First, she (Aurangabad woman) may be in the incubation period, which means she came in contact with the virus but it (virus) is yet to start the multiplication process and thus her first report may have come negative. The second possibility is that the virus may have died, but owing to intermittent shedding, a phenomena in medical terms, her first report may have come negative and second have come positive. This is because in the RT-PCR test we test only RNA particles and not the whole virus. Thus even if the virus is dead, the small particles continue to shed and sometimes be detected in the subsequent test reports, she explained.Despite Maharashtra’s heartening trend of fewer cases of late, state officials still want people and authorities to be extra cautious for two reasons, first, the concern of a surge from next month and second, a new variant of Covid-19 found in the UK and some other countries, which is believed to be 70% more transmissible than the original strain.“Instead of complaining about the night curfew, people need to understand the seriousness of the situation. If we are getting fewer cases doesn’t mean that it won’t rise again. Also, the new mutant spreads much faster than all the old strains, which means a carrier can infect much more people. Hence, it is advisable to take as much precaution as possible because many people returned from the UK have tested positive, although it is yet to ascertain if they are infected with the old virus or the new mutant,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.Mumbai has clocked 536 cases, highest in the state, on Saturday, taking the count to 290,336. Of them, active cases are 8,262. There were 12 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 11,068.Nagpur city contributed the second-highest number of infections in the daily caseload and it has recorded 282 cases. Their tally reached 109,946.Pune city recorded 226 cases, third-highest number of cases. Its count stood at 189,882.The state has completed a total of 12,451,919 Covid-19 tests with 50,282 conducted on Saturday.The number of recovered patients reached 1,807,824 with 1,526 recorded in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate remains at 94.34%.The state also imposed a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 for the next 15 days till January 5, which is effective in all major cities (municipal corporation areas) across the state between 11 pm and 6am. It has also empowered district collectors to impose night curfew to contain the Covid-19 spread, only after taking approval from the chief secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/16-uk-returnees-test-positive-for-virus-across-maharashtra/story-UOCamoWEkuhIEzXYTT10FO.html
29-12-2020||Noida||In Noida, no more than 100 people allowed at New Year’s Eve parties; permit necessary before organising||NOIDA: No more than 100 persons would be allowed at a venue for New Year’s Eve parties this year in Noida, the district administration and police department have said. Besides, owners of all hotels, restaurants and clubs organising parties and events in Gautam Budh Nagar on December 31 would have to obtain permissions from the district magistrate or commissioner of police (CP) before doing so, as well as intimate the number of guests expected. Further, guidelines issued by the police say that any violation of protocols put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease would invite police action.District magistrate Suhas LY said it is mandatory for all hotels, restaurants, clubs and bars, to acquire proper licences under Uttar Pradesh Cinematography Act, 1955 (amended as UP Cinematography Act) from the competent authority, i.e. the district magistrate. “Similarly, they will have to get licences for fire, air-conditioners, electricity and safety from the competent authorities. Since possible gatherings during the New Year celebrations could pose a greater risk of the spread of Covid-19, ensuring full compliance of the Covid-19 safety protocols is mandatory at all these venues,” he said. Commissioner of police Alok Singh said that as per directions issued by the state government, only 50% of the capacity of a closed venue, up to a 100 persons, will be allowed at a time. “Permission for organising a new year’s programme will have to be obtained from the local deputy commissioner of police office, and the organisers will have to provide their names, addresses and mobile numbers. The maximum limit for the open spaces, meanwhile, will be 40% of total capacity, with all other arrangements like thermal scanning, sanitization, masking, social distancing, etc., will need to be in place,” he said. Singh further said that adequate forces have been deployed for patrolling near places where New Year celebrations will be held. “Stern action will be taken against anyone found spreading fake or inflammatory messages through social media. Our officers will keep the round the clock vigil on liquor shops, hotels, restaurants, malls, metro stations, bus stations and railway stations to avert any mischievous activities there by the anti social elements,” he said. The police commissioner also urged people to stay at home to avoid the risk of the disease. The police chief also warned that the DJs and sound systems used at such events must adhere to the Supreme Court guidelines. “The organisers will have to inform in advance the estimated number of people participating in the program. The organisers will also have to follow Covid-19 protocols. For the purpose of ensuring compliance with Covid-19 safety guidelines, monitoring by drone cameras will also be undertaken at sensitive sites concerned,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-noida-no-more-than-100-people-allowed-at-new-year-s-eve-parties-permit-necessary-before-organising/story-nlsBeq7PX5yW2bLgrfEFvL.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||An arts school for poor kid comes up at Singhu protest site||Khushboo Kumari, 9, loves drawing and painting but since the government school she studies in is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic since March and her parents are unable to afford stationery, she was unable to fulfill her hobby. Like Kumari, seven-year-old Pawan Singh’s studies were also affected since the classes in the school are suspended and his family was unable to afford private tuitions. But for Kumari, Singh, and scores of other children living in areas around the Singhu border, a tent erected near the spot where farmers are protesting against the three farm laws, is serving as a tuition centre. Here at this tent, they are taught basic lessons and trained in various arts. Set up by eight “like-minded people” from Punjab 17 days ago, the tent initially worked as a space for storing mattresses, blankets and other items for the use of the protesting farmers. Later, a library was set up and books related to agriculture and various farmers’ revolutions were provided to the protesters for free. All eight volunteers behind the initiative belong to the families of farmers but are educated and established in various business and professional fields. Also Read | A month on, farmers have made highway their home“Recently, we started using the space in the tent for educating poor children and training them in various arts,” said Garry Birring, 34, a graduate from the University of Oxford and a resident of Ludhiana, who is now into the business of water purifier manufacturing. Seven others who were part of the group that launched this school-library are Dinesh Chaddha, advocate, Parminder alias Goldy, an RTI activist, Inder Wajwa, a former model, Sukhwinder Singh, Navdeep Singh, Amritpal Singh, and Gurtez Singh -- all involved in farm trade. All of these are from Ropar, Mohali, and Muktsar.Besides the eight founders, several other volunteers teach the kids at school.  Sharing the story of how it all started, Birring said they had met at Singhu border during the protest. As sanitation and health hygiene was an issue for the farmers, our group collected money, purchased items and distributed to the farmers free of cost. “We set up a tent and named it Sanjhi Sathh which means a shared or common chaupal (meeting place). Apart from supplying mattresses and blankets, we are now running a school and library in our tent. At least 60 poor children are taught daily. They are provided with free books, notebooks and stationery items,” he added. The temporary school not only provides space to children for free education but it also organises drawing, painting and storytelling competitions and arts exhibitions to make their studies entertaining. The classes are organised every day between 11 am and 2 pm. “Drawing and painting is my passion but my parents are daily wagers and they don’t have money to buy drawing sheets and colour pencils for me. I learnt this art in the school. As the school is closed for the past nine months, I was not able to practice it. My parents sent me to this school run by the farmers when they learnt about it. I can now continue my drawing practice,” said nine-year-old Kumari. The facility that was started by eight people now has around 20 volunteers – all from Punjab – and is imparting free education to poor children at Singhu border. One of the volunteers is Navjot Kaur from Bathinda who recently completed her B.Ed course and had been camping at the Singhu border with her parents for the past 20 days. “I learnt about this temporary school through my friend Kanwal Preet as she was coming here to teach children. Being an aspiring teacher, I found it an opportunity to train myself. It gives me so much satisfaction,” said Kaur. Thousands of farmers are protesting at Singhu border for over a month now against the three new farm laws enacted by the Parliament in September that seek to open up agricultural trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/an-arts-school-for-poor-kid-comes-up-at-singhu-protest-site/story-uhH2b3JJySkeywSsuIUffK.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Fewest new Covid-19 cases in Delhi since May 26||Daily new Covid-19 infections in the national capital touched a 219-day low on Monday, with the city adding 564 new cases — the fewest in a day since May 26, when 412 cases were reported.To be sure, fewer tests were conducted on Sunday as compared to the weekly average. Even then, the positivity rate — which experts regard as a vital metric to understand the spread of an infection — remained below 1% for the fourth time in seven days. Of the total 57,463 samples collected on Sunday, 0.98% tested positive. Further, 32,484 of these tests were conducted using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method — regarded as the gold standard diagnosis for the coronavirus disease.While cases and deaths have waned over the past few weeks, experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.The seven-day average cases too fell to 801, the lowest in 213 days, since an average of 724 cases in the seven days ending May 29.The city recorded 21 deaths of the viral infection on Monday’s bulletin, which primarily records data from the previous day. Delhi has now seen 10,474 deaths of the illness.Meanwhile, a vast majority of hospital beds reserved for the treatment of Covid-19 patients continue to remain vacant in the capital, with only 2,499 of 18,774 beds occupied. With this in mind, the Delhi government on Sunday scaled down the percentage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals in the city. While informing the Delhi high court on Sunday that 60% such beds would be reserved instead of 80% previously, it added that it was not looking at scaling down this number further in view of New Years’ celebrations as well as a reportedly more contagious strain of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that emerged in the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fewest-new-covid-19-cases-in-capital-since-may-26/story-JGnACWIi1QBO4Tv8QaIi3K.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Police questions Pracha for questioning over October protest against Pakistan||The Delhi police on Monday questioned lawyer Mehmood Pracha for allegedly violating social distancing norms during a protest outside the Pakistan High Commission in October even as the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) condemned Thursday’s police raid on the lawyer’s office in connection with another case as a “malicious act”.Pracha, who represents at least 80 accused and victims in the north-east Delhi riots cases, describe the police summon in the protest case as harassment. “I told them that they should be happy that I protested against the ill treatment of minorities in Pakistan. The police officers who questioned me for over one and a half hours said that I should stop protesting against Pakistan. It made no sense. I could not make head or tail of what my crime was. It is clear that police are harassing me,” he said. “First, my office was raided by the special cell on Thursday. They then registered a case against me at Hazrat Nizamuddin police station. And today (Monday), they summoned me at Chanakapuri. It is clearly their way of harassing me for speaking the truth and fighting the riot cases. They did not even give me a copy of the FIR (Chanakyapuri police station case), they have registered against me for protesting,” he added. Around 4pm on Monday, Pracha tweeted a photograph showing him outside the Chanakyapuri police station. He tweeted, “ Entering PS Chanakyapuri on the dot.”Police said on October 3, a protest was organised at Teen Murti in Chanakyapuri without police permission. Accordingly, a case under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC was registered at the Chanakyapuri police station against Pracha, the organiser of the protest. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said, “A notice was served to the organiser (Pracha) for recording his statement in the case at the police station.” A police officer associated with the case said Pracha’s statement was recorded on Monday afternoon and stayed in the station for about 15 minutes.Last Thursday, confusion and controversy had surrounded the raid by police’s special cell at Pracha’s office. After the raid, Pracha accused police of assaulting him and stealing data from his office. He had also filed a complaint against the police team at Hazrat Nizamuddin police station. Police are yet to act on his complaint.Delhi police have maintained that they had obtained a warrant and had searched his place, during which Pracha got violent and did not cooperate. The raid, police said, was in connection with a case registered on August 22, after one of the riot victims told a court that the lawyer has asked him to fake a deposition and frame three people in riot cases. Reacting to the raid on Monday, the SCBA and the Bar Association of India (BAI) condemned police action by issuing separate statements. The SCBA described the raid as a “malicious act that defeats the rights of an advocate to practice his profession without fear or favour.” It emphasised that the seizures of confidential information that is protected by “lawyer-client privilege”, in a search conducted by the very police authorities who are prosecuting Pracha’s clients, will prejudicially affect the rights and guarantees of the accused. “It is illegal and contravenes all cannons of protection to a client and his lawyer,” read the statement. It also questioned the manner in which a magistrate had issued the warrant of search and seizure, saying exercise of authority of the court in such a “routine, mechanical manner” is antithetical to rule of law and constitutes a disturbing violation of this privilege directly affecting the administration of justice. In its statement, the BAI also implored the judiciary to be mindful of the importance of attorney-client privilege in such matters. “The issuing of a search warrant in respect of a lawyer’s communication and correspondence is a grave violation of client-attorney privilege, and can cause a chilling effect in clients providing true and complete disclosures to their lawyers, and would impede the administration of justice”, said the BAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-questions-pracha-for-questioning-over-october-protest-against-pakistan/story-Kdo3HwB7AgzhmqDNp6I2GM.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Driverless trains take Metro commuters by surprise||Rajesh Meena, a 42-year-old resident of west Delhi’s Janakpuri was among the first passengers to board India’s first driverless train on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden) on Monday. After boarding at Janakpuri West Metro station, where the train picked up its first batch of passengers, Meena said he was not aware the unit he had boarded was running without a driver. “Till a few stations after I boarded, I was not aware that the train was driverless. But when I was told about this, I started feeling that the train was running faster than usual. This could be psychological,” Meena said. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Monday entered the elite league of 7% of the world’s Metro networks that can operate without drivers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the first driverless train via a video event, after which the first train set off from Jasola Vihar-Shaheen Bagh station towards Janakpuri West. The first trip was a preview for media houses, and the first trip for general passengers was operated from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden, the DMRC said on Monday.  While many commuters like Meena said they were not aware of being on board a driverless train, others had especially come to take a ride aboard these trains. “There was no way of knowing if the train we were aboard was driverless or not but we have to take a ride after the news channels flashed that the Prime Minister had inaugurated this new technology. We did not feel like the ride was any different,” said Manju Raj, a resident of southwest Delhi’s Palam. DMRC on Monday said that a limited number of trains was operated on the driverless technology. This number will be gradually increased over the coming days, they said. By mid-2021, the driverless operations will be extended to the Pink Line, which connects Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar. On Monday, some commuters also said that they were a little apprehensive of the safety measures in place on a driverless train but were confident of the DMRC’s safety standards. “Once you know that the train is being automatically operated and that there is no driver on board, you tend to wonder what happens in case of emergencies. Maybe eventually these doubts will clear out,” said Radhika Uppal, a commuter who boarded from south Delhi’s Munirka. DMRC officials assured that initially there will be a driver in these automated trains to win the confidence of the commuters. “In DTO [driverless train operations], initially, the train operator will be present in the train to instil a sense of confidence and assistance. DTO’s higher level of diagnostic features will help move from conventional time-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance. This will also reduce maintenance downtime of trains,” the DMRC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/driverless-trains-take-metro-commuters-by-surprise/story-U2avj9qYuLAo3ShfNBGqNI.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||10 more contacts of fliers from UK test positive for Covid-19||Ten more contacts of fliers who recently returned from the United Kingdom and tested positive for Covid-19 in Delhi have been diagnosed for the infection and admitted in a special ward at Lok Nayak hospital, a senior government official said on Monday.As of Monday evening, 31 patients were admitted in the special ward at Lok Nayak hospital of whom 20 are UK-returned Covid-19 patients and 11 are their contacts who tested positive.Of the 20 patients who returned from the UK, 11 were moved to the ward directly from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) after being tested on arrival between Tuesday and Wednesday. They had arrived in the last few flights from the UK before trips were suspended in light of a new, more contagious variant of Covid-19 reported to have emerged in the country.“The other nine UK-returned patients were found Covid-19 positive after being traced and tested by the government since Wednesday under an ongoing outreach drive,” the senior official said.The swab samples of all such individuals who have tested positive have also been sent to the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi for genome sequencing, to ascertain if they have been infected by variant discovered in the UK. The results of these tests are awaited, said the official, who asked not to be identified.“Of the 11 contacts of UK-returned Covid-19 patients who were found infected, one was identified on Friday – and 10 more were identified over the weekend,” the senior official said.While people arriving from UK on December 22 and 23 — after the government announced flights would be suspended till December 31 — were directly scanned, tested and quarantined (if needed) from the airports, state governments have been entrusted with reaching out and conducting Covid-19 tests on all passengers who arrived from UK between November 25 and December 21, even if they had previously been tested on arrival.A senior official in Delhi’s revenue department said around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport between November 25 and December 21 — of whom around 1,500 are Delhi residents. District officials said they are in the process of tracing them all and, so far, around 1,200 of them have been tested, said another senior official in the government’s revenue department.Once a UK returnee tests positives, all her /his contacts are to be tested. The contacts awaiting test results and those who test negative have to complete mandatory institutional quarantine. They can either opt for a government facility in Chhatarpur – which currently has around 100 individuals lodged -- or a paid facility in hotel at Aerocity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-more-contacts-of-fliers-from-uk-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-wkiDRYro9zwfCLghswDnRN.html
29-12-2020||Delhi||Scuffle in EDMC House over alleged scam in north Delhi municipality||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) got into a scuffle during a House meeting of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday when the latter raised the alleged Rs2,500 crore scam in the North Delhi civic body. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain suspended two AAP councillors, including leader of the opposition Manoj Kumar Tyagi from the House for 15 days and also issued disciplinary action warning against AAP councillor Geeta Rawat.While AAP lodged a police complaint against former mayor and BJP councillor Bipin Bihari for using “casteist remarks” and assaulting some councillors, the BJP alleged that opposition members hurled slippers at their councillors and also tore copies of the agenda.The Delhi government had ordered an inquiry into alleged misappropriation of funds to the tune of more than Rs2,500 crore in the North Delhi municipal corporation. It concerns payments between the North and the South Delhi municipal corporation. According to EDMC functionaries, as soon as the meeting started and the leader of the house Pravesh Sharma started reading a condolence letter, the opposition members protested and demanded a discussion on alleged misappropriation of funds and on farm distress. EDMC, in a statement, said the opposition created a ruckus during the House meeting. AAP councillor Geeta Rawat reached the Mayor’s seat and the leader of opposition Manoj Kumar Tyagi got into a scuffle with former mayor Bipin Bihari, the EDMC said in the statement. Nirmal Jain, EDMC mayor, said opposition councillors behaved in a “undemocratic, rude and indecent” manner. “It was a predetermined move by the AAP to not let the House function. The agenda of the meeting was also pulled from the leader of the house and torn by Tyagi. AAP councillor Mohini Jeenwal hurled her slippers at BJP councillors. I have suspended Tyagi and Jeenwal for 15 days from the House for their indecent, insensitive and rude behaviour. AAP councillor Geeta Rawat will be issued a letter for disciplinary action due to her indecent behaviour,” Jain said. AAP’s Tyagi denied allegations and blamed BJP councillors for indulging in fighting and using foul language against AAP councillors. “BJP doesn’t want to discuss Rs 2400 crore scam done by north and south corporations. When we demanded a debate, they indulged in violence and used abusive language. Former mayor Bipin Bihari manhandled our councillors, including a woman. When I objected, they started fighting with me as well. Instead of taking action against Bihari, the mayor suspended me for 15 days which is completely wrong and shows his bias,” Tyagi said. Bihari, however, refuted allegations against him. “All these allegations are false...The recording of the House can be checked as a proof,” Bihari said. Senior AAP leader and party’s MCD-incharge Durgesh Pathak said BJP councillors had started the ruckus. “We demanded a discussion on Rs 2,500 crore scam but instead of the debate they started abusing our councillors and manhandling party leaders. If they have done no wrong then why are they running from debate and not ordering CBI inquiry. We have lodged a complaint against Bipin Bihari at Patparganj police station,” Pathak said. The AAP councillors also displayed banners regarding Rs 2,500 crore scam in the north and south corporations at the North corporation’s office. Chhail Bihari Goswami, chairman standing committee in north corporation, dismissed the allegations of “misappropriation of funds” and said the AAP was in the habit of making baseless accusations. “North MCD is outrightly denying the allegation of any misappropriation of funds on account of waiving of the ground rent purportedly to be paid by SDMC to North MCD as there is no truth in the said allegation,” Goswami said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scuffle-in-edmc-house-over-alleged-scam-in-north-delhi-municipality/story-mTERGIuwuKd1B8WblPg8BO.html

However, the Deputy Director of Education (DYDE) has now formed three teams to assess the financial situation of seven schools in and around Pune. The teams will carry out audits to examine the utilisation of funds in these schools. The teams will also submit a report in the next 10-15 days. The decision came as a relief to many parents who have been filing grievances with the education department as well as related authorities.Members of the parents’ associations also met state education minister Bacchu Kadu on Monday in Pune.Jayshree Deshpande, president of the parents’ association of Pune said that the decision has come as a relief.“We have demanded audits against these schools. Many of our children are not receiving online education due to non-payment of fees. Even in this pandemic, many schools have asked parents to pay the full fees. We want our parents to get relief and students should get back to online education,” said Deshpande.She further said that many schools have repeatedly not responded even to the education department’s notices.“This step by the education department will ensure that these schools are under scrutiny for denying education to children,” said Deshpande.“We discussed many important issues. Some of our parents whose wards are in ICSE and CBSE schools are unaware about how they can apply for external examinations in these boards. The minister has assured us that every school in Maharashtra has to obey the rules made by the state,” said Deshpande.Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of education said that the report is expected in 10 to 15 days. “We have appointed teams who will carry out the audits. In these audits we will assess the schools for the utilisation of funds that were charged from parents in various activities. If there are discrepancies found, then the report will be sent to the government for appropriate decisions,” said Ukirde.Despite several attempts to contact him, minister of school education Omprakash (Bacchu) Kadu wasn’t available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dyde-orders-audit-of-seven-schools-in-pune-over-funds-utilisation/story-MczNLG48pqxznGwmpLWKGL.html

Some garbage was also seen piled up at Ramtekdi.In order to process the garbage without executing the tendering process, the standing committee appointed the contractor. The cost is almost Rs 250 to Rs 300 per metric tonne more than the existing rates, said officials.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “This is a temporary arrangement to clean up the piled-up garbage. The contractor would establish the mobile garbage processing unit and clear it. We have instructed the administration that this is a temporary arrangement on the request of residents around the garbage depot. We would execute the tendering process later.”While putting the proposal in front of the standing committee, PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “Due to the Covid-19 situation and model code of conduct, PMC is not able to float a tender for the garbage processing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-appoints-contractor-for-garbage-processing/story-sA53FWHZkrsIJg7VAx78zK.html
29-12-2020||Kolkata||‘BJP trying to break spine of Bengali culture through distorted facts’: Mamata Banerjee||Sharpening her attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee alleged that the BJP was trying to break the spine of Bengali-culture with the help of distorted facts. “Of late, the BJP is trying to break the spine of Bengali culture. They are trying to break the Bengali pride, erase our history, change the geographic boundary and hit the political ideology with violence. Bengal’s culture is not the one which they are trying to present,” said Banerjee while adding that she never tagged Indians as outsiders. The Trinamool Congress supremo was addressing the media at Birbhum district on Monday. She is on a two day visit to the district. “All information and cultural hubs in the country are being attacked so that their spines could be broken. Be it Puducherry University, JNU or Nalanda University. Outsiders have captured Visva Bharati (set up by Rabindranath Tagore),” she added. Also read: MHA extends Covid-19 guidelines till JanuaryUnion home minister Amit Shah had visited Visva Bharati on December 20 while he was camping in the state for two days to bolster the BJP’s campaign in the run-up to the crucial state assembly elections in 2021. Shah, who had held a mega roadshow in Birbhum, was impressed with the huge turnout. Banerjee is scheduled to hold a roadshow on the same route on Tuesday. The BJP has hit back. “The Mamata Banerjee administration has failed to address the burning problems of the state. They know they would lose and are hence attacking the BJP with baseless allegations and opposing the Narendra Modi-led government,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state. Banerjee also said that Nobel laureate Amartya Sen is being attacked by the BJP for his views against the Union government. This is, however, not the first time that she has said this. “Amartya Sen is being attacked for his views against the Union government. This is completely unacceptable. Just like, I am being attacked for my political views,” she said while talking to reporters. Banerjee had earlier written a letter to Sen expressing her anguish after Visva Bharati, a central university, and had allegedly said that Sen’s family was in illegal possession of land on the campus. Amartya Sen in his letter to Banerjee wrote, “Your strong voice, along with your full understanding of what is going on, is, for me, a tremendous source of strength.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-trying-to-break-spine-of-bengali-culture-through-distorted-facts-mamata-banerjee/story-9E7bdF8WYDYU5Zxfj86NhK.html

It passed 300,000 in three months, and 400,000 looks set to take just one month, the CDC determined using a collection of mathematical models. the US has one of the highest mortality ratios of nations hit hardest by the virus, behind only Italy, Spain and the U.K., scaled for population.The predicted pace would mean an additional 65,000 deaths in coming weeks. The numbers are a reminder of the increasing speed with which the virus claims lives in the US, underscoring the urgency of vaccine distribution efforts.President-elect Joe Biden was expected Tuesday to fault the Trump administration for the slow roll-out of vaccines, which stands at over 2 million doses given, a fraction of the 20 million promised by year-end.Also Read | Britain must vaccinate two million a week to prevent third Covid-19 wave: StudyWeekly deaths are predicted to rise through Jan. 16, even though national case numbers have been falling for two weeks amid patchy holiday reporting.

She received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine at the United Medical Center (UMC) in Washington DC.“That was easy!” Harris exclaimed after receiving the shot and thanked the nurse saying that “she barely felt it.” She also thanked UMC for serving the community which she called was “often overlooked.” “I have now been vaccinated.

It is safe,” Harris said while addressing reporters after receiving the jab.Also read: Joe Biden receives Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine shot on live televisionHarris confirmed that her husband Douglas Emhoff would also be vaccinated on Tuesday and that she looks forward to receiving the next dose.

29-12-2020||World||Wuhan’s Covid-19 cases may have been ten times higher than estimated: Study||The scale of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan early this year may have been nearly 10 times the recorded tally, a study conducted by China’s public health authorities indicates, leaving the city where the coronavirus first took hold still well short of the immunity required to protect against a potential resurgence.About 4.4% of those tested were found to have specific antibodies that can fight off the pathogen that causes Covid-19, indicating they were infected some time in the past, according to a serological survey of more than 34,000 people conducted in April by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The data was released late Monday.That ratio would suggest that with Wuhan home to about 11 million people, as many as 500,000 residents may have been infected, nearly 10 times more than the 50,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases reported by health authorities in mid-April, when the survey was conducted.China has been criticized internationally for its initial handling of the outbreak, which has spread around the world in a global pandemic in the year since the first cases emerged. The US has raised questions about China’s accounting of the virus fallout in Wuhan, which was quickly eclipsed by larger outbreaks in Europe and North America. A number of revisions of the case and deaths data added to suspicions China was massaging the numbers.While the serological data may reignite those claims, it is common for health authorities to under-report cases during an acute outbreak, given testing capabilities can be limited and hospitals overwhelmed with a sudden surge in patients. The coronavirus’s ability to quietly infect people without making some of them sick until later or even throughout the infection period only exacerbates the problem.Serological surveillance has been widely used by health professionals around the world to gauge the true scale of epidemics, from Covid-19 to AIDS and hepatitis. The prevalence of disease derived from such studies can guide mitigation and vaccination efforts.The China CDC survey showed a far less impact of the virus outside Wuhan, which was effectively shut off as a way of containing the outbreak. The positive rate for antibodies dropped to 0.44% for the broader Hubei province, which was also placed under a three-month lockdown. Only two people tested positive for the antibody among the 12,000 surveyed in six other Chinese cities and provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, suggesting an extremely low prevalence of the virus across the rest of the country.The results for Wuhan mean even China’s worst-hit city is still vulnerable to Covid-19. Epidemiologists say at least half a population needs to have come into contact with the virus for even the minimum threshold for herd immunity. But the city’s rate of infection is generally in line with those found in other countries after the first wave of coronavirus infections, the China CDC said in a press release published on its website.The antibody positive rates in Spain and Switzerland this spring, for example, were as much as 6.2% and 11%, respectively, the China CDC said. While those are higher than the 4.4% found in Wuhan, and come before later waves that have swept across Europe, they still fall short of the herd immunity threshold.Since quelling the Hubei outbreak, China has largely contained the coronavirus, with sporadic flareups since April snuffed out through aggressive contract tracing and quickly testing millions of people in a matter of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-s-covid-19-cases-may-have-ten-times-higher-than-estimated-study/story-08zezZwXGMtnrDaHMvaiHP.html
29-12-2020||World||‘Ready to forget everything if Oli accepts his fault’: Madhav Nepal||Chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s rival faction Madhav Kumar Nepal said on Tuesday that the party could still be united if Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli was willing to accept his mistakes, as thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Kathmandu against the dissolution of Parliament. Madhav Nepal made the comments while addressing a massive protest rally organised by his faction in Kathmandu, which was attended by former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Jhala Nath Khanal. “We are ready to forget everything if Oli accepts his mistakes,” Madhav Nepal, the former prime minister who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction, told the rally. He also accused Prime Minister Oli of practicing anti-democratic activities by making decisions against the Constitution and the general public. “All the political parties, intellectuals, teachers, students and public are on the streets against the unconstitutional move of the Oli-led government. The lower house will soon be revived,” Madhav Nepal was quoted as saying by My Republica newspaper. Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after Prime Minister Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. Acting on the prime minister’s recommendation, President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Addressing the rally, Prachanda said that Prime Minister Oli’s recent move to dissolve the House of Representatives is aimed at killing federalism and republicanism which were achieved after decades of struggle by the people. “Oli’s move to give a blow to the Constitution as well as democratic system through dissolution of the lower (house of) Parliament will be written in black pages in history,” he said. Prachanda called one and all to stand together against Oli’s “unconstitutional move”, underlining the need to fight collectively. “The act of dissolving parliament is totally unconstitutional. It has taken the country toward another round of political instability. “We did not even imagine that we would be forced to take to the streets against Oli’s regressive move. Now, we have to fight collectively against this move,” said Prachanda, who claims control over the ruling party after removing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli from the posts of the party’s parliamentary leader and chair. “People had given us (the NCP) the mandate to ensure political stability with social justice so that we could move toward achieving a socialism-oriented system,” he said, adding that unfortunately, Oli’s abrupt decision to dissolve parliament without holding any discussion in the party has only invited political chaos. Prachanda said that Oli has attacked the Constitution and republicanism that were achieved after a great struggle. “I had personally taken initiatives for a merger between the two Communist parties and approached Oli for the same. At that time, he agreed to accept federalism, secularism and republicanism although I was well aware of his political ideology and the fact that he was against federalism and republicanism… he started to work against the spirit, ideology, principle and norms of a communist party,” he said. Prachanda said that Oli eventually turned autocratic, imposed hegemony in the party and even did not bother to consult other leaders before blatantly dissolving Parliament. “Oli’s tyranny will not last long because the people will firmly protest against his recent political move,” he said. Prachanda said it was not Parliament but the Oli-led government that had actually been dissolved for its wrong political move. He expressed hope that Parliament will be reinstated through the Supreme Court’s verdict. “I have faith in the court. I hope that the Supreme Court will honour the emotions of the people. I cannot even imagine that the apex court will go against the wish of the people,” he said. Nepal’s Supreme Court on Friday issued a show-cause notice to the Oli-led government, asking it to submit a written clarification over its decision to abruptly dissolve Parliament. The five-member Constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana asked the government to submit an original copy of the recommendations made by it to dissolve the House and the decision made by the President to authenticate the government’s recommendations within 10 days. Prachanda, meanwhile, also accused Oli of having made several efforts time and again to split the NCP but had failed in the past one year even as the country was battling the COVID-19 pandemic. The agitation will not stop unless the regressive move taken by Oli is neutralised, he added. The Prachanda-led faction organised protest rallies at various places, including Koteshwor, Lagankhel, Tripureshwor, Maitighar, Thamel, Chabahil, Teku, New Baneshwor, Kupandol, Lainchaur, Naxal, Bagbazar and Ratnapark. A 2,501-member “agitation mobilisation committee” was formed to launch protests in various districts of the country. On Monday, thousands of the Nepali Congress supporters held demonstrators in all the 165 constituencies represented in the House to protest Prime Minister Oli’s move to dissolve the parliament.

29-12-2020||World||Blow for Donald Trump: US House passes defence bill to set up veto override||The US House of Representatives on Monday passed a $740 billion defence policy legislation, setting up the first veto override of the Trump presidency. The Senate is expected to pass it on Tuesday.Outgoing President Donald Trump had vetoed the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) last week for not repealing protections for social media platforms, and for the renaming of military facilities named after confederate generals.US congress can override a presidential veto with a two-third vote count in each chamber. The Democratic-controlled House passed the override vote 322-87, with the support of the majority of Republicans. The Republican-led Senate is set to follow suit.But the Senate is unlikely to pass another legislation passed by the House on Monday that increases direct Covid-19 relief payments to qualifying Americans from $600 to $2,000 each, as had been demanded by the president. The Republicans had negotiated against a higher payment.Trump, in the meantime, continued his efforts to overturn the electoral defeat and has called upon his supporters to gather in Washington, DC on January 6, when US congress will certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Republican lawmakers allied to the outgoing president are expected to try to reject the verdict, but their attempts are set to fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blow-for-donald-trump-us-house-passes-defence-bill-to-set-up-veto-override/story-PFkO4GqeiLAAX9JqSTzLaM.html

This will be the first positive case of the South African variant in Australia,” D’Ath said during a briefing.According to health authorities, genome testing confirmed that a woman, who returned from abroad and was quarantined in a hotel in Brisbane, was infected with the 501.V2 strain.Queensland authorities are monitoring other passengers who flew on the same flight with the woman who later tested positive for Covid-19, D’Ath added.In addition to South Africa, several other countries have reported 501.V2 strain of SARS-CoV 2, including Japan and the United Kingdom. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the 501.V2 variant is even more dangerous than another new coronavirus strain that has been spreading in his country since September and is known to be up to 70 percent more contagious. South Africa said there was no evidence to support this claim.Many countries around the world have halted air traffic with the UK and South Africa over new coronavirus variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-registers-first-case-of-new-covid-19-strain-that-emerged-in-south-africa/story-NUcEry2bUmcCCTaSrDnXXL.html
29-12-2020||World||UK hospitals being overwhelmed by new Covid-19 peak: Officials||The UK is “back in the eye of the storm”, the head of the NHS said on Tuesday as the country’s health chiefs warned that hospitals were being overwhelmed by a surge in the Covid-19 pandemic, largely driven by a new highly transmissible variant of coronavirus, which has seen clinic admissions surpass the first peak. According to the figures from National Health Service (NHS) England, 20,426 patients were being treated in hospitals on Monday, compared to 18,974 recorded on April 12 during the first peak of the pandemic this year. The surge is largely driven by a new highly transmissible variant of coronavirus, which had led to most of the country being plunged into complete lockdown earlier this month and also several countries cutting transport links with the UK in an effort to try and curb its rapid transmission. The UK is “back in the eye of the storm,” said Sir Simon Stevens, the head of the state-funded NHS. “Now again we are back in the eye of the storm with a second wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe and, indeed, this country. Many of us have lost family, friends, colleagues and – at a time of year when we would normally be celebrating – a lot of people are understandably feeling anxious, frustrated and tired,” he said during a visit to NHS vaccination centre. However, the NHS chief tried to strike a note of optimism as he said that with vaccine supplies continuing to come on stream, things should start turning around by late spring in the New Year. “That perhaps provides the biggest chink of hope for the year ahead,” he said. It comes as the patients who received the first vaccinations three weeks ago will receive their second booster jab of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which also has a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India, is believed to be on the brink of regulatory approval as well with hopes of a rollout by next week. But, meanwhile, people are being urged to stick to social distancing rules as the deadly virus continues to cause havoc. “Today we learnt that we have more patients with Covid in hospital than ever before in England. This is not a drill. Please believe us,” Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, president of the Doctors’ Association UK, said on Twitter in a widely shared social media post about the severity of the new pandemic peak and the pressures it is piling on the over-stretched NHS. “We are incredibly thin on the ground. NHS staff have not been prioritised for the vaccine and are going off sick in droves with the new strain. Trusts are so desperate they are tweeting out for medical students to help in ICU. This was confirmed by a consultant on the ground,” she said. Medical director of Public Health England (PHE) Dr Yvonne Doyle said the “very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable”. “We have all made huge sacrifices this year but we must all continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus which is still replicating fast,” she urged. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are similarly at risk of becoming overwhelmed. On Monday, a record 41,385 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the UK, though it is thought the infection rate was higher around March-April when testing was much more limited. There is growing pressure on ministers to extend the Christmas and New Year holiday break for schools even as UK Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he was “confident” the staggered return to secondary schools in England could go ahead as planned. Members of the armed forces will be on standby to help roll out mass testing at secondary schools and colleges in England from next month, as announced previously. Around 1,500 personnel will give planning support, training and phone advice to English schools needing help with the testing process and setting up facilities. Each secondary school and college in England will be offered testing, with 78 million pounds allocated to support this, the government has said, adding that schools will be given the kits they need. In most cases, students will be expected to swab themselves under supervision of a school staff member or volunteer who has been trained for the role. The military support of the programme begins this week and will consist mostly of webinars and meetings, although there will be teams capable of deploying at short notice to provide closer support if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hospitals-being-overwhelmed-by-new-covid-19-peak-officials/story-RaqKz8PlwXiCUtpYIjFVhO.html

The EMA did not respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-is-asked-to-approve-extra-dose-from-pfizer-vaccine-vials/story-nFWMX7fhxOsugPSl3p2oQN.html

However, auction bids are highly unpredictable and can sometimes go up to two or three times the higher estimate given by the auctioneer. This is especially true in the age of 24-hour global online auctions, Covid or no Covid.Gandhi heirlooms -- letters, photographs, portraits, books, sandals, spectacles among other items -- attract collectors of all sorts, both institutions and individuals, throughout the world. Items personally used by Gandhi are, however, rare at auctions. The present set of bowl and cutlery have excellent provenance. It comes from the collection of one-time shipping magnate Sumati Morarjee, a well-known devotee of Mahatma Gandhi.According to the East Bristol Auctioneer’s catalogue, “The set was used by Gandhi during his incarceration at Aga Khan Palace in Pune (1942-1944) and at the Palm Bun House in Mumbai. The bowl of simple metal construction, stamped 208/42 to base, with a scalloped form leading to a flat base (approx. 21cm diameter). The cutlery comprising a wooden fork and two carved wooden spoons are also of a simple form, in the traditional manner (approx. 16cm long).”“All were, by repute, used daily by Gandhi and originally came from the collection of Sumati Morarjee a long-time friend and supporter of Gandhi, who cared for him on a number of occasions. The items are documented in the book Sumati Morarjee Felicitation (1970) and also in Vithalbhai Jhaveri’s epic film biography ‘Gandhi’. A full letter of provenance and history is supplied with the lot. An incredibly important set of historical artefacts, not only relating to Gandhi, but to the history of India,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahatma-gandhi-s-bowl-cutlery-to-be-auctioned-in-uk/story-etD3fNKg4r2771tMCyRYJI.html
29-12-2020||World||UK can avert new catastrophe, needs tighter rules, epidemiologist warns||Britain’s government needs to bring in tighter coronavirus lockdown rules to avert a fresh wave of deaths from a new strain of the disease, a leading epidemiologist and government advisor warned on Tuesday.Britain reported 41,385 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the highest number since testing became widely available in the middle of 2020, and English hospitals say they have more Covid-19 patients than during the first wave of the pandemic in April. “We are entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic, and we’re going to need decisive early national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February,” said Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London.More than 71,000 people in Britain have died within 28 days of a positive test for the disease.Hayward, who sits on a British government advisory body on respiratory diseases, said the new strain of COVID that infected people more easily meant existing lockdown measures in England were unlikely to be enough to slow the spread of the disease.On December 26 Britain’s government expanded the strictest level of COVID restrictions, under which non-essential retailers are shut and people mostly cannot meet in person, to cover almost half of England’s population.Hayward told the BBC that these curbs needed to be extended further.“We’re really looking at a situation where we’re moving into near-lockdown,” he said.Schools in England are due to reopen for many pupils on Jan. 4. Hayward said that from a purely epidemiological point of view it would make sense to keep them closed longer, but difficulties poorer pupils faced learning online meant curbs on other areas of public life might be preferable. Authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own policies on schools and measures to combat COVID.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-can-avert-new-catastrophe-needs-tighter-rules-epidemiologist-warns/story-FiZkYpVJC6Gl8QJy90RjrO.html

The government has previously said students facing public exams this year will return on Jan. 4, with other pupils back later in the month.But a growing number of unions, politicians and scientists called for more time to prepare testing to prevent infections in schools. The number of new cases in the UK surged to a daily record of more than 41,000 on Monday and hospitalizations exceeded the peak recorded in the first wave in the spring, as a more virulent strain of the virus takes hold.Johnson has made keeping schools open a key priority as he looks for ways to kick start the economy after months of restrictions left it facing its worst downturn for 300 years. Ministers threatened legal action to stop schools offering home learning before Christmas, but the government on Tuesday left open the possibility of that position being reversed in the new year.“We are planning for that staggered opening, but we keep all measures under constant review as we have done throughout the pandemic,” Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, told reporters when asked about the potential for delay. He declined to rule out a future policy shift.Schools should remain closed for “a week or two” to ensure testing is effective, Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis chain of academy schools, told BBC radio on Tuesday. His intervention followed similar calls for a delay from the National Education Union on Monday.Demanding a Pause“We would ask government to pause, to come up with a clear strategy for the continuity of education,” Chalke said. “We think that if you really care about kids you would do this well -- to invest now, to give time now makes sense.”Roger Gale, a member of Parliament in Johnson’s Conservative Party, said schools should remain closed until vaccines have been made available to teachers. But Davies said there is no plan to add teachers to the list of the most vulnerable people receiving shots in the first round of vaccinations.“Education is important, but so are the lives and well-being of teachers,” Gale, the MP for North Thanet, said on Twitter.Since the fallout from the decision to close schools in March, which led to the cancellation of exams and a furore over university admissions in the summer, ministers have repeatedly said education must continue even if other parts of society and the economy have to close to accommodate it.New StrainBut the government’s pandemic strategy has been uprooted in recent weeks by the emergence of a new strain of the virus, which has spread rapidly in London and surrounding areas and led many countries to block arrivals from the UK.The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies told Johnson to keep secondary schools closed in January and to consider another national lockdown, Politico reported Monday, citing an adviser familiar with the matter.The group said a lockdown on the same terms as November may not be enough to control the new strain of the virus, according to the report.Ministers and officials will meet later Tuesday to discuss a review of England’s regional coronavirus tiers, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock will make a statement in Parliament on Wednesday outlining any changes, which could include tougher curbs in some regions.National restrictions are needed to prevent a “catastrophe” at the start of year, a member of the government’s advisory group on new respiratory virus threats -- which itself advises SAGE -- told the BBC on Tuesday.“We are entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic and we’re going to need decisive, early, national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February,” said Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London. “Previous levels of restrictions that worked before won’t work now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-army-to-help-covid-19-tests-as-pm-faces-school-pressure/story-LhzuqtROjTQGmoJQjFCw0I.html

The temblor was felt throughout the country and in neighbouring Serbia and Bosnia. It even was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Associated Press cited the Austria Press Agency as reporting.The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude hit 46 kilometres (17 miles) southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday and several smaller aftershocks were felt on Tuesday.Croatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk, according to AP, described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky, old buildings and move to the newer areas of the city because of the aftershocks.Here is what we know so far:1. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake hit at a depth of 10 km (6 miles). The N1 news channel reported that the epicentre was in the town of Petrinja, 50 km from Croatia’s capital Zagreb.2. Associated Press cited regional N1 television reporting live from the town of Petrinja, which was hard-hit in the Monday quake, that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. 3. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris to reach the car, which was buried underneath. A man and a small boy were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance.4. Streets in Petrinja were littered with fallen bricks and dust and many houses were completely destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation.5. Croatian media said people were injured by the quake, but could not initially say how many amid the confusion and downed phone lines.6. In Zagreb, people ran out into the streets and parks in fear. Many reportedly were leaving the city, ignoring a travel ban imposed because of the coronavirus outbreak.7. Slovenia’s Krsko nuclear power plant was shut down as a precaution after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake was registered in Croatia, the plant’s spokesperson said.8. Krsko is Slovenia’s sole nuclear power plant and lies about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of the capital Ljubljana. The current 700-megawatt Westinghouse reactor was built in the former Yugoslavia and went into service in 1983. It is co-owned by Slovenia and Croatia.9. On Monday, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia, also near Petrinja. In March, an earthquake of magnitude 5.3 hit Zagreb causing one death and injuring 27 people. 10. The earthquake in March had caused $6 billion in damage when it hit the capital Zagreb.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-earthquake-strikes-croatia-here-s-what-we-know-so-far/story-gMwsS7cyoTaRGvDzm2dZsI.html

That confirms a trend noted by the group since 2016, when only four out of 10 deaths were in countries not at war.Targeted killings of journalists surged in 2020, accounting for 84% of deaths, sharply up from 63% in 2019, the group said.It again listed Mexico as the deadliest country for media workers, counting at least eight journalists killed there in connection with their work in 2020. Among them was Julio Valdivia, a newspaper reporter whose decapitated body was found in September in an area ridden with organized crime.Among six media deaths that the group counted in Iraq was the killing in July of Hisham al-Hashimi, a leading expert on the Islamic State and other armed groups, who was shot dead outside his Baghdad home.Reporters Without Borders also noted an increase in the killings of investigative journalists, including four who were looking into organized crime groups, 10 who were reporting on corruption and the misuse of public funds and three who were working on environmental issues including illegal mining and land grabs.Reporting on civil unrest also proved particularly deadly, the group said, with seven journalists killed while covering protests — four of them in Iraq, two in Nigeria and one in Colombia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/targeted-killings-of-journalists-surged-in-2020-68-killed-outside-war-zones-report/story-duJeXkliRsox4lKvsqlzSN.html

29-12-2020||World||Strong 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocks central Croatia; 1 dead||A strong earthquake hit central Croatia on Tuesday, causing major damage to homes and other buildings in a town southeast of the capital. Authorities said a girl was killed and at least 20 people were injured in the quake.The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings.The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday and several smaller aftershocks were felt Tuesday.Officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people southeast of the capital that was hit hardest by the earthquake. At least 20 people were hospitalized with injuries, two with serious ones, they said.“The center of Petrinja as it used to be no longer exists,” Croatria’s state HRT television said in its report. “One girl died and there are injuries and people inside collapsed buildings.”“My town has been completely destroyed. We have dead children,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dumbovic said in a statement broadcast by HRT TV. “This is like Hiroshima - half of the city no longer exists.”“The city has been demolished, the city is no longer livable,” he said. “We need help.”Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and other government ministers arrived in Petrinja after the earthquake.“They are searching through the rubble to see if there is anyone else there,’’ Plenkovic said. “The biggest part of central Petrinja is in a red zone, which means that most of the buildings are not usable.”He said the army has 500 places ready in barracks to house people, while others will be accommodated in nearby hotels and other available places.“No one must stay out in the cold tonight,” the prime minister said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that she spoke with Plenkovic and instructed an envoy to travel to Croatia as soon as possible.As a Mediterranean country, Croatia is prone to earthquakes, but not big ones. The last strong quake struck in the 1990’s when the picturesque Adriatic coast village of Ston was destroyed.Regional TV channel N1 reported live Tuesday from Petrinja that a collapsed building had fallen on a car. The footage showed firefighters trying to remove the debris to reach the car, which was buried underneath. A man and a small boy eventually were rescued from the car and carried into an ambulance.Fallen bricks and dust littered the streets, and many houses were completely destroyed. The Croatian military was deployed in Petrinja to help with the rescue operation.Also Read| Croatia earthquake: Slovenia shuts nuclear plant as a precautionary measureCroatian seismologist Kresimir Kuk described the earthquake as “extremely strong,” far stronger than another one that hit Zagreb and nearby areas in the spring. He warned people to keep out of potentially shaky, old buildings and to move to the newer areas of the city because of the aftershocks.In the capital, people ran out into the streets and parks in fear. Many reportedly were leaving Zagreb, ignoring a travel ban imposed because of the coronavirus outbreak.The earthquake was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and Slovenia. It even was felt as far away as Graz in southern Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported.Authorities in Slovenia said the Krsko nuclear power plant was temporarily shut down following the earthquake. The power plant is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia and located near their border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-6-3-magnitude-earthquake-rocks-central-croatia-damage-reported/story-pKc2XZeNJ7TrKRlmPdDnhO.html
29-12-2020||World||China readies Plan B for Nepal Communist Party if PM Oli doesn’t play ball||The Communist Party of China team tasked to unite the two rival factions of Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda may not have made much of headway, people familiar with the matter said after the group led by Prachanda stepped up attacks on PM Oli on Tuesday for dissolving parliament’s House of Representatives and calling fresh elections.Former prime ministers Prachanda, Madhav Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal - the three communist party leaders who are fronting the attacks on PM Oli - are also set to address a joint rally against PM Oli.The joint rally comes a day after the three had separate meetings with the visiting Chinese delegation led by Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee.Guo Yezhou and his team were deputed to visit Nepal by President Xi Jinping to stop the ruling communist party in Nepal from splitting.Last week, PM Oli dissolved parliament in a surprise move that he later explained was designed to pre-empt his rivals within the party from moving a no-confidence motion against him. It was seen as a precursor to the split of the NCP that was formed in 2018 with the merger of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.China’s Guo Yezhou, who is believed to have helped the two parties merge in 2018, was sent by President Xi to help the two factions reconcile their differences. Guo Yezhou landed on Sunday and hours later, met President Bidya Bhandari and PM KP Sharma Oli.Yesterday, he met the three former PMs from the rival camp - Prachanda, Madhav Nepal and Jhananath Khanal - and Janata Samajbadi Party boss Baburam Bhattarai.On Tuesday, the Chinese delegation met former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who heads the country’s largest opposition party Nepali Congress.Nepal watchers said the Chinese delegation, which had started by exploring the possibility of keeping the communist party in Kathmandu appeared to have concluded that the differences between the two rival factions were irreconcilable and had also discussed the possibility of an arrangement between the communist party faction led by Prachanda and Madhav Nepal and other political parties such as the Nepali Congress and Janata Samajbadi Party in case parliament’s dissolution is rolled back by the Supreme Court.PM Oli had stunned the Chinese at their meeting on Sunday when he declined a suggestion that his cabinet should rescind its recommendation to the President to dissolve Parliament“In China’s Plan B, it seems PM Oli is the common enemy,” a diplomat who tracks developments in Nepal said, indicating that PM Oli’s rivals could be expected to aim at PM Oli’s credentials. PM Oli had led the communist party to victory in the 2017 elections on the basis of a nationalist agenda.“There will be an attempt to erode his credibility over the next few weeks and months,” the diplomat added.China has rebutted criticism around interference in Nepal’s internal affairs, insisting that Guo Yezhou’s team was only in Kathmandu to deepen relations between political parties of the two countries.“As the country’s friend and close neighbor, we hope relevant parties in Nepal can take into account the national interests and the big picture, properly manage internal differences and commit themselves to political stability and national development,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-readies-plan-b-for-nepal-communist-party-if-pm-oli-doesn-t-play-ball/story-HFQ57iUBBdv3BGBkAnbJoN.html

Inoculations will also be provided to people with chronic diseases aged 18 or above, and to frontline workers.The second phase is set to begin in April, and would be open to all citizens and residents, Khaja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-aims-to-vaccinate-70-of-population-by-2021-end-report/story-9s8kvIUmf68dDgWkGRQmyM.html
29-12-2020||World||First confirmed case of new Covid-19 strain detected in Pakistan||Pakistan on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus variant found in the UK after it identified the strain that spreads at a much faster pace in three samples taken from passengers who had returned from Britain. The health department in Sindh said the samples of 12 returnees were taken for genotyping, out of which six tested positive. “Samples of 3 UK returnees show a 95 per cent match to the new coronavirus variant from the UK in the first phase of genotyping,” it said in a tweet. The health department said that the provincial government was tracing contacts of these patients, and all those who came in contact with them were being isolated. The new variant is considered as 70 per cent more transmissible and has sparked concerns around the world. The development came as Pakistan extended a ban on the UK flights till January 4. The ban was announced on December 21. Several countries have closed their borders with the UK and suspended flights amid growing concerns of an “out of control” new variant of coronavirus spreading at a much faster pace in parts of England. The new variant is said to be 70 per cent more transmissible, though health experts say there is no evidence that it is more deadly or would react differently to vaccines. Meanwhile, 63 more people have died in Pakistan in the last 24 hours, taking the Covid-19 death toll to 9,992. Another 2,259 patients were in critical conditions, according to the Ministry of National Health Services. The total number of Covid-19 infections have reached 475,085 after 1,776 new cases were detected across the country. A total of 425,494 people have recovered, it said. The authorities carried out 30,666 tests in the last 24 hours, registering a positivity rate of 5.44 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-confirmed-case-of-new-covid-19-strain-detected-in-pakistan/story-TFLSMYU6WRJ8yToNQfIeyJ.html
29-12-2020||World||China’s capital locks down part of district in coronavirus fight||Beijing sealed off 10 areas of its northeastern Shunyi district on Tuesday, the first lockdown in the Chinese capital since the last coronavirus outbreak in the months of June and July. The city has reported 16 infections and three asymptomatic cases since December 18, when the first cases were found. Most of the cases were in Shunyi, which has banned couriers from entering residential compounds.Six villages, three buildings and one industrial zone were among the areas locked down, a Beijing municipal official told a news conference.While Beijing’s new cases are modest in number compared with June and July, municipal authorities have beefed up steps to rein in the coronavirus, which has surfaced in three districts, where hundreds of thousands of residents have been tested. “The capital’s COVID prevention and control (efforts) need to initiate emergency mode,” a city spokesman said at the news conference.The Beijing government said it was cancelling large-scale gatherings such as temple fairs and sporting events, and controlling the size of offline events such as annual parties. On Sunday, it said it would increase the number of carriages in the metro system to spread out commuters, and limit attendance at scenic spots and entertainment venues to 75% of capacity.Live music events have been cancelled and a New Year’s Day light show called off. Educational institutions, from primary schools to the prestigious Tsinghua University have barred unnecessary entry of outsiders. Students of primary schools and some from middle schools will also start winter holidays by up to two weeks earlier next month, a peak travel period before the Lunar New Year in mid-February. Beijing has also urged residents to stay home during the holidays, with officials in its northern district of Yanqing turning on loudspeakers to advise residents not to travel outside the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-capital-locks-down-part-of-district-in-coronavirus-fight/story-xaYZz3hGny4dEzpzgwJKwK.html
29-12-2020||World||EU-China investment deal likely this week, officials say||China and the European Union are likely to clinch a deal this week that would give EU firms better access to the Chinese market, improve competition conditions and protect EU investment in China, European officials said on Monday.Talks on the investment deal began in 2014, but were stuck for years as the EU said China was failing to make good on promises to lift curbs on EU investment despite a pledge to open up the world’s second largest economy. But tensions in trade relations between the United States and China may have helped change the Chinese position and bring about a deal between Beijing and Brussels, officials said.“The talks are about to be concluded. It’s looking good. There are only some minor details left which need to be hammered out,” an EU official with knowledge of the talks told Reuters.“As things stand now, the political agreement between the EU and China will be sealed on Wednesday.” Other officials close to the talks said that under the deal China would open up its manufacturing sector to EU companies, as well as construction, advertising, air transport, maritime services, telecoms and, to some extent, cloud computing.“We get much better market access and the protection of our investments in China. Better market access is something we have been working for for many years, and the Chinese have made quite a big step towards us,” a senior EU official said.Talks on investment protection, however, are likely to continue next year and be concluded later, according to an agreed timeline. If there is political agreement on the deal on Wednesday, its transposition into legal texts could take several months. Together with the ratification process, that could mean it will be about year before it is implemented, officials said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular news briefing on Tuesday that talks had made huge progress and that China hopes a deal can come to fruition “at an early date”.The negotiations have been conducted by the European Commission, which handles all external trade issues for the 27-nation bloc, with the aim of getting the same access for EU firms that Chinese companies already have to the EU market.The investment agreement also prohibits forced transfer of technologies by EU firms that establish themselves in China, and contains measures to discipline Chinese state-owned companies when it comes to competition on the Chinese market and rules on the transparency of state subsidies to Chinese enterprises.Under the agreement, China will also pledge to subscribe to the International Labour Organisation’s rules on forced labour.China wanted access to the EU’s energy market, but given sensitivities over national security, the Commission offered Beijing access to only a small part of the renewable energy sector, and only on a reciprocal basis, the officials said.Ambassadors of EU governments in Brussels discussed the agreement on Monday, and no country had any major problems with it, the officials said. Poland suggested the EU should wait to discuss the deal with the new US administration of President-elect Joe Biden, they added, but other countries did not share this view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-china-investment-deal-likely-this-week-officials/story-pkz3JRzZTnqdUVM0hUhszJ.html
29-12-2020||World||Will Covid-19 vaccines work on the new coronavirus variant? Here’s what experts think||Will Covid-19 vaccines work on the new coronavirus variant?Experts believe so, but they’re working to confirm that.A coronavirus variant in the United Kingdom has caused alarm because of the possibility that it might spread more easily. But even if that turns out to be true, experts say the Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out will likely still work on the variant.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said data coming from Britain indicates the vaccines still will block the virus. But the US also will do tests to be sure.Viruses often undergo small changes as they reproduce and move through a population. In fact, the slight modifications are how scientists track the spread of a virus from one place to another.But if a virus mutates significantly enough, one worry is that current vaccines might no longer offer as much protection. And although that’s a possibility to watch for over time with the coronavirus, experts say they don’t believe it will be the case with the variant in the UK.“My expectation is, this will not be a problem,” said Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser for the US government’s Covid-19 vaccine push.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-covid-19-vaccines-work-on-the-new-coronavirus-variant-here-s-what-experts-think/story-jTGSWyh6bq82VZcyQQiKFM.html
29-12-2020||World||Britain must vaccinate two million a week to prevent third Covid-19 wave: Study||Britain must vaccinate two million people a week to avoid a third wave of the coronavirus outbreak, a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) has concluded.The UK has had more than 71,000 deaths from the coronavirus and has recorded over 2.3 million cases of Covid-19 infections as of late Monday, according to a Reuters tally.“The most stringent intervention scenario with tier 4 England-wide and schools closed during January and 2 million individuals vaccinated per week, is the only scenario we considered which reduces peak ICU burden below the levels seen during the first wave”, the study said.“In the absence of substantial vaccine roll-out, cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths in 2021 may exceed those in 2020.”An accelerated uptake of two million vaccinated per week “is predicted to have a much more substantial impact”, it added. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed.Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his scientific advisers have said a variant of the coronavirus, which could be up to 70% more transmissible, was spreading rapidly in Britain, although it is not thought to be more deadly or to cause more serious illness.That prompted tight social mixing restrictions measures for London and southeast England, while plans to ease curbs over Christmas across the nation were dramatically scaled back or scrapped altogether.Media reports over the weekend said that the United Kingdom will roll out the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine from Jan. 4, with its approval by the country’s medical regulator expected within days.Earlier this month, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to roll out the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech.The British government said on Thursday that 600,000 people in the United Kingdom have received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine since inoculations began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-must-vaccinate-two-million-a-week-to-prevent-third-covid-19-wave-study/story-dgEZunWaDrHgPl2HBtlUPN.html

Both deals will include the option to procure an additional 50 million doses from each company.The country that’s grappling with Southeast Asia’s worst coronavirus outbreak has signed multiple deals with vaccine suppliers, including with China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. that has already shipped 1.3 million doses in early December. The first available shots will be gradually deployed to its 1.3 million health workers across the world’s largest archipelago once the vaccine is approved by the local food and drug regulator.AstraZeneca’s vaccines are set to be delivered to Indonesia starting from the second quarter of next year, while Pfizer’s shots will be sent from as early as July, with both shipments to end in the first quarter of 2022, Sadikin said.The government is calling on Indonesians to limit their movement during the first 10 days of 2021 as authorities brace for a spike in coronavirus infections after year-end festivities. Indonesia has expanded its entry ban on foreigners through mid-January on concern over a virus strain that may be more transmissible, even if it has found no evidence that the variant has arrived in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-to-sign-covid-19-vaccine-deals-with-pfizer-astrazeneca/story-nxEwRIUs2XvtqEf6nn6qsN.html

Addressing a gathering of JUI-F workers in Tank on Monday, Fazlur Rehman said the incumbent government did not have the right to stay in office as it is a “product of fraud”, Geo News reported.“This illegitimate government is a product of fraud,” he said, adding that the country belongs to everyone and that it was not anyone’s personal property.“I am bound by the oath I have taken [...] In this situation, we have to do principled politics,” Fazl said, adding that all Opposition parties were on the same page that the 2018 general elections were “rigged”.“Pakistan is facing internal and external problems,” Fazlur Rehman said, adding that the state would be strong when its economic conditions improved.Fazlur Rehman’s remarks come a day after several political leaders of the PDM addressed crowds gathered on Sunday at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh in Larkana to commemorate the 13th death anniversary of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.Fazlur Rehman, who is also the chief of the PM, said the next meeting of the leadership of the alliance will be held on January 1 in Lahore to formulate its future strategy.The PDM has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan till January 31 and in case of no resignation, it has announced a long march.

29-12-2020||World||Spain to create register of people who refuse Covid-19 vaccine||Spain will create a register of people who refuse to get a Covid-19 vaccine, part of European efforts to counter public resistance to the new shots.While the register will be shared with other European partners, it won’t be made public, Health Minister Salvador Illa said in an interview with La Sexta television on Monday. Taking the vaccine is voluntary in Spain and the data will be “treated with the utmost respect for data protection,” Illa said.On Monday, Spain became the fourth European country to record more than 50,000 coronavirus deaths. The country has been hit particularly hard by the virus, forcing the government to impose a state of emergency in March. When it emerged from a strict national lockdown three months later, management of the pandemic was placed in the hands of regional governments.While Spain has ordered restrictions on movement and a curfew as cases increase again, the government hasn’t imposed a strict lockdown like those seen in the UK and France in recent weeks.The number of people dying from the virus has been slowing since November, according to Fernando Simon, the head of Spain’s medical emergency response center. However, data gathered over the holiday period can have gaps in reporting, he said at a press conference on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-to-create-a-register-of-people-who-refuse-covid-19-caccine/story-JycSKU2KJUp5vIUlqKkXuO.html
29-12-2020||World||Bangladesh navy ships shift 1,700 Rohingya refugees to isolated island||Five Bangladesh navy ships carrying more than 1,700 Rohingya refugees left the southeastern port city of Chittagong on Tuesday for an isolated island where they will be relocated despite concerns among human rights groups about their safety.The refugees were expected to reach Bhashan Char island after a three-hour naval journey, a government official involved with the process said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the refugees were taken to Chittagong from their camps in Cox’s Bazar by buses on Monday and stayed overnight in a temporary camp.Authorities insist the refugees were selected for relocation based on their willingness, and that no pressure was applied on them. But several human rights and activist groups say some were forced to go to the island, located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland.The island surfaced only 20 years ago and was not previously inhabited. It was regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.The island’s facilities are designed to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district.Authorities sent a first group of 1,642 Rohingya to the island on Dec. 4 despite calls for a halt by human rights groups.International aid agencies and the U.N. have opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The United Nations also voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have urged the government to cancel the plan.An influential Cabinet minister and general secretary of the governing party, Obaidul Quader, said Monday that the Rohingya are being moved to the island because their repatriation to Myanmar has been delayed. He said refugees who were earlier taken to Bhashan Char have expressed satisfaction.About 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after August 2017, when Myanmar’s military began a harsh crackdown on the minority group following an attack by insurgents. Security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and burning thousands of homes.Bangladesh has attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral agreement, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other state-sanctioned discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-navy-ships-take-1-700-rohingya-to-isolated-island/story-pmaEOhPnXhkNbAwHxvflyJ.html

29-12-2020||World||Biden slams Chinese abuses, stresses security and prosperity in Indo-Pacific||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday slammed China once again for “abuses” on trade, technology and human rights and said America can best pursue its goals relative to Beijing, which include “security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region” when it is “flanked” by like-minded partners and allies.He reiterated his plans to pivot away from outgoing President Donald Trump’s unilateral America First strategy and focus instead on “rebuilding our alliances to close ranks with our partners and bring to bear the full benefits of our shared strength for the American people”.Biden’s remarks on China, which will be scrutinised closely both at home in the US and abroad in India, Japan and Australia for clarity on how he will run this most crucial relationship, came after a meeting with his team of foreign policy and national security nominees and officials of his transition team.“(As) we compete with China and hold China’s government accountable for its abuses on trade, technology, human rights, and other fronts, our position will be much stronger when we build coalitions of like-minded partners and allies to make common cause with us in defence of our shared interests and values,” the president-elect said.He added, “On any issue that matters to the US-China relationship — from pursuing a foreign policy for the middle class, including a trade and economic agenda that protects American workers, our intellectual property, and the environment — to ensuring security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, to championing human rights — we are stronger and more effective when we are flanked by nations that share our vision for the future of our world.”The incoming president has spoken before of China’s abusive trade practices — in an interview to The New York Times — in which he indicated he will keep Trump’s restrictive tariffs in place for now. He intends to seek “leverage” in the relationship first by ramping up American economy.Biden has also triggered nervousness among some China watchers who fear he may opt for a conciliatory approach that could encourage China to step up its expansionism, as seen widely in the South China Sea and most recently along the border with India, and in its relationship with Australia.Biden’s use of the phrase “Asia-Pacific” in the past has been a cause for concern, because China prefers it to “Indo-Pacific”. Global Times, the state-controlled Chinese media outlet, said recently, “‘Asia-Pacific’ involves economic and cooperative connotations, while the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ is directly associated with geopolitical competition and alliance confrontation. The publication went on to call, in the same editorial piece, for Biden to abandon Indo-Pacific for Asia-Pacific.Biden has indeed used the term “Asia-Pacific” a few times recently after election but he has also gone with “Indo-Pacific”. Brahma Chellaney, an Indian strategic analyst, has found it more disconcerting, as he wrote in The Japan Times recently, that Biden has switched from “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”, a strategic construct coined by Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe and adopted by many countries including India since, to an undefined and unspecified “Secure and Prosperous Indo-Pacific (or variations of it)”.Richard Fontaine, a former Bush administration diplomat who now is CEO of the Center for New American Security, an independent and bipartisan think-tank, said the president-elect’s use of the term Indo-Pacific “was welcome” but “more striking was his calling out Beijing for tech abuses, and his framing the need to cooperate with partners as a necessary element of a competitive China strategy.”He added: “(It) sends a message, I think, that the new administration will be quite clear eyed about the China challenge.” Fontaine was a foreign policy adviser to late Senator John McCain, the widely respected Republican who ran for president and lost to Barack Obama, served in the state department in the administration of Republican president George W Bush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-slams-chinese-abuses-stresses-security-and-prosperity-in-indo-pacific/story-vzc4w6SkjF3Z7sM9V4tKbN.html
29-12-2020||World||Russia admits to world’s third-worst coronavirus death toll||Russia on Monday said its coronavirus death toll was more than three times higher than it had previously reported, making it the country with the third-largest number of fatalities.For months President Vladimir Putin has boasted about Russia’s low fatality rate from the virus, saying earlier this month that it had done a “better” job at managing the pandemic than western countries.But since early in the pandemic, some Russian experts have said the government was playing down the country’s outbreak.On Monday Russian officials admitted that was true.The Rosstat statistics agency said that the number of deaths from all causes recorded between January and November had risen by 229,700 compared to the previous year.“More than 81 percent of this increase in mortality over this period is due to Covid,” said Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova, meaning that over 186,000 Russians have died from Covid-19.Russian health officials have registered more than three million infections since the start of the pandemic, putting the country’s caseload at fourth-highest in the world.But they have only reported 55,265 deaths -- a much lower fatality rate than in other badly hit countries.Russia has been criticised for only listing Covid deaths where an autopsy confirms the virus was the main cause.Alexei Raksha, a demographer who left Rosstat in July, told AFP last week that the Russian health ministry and the consumer health ministry falsify coronavirus numbers.Rosstat’s new figures mean that Russia now has the world’s third-highest Covid-19 death toll behind the United States with 333,140 and Brazil with 191,139, according to an AFP count.The figures came as authorities hold out against reimposing a nationwide lockdown in the hopes of buttressing a struggling economy even as the country is battered by a second wave of infections.Russia’s government predicts the economy will shrink by 3.9 percent this year, while the Central Bank expects an even deeper decline.During his annual end-of-year press conference earlier this month, Putin rejected the idea of imposing the kind of lockdown many European countries introduced going into the Christmas holidays.“If we follow the rules and demands of health regulators, then we do not need any lockdowns,” he said.While strict measures have been imposed in some major cities, authorities in many regions have limited restrictions to mask-wearing in public spaces and reducing mass gatherings.But many Russians flout social distancing rules and in recent weeks the country’s outbreak has overwhelmed poorly funded hospitals in the regions.- Vaccine scepticism -Russia has instead pinned its hopes on coralling its outbreak by vaccinating people en masse with its homemade Sputnik V jab, named after the Soviet-era satellite.The country launched a mass vaccination programme earlier this month, first inoculating high-risk workers aged between 18 and 60 without chronic illnesses.Over the weekend people older than 60 got the green light to receive the shot.On Monday Sputnik V’s developer, the state-run Gamaleya research centre, said that around 700,000 doses had so far been released for domestic use.However Russia has not said how many people it has vaccinated so far, and according to recent surveys by state-run pollster VTsIOM and the Levada polling agency only 38 percent of Russians plan to get the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-admits-to-world-s-third-worst-coronavirus-death-toll/story-rZIkSRDxI5aNMmefore3DJ.html

Thus far, most countries have given emergency use authorisation (EUA) to the vaccine candidate of either Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE or Moderna, or both. Several other candidates, like Oxford University-AstraZeneca’s, meanwhile, are either close to being approved or are in the final-stage of trials.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere are some latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. In India, officials of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) are likely to meet this week to take a call upon the Serum Institute of India’s (SII) EUA application for the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, Covishield. No vaccine has been given EUA in India thus far. Tuesday also marks the second and final day of a Covid-19 vaccination “dry run” in four states.Also Read | Expert panel may convene this week to examine Oxford vaccine emergency-use authorisation2. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency on Tuesday reported that the country would sign a deal with Moderna Inc for vaccines for 20 million people. The report came on a day the government unveiled a fresh $8.49 billion package to fight a third wave of the coronavirus outbreak. Also on Tuesday, the country reported its highest single-day Covid-19 death toll of 40, taking total fatalities to 859.3. The United States’ National Institute of Health (NIH) on Monday announced the commencement of phase 3 trials of the vaccine candidate of Novovax, an American biotech firm, in both the US and Mexico. A phase 3 trial of the candidate, named NVX-CoV2373, is currently underway in the United Kingdom as well. Incidentally, vaccination drives are already underway in all the three countries.4. Brazil’s Fiocruz medical institute on Monday said that it will file an EUA application for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with the country’s health regulator, Anvisa, on January 15. Also on Monday, President Jair Bolsonaro proclaimed that any vaccine, which receives approval from Anvisa, will be made available “within five days” of being granted approval.5. Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday announced that the country would receive the first batch of vaccines from China’s Sinovac this week. The country has agreed to buy 50 million doses of the vaccine, CoronaVac, which, last week, was found to be 91.25% effective in Turkey. Erdogan also announced that Turkey had worked on “eight vaccines thus far.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-india-likely-to-decide-on-first-vaccine-this-week-south-korea-seeks-moderna-s-candidate/story-BcoIFalI7t0E7p8Y8LatTP.html

Outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people.Australia has largely avoided the high infections and deaths from the novel coronavirus compared with many other developed countries. It has recorded just over 28,300 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Sam Holmes)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-on-alert-after-mystery-covid-19-cases-detected-outside-current-cluster/story-tmgjLAEe6W0KXt5wbScauL.html
29-12-2020||World||Influential figures who passed away in 2020||Along with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis that has killed over 1.8 million people worldwide, destroyed economies and brought to the fore the inadequacies of health systems, the world will remember the year 2020 for the death of many influential figures.While some figures lost their battles to coronavirus, others died of natural causes. From Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Pranab Mukherjee the list of people this year took away is long.

29-12-2020||World||‘Return immediately or face jail’: Russia warns Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny||Russia’s prison service on Monday gave Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny a last minute ultimatum: Fly back from Germany at once and report at a Moscow office early on Tuesday morning, or be jailed if you return after that deadline. Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin’s leading critics, was airlifted to Germany for treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in what Germany and other Western nations say was an attempt to murder him with a Novichok nerve agent.Russia has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied any involvement in the incident. The Federal Prison Service (FSIN) on Monday accused Navalny of violating the terms of a suspended prison sentence he is still serving out over a conviction dating from 2014, and of evading the supervision of Russia’s criminal inspection authority.Citing an article in the British medical publication The Lancet about his treatment, it said Navalny had been discharged from hospital in Berlin on Sept. 20 and that all symptoms of what it called his illness had vanished by Oct. 12. “Therefore the convicted man is not fulfilling all of the obligations placed on him by the court, and is evading the supervision of the Criminal Inspectorate,” it said. Navalny is serving out a suspended three-and-a-half-year prison term over a theft case he says was politically-motivated. His probation period expires on Dec. 30. The prison service said in a statement late on Monday that it had summoned Navalny to report to the inspection authority and that his suspended sentence could be changed to a real jail term if his suspected violations of the terms of the suspended sentence were proven to be true. The prison service mentioned no deadline, but Navalny posted a screenshot of a message to his lawyer which said he had until 0900 on Tuesday to return and show up at a Moscow office. His spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Twitter, it was impossible for Navalny to return in time, that he was still convalescing after his poisoning, and accused the prison service of acting on orders from the Kremlin. “There’s no way he could appear at the Moscow Criminal Inspectorate tomorrow. But does the FSIN really care about common sense? They were given an order, they are fulfilling it,” she wrote. The Kremlin has said Navalny is free to return to Russia at any time like any other Russian citizen.

29-12-2020||World||US cuts military aid to El Salvador amid intense lobbying||The US is slashing foreign military aid to El Salvador despite staunchly pro-American President Nayib Bukele’s intense lobbying in Washington to counter criticism he has taken his country down an authoritarian path. Tucked into the omnibus spending bill signed on Sunday by President Donald Trump was a provision barring access for El Salvador -- as well as for neighbours Guatemala and Honduras -- to a State Department program that finances the purchase of US defense equipment. The ban is part of an initiative by House Democrats to strengthen anti-corruption efforts in Central America. While far larger security assistance channelled through the Pentagon to fight drug trafficking is not affected, it’s nonetheless a symbolic blow to the countries as they try to show progress in strengthening the rule of law, said Adam Isacson at the Washington Office on Latin America. “It basically puts these countries on the same tier as dictatorships and failed states,” said Isacson, an expert on defense spending. “Only a handful of countries aren’t eligible for this program.” Israel, Egypt and more than a dozen other countries annually receive around USD 5.6 billion through the so-called Foreign Military Financing program to fund purchases of US military equipment and services. El Salvador has received about USD 15 million through the program since 2016, including USD 1.9 million this year. Honduras and Guatemala last received such funding in 2018. Milena Mayorga, who this month became El Salvador’s ambassador in Washington, said she was surprised by the curtailment, which she said goes against decades of close military cooperation between the two countries. El Salvador was one of the few Latin American nations to join the US-led coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003 and the country’s international airport is one of just two in Latin America used by the US military to carry out anti-narcotics missions in the region. “It’s of vital importance this decision be reconsidered,” Mayorga said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Our military will always need to have certain tools to fight insecurity,” Mayorga added. Bukele took office in 2019 vowing to rescue El Salvador from the deep divisions left by uncontrolled gang violence and systemic corruption in both right- and left-wing governments that followed the end of a bloody civil war in 1992.He remains popular at home thanks to a sharp reduction in one of the world’s highest homicide rates. But in Washington he has drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans for strong-armed tactics like his decision last February to surround congress with heavily armed troops to pressure lawmakers into approving a loan to fund the fight against gangs. Mayorga said the traditional parties that have dominated El Salvador’s congress have spared no effort trying to portray Bukele as an autocrat. But she said many of the president’s initiatives, such as inviting the Organization of American States to lead a commission to investigate graft, are in line with anti-corruption concerns in the US Congress. “Right now is when we most need the US’s support,” said Mayorga, a popular former TV anchor who as a lawmaker angrily split with her conservative ARENA party to back Bukele. Bukele’s government tried to improve its standing in Washington by signing lobby contracts with three different Washington firms totalling more than $1.6 million since August. The partial ban, which was pushed by Rep. Norma Torres, a California Democrat who is the only Central American immigrant serving in Congress, was adopted by the Senate in the federal spending bill sent this month to the president.Also included in the spending plan is a provision threatening targeted sanctions on government officials in the so-called Northern Triangle countries — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — deemed to have undermined democratic institutions. It requires the president to submit in the next 180 days a public list of corrupt individuals. That is expected to include some of the region’s most-powerful politicians, some of whom have been suspected for years of ties to drug traffickers.Foreign aid to Central America has been the subject of much haggling in recent years. Trump in 2019 suspended aid to several countries over the continued flow of migrants from the region. Bukele managed to resume aid by signing an agreement to allow the US to send asylum seekers from other countries to El Salvador, paving the way for an era of close cooperation with the Trump administration. But even Trump officials in May quietly expressed concern that Bukele’s defiance of El Salvador’s congress and supreme court threatened its eligibility to receive anti-poverty assistance. President-elect Joe Biden has made Central America one of his foreign policy priorities in the Western Hemisphere and it’s unclear whether he will go along with the decision to curtail military aid to the Northern Triangle. As vice president he aggressively pushed a USD 750 million package to the region to attack the root causes of migration — poverty and violence — and as president has vowed to expand aid to USD 4 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cuts-military-aid-to-el-salvador-amid-intense-lobbying/story-9IdzZ1UNYkEbBkh8Jpb0AJ.html
29-12-2020||World||House casts bipartisan vote to override Donald Trump on defense||The House voted Monday to override Donald Trump’s veto of a $740.5 billion defense policy bill. If the Senate follows suit as expected in the waning days of Trump’s presidency, it will be the first time one of his vetoes has been surmounted.The vote was 322-87, handily exceeding the two-thirds threshold needed to override a veto, with support coming from majorities of both Democrats and Republicans. The 212 Democrats and one independent voting to override Trump were joined by 109 Republicans. The Senate is planning to start its override process Tuesday, with the final vote delayed until as late as Jan. 3 if some senators insist on running out the legislative process.Trump vetoed the annual measure because he wanted to attach an unrelated provision to eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies from liability for most content published by their users. He also took issue with the bill because it contains a provision for renaming military installations that honor Confederate generals. In his veto message, Trump called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia without clearly articulating his reasoning.“The president must end his eleventh-hour campaign of chaos, and stop using his final moments in office to obstruct bipartisan and bicameral action to protect our military and defend our security,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement after the vote.Voting to override Trump’s veto reflects a widening rift between the president and some congressional Republicans, who stood by him through previous conflicts, as his influence ebbs. More GOP lawmakers in recent weeks recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election, and many of them oppose Trump’s call for larger stimulus payments as part of pandemic relief.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said in an interview that rejection of the defense bill was an “impulsive, small-minded veto” that “was too irrational a move for Republicans to rationalize.”Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, a Republican ally of the president, said he voted to override the veto “because of the high probability that we are going to get a much worse bill for national security a month from now,” a reference to Biden’s approaching inauguration.Many of Trump’s voters remain loyal to the president, while others share Republicans’ concerns. The split comes at a dangerous time politically for the GOP -- just a week before two runoff races in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate.Troop BenefitsThe defense bill, H.R. 6395, is considered must-pass legislation because it authorizes not only billions of dollars for weapons systems, but also benefits for US troops. The measure would increase hazardous duty pay to $275 from $250 per month. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe, a Trump ally who’s now at odds with the president, called the defense measure “the most important bill of the year.”It’s a point of bipartisan pride for members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that the annual defense policy bill has been enacted without fail for the past 59 years.The president and others on the right have long accused social media platforms of censoring conservatives, something that the technology giants deny. While lawmakers from both parties have called for modifying or even eliminating Section 230, even Trump allies said it was the wrong place and the wrong time to wage that battle.The annual defense policy bill would authorize $732 billion in discretionary spending for national defense, including $69 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also authorizes funding for 93 F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp.The legislation would establish a commission to study and provide recommendations, within three years, on the removal of names, symbols, displays and monuments that honor or commemorate the Confederacy. It would also address diversity in the military ranks by requiring the removal of personal identifiers in promotion and selection pitches, a step backed by Democratic Representatives Jackie Speier of California and Anthony Brown of Maryland.The defense measure would establish a Pacific deterrence initiative intended to counter China’s influence in the region. Congress plans to authorize $2.2 billion for the new effort designed to bolster the US defense posture and weapons and alliances in the region.Lawmakers took aim at Russia with provisions including additional sanctions on Turkey for purchasing a Russian made missile defense system, as well as penalties on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-casts-bipartisan-vote-to-override-donald-trump-on-defense/story-BW5c0nJx0lFHI8cVEhP3cM.html

29-12-2020||World||US government appeals order blocking TikTok restrictions||The Trump administration on Monday appealed a federal judge’s order blocking restrictions that would have effectively barred the use of Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok in the United States.The government has cited national security concerns in its targeting of TikTok, arguing that the personal data of US users could be obtained by China’s government. TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, denies the allegation.In a Dec. 7 ruling, US District Court Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued an order that prevented the Commerce Department from barring data hosting for TikTok within the United States, content delivery services and other technical transactions that TikTok-owner Bytedance said would have prevented the use of the app in the United States.Also Read: Google, Microsoft Invest in booming India made TikTok rivalThe Justice Department said it was appealing Nichols’ order to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.A separate US appeals court is set to hear an appeal in February of an October ruling by US District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania, who blocked the same restrictions that had been set to take effect on Nov. 12. Officials briefed on the matter told Reuters it is increasingly unlikely the government will resolve the fate of TikTok in the United States before President Donald Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. There is still an outside chance a deal could be struck in January, they said.In a separate ruling in September, Nichols issued an order blocking the Commerce Department from requiring Apple Inc and Alphabet’s Google to remove the TikTok app from their stores.A US appeals court in Washington heard the government’s appeal of that ruling two weeks ago. Also Read: US not extending TikTok divestiture deadline, but talks expected to continue: ReportEarlier this month, the Trump administration opted not to grant ByteDance a new extension of an order issued by the president in August requiring the company to divest TikTok’s US assets. That gave the Justice Department the power to enforce the divestiture order once the deadline expired.In a Dec. 16 interview with Reuters, then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen declined to say if the Justice Department would seek to enforce the order.

It’s nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility,” Biden said.He warned that his team needs “full visibility” into the budget process at the Defense Department “in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch-up that our adversaries may try to exploit.” He also said they need “a clear picture of our force posture around the world and of our operations to deter our enemies.”Biden’s remarks came after he was briefed by members of his national security and defense teams and advisers, including his nominees for secretary of State, Defense and Homeland Security, as well as his incoming national security adviser. The president-elect said his team found that agencies “critical to our security have incurred enormous damage” during President Donald Trump’s time in office.“Many of them have been hollowed out in personnel, capacity and in morale,” he said. “All of it makes it harder for our government to protect the American people, to defend our vital interests in a world where threats are constantly evolving and our adversaries are constantly adapting.”Trump has still refused to concede an election he lost by more than 7 million votes, and his administration did not authorize official cooperation with the Biden transition team until Nov. 23, weeks after the election. Biden and his aides warned at the time that the delay was hampering their ability to craft their own vaccine rollout plan, but have since said cooperation on that and other issues related to Covid-19 has improved.Last week, however, Biden himself said that the Defense Department “won’t even brief us on many things” and suggested because of this, he didn’t have a complete understanding of the full scope of the recent cyberhack that breached numerous government systems.Pentagon officials pushed back on Biden’s characterization of the disconnect between the Defense Department and the Biden team. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller said in a statement that the department has conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials, and provided over 5,000 pages of documents, which is “far more than initially requested by Biden’s transition team.”Miller also said that his team is continuing to schedule meetings for the remaining weeks of the transition and “answer any and all requests for information in our purview.”Speaking Monday, Biden said they’re still gathering information about the extent of the cyberhack, but described the need to “modernize” America’s defense to deter future such attacks, “rather than continuing to over-invest in legacy systems designed to address the threats of the past.”Biden also spoke in length about the need to rebuild global alliances, which he said were necessary to combat climate change, address the Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for future epidemics, and confront the growing threat posed by China.“Right now, there’s an enormous vacuum. We’re going to have to regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find ways to work around us or without us,” he said.Trump has implemented an “America First” foreign policy that saw the US retreat from longstanding global alliances and treaties. The Trump Administration cut funding from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, withdrew from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords.The shift away from international diplomacy also precipitated an exodus of staff from key agencies, like the State Department. Trump himself has had a contentious relationship with the intelligence community, criticizing its findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy. And still other national security agencies have faced staff cuts and unstable leadership throughout Trump’s time in office as the president frequently fired his department heads with little notice, often leaving departments with acting secretaries or vacant positions in their top ranks.The situation has left what experts say is a major morale crisis throughout the federal government, and Biden said Monday that “rebuilding the full set of our instruments of foreign policy and national security is the key challenge” he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris face when they take office on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-warns-of-donald-trump-officials-roadblocks-to-transition/story-33MudxKeNGhcWHKIwQ9M8J.html
29-12-2020||World||Ohio police officer fired in fatal shooting of Black man||A white Ohio police officer was fired Monday after bodycam footage showed him fatally shooting 47-year-old Andre Hill — a Black man who was holding a cellphone — and refusing to administer first aid for several minutes.Columbus police officer Adam Coy was fired hours after a hearing was held to determine his employment, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus Jr. said in a statement.“The actions of Adam Coy do not live up to the oath of a Columbus Police officer, or the standards we, and the community, demand of our officers,” the statement read. “The shooting of Andre Hill is a tragedy for all who loved him in addition to the community and our Division of Police.”Coy remains under criminal investigation for last week’s shooting.The decision came after Pettus concluded a hearing to determine whether the actions taken by Coy in the moments before and after the fatal shooting of Hill on Tuesday were justified. The public safety director upheld the recommendation of Police Chief Thomas Quinlan, who made a video statement Christmas Eve, saying he had seen enough to recommend Coy be terminated.Quinlan expedited the investigation and bypassed procedure to file two departmental charges alleging critical misconduct against Coy in the death of Hill.“This is what accountability looks like. The evidence provided solid rationale for termination,” Quinlan said after Coy’s termination Monday afternoon. “Mr. Coy will now have to answer to the state investigators for the death of Andre Hill.”Members of the local Fraternal Order of Police attended the hearing on behalf of Coy, who was not in attendance, according to a statement from Pettus’ office.“Officer Coy was given the opportunity today to come and participate,” Brian Steel, vice president of the police union, told reporters Monday. He elected not to participate. I do not know why … I would have liked to have him here, but it’s his decision.”Coy and another officer responded to a neighbor’s nonemergency call after 1 a.m. Tuesday about a car in front of his house in the city’s northwest side that had been running, then shut off, then turned back on, according to a copy of the call released Wednesday.Mayor Andrew Ginther said it remains unclear if that car had anything to do with Hill.Police bodycam footage showed Hill emerging from a garage and holding up a cellphone in his left hand seconds before he was fatally shot by Coy. There is no audio because the officer hadn’t activated the body camera; an automatic “look back” feature captured the shooting without audio.An investigation is also being conducted into the other officers who responded to the call that ended in Hill being shot, who Quinlan said also appear to have either failed to activate their body cameras or to render Hill aid. He said any others who violated department protocols will be held accountable.Officers must activate their body cameras as soon as they are dispatched to a major incident such as a shooting, robbery or burglary, under departmental policy. Although Coy was dispatched on a non emergency call, the call became an enforcement action when the officer interacted with Hill because that was separate from the original call, said police department spokesperson Sgt. James Fuqua.In addition to an internal police investigation, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost was appointed a special prosecutor in the death of Hill on Thursday.There is also an investigation under the state’s criminal investigations unit, under Yost, with assistance from the US attorney’s office and the FBI’s Civil Rights Division.Coy, a 17-year member of the force, was relieved of duty, ordered to turn in his gun and badge, and stripped of police powers last week.The killing of Hill at the hands of Columbus police follows the fatal shooting of Casey Goodson Jr. on Dec. 4 by a white Franklin County Sheriff’s deputy. The two back-to-back shootings have resulted in an outpour of criticism from advocates and the Black community in Columbus for wider and more comprehensive police reform.“The termination of Adam Coy from Columbus Division of Police does not bring Andre Hill back to those who love him,” Ginther said in a statement Monday.He added that the actions by Coy do “not represent the values of the Columbus Division of Police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ohio-police-officer-fired-in-fatal-shooting-of-black-man/story-dMdMwVuNxfx4IoGdoReTGJ.html
29-12-2020||World||China starts ‘Hong Kong 12’ activists’ trial||A group of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists who tried to escape the city by speedboat for sanctuary in Taiwan went on trial in China on Monday as the United States urged the immediate release of dissidents it says “fled tyranny”.Ten of the so-called “Hong Kong 12” were in court in the southern city of Shenzhen to face charges linked to an illegal border crossing. Chinese authorities took them into custody after their boat was intercepted on August 23. The hearing began as scheduled on Monday afternoon and a convoy of vehicles were seen departing around four hours later. The Yantian District People’s Court said sentencing will be at a later date. Court officials stayed tight-lipped about the case, and the trial - like many in China’s opaque legal system - was not open to foreign reporters or diplomats.At least two of the group could face around seven years in jail for organising the attempted escape from a city where democracy activists last year led massive protests against Beijing’s rule.Some of the group were already facing prosecution in Hong Kong, where a draconian national security law imposed by China has largely stamped out the city’s protest movement.The United States should stop using Taiwan to meddle in China’ domestic affairs, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday, after US President Donald Trump signed into law the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020. “The determination of the Chinese government to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.The act was included in a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package Trump signed on Sunday. The act contains language objectionable to China, including US support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations bodies and regular arms sales. Taiwan welcomed the US move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-starts-hong-kong-12-activists-trial/story-Nk3DpftQV6cxcHkHA6gBkI.html
29-12-2020||World||Donald Trump administration bolsters order barring US investment in Chinese firms||The Trump administration on Monday strengthened an executive order barring US investors from buying securities of alleged Chinese military-controlled companies, following disagreement among US agencies about how tough to make the directive.The Treasury Department published guidance clarifying that the executive order, released in November, would apply to exchange-traded funds and index funds as well as subsidiaries of Chinese companies designated as owned or controlled by the Chinese military.The “frequently asked questions” release, posted on the Treasury website on Monday, came after Reuters and other news outlets reported that a debate was raging within the Trump administration over the guidance. The State Department and the Department of Defense (DOD) had pushed back against a bid by Treasury Department to water down the executive order, a source said.Specifically, some media outlets reported that Treasury was seeking to exclude Chinese companies’ subsidiaries from the scope of the White House directive, which bars new purchases of securities of 35 Chinese companies that Washington alleges are backed by the Chinese military, starting in November 2021.The guidance released on Monday specifies that the prohibitions apply to “any subsidiary of a Communist Chinese military company, after such subsidiary is publicly listed by Treasury.” It added that the agency “intends to list” publicly traded entities that are 50% or more owned by a Chinese military company or controlled by one.The list of designated companies, which was mandated by a 1999 law, currently contains 35 companies, including oil company CNOOC Ltd and China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-administration-bolsters-order-barring-us-investment-in-chinese-firms/story-Lnhhm3gcs5zRuzzkaBK2HL.html
29-12-2020||World||Saudi FM to visit Pakistan next month to discuss bilateral issues||Amid souring ties between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, a high-level Saudi delegation led by the kingdom’s foreign minister is set to pay an official visit to Islamabad in January.According to The Express Tribune report, both sides will hold discussions on several matters including the latest developments in the Middle East region, and other bilateral issues.The Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud will be accompanied by a team of Saudi businessmen and companies. Sources told the Pakistan daily that Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman will also accompany the visiting delegation, adding that the establishment of an oil refinery in Pakistan will also be deliberated upon. The Saudi FM will hold talks with country’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Arif Alvi.Back in August, the relationship between the two countries went haywire when Mehmood Qureshi openly rebuked the kingdom for its lack of support for Islamabad’s stance on the Kashmir issue.During a television talk-show, the Pakistani Foreign Minister made a statement that irked the Saudi “big brother”, where he said that Pakistan would be “compelled” to “call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir.”The remark by Pakistani Foreign Minister was not taken well by Riyadh and was seen as a veiled threat to concoct a new side against the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).In retaliation, the kingdom was quick to request the sudden repayment of a billion-dollar loan extended to Pakistan in November 2018, which was renegotiated just six months ago. Besides this, it also refused to renew a deferred oil payments scheme that was part of the same loan which was given to Islamabad when the country was trying to avoid a possible sovereign default.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-fm-to-visit-pakistan-next-month-to-discuss-bilateral-issues/story-3hTFwd1lQo20aTRwCBraFO.html
29-12-2020||World||US House approves $2,000 coronavirus aid checks sought by Trump||The Democratic-led US House of Representatives voted 275-134 to meet President Donald Trump’s demand for $2,000 Covid-19 relief checks on Monday, sending the measure on to an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate.The Republican Trump last week threatened to block a massive pandemic aid and spending package if Congress did not boost stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 and cut other spending. He backed down from his demands on Sunday as a possible government shutdown loomed, brought on by the fight with lawmakers.But Democratic lawmakers have long wanted $2,000 relief checks and used the rare point of agreement with Trump to advance the proposal - or at least to put Republicans on record against it - in the vote on Monday, less than a month before he leaves office.A total of 130 Republicans, two independents and two Democrats opposed the increase on Monday, which required two-thirds of those present and voting to pass it.Trump, who lost November’s election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden but has refused to concede defeat, finally signed the $2.3 trillion package into law after holding it up with a veiled veto threat. But he continued demanding $2,000 checks.The $2.3 trillion includes $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies and $892 billion in Covid-19 relief.It is not clear how the measure to increase aid checks will fare in the Senate, where individual Republican lawmakers have complained the higher amount would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the latest relief bill.Increasing the checks would cost $464 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which prepares cost estimates for legislation before Congress.The Senate is due to convene on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday made no mention of Senate plans for a vote, after welcoming Trump’s signing of the relief bill.The coronavirus pandemic has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States and led to widespread economic hardship, with millions of families relying on unemployment benefits and Covid-19 relief funds.Global markets were buoyed after Trump approved the package.Wall Street’s main indexes hit record highs on Monday as Trump’s signing of the aid bill bolstered bets on an economic recovery and drove gains in financial and energy stocks.House lawmakers on Monday will also seek to override Trump’s recent veto of a $740-billion bill setting policy for the Defense Department. If successful, it would be the first veto override of Trump’s presidency.Asked at the end of an event in Wilmington, Delaware, whether he supported expanding the payments to $2,000, Biden replied: “Yes.”Georgia Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who face crucial Senate runoffs next month that could determine who controls the chamber, welcomed Trump’s move, without saying whether the payments should be increased.As the floor debate was under way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Republicans have a choice, vote for this legislation, or vote to deny the American people the bigger paychecks that they need.”And Democratic US Representative Dan Kildee said: “We would have included much larger payments in the legislation had he (Trump) spoken up sooner. But it’s never too late to do the right thing.”But Republican Representative Kevin Brady said the bill does nothing to help people get back to work. “I worry that as we spend another half a trillion dollars so hastily, that we are not targeting this help to the Americans who are struggling the most and need that help,” he said.The US Treasury Department is anticipating sending the first wave of $600 stimulus checks to US individuals and households as early as this week, as previously planned, a senior Treasury official said on Monday.

29-12-2020||World||The world is ‘never going to forget me’: Nashville bomber to neighbor before explosion||It seemed like a friendly chat between neighbors. Only after a bomb exploded in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning could Rick Laude grasp the sinister meaning behind his neighbor’s smiling remark that the city and the rest of the world would never forget him.Laude told The Associated Press on Monday that he was speechless when he learned that authorities identified his 63-year-old neighbor, Anthony Quinn Warner, as the man suspected of detonating a bomb that killed himself, injured three other people and damaged dozens of buildings.Laude said he saw Warner standing at his mailbox less than a week before Christmas and pulled over in his car to talk. After asking how Warner’s elderly mother was doing, Laude said he casually asked, “Is Santa going to bring you anything good for Christmas?”Warner smiled and said, “Oh, yeah, Nashville and the world is never going to forget me,” Laude recalled.Also Read | Nashville blast suspect died in explosion, say policeLaude said he didn’t think much of the remark and thought Warner only meant that “something good” was going to happen for him financially.“Nothing about this guy raised any red flags,” Laude said. “He was just quiet.”Warner left behind clues that suggest he planned the bombing and intended to kill himself, but a clear motive remains elusive.“We hope to get an answer. Sometimes, it’s just not possible,” David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said Monday in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show. “The best way to find motive is to talk to the individual. We will not be able to do that in this case.”Investigators are analyzing Warner’s belongings collected during the investigation, including a computer and a portable storage drive, and continue to interview witnesses as they try to identify a motive for the explosion, a law enforcement official said. A review of his financial transactions also uncovered purchases of potential bomb-making components, the official said.Warner had recently given away a vehicle and told the person he gave it to that he had been diagnosed with cancer, though it is unclear whether he indeed had cancer, the official said. Investigators used some items collected from the vehicle, including a hat and gloves, to match Warner’s DNA and DNA was taken from one of his family members, the official said.The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Warner also apparently gave away his home in Antioch, a Nashville suburb, to a Los Angeles woman a month before the bombing. A property record dated Nov. 25 indicates Warner transferred the home to the woman in exchange for no money after living there for decades. The woman’s signature is not on that document.Warner had worked as a computer consultant for Nashville real estate agent Steve Fridrich, who told the AP in a text message that Warner had said he was retiring earlier this month.Officials said Warner had not been on their radar before Christmas. A law enforcement report released Monday showed that Warner’s only arrest was for a 1978 marijuana-related charge.“It does appear that the intent was more destruction than death, but again that’s all still speculation at this point as we continue in our investigation with all our partners,” Rausch added.Furthermore, officials have not provided insight into why Warner selected the particular location for the bombing, which damaged an AT&T building and continued to wreak havoc on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states as the company worked to restore service.Forensic analysts were reviewing evidence from the blast site to try to identify the components of the explosives as well as information from the US Bomb Data Center for intelligence and investigative leads, according to a law enforcement official who said investigators were examining Warner’s digital footprint and financial history.The official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said federal agents were examining a number of potential leads and pursuing several theories, including the possibility that the AT&T building was targeted.Doug Korneski, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said Sunday that officials were looking at any and all motives and were interviewing acquaintances of Warner’s to try to determine what may have motivated him.The bombing took place early on a holiday morning well before downtown streets were bustling with activity. Police were responding to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Then, for reasons that may never be known, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast.In addition to the DNA found at the blast site, investigators from the Tennessee Highway Patrol were able to link the vehicle identification number recovered from the wreckage to an RV registered to Warner, officials said.“We’re still following leads, but right now there is no indication that any other persons were involved,” Korneski said. “We’ve reviewed hours of security video surrounding the recreation vehicle. We saw no other people involved.”President-elect Joe Biden on Monday called the bombing “a reminder of the destructive power an individual or a small group can muster and the need for continued vigilance across the board.”President Donald Trump hasn’t publicly commented on the explosion but has spoken to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and offered resources and support, according to the governor’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-is-never-going-to-forget-me-nashville-bomber-to-neighbor-before-explosion/story-9GCyhOQiLgm41kAYRjuD1H.html
29-12-2020||World||Four ways North Korea’s Kim Jong Un got more dangerous under Trump sanctions||US President Donald Trump’s campaign to cut North Korea’s economy off from the world worked. But it also may have accelerated Kim Jong Un’s efforts to build a military less reliant on foreign support.The North Korea awaiting President-elect Joe Biden is more dangerous and more self-reliant, possessing at least three different intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to a US city. Kim has over the past two years test-launched a range of new rockets to threaten allied forces closer to home. He’s built a fleet of special trucks needed to deploy such nuclear-ready weapons around the country and is believed to be constructing a submarine to put them to sea.Kim could flaunt his advances again in the coming days -- whether in his traditional New Year’s Day address, or with a more provocative weapons test -- as an early signal to Biden that past American strategies have failed. Much of Kim’s new hardware has been domestically developed and produced, according to non-proliferation experts, despite sanctions crimping his access to everything from weapons and industrial machinery to oil and foreign cash.Also Read | Daily 90 minutes must to learn about Kim Jong Un: North Korea’s new orderThere’s no indication Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign caused Kim to rethink his weapons program, even if it helped push North Korea toward what’s expected to be its biggest economic contraction in more than two decades. “Sanctions appear to have had little, if any, effect in slowing down the DPRK’s drive for fissile materials and nuclear weapon production,” said Siegfried Hecker, a professor emeritus at Stanford University and one of the few American scientists who has participated in in-person inspections of North Korea’s main nuclear facilities.Kim, 36, can expect to complete his first decade in power in December 2021 having demonstrated a proficiency for producing nuclear arms far exceeding his father or grandfather. That capability will make it harder for Biden to maintain the US’s longstanding demand that Kim dismantle his entire nuclear program, rather than simply freezing it.Here are four areas North Korea has advanced over the past four years:1. Nuclear BombsWhile Kim hasn’t detonated a nuclear bomb since 2017, experts believe he has continued to make progress toward developing warheads that could overwhelm US antimissile systems. North Korea “has probably developed miniaturized nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles,” a UN Security Council expert panel said earlier this year. Kim is estimated to be able to produce about six times as much fissile material annually as his father. According to Hecker, Pyongyang has capabilities to make highly enriched uranium, as well as the fusion fuels deuterium and tritium needed for more powerful hydrogen bombs. The device Kim blew up underground in September 2017 was thought to be more than 10 times as powerful as the one the US dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945.2. Ballistic MissilesKim’s regime has rolled out several new models of ballistic missiles in recent months that are either bigger and more powerful or easier to move and fire. At an October military parade through Pyongyang, he debuted a huge ICBM that appeared to be the world’s largest road-mobile missile and capable of carrying multiple warheads. In 2019, North Korea also test-fired the two-stage Pukguksong missile, which demonstrated solid-fuel technology needed to store and quickly launch such weapons before they could be destroyed in an actual conflict. Kim has also tested several hypersonic KN-23 missiles that can strike all of South Korea -- including the some 28,500 American troops stationed there -- within a manner of minutes.3. Conventional ForcesThe October parade also showcased Kim’s capacity to produce a wide variety of military gear that at least looks modern, including anti-aircraft systems, chemical weapons gear and rifles for its million-man army. Joost Oliemans, a specialist in North Korea’s weaponry, said the mobile missile launchers put on display showed that Kim’s heavy truck industry has made major advancements that also “presumably aided the inception of a flurry of new armored fighting vehicles.” The regime was so proud of its progress that it released a picture book of the armaments in nine languages through its Naenara propaganda websites. Kim has also inspected the production of what appears to be a new submarine capable of carrying its most advanced nuclear weapons.4. Military ResearchThe weapons demonstrated North Korea’s capacity to adapt foreign-developed technology to suit its own needs and overcome local limitations. The KN-23 missiles appear to be based on a Russian Iskander with some modifications while the new ICBM unveiled in October looked like a native design. That’s a marked improvement from when North Korea relied on reverse-engineering imported Scuds or help from Pakistani scientists to put it on the path toward uranium enrichment. The regime has likely expanded its capabilities by using openly available information and by rewarding scientists with perks like prized apartments. Kim is nurturing scientists through about 130 government-backed organizations, the Diplomat reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-ways-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-got-more-dangerous-under-trump-sanctions/story-7d4npuRjd3YdyMP5xp8gML.html
29-12-2020||World||US to allow small drones to fly over people and at night||Small drones will be allowed to fly over people and at night in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday, a significant step toward their use for widespread commercial deliveries.The FAA said its long-awaited rules for the drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, will address security concerns by requiring remote identification technology in most cases to enable their identification from the ground.The rules will take effect 60 days after publication in the federal register in January. Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to begin producing drones with Remote ID, and operators will have an additional year to provide Remote ID.There are other, more complicated rules that allow for operations at night and over people for larger drones in some cases.“The new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. “They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.”Companies have been racing to create drone fleets to speed deliveries. The United States has over 1.7 million drone registrations and 203,000 FAA-certificated remote pilots.For at-night operations, the FAA said drones must be equipped with anti-collision lights. The final rules allow operations over moving vehicles in some circumstances.Remote ID is required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more, but is required for smaller drones under certain circumstances like flights over open-air assemblies.The new rules eliminate requirements that drones be connected to the internet to transmit location data but do that they broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast. Without the change, drone use could have been barred from use in areas without internet access.The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International said Remote ID will function as “a digital license plate for drones ... that will enable more complex operations” while operations at night and over people “are important steps towards enabling integration of drones into our national airspace.”One change, since the rules were first proposed in 2019, requires that small drones not have any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin.United Parcel Service Inc said in October 2019 that it won the government’s first full approval to operate a drone airline.Last year, Alphabet’s Wing, a sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get US air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation. In August, Amazon.com Inc’s drone service received federal approval allowing the retailer to begin testing commercial deliveries through its drone fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-small-drones-to-fly-over-people-and-at-night/story-xgiUSwiKABZTXrh3duC9tN.html
29-12-2020||World||Chinese team in Nepal makes a peace offering to PM Oli. He doesn’t bite||A team of senior officials of the Communist Party of China that landed on Sunday continued their interactions with leaders of Nepal Communist Party on Monday in an effort to broker peace between the two rival factions of the ruling party in Kathmandu. Chinese President Xi Jinping last week deputed the delegation led by Guo Yezhou, vice-minister of the international department of the Chinese communist party’s central committee, after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli sprung a surprise on his detractors in the party and dissolved Parliament. Fresh elections to the 275-seat House of Representatives have been scheduled in two phases on April 30 and May 10 next year.Guo Yexhou, who flew into Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport in a scheduled Air China flight with three delegates, is learnt to have been told by President Xi to amp up Ambassador Hou Yanqi’s efforts to keep Nepal Communist Party in one piece. About 7-8 more communist party officials drove into Nepal from the land border.Guo Yezhou’s team met President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday. The President’s office hasn’t given any details of the discussions or the guests except to confirm the Chinese team’s meeting with Bidhya Devi Bhandari, who had signed off on the recommendation to dissolve parliament.The delegation that included Dr Sun Haiyan, DG, China Centre for Contemporary World Studies, Liang Wihan, IDCPC, South Asia Affairs, and Zheng Yoyuwa, senior office bearer, IDCPC, also held meetings with Prachanda, Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, and Baburam Bhattarai, all opponents of PM Oli.“The picture is not very clear. The attempt is to maintain unity, failing which to bring the majority tothe PR-MN side, the clearest road for which is restoration of parliament,” said a diplomat in Kathmandu.PM Oli, who was seen to be reluctant to engage with the Chinese and had previously told off the Chinese ambassador for her interventions, did meet the Chinese team on Sunday evening. PM Oli’s foreign affairs advisor Rajan Bhattarai had described the meeting, which local media reports indicated went on for two hours, as a “courtesy call”.On Monday, Guo Yezhou’s delegation drove down to the Khumaltar residence of former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda who is leading the rival faction within the communist party to discuss the options to stop the party from splitting. Guo will next meet another former prime minister Madhav Nepal who is aligned with Prachanda.Guo Yezhou is a familiar face in Nepal’s political circles and is believed to have played a role in the formation of the Nepal Communist Party in 2018 by the merger of PM Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre. Prachanda and PM Oli had been co-chair of the Nepal communist party as part of the pact signed when the party was formed in 2018.Nepal watchers said President’s Xi’s Communist Party of China wants the PM Oli-led government to rescind the presidential order dissolving parliament and has offered to use its influence with the rival faction led by Prachanda and Madhav Nepal to get them to back off and guaranteed that he would be able to complete his five-year term.The buzz in Nepal’s political circles is that PM Oli stood his ground and indicated that he would rather let the Supreme Court take the call on the presidential order. Five judges of Nepal’s top court have started hearing dozen-odd petitions filed against President Bhandari’s order dissolving the House of Representatives.PM Oli is also learnt to have pointed to his previous discussions with ambassador Hou who at one point, wanted him to step down, and asserted that it would not be possible for him to roll back his cabinet’s recommendation.In a televised address to the nation that followed the dissolution of Parliament earlier, PM Oli had lamented that his rivals within the party hadn’t been letting him function and had planned to move a vote of no-confidence against him.Prachanda and Madhav Nepal, who led the offensive against him, are learnt to be planning to form a government with the Nepali Congress and the Janata Samajwadi Party - the two opposition parties that have been launching sharp attacks at PM Oli for his decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-china-is-playing-political-broker-in-nepal-it-is-not-working/story-9qnICuYr7MEDzhSqHietRM.html
29-12-2020||India||TWo children among six with new Covid strain||Two of the six people in India who were confirmed on Tuesday to have been infected with the new coronavirus variant that originated in the UK are children, a two-year-old girl and a six-year-old girl, reinforcing concerns that the mutation may have made the Sars-Cov-2 more adept at infecting the young, who till now have been less susceptible to the virus. The new variant of the coronavirus – called VOC-202012/01 – has been established by experts in the UK to be more transmissible and, although it does not seem to cause more severe disease, more cases could mean more number of people who require hospitalisations. The first clues that these could also have an implication for children were disclosed by authorities in UK. “There is a hint that it has a higher propensity to infect children,” said Neil Ferguson, a professor and infectious disease epidemiologist at Imperial College London and also a member of the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), on December 21.The variant carries 17 changes from the virus that first began spreading from Wuhan last year, including a change known as N501Y, which enhances the pathogen’s ability to bind to host cells. The virus uses a doorway called ACE-2 receptors through which it enters cells and N501Y is believed to make the spike protein more capable of binding to ACE-2.Wendy Barclay, also from Nervtag and Imperial College London, said the mutations to the virus appeared to be making it easier to walk through these doorways. “Therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults,” she said, according to BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-children-among-six-with-new-covid-strain/story-wMWXlfqhc1x5CYma2ZYwoJ.html

29-12-2020||India||Heavy China air force presence in Ladakh: IAF chief||NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Tuesday said that China had heavily deployed the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) to support its army in the Ladakh theatre along with a large number of radars and missiles, even as he listed the possible Chinese objectives for its actions om the northern border. The air chief said the likely reasons for Chinese actions could include a planned escalation and an attempt to establish border claim lines and start border talks on the new positions, military signalling, domination efforts with escalation control and deployment and training of their Western Theatre forces in real war-like scenarios wherein the Galwan Valley incident was an overreach. At an event organized by the Vivekananda International Foundation, Bhadauria said China’s aim could also possibly be fine-tuning its strategy to enhance its military technologies and recognize and fill gaps to get its forces to synergise in the structures the Chinese military has created over the last two decades. “In any case, all of the above (possible objectives) appear to have happened irrespective of what was the starting objective. It could also be a totally military-dominated misadventure that escalated given the rapid decrease in trust deficit in post-Covid secenario… and possibly due to the loss of face (for the Chinese), the action later continued to escalate,” Bhadauria said. “The important issue is that we recognize what they (China) have really achieved and whatever four or five points I mentioned have been actioned in the real sense,” the Indian Air Force chief said. Responding to a question, he said the frontier PLAAF was deployed fully to support the Chinese army and it also had a large presence in the “second tier.” “Their deployment has been very strong. We have taken every action that we were required to take and cater to such situation and be sure that we will handle it,” Bhadauria said. The IAF chief said that the air force’s robust actions in the Ladakh theatre had “stopped the Chinese in their tracks and they remained there.” He said India’s most important national security challenge was to understand China, its possible game plan and the deepening and evolving Sino-Pakistan relationship. “We are aware that China’s main aspirations are clearly on the global front and regional domination is part of the route to global leadership. Any serious India-China conflict is not good for China at the global front. If Chinese aspirations are global, then it does not suit their grand plans and therefore is important to understand what could be their possible objectives for their actions in the north (Ladakh sector),” he said. He said the evolving uncertainties and instability on the global geopolitical front provided China with a chance to demonstrate its growing power and also revealed the inadequate contribution of major powers to global security. He said budgetary constraints were an issue for the military. “While we have our needs, we have factored in the current constraints and we are aware that it will take a while for the economy to get back and for us to have the kind of budget we had earlier…We can’t expect we will have some unlimited budget even with the security scenario in the north. The current budget will not be a constraint for us in the north,” he said. He said Sukhoi-30 fighter jets equipped with the BrahMos missile had significantly increased the reach of the air force and no territory in the so-called string of pearls area was out of the IAF’s reach. China’s string of pearls refers to strategic attempts to surround India with facilities that can be upgraded to military bases.On the Ayni airbase in Tajikistan that gives India a strategic footprint in central Asia, the IAF chief said: “It’s an area that gave us a huge capability in terms of being able to operate from there…it has resulted in not only a lot of goodwill but also has a lot of strategic importance and it is going well.” On the possibility of joint air exercises between the air forces of India, the United States, Australia and Japan (their navies carry out the Malabar drill), the IAF chief said: “Quad as an execution hasn’t happened so far for the air forces but as a plan of action, it is possible that it will come up soon. At the trilateral level, exercises have happened….between air forces of two Quad countries and observers from a third.” China has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-china-air-force-presence-in-ladakh-iaf-chief/story-dkmdycA7E3qAtko50xc6kJ.html
29-12-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee, Suvendu Adhikari face off at back-to-back mega rallies||Political heat in West Bengal soared on a cold December day on Tuesday when Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her follower-turned -challenger Suvendu Adhikari, the BJP’s newest heavyweight entrant in the poll-bound state, held back-to-back rallies in three districts where lakhs millions turned up.Adhikari addressed a Bajrang Dal rally at Nandigram in East Midnapore district, his home turf, in the morning and a second one at Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, 150 km away, in the evening. He unleashed a scathing attack on the chief minister and her nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and called for their ouster in the interest of Bengal. In a significant move, Adhikari declared at the second rally that members of his family will soon join the BJP and said he will make the lotus (the BJP’s symbol) bloom in the Banerjee family as well. “You (Abhishek) asked at a recent rally whether I feel ashamed to live in a house where the other members are still with the ruling party. Bhaipo (nephew) let me tell you that the lotus will bloom in my home. Wait for Ram Navami and Basanti Puja. And, I will enter your home too. The lotus will bloom in your home. Mark my words,” said Adhikari. Amid loud applause, Adhikari spoke in Hindi and referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s famous quote on hitting Pakistan inside its territory after the Pulwama terror attack. “Ghar main ghus ke maar diya,” he said. Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyendu are the TMC’s Lok Sabha members from Kanthi and Tamluk constituencies respectively. Both of them refused to comment on Adhikari’s remark. The family’s youngest son, Soumendu, who headed the Kanthi municipality, was removed from the post by the government on Tuesday evening. In between the two BJP rallies, Mamata Banerjee led a grand roadshow and addressed a rally in Birbhum district’s Bolpur town, where Union minister Amit Shah led a roadshow on December 20, a day after welcoming Adhikari into the BJP. Reiterating that the BJP is a party of “outsiders,” she alleged that Visva-Bharati, Bengal’s only Central university that Rabindranath Tagore had set up in Bolpur, has turned into a centre of dirty politics. The Prime Minister is the de-facto chancellor of Visva-Bharati and he virtually addressed the institution’s centenary celebration programme last week. Shah also visited Visva-Bharati on December 20 and spent time in the rooms used by Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, who was a visitor. Visva-Bharati has been in the news for several months over vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty’s attempts to set up a security zone around the open-air campus. The authorities hit the headlines last week for accusing Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen of illegally occupying some land. Banerjee has extended her support to Sen, saying he has become a target for speaking against the BJP. Sen’s maternal grandfather, educationist and writer Acharya Kshitimohan Sen, was a follower of Tagore and taught at the university since its inception in 1921. “Visva-Bharati has become the centre of dirty politics over blind religious faith. The dirty politics has been imported. Those who are importing this hatred do not know the Hindu religion,” said Banerjee. “The vice-chancellor is a marked stooge of the BJP. Didn’t they (the Centre) find any other person for the post? Why are BJP leaders visiting Visva-Bharati so frequently? What business do they have on campus? I do not do politics on Calcutta University campus,” said Banerjee. Her statement came amid reports that BJP national president J P Nadda may visit Bengal on January 9 and visit Bolpur. Without naming Adhikari, the chief minister alleged that the seven TMC legislators who joined the BJP on December 19, were purchased. “You can spend money and buy a few legislators but you cannot purchase Bengal. Win 30 seats if you can. TMC will fight till the end and win the election,” said Banerjee, indirectly hitting out at Shah who has declared that his party will win more than 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats in the polls due in about five months. In a bid to strike a chord with the masses, Banerjee drew a connection between the 2021 elections and the martyrs’ day the TMC observes on February 21. “Ekush (21 in Bangla) will show the way. Ekush will liberate Bengal,” she said. In a veiled reference to Modi, who has grown his beard and hair, Mamata Banerjee tried to mock the Prime Minister at the olpur rally. “One or two of the leaders coming to Bengal are looking like Rabindranath Tagore,” she said.At Adhikari’s morning rally, Banerjee drew flak for cancelling her scheduled rally at Nandigram on January 7. Nandigram, where a three-year-long violent struggle against acquisition of farm land for industry played a key role in helping Banerjee oust the Left Front government in 2011, was the assembly constituency of former minister Adhikari till he resigned from the state assembly. “Those who talked of holding a rally in Nandigram have suddenly vanished. But I keep my word. I will hold a rally on January 8 and there will be more than one lakh people,” Adhikari said. The reason TMC leaders cited on Monday for cancelling Banerjee’s January 7 rally was that Akhil Giri, the legislator from the district’s Ramnagar constituency and the event’s organiser, had tested positive for Covid-19. Reacting to Adhikari’s statement that his family will join the BJP, Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member, said, “It will not make any difference to the TMC. We successfully held a rally in Kanthi, their hometown, last week without anyone from the Adhikari family.” The BJP rally at Barrackpore was attended the local Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh, BJP’s youth front president and Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan and Union minister of state Babul Supriyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-suvendu-adhikari-face-off-at-back-to-back-mega-rallies/story-BkkuCahZuTdsrfoIJlyg5H.html

In the first week of January, the committee will study the pay revision commission’s (PRC) report.

With no limit on the installed capacity, industries can produce more solar power and bring down their overall production cost,” Rupani said.This policy will make Made in Gujarat products more competitive globally, he said.To encourage people to opt for solar panels, the state government has also announced that additional electricity from roof-top residential projects and captive MSME units will be purchased at Rs 2.25 per unit for a period of five years, it was stated.Moreover, a group of industries can also come together to set up a captive solar project at one place and distribute power as per their share in the investment, state energy minister Saurabh Patel said.At present, solar project developers need to pay a security deposit of Rs 25 lakh for each megawatt of installed capacity to distribution companies under the Power Purchase Agreement, he said.Under the new policy, the deposit amount has been slashed to just Rs 5 lakhs for a megawatt, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-govt-announces-new-solar-power-policy/story-MAPUUeMI1lKlHNZYfSUCHN.html

At present, the junior doctors get monthly stipends of Rs 50,000, Rs 55,000 and Rs 60,000 respectively.The Junior Doctors Association (JDA), Bihar claims that the government while revising the stipends on May 9, 2017, had agreed for a revision every three years.While justifying the demand of the junior doctors, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha said the inflation rate had risen exorbitantly during the NDA regime, so the doctors demand was reasonable seeing the rising expenses.“Nitish Kumar should get a study conducted of the stipend paid to junior doctors in neighbouring states and pay them accordingly. The state government should take urgent steps to end the strike, because of which thousands of people have been suffering,” Jha said.Manjhi on Monday had appealed to the chief minister and health minister Mangal Pandey to intervene and end the strike of junior doctors.Meanwhile at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), patients have vacated most of the wards, while many, in absence of enough financial resources, preferred to stay outside the hospital buildings. The patients complained that the claim of the state government that senior doctors would take charge seems to be false.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-asks-nitish-kumar-to-intervene-as-doctors-strike-hits-health-services/story-RIgPFJBOhF8O773LHs0pxL.html

The former’s Speaker suggestion was backed by another party leader Vijay Prakash, who suggested that Kumar should go to Delhi and make way for Tejashwi in the state.The RJD’s offer, which came amid the bitterness between BJP and JD (U) after the defections in Arunachal Pradesh, shows that the main opposition party has not stopped its effort to form government in the state. The offer was, however, rejected by both the alliance partners – JD (U) and the BJP.“This shows their dejection. They have not been able to digest their defeat yet. The verdict has dashed their dreams. They are talking rubbish,” said JD (U) state president Bashistha Narain Singh and advised the RJD to wait till 2025 and make a fresh effort.The BJP called it daydreaming by the RJD. “Chowdhary’s proposal is a joke. They are daydreaming. The RJD should introspect on its relationship with the Congress,” said BJP’s spokesperson Nikhil Anand.The Congress too called it a non-serious offer. “Is this the party’s official line? This is an uncalled for and a non-serious talk,” said Congress leader Premchandra Mishra. “The question of projecting Kumar as PM candidate does not arise. We have Rahul Gandhi as our candidate. Moreover, as long as Kumar is in NDA, the question of such talks doesn’t arise,” he said.Nitish Kumar had forged an alliance with the RJD in 2015 and returned to power with a thumping majority. However, mid-way, he walked out of the GA and formed a government with the BJP’s support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-tries-to-lure-nitish-kumar-as-pm-candidate-jd-u-says-it-is-rubbish/story-rZI6V1blXtCKmaoJZxTxgI.html

Of the 12 UK-returned passengers who tested positive for Covid-19, only the woman had the new strain, state Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said, citing a report of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. “Her son tested negative while another person who came in contact with her also did not contract any virus,” Bhaskar said in a release.The woman, who returned to India on December 21, managed to give the slip to authorities in New Delhi and reach AP by train but was picked up from Rajamahendravaram and admitted to a hospital along with her son. Eight passengers who travelled by the same first AC coach on AP Express, as the UK-returned woman, from New Delhi to Visakhapatnam had tested negative for Covid-19. Health authorities conducted RT-PCR tests on these passengers, including two children, upon their arrival in Visakhapatnam as they shared the coach in which the woman travelled after testing positive for coronavirus, though she was found to be asymptomatic. The Health Commissioner said here on Tuesday that there was no trace of the new UK strain’s spread in the state. “We are constantly monitoring the situation and there is no need to panic.I appeal to people not to believe in rumours,” the Commissioner added. Bhaskar said 1,423 peoople came to the state from the UK in recent days and 1,406 of them have been traced. RT-PCR tests revealed that 12 had tested positive for Covid-19. Also, 12 out of 6,364 of the UK returnees primary contacts also tested positive for the infection. “We have sent all these samples for genomic examination to the CCMB in Hyderabad.We are awaiting the results of 23 samples,” the Health Commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contagious-variant-of-covid-19-found-in-andhra-woman-who-returned-from-uk/story-ZCQ6aMS6ZoJlHW8BeMiK9O.html
29-12-2020||India||New variant of Sars-Cov-2 not impediment to vaccine development, says CCMB||Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology on Tuesday said that the new variant of Coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 is not more dangerous than its original variant and is not an impediment to the vaccine development. “The new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 (B.1.1.7) disease is 71% more transmittable than the other variants. The mutations do not worsen the symptoms or the disease outcomes,” CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra said. He said the mutant form of Sars-Cov-2 was not an impediment to the vaccine development and the testing protocol also remained the same. “The measures to avoid infection still remain the same. Using masks when in presence of others, avoiding crowded places, maintaining physical distancing are the most effective and feasible ways for avoiding this virus, including the new variant,” he said. He said it was now very important to launch an extensive genome surveillance of the virus to assess the extent of the spread of the new virus. “We should also keep an eye on other variants that might emerge independently, as India houses the second largest population infected with this virus, at present,” Dr Mishra said. First reported in the UK in September 2020, this variant makes up for 60% of all coronavirus infection there. Many countries including India have temporarily banned flights from the UK. By tracing and testing 33,000 passengers who have flown in to India from the UK, India has confirmed the presence of this new variant in the country. CCMB, a CSIR institute, is one of the ten research institutes in India that is tracing the new variant of the virus here. “We needed to expedite the viral genome sequencing efforts, and check for the presence of the new variant in India. We have used both, the traditional Sanger sequencing method as well as the modern Next-Gen Sequencing tools,” Dr Divya Tej Sowpati, who leads the Coronavirus genome sequencing efforts at CCMB, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-variant-of-sars-cov-2-not-impediment-to-vaccine-development-says-ccmb/story-hQnH8422YiHH7cD0SqV5RO.html

The cost of manufacturing a single Vistadome coach is approximately Rs 4 crore, according to a statement from the ministry in June.In addition to the standard safety measures provided, other measures such as glasses that are shatter-resistant and film coating for passenger safety have been used in the manufacturing of Vistadome coaches.Goyal also announced the resumption of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway services in Tamil Nadu and the successful trial run of an electric locomotive on a newly electrified rail line between Bangaon and Petrapole in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-completes-speed-trial-of-vistadome-coach/story-T9tpYtaaga0jrqTdyGrK1H.html
29-12-2020||India||India likely to extend ban on UK flights, vaccine cold-chain being prepared: Hardeep Puri||India is likely to extend the suspension of flights from the UK in a bid to contain the spread of a new strain of coronavirus, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday. He also said that the aviation ministry is also preparing a cold chain for the transportation of Covid-19 vaccine. On December 21, India joined a growing list of countries to seal off access to people who have been to the UK, suspending all flights to and from the country between December 23 and December 31 in order to stop the arrival of a new strain of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 that is feared to spread faster.“I foresee a slight extension of the temporary suspension. I don’t expect that extension to be a long or indefinite extension. In the next day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current temporary suspension,” Puri said at a press conference on Tuesday.India has been operating international flights through bilateral transport bubbles with 24 countries including the UK since calling off scheduled overseas flight operations when it announced the lockdown in March.The minister said passengers who arrived from the UK on December 21 and 22 were made to undergo RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 at the airport, with only those who tested negative being allowed to go home, where they were told to do mandatory home isolation for seven days. Anyone who tested positive was taken to institutional quarantine.“We went one step further. We went back till November 25 and any passenger who had come directly or indirectly from the UK, we did some contact tracing and we did some Genome sequencing. As per the latest figures that I have...I believe a total of 6 cases out of at least around 2,000 passengers coming in have shown the new strain,” he said.The aviation ministry is also coordinating with the ministry of health and department of pharmaceuticals for preparing the cold-chain for the Covid 19 vaccine transportation, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Kharola said.“In the administration of the vaccine transportation is going to be a very important component. This vaccine has to be moved from the place of manufacturing to all the corners of the country. The movement of the vaccine will be multi-modal, it cannot be merely civil aviation, it will be a combination of different modes. For our part we are coordinating with the ministry of health and pharmaceutical. We have also had meetings with airports and airlines regarding the transportation plan of the vaccine,” Kharola said.The aviation ministry has held a round of meetings with airlines to discuss logistics issues. The central government has started preparations for setting up a cold storage chain for the Covid-19 vaccine that will eventually be approved for use in India, HT had reported on December 7.“The most important factor for the vaccine’s transportation will be temperature regulation for the entire cold chain that is being made. From the place of manufacture to the place of consumption is a long chain and there will be different modes; there will be road travel, air travel, there will be storages, there will be distribution and then there will be administration of the vaccine. This entire process is being prepared on war footing,” Kharola added.Puri said that 30 crore Indians will be vaccinated against Covid-19 by July 2021, for which at least 60 crore doses will be needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-extend-ban-on-uk-flights-vaccine-cold-chain-being-prepared-hardeep-puri/story-7H4brYMgE8oJubpKySOqAL.html
29-12-2020||India||Scientists quell Covid-19 variant fears, say staying cautious sufficient||Standard defense mechanisms such as masks, sanitisation and physical distancing will work to contain the coronavirus strain detected in six people who came from the UK, scientists said on Tuesday, giving assurance that the mutant is not clinically more severe and there is no need to worry. The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday said six people who returned to India from the UK recently have tested positive for the new mutated variant called VUI-202012/01, sparking worries that India’s fight against the disease has gotten more complex just as its daily Covid-19 count was falling.According to the Health Ministry, the SARS-CoV-2’s UK variant genome was detected in three samples in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Hospital (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, two in the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and one in the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.Several scientists stepped in to assuage concerns and said there is no evidence yet that the variant is more deadly. Anurag Agrawal, director of New Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) was one of them.   “Staying cautious and following good practices should be sufficient (to tackle the variant),” Agrawal told PTI, adding that the UK, where the variant was identified first, has not reported any clinical indication of the variant being more severe. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said preliminary modelling results communicated by the UK on December 19 suggest the variant is 70 per cent more transmissible than previously circulating variants. However, it also said there is no indication of increased infection severity observed related to the variant with multiple mutations in the spike protein.The spike protein comes in contact with human cells to enter the body and infect.Virologist Upasana Ray agreed with the assessment that there is no cause for alarm because there is nothing so far to back concerns that the variant is more deadly. The senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata, went a step further and said, “It has been said the transmission rate is more. However, for that also there is no laboratory based evidence.” Ray also noted that a check on travel has already been suggested and said tests have been recommended for anyone entering the country from the UK.“The most important step required is implementing the basic precautions like using masks (that many people have stopped using) social distancing etc. A watch on the variant is also important to monitor its transmission and pathogenicity,” Ray told PTI. There should be no concerns on the vaccine front as well.Asserting that it has so far not been found that the new variant increases the severity of the disease, the government’s Principal Scientific Advisor K Vijay Raghavan said at a press conference, “There is no evidence that current vaccines will fail to protect against Covid-19 variants reported from UK or SA.” “Most vaccines do target the spike protein in which there are changes in the variants but vaccines stimulate our immune system to produce a wide range of protective antibodies,” he said.Rakesh Mishra, director of Hyderabad’s CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Microbiology added that there is no surprise to find the new variant of the virus in some of the samples tested in India.According to him, large-scale testing is required, and people need not worry too much about the new strain.“It  (new strain of Covid-19) is just fresh, otherwise, it is the same virus and not much of an issue. Same symptoms, mortality, everything is the same… we just have to take precautions,” Mishra told PTI. Though the new variant is more transmissible, it has not shown to cause more severe infection compared to other mutants, agreed Divya Tej Sowpati, a scientist at CSIR-CCMB.   “Please note that though more transmissible, this strain is not shown to be clinically more severe. Also, the same defences work to contain the UK strain too - masks, sanitization, and social distancing,” Sowpati tweeted on Tuesday.Immunologist Satyajit Rath said the variant is likely to be a cause for concern in terms of policy responses to Covid-19, but not in terms of individual risk of serious illness.“However, the basis for this concern remains somewhat circumstantial at this point, since it is based on the correlation between the increasing prominence of this variant with growing case numbers in southern England over the past few weeks.“More direct evidence, if any, is still awaited,” Rath from New Delhi’s National Institute of Immunology (NII) said. He also expressed doubts about whether the new variant will have any impact on the accuracy of the standard RT PCR diagnostic tests for Covid-19 being conducted in India.“It is true that some tests are based on detection of regions that are a bit different in this variant, but those differences are not large enough, I think, for the tests to be affected to any substantial extent,” he explained.Agrawal concurred with Rath, saying “no sweeping changes were needed” in RT-PCR diagnosis due to the new variant. A total of 16,432 new infections were reported in a span of 24 hours, the lowest in little over six months, while the death toll increased to 1,48,153 with 252 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry on Tuesday. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 98,07,569 pushing the national recovery rate to 95.92%, while the Covid-19 case fatality rate is 1.45%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-quell-covid-19-variant-fears-say-staying-cautious-sufficient/story-zjqeqJp3fp2RH4LWJCOUeL.html

The key representatives from the government discussed and finalised the government’s position for their talks with the farmers, news agency PTI reported.The meet comes just a day before the government is set to negotiate terms with the farmers who are protesting the three contentious farm laws cleared by the government in what critics said was in a hurried manner. At least 40 protesting farmers’ unions have been invited for the next round of talks on Wednesday on all relevant issues to find a “logical solution” to the current impasse.Also read: Centre calls farmers for meeting over farm laws on December 30 in DelhiA bitter protest was called by thousands of farmers hailing from Punjab and Haryana - now joined by farmers from across the country last month after the government pushed the three laws – Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 – through Parliament in September.Holding momentum for over a month now, the stir by farmers is the largest strike by the farmers’ unions on the borders of the national capital in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three laws. If not heard, the farmers have threatened to intensify their stir in the coming days.So far, five rounds of formal talks have remained inconclusive. The last round was held on December 5, while the sixth round of talks originally scheduled for December 9 was called off a day after an informal meeting of home minister Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-tomar-piyush-goyal-meet-amit-shah-ahead-of-crucial-talks-with-farmers/story-h0vYhRYmPJysQKgRK68zlJ.html

This trilateral initiative is also part of the Japanese government’s efforts to help Japanese industries diversify supply chains and become more resilient.Also read: ‘Agriculture can’t be run sitting in Delhi’ - Sharad Pawar slams Centre for ‘bulldozing’ farm lawsAsked specifically about the India-China border standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and China’s aggressive actions within Japan’s territorial waters, Suzuki replied, “In a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific where the rule of law prevails, there is no place for any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion. “Be it in Ladakh, in the East China Sea, or in the South China Sea, Japan stands firm to uphold the principles that underpin a rules-based international order. I think this is also the best example where we have seen growing strategic convergence in both countries’ thinking.”Japan, which was among the first countries to call for maintenance of status quo on the LAC, has been grappling with the activities of Chinese official vessels in its territorial waters near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.Suzuki said, India has been Japan’s “most natural strategic partner” to promote the vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their first phone conversation on September 25 that his administration will “continue to attach significance to this vision”.Following the presence of all four members of the Quad – Japan, India, Australia and the US – in this year’s Malabar exercise, Suzuki said he looked forward to seeing the four maritime forces continuing to operate together in future. “These four countries, or the Quad, share a common vision of ensuring a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific in which the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are ensured, and all countries enjoy freedom of navigation and overflight. The Malabar exercise this year was a great example of our joint efforts to this end,” he said.While speaking of the Japanese government’s efforts to help the country’s companies diversify their supply chains and the backing for two pilot projects and feasibility studies in India, Suzuki said a “further improvement of business environment is important here (in India)”. He added, “To make India more attractive to investors, predictability and stability of business environment are critical, including the continued free flow of goods, such as intermediary goods which are indispensable to fulfil ‘Make in India’ objectives.”Suzuki also said Japan remains committed to the flagship Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project, with tenders for important packages, including the largest civil package, having been successfully made. Japan also wants to explore more collaborations in third countries with India after their successful efforts in building roads and bridges in Bangladesh and working on the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in the Maldives, he said.Apart from supporting the Indian government’s efforts for post-Covid recovery through 50 billion yen (about Rs 7,500 crore) budget support and 1 billion yen (about Rs 150 crore) grant assistance, Japan also backs the concept of a patent pool, to which India has expressed support, to promote voluntary licensing of intellectual property to enable emerging countries to have access to vaccines and medicines, Suzuki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-space-for-unilateral-attempts-to-change-status-quo-in-free-indo-pacific-japanese-ambassador/story-JkDlE8NEouYslTqtdQrnCN.html

The Samajwadi Party will form the government. And we are making that road to return to power clear by shaking hands with smaller parties,” Akhilesh said at a press conference he held at his party office here where Sumaiya Rana, daughter of famous Urdu poet Munawwar Rana, former BSP Lok Sabha candidate from Gonda Masood Alam Khan; former MLA and BSP chief coordinator Ramesh Gautam and over two dozen leaders and many of their supporters joined the SP.A poetess herself, Sumaiya Rana was one of the leaders of last year’s anti-CAA-NRC protest at Ghantaghar in Lucknow.Akhilesh said a large number of people from other parties were joining the SP and many more would become SP members in the near future. “This trend of leaders joining the SP is another sign of the SP’s return to power,” he said.Attacking the BJP government, the former chief minister said the saffron party cannot stand any voice of dissent. He alleged that in order to suppress the voice of the people and the opposition, the BJP government was framing cases against them. “Even if you raise your voice against adulteration of milk, you may have a case filed against you,” he said.He also criticized the recent farm laws that have triggered massive protests by farmers on Delhi’s borders. Terming the new farm laws a death warrant for farmers, Akhilesh said his party had consistently played an active role in farmers’ campaigns. There was no political party in the country against whom so many cases were filed by a government. However, SP will continue to support the farmers’ struggle, he said.Akhilesh also said the MSP (minimum support price) for an agriculture produce should be fixed in a manner that it doubles the farmers’ income. “The BJP government had promised that it would double the income of farmers by 2022. So, MSP should be fixed accordingly,” he demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sp-to-form-next-govt-in-up-will-withdraw-cases-against-caa-protestors-akhilesh/story-l0qupbGWyn8gpPmdm24pzO.html

If the laws are not accepted by the farmers, can they be beneficial to them. If you bring laws which are not acceptable to people, you are disrespecting the Constitution of the country,” she said while addressing a party function here.She also accused the Centre of disrespecting the Constitution by repealing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.The former chief minister, who was an ally of the BJP from 2015 to 2018, said the mainstream political parties in Kashmir were working to achieve their goal of restoration of special status “within the Constitution of the country”.“National Conference talks about autonomy, it is within the Constitution. We (PDP) talk of self-rule, open borders, reconciliation ... how long can you maintain peace through the barrel of the gun?” she asked.The PDP president said that the resolution of the Kashmir issue was a cause close to her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s heart.“Even from his death bed (in December 2015), he asked me if (Prime Minister) Modiji had gone to Lahore (Pakistan). He (Mufti) said now some way could be found for a resolution,” she said.“We want peace, but we are not the ones to raise the white flag,” she added.Mehbooba said her party’s struggle is not against the people of the country but the party and the government that “humiliated Jammu and Kashmir” by repealing its special status.“PDP is going nowhere till it plays its role in restoring what has been snatched from us,” she said.Mehbooba claimed that the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) had led to frustration in the ruling party and referred to the recent detention of some leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-accuses-centre-of-disrespecting-constitution/story-N04YQPNdR26OsSnZRO9kxM.html
29-12-2020||India||SC hears plea seeking prevention of circulation of fake Covid-19 vaccine||A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Supreme Court on Tuesday by lawyer, Vishal Tiwari, seeking a direction to the Union of India (UoI) and others, to issue strict guidelines and regulations under the Disaster Management Act by constituting a special committee to prevent the chances of sale or circulation of fake and counterfeit Covid-19 vaccine by any organisation, company or online apps.The petitioner in his PIL sought a direction that the respondents, including the Centre, be directed to run an awareness programme for the safety of the citizens against the danger of counterfeit vaccination of coronavirus.Tiwari, in his petition, sought a direction that the respondents be directed to enact a strict law against the criminal act committed by selling or circulating counterfeit coronavirus vaccine by any organisation or individual.The petitioner cited that the pandemic took the entire world into its captivity. He further stated in his plea that all countries started research for its cure. After several months of research, some countries have been successful in inventing the vaccine against Covid-19.The United Kingdom (UK) pioneered the anti-coronavirus vaccine programme for its citizens. It authorised drug-maker Pfizer for anti-coronavirus vaccination. The Right to Health care, Right to Safe Health and Right to Life enshrined under Article 21 guarantees the protection from fake treatment during this pandemic, the petition said.The petition further said Interpol has issued an orange notice to member countries and has warned that now along with the corona vaccination programme, several criminal organisations will be active and will circulate and sell counterfeit or fake vaccine.This criminal act will be carried out through the physical as well as online modes. Many websites will be active in committing such fraud, the petition filed by Tiwari stated.People can be easily be attracted by them (illegal and anti-social elements) as the present pandemic has created a situation of fear and uncertainty. So, people with an intention of saving their lives from the deadly virus can easily fall prey in the hands of such criminal organisations who intend to sell forged vaccine and make huge profit, the petition added.India is a vast country having huge population. It can be a big place of profit for criminal organisations and companies as it can be made a market for selling counterfeit and fake corona vaccine. Such organisations adopt a very smart technique of publicity, which can attract several innocent citizens of our nation for buying the vaccine, Tiwari in his petition claimed.The lawyer further raised the issue of online fraud in his PIL and said the Centre and the states are bound by the Disaster Management Act to take steps for the safety of the citizens.Online fraud has become a regular criminal act and our nation is also facing this challenge. Under the Disaster Management Act, both the Centre and states have power to prevent the epidemic and take necessary steps for the safety of the citizens. The protection of citizens from fake and counterfeit anti-corona vaccine is also a task covered under this act, Tiwari in his petition said.If the criminal organisations succeed in committing such acts then it may lead to chaos and big imbalance as it will affect the vaccination programme of government negatively and instead of cure it will bring more disastrous effects, the lawyer stated in his petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-hears-plea-seeking-prevention-of-circulation-of-fake-covid-19-vaccine/story-REVLKsExXjSctdPArzM5BJ.html
29-12-2020||India||BJP govt crossed all limits of injustice, atrocities; farmers will bring them down: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said the protesting farmers will bring down the BJP government at the Centre and predicted his own party’s victory in the next Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Yadav attacked the government in tweets and at a press conference after Urdu poet Munnawar Rana’s daughter Somaiyya Rana, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Masood Alam and former MLA Ramesh Gautam joined his party. He repeated that the SP is keeping its doors open for smaller parties and will take everyone along. He also referred to West Bengal and accused the BJP of trying to break leaders away from other parties. “The BJP government has crossed all limits of injustice and atrocities. Whoever raises their voice, the government muzzles it. Democracy will be safe only when this government goes,” the SP chief said. Akhilesh reiterated support to farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders against the three new central agri-marketing laws. He accused the central government of putting off a planned round of talks while farmers camped out in bitter cold. “The BJP is constantly disrespecting farmers. Farmers will bring the arrogant BJP government down to the street,” he tweeted in Hindi. He claimed there had never been so much corruption under any other government, and accused it of harming the economy. Yadav cited the coronavirus lockdown and demonetisation as “examples”. Yadav claimed that over 90 workers died while walking to their homes from the cities during the lockdown, “but the government did not help anyone”. He accused the BJP of poaching leaders from other parties and instigating fights among them. “It is doing the same thing in West Bengal. It did the same in Uttar Pradesh before the assembly elections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-govt-crossed-all-limits-of-injustice-atrocities-farmers-will-bring-them-down-akhilesh-yadav/story-1cUxaUB1Cpmv0Kxn7D40KN.html
29-12-2020||India||How an essential worker experienced a pandemic||Long hours of work in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and erratic sleep rhythms have caused the under eyes of Dr Naman Jain, 35, to turn puffy. Other marks have faded. “While wearing the PPE suit, I had to tape the second mask which I wore above the N-95 mask under my eyes so that it would stay in place. While taking it off, the skin under my eyes would often tear,” says Dr Jain, of the critical care department at Fortis Hospital in New Delhi’s Vasant Kunj.It’s a drill he has now become better at. It would take him around 10 minutes to wear the PPE suit, which includes six articles of protective gear to be worn in a certain sequence; he now does it in three.Delhi is the state with the fourth highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in India; the first confirmed case was detected on March 2. At the beginning, the Delhi government designated Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital as the only Covid-19 care facilities. Fortis, like many other private hospitals, began to attend on patients of the viral disease only in April. Dr Jain has been on Covid-19 duty since April.In pre-pandemic times, he either worked the 9am-5pm shift or the 5pm-9pm shift with a weekly day off, when he would stay home with his wife Shilpi. “From April, I’ve been working seven days and then spend seven days in quarantine. I’ve to completely isolate myself in this period. The first two months, April and May, I did not return home and quarantined in a nearby hotel in Vasant Kunj.”That the health crisis would pose a huge challenge to health-care professionals dawned on him gradually. “Like everyone else, I had heard the news on TV. But there was no question of not being mentally prepared. This is what we do. There was no question of not going out or staying back home no matter what the risk. I telephoned my mom and told my wife it is possible I may not escape infection and survive. Had my wife not been brave, it would have been difficult to carry on my tasks if I had to fight on both fronts,” says Dr Jain. “With time, I think I know how to keep myself safe”. But he always adds this caveat; there are no guarantees.This is also what he tells patients and their attendants. “Medical illiteracy is one of the challenges right now,” he says. “Every doctor faces difficult questions from families who at times turn on us. It’s almost a year since the crisis broke over all our heads, people should know that overnight things can turn serious in Covid cases, especially if a patient is aged and has comorbidities. If the patient gets into a cytokine storm where the body’s immune system turns hostile and multiple organs get affected along with the lungs or there is massive pulmonary embolism, there is not much a doctor can do. The medical field has its limitations.”Being a doctor in the ICU, death is not new to Dr Jain. “It is always hard losing a patient, it’s just that now you are losing a person faster. And that does cause stress”. But lessons have been learnt on the job. “Daily, we get new studies that help us understand the disease and its progression,” he says. With time, he has also learnt how to “carry on for long periods without food and water, or having to relieve myself to take a toilet break. This is not to say that it isn’t hard or that there aren’t bad days.”Initially, the stress was overwhelming when colleagues too started getting infected. So far, he has known fear, he says, only twice. “When a colleague in the ICU who was working on the same shift as I was got infected. And another time when as my breath was fogging the mask and clouding my vision, I had to remove my shield to intubate [the process of inserting a tube through the mouth and then into the airway so as to put him on the ventilator] a patient so I was in direct contact with the patient. But the effort paid off as he walked out of our hospital alive,” he says.There is also on-the-job pressure when relatives get admitted. “To make my 76-year-old uncle understand his condition was a hurdle. He survived.” Even his own family got the same line, Dr. Jain says. “I had told them there were no guarantees that he would come out alive, but we will try our best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-an-essential-worker-experienced-a-pandemic/story-TndWdnxqU022N1TTnY4voO.html
29-12-2020||India||Union Territory of Ladakh gets its own meteorological centre||A meteorological centre was inaugurated in the Union Territory of Ladakh on Tuesday which would provide localised weather forecasts thus strengthening weather-related early warning system for the region.At 3,500 metres, this meteorological centre is the highest such facility in India, Union Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan said at the inauguration of the facility.He said it will provide short range (three days,) medium range (12 days) and long range (one month) forecast for the two districts -- Leh and Kargil -- of the Union Territory.The region is unique in terms of weather, climate, culture, topography with extreme temperatures, ranging from minus 40 degrees Celsius in Drass to scanty average precipitation of 10 centimetres annually, which makes the region a distinct cold desert, he said.Ladakh also experiences various kinds of extreme weather events like cloud bursts, flash floods, glacial lake outbursts, avalanches and drought.“To avert losses due to such weather events in the future, the Government of India felt the need to establish a meteorological Centre at Leh to strengthen weather-related early warning system in Ladakh. At 3,500 metres, Meteorological Centre, Leh, will be the highest meteorological centre in India,” Vardhan said.The centre will also give weather forecasts about tourist places such as Nubra, Changthang, Pangong Lake, Zanskar, Kargil, Drass, Dha-Baima (Aryan valley), Khalsi, he said.Some important services are highway forecast, forecast for mountaineering, trekking, agriculture, flash flood warning, information on gusty winds, low and high temperatures.“Keeping in mind the geo-strategic importance, harsh environment, changing climate and vulnerabilities to various natural hazards and disasters affecting the region adversely, the government felt the need to open a state-of-the-art meteorological centre in Leh,” the Union Minister added.IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said the new centre will help augment the weather services. Ladakh has four Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), two each in Leh and Kargil, of which one is at Drass, the coldest place in India. To improve the network of observations, IMD plans to install more AWSs next year at the remotest of places like Nubra, Zanskar, Changthang, Parkachik and others, thus covering the whole of Ladakh, Mohapatra said. To begin with, the India Meteorological Department established a surface observatory at Leh for reporting daily meteorological parameters like pressure, humidity, temperature, snowfall, etc. With the availability of quality data from Ladakh, IMD will generate city-specific forecasts based on numerical models, the MeT department sad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-territory-of-ladakh-gets-its-own-meteorological-centre/story-jxr58IMIxSeJG5qDarN9OM.html
29-12-2020||India||Amid tourist rush to ring in new year, Uttarakhand braces for cold wave||The India Meteorological Department on Tuesday predicted that cold wave conditions are likely to prevail in Uttarakhand for the next three days. In a weather bulletin for December 30-January 1, the MeT department predicted, “Cold wave conditions are likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarakhand. Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur in some parts of the plains, especially in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts. Ground frost is likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarakhand.” Meanwhile, there has been a tourist rush in the hill towns of Mussoorie and Dhanaulti after the latter reported the season’s first snowfall on Monday. Lal Tibba in Mussoorie witnessed a brief spell of snow on Monday accompanied by hailstorm and intermittent rain. Sanjay Bhasin, a tourist from Delhi said, “We had expected snowfall during this weekend and were fortunate enough to witness a couple of inches of snow while on our way to Dhanaulti.” Souvik Chatterjee, a tourist from Delhi said, “We did not find snow when we reached Mussoorie but we have extended our stay for a few days and are hopeful that we will be able to witness a fresh spell of snow on new year.” The police in Mussoorie have planned traffic diversions in view of an expected rush of tourists for the new year. Devendra Aswal, police station in-charge of Mussoorie said, “We have deployed additional police force near Jaypee bend to manage the traffic heading towards Dhanaulti. We have prepared a detailed traffic plan and will introduce a one-way traffic system at Gajji bend and divert the traffic to Cart road during new year celebrations and in case of heavy spells of snow.” Rajat Agarwal, president of Mussoorie traders’ association said, “The first spell of snow has brought tourists to the town but the administration should ensure clearing of snow immediately to avoid traffic congestion.” Manish Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate Mussoorie said that all departments concerned have been instructed to stay alert and act immediately by implementing the traffic plan and clearing snow from the roads in case of heavy snowfall in the future. He added that the administration is also following strict Covid-19 safety protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-tourist-rush-to-ring-in-new-year-uttarakhand-braces-for-cold-wave/story-pCO9vA7GVDplaVTX7WExnO.html
29-12-2020||India||Kerala extends education scholarship, wedding grant for transgenders||With an aim to bring the transgender community into the forefront of society, the Left government in Kerala has announced a slew of programmes, including extension of scholarship for third gender students and financial aid for legally married transcouples. Announcing the initiatives on Tuesday, Minister for Social Justice K K Shylaja said the Social Justice Department has sanctioned Rs six lakh for the scholarship of the marginalised group students in the current financial year. The scholarship scheme is targeted at the trans students, studying from seventh standard to colleges in the government, aided and self-financing educational institutions. “It is part of the drive to bring the marginalised and generally isolated transgender community into the mainstream of society,” the minister said in a statement. Under the scheme, Rs 1000 per month would be given to each third gender student studying in Class 7 to Class 10 for a period of 10 months. The scholarship would be Rs 1,500 per month for transgender students studying in higher secondary and Rs 2,000 per month for those pursuing diploma, degree, professional and post-graduate courses for a 10 months, the minister explained. As an educationally backward group, there was need for giving more care and consideration for transgender community members,the minister said detailing the circumstances that prompted the government to launch such a scheme. Besides this, a recent survey had found that 58 per cent of transgender students drop out of educational institutions in the state without being able to complete even basic education, the minister added. The Department also decided to extend Rs 30,000 financial aid for trans couples who enter into wedlock legally, in the current financial year also. “A total of Rs three lakh has been sanctioned for the same. Through this, Rs 30,000 each can be given to 10 trans couples,” she said, adding that the scheme was aimed at helping trans people build up a social life through marriages. Applications for the grant can be submitted six months after the marriage and up to one year, the minister added. Incidentally, Kerala was the first state in the country which unveiled the Transgender Policy to end the societal stigma towards the sexual minority group and ensure them non- discriminatory treatment and justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-extends-education-scholarship-wedding-grant-for-transgenders/story-9EqNL672y0JsW8C2VoNRWL.html
29-12-2020||India||‘Agriculture can’t be run sitting in Delhi’: Sharad Pawar slams Centre for ‘bulldozing’ farm laws||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday criticised the Centre for excluding state governments and not consulting them on the three new contentious farm laws, which has triggered protests by farmers since the last one month. The clearance of the laws has prompted thousands of farmers to camp on the borders of the national capital since November 26.In a stinging remark, the NCP supremo said that the agriculture sector of the country cannot be run sitting in Delhi. “Agriculture can’t be run by sitting in Delhi as it involves hard-working farmers in villages and a bigger responsibility for this subject lies with state governments,” Pawar told news agency PTI. Pawar also countered the charges by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who has said that the NCP leader wanted to introduce the same legislation during the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government but couldn’t do so, owing to the political pressure. “I and Manmohan Singh also wanted to bring some reforms in the agriculture sector but not in the same way as the current dispensation did. That time the agriculture ministry held long deliberations on the proposed reforms with agriculture ministers of all states and experts of the sector,” Pawar said.“So, when a majority of agriculture ministers had some reservations, it was the duty of the central government and mine to take them in confidence and resolve their issues before moving ahead,” Pawar said.Attacking the arrogance posed by the government while introducing the three farms law, Pawar said, “How can a government say in a democracy that it won’t listen or it won’t change its line? In a way, the government bulldozed these three bills.”Had the Centre consulted state governments and taken them in confidence, then such a situation wouldn’t have arisen, Pawar said. The NCP chief, whose party is a one-third stakeholder in the Maharashtra government, has also alleged that farmers are not a priority for the government. “If farmers would have been the priority of the government, this problem would not have continued for so long. Then they say there are farmers only from Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh who are protesting,” Pawar said.“Have they not contributed to the overall food security of the country?” Pawar asked.Pawar’s remarks come following the Centre’s invite to protesting farmers for a meeting on Wednesday in Delhi to discuss the three farm laws after farmers’ unions agreed to restart negotiations with the government in a bid to resolve the stalemate. The invite comes amid one of the largest strikes by the farmers’ unions on the borders of the national capital in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three laws approved by Parliament in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agriculture-can-t-be-run-sitting-in-delhi-sharad-pawar-slams-centre-for-bulldozing-farm-laws/story-3hWHnTPR19uSjTbsmpHxnK.html
29-12-2020||India||J&K: Highest number of ceasefire violations by Pak in 2020 since 2003 truce||There were 5,100 instances of ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2020 in Jammu and Kashmir, the highest in nearly 18 years, that claimed 36 lives and left more than 130 people injured, according to security officials.They said the “very heavy” shelling and firing by Pakistani troops virtually made the 2003 India-Pakistan border truce “redundant”.“Pakistani troops repeatedly targeted forwards posts and villages along the LoC and the International Border (IB) to create fear among the people and destabilise the peace along the borderline,” a senior police officer said.“Pakistani forces have violated the ceasefire 5,100 times in 2020 with an average of 14 cases daily,” an official source said. In these ceasefire violations, 36 people including 24 security personnel were killed and 130 injured, according to the compiled data. Fifteen of the soldiers died along the LoC in the Jammu region.There were 3,289 ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army along the Indo-Pak border in 2019, they said. Of these, 1,565 ceasefire violations took place since August 2019, after the Indian government abrogated Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the erstwhile state into union territories.In 2018, Jammu and Kashmir had recorded 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan with an average of eight cases daily, in which 61 people were killed and over 250 injured.The number of ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops in 2020 was over five times that of 2017 when 971 cases were reported in which 31 people -- 12 civilians and 19 security forces personnel -- were killed and 151 suffered injures.Before the ceasefire agreement, as many as 8,376 incidents of shelling and firing by Pakistani troops were reported in 2002. For three years - 2004, 2005 and 2006 - there was not a single such violation on the border. However, there had been a gradual increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan since 2009. People living near the border in Jammu, Kathua, Kupwara and Baramulla, Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts were also severely hit by firing and shelling by Pakistani troops during the year.The officials said that due to shelling and firing incidents, people had to migrate to safer places three times which affected education and farm activities.To protect border residents in the wake of increasing ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir, the central government sanctioned Rs 415 crore for constructing over 14,400 underground bunkers along the LoC and the IB.As many as 7,777 bunkers have been constructed under the programme in Rajouri, Poonch, Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts and tenders have been floated for more such shelters, the officials said, adding the rest would be constructed soon.Giving details of the ceasefire violations, they said that in 2015, 405 cases of ceasefire violations were reported while 583 such instances were recorded in 2014.The corresponding figures for 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 347, 114, 62, 44, and 28. There were 77 violations in 2008, 21 in 2007 and three in 2006, according to official data.The Indian government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had entered into the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan on November 26, 2003.India shares a 3,323-km border with Pakistan, of which 221 km of the IB and 740 km of the LoC fall in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-highest-number-of-ceasefire-violations-by-pak-in-2020-since-2003-truce/story-TJ7teyXb88dheysDqEgWCN.html

But a faith in truth and striving hard would get you to be victorious of truth and today is one among such,” Bhagwat said.He said the objective of ‘Kesari’ was to establish the way of ‘Dharma.“The objective of Kesari was to establish the way of ‘Dharma’, no matter if we achieved some victories. In spite of all odds, we should strive to achieve our goals to attain dharm”, the RSS chief added.Bhagwat released eight books including “RSS in Kerala: Saga of a Struggle” on the martyrs of the RSS and BJP, authored by Dr AKM Das and compiled jointly by Dr Das, VM Gopinath and Shabu Prasad.Later, he inaugurated the library at the centre.Organising Committee President, P R Nathan, noted Hindu religious scholar Swami Chidananthapuri, Ramakrishna Ashram regional chief Narasinhananda Saraswathi, Chinmaya Mission regional head Swami Tejomayananda and O Rajagopal, MLA, were among those who were present at the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mohan-bhagwat-inaugurates-media-studies-and-research-centre/story-nVSSPiCF8trzeARdkTjUeI.html
29-12-2020||India||Not the time to disco this NY’s eve, say DJs||Partying on the tunes of celebrity disc jockeys from Delhi and Mumbai, tight schedules of city-based DJs and premium packages have been a routine in the pre-Covid era. But, even as the world waits with bated breath to welcome the ‘year of hope’ 2021, the end of 2020 may not be musical for many city DJ’s.Some of them — mostly working on monthly-contracts with hotels, discs and lounges — confirmed bookings for the New Year-eve bashes. However, a larger chunk reported a low-key end to the year. Reeling under less work in bare minimum remuneration, the DJs are hoping for last-minute bookings for private bashes or at commercial places who are undecided to hold the year-end celebrations or not.Low key, few queriesCity’s leading DJ Moni said that every year they used to have at least 14-15 events in Lucknow, Kanpur and Delhi-NCR. “This year, till now, I have only one confirmed booking at a city lounge and my jockey will go and play. They are not paying my desired prices so I will better skip and stay back at home,” says Moni who has a lot of DJs who play for him.He has been getting queries but is not getting any confirmation. “For quality work, you need to pay a certain price. We have got a lot of queries but after we quote our rates, which certainly are down to previous years, there are no confirmations. Let’s hope fence-sitters make a move,” says Moni.Low budgetDJ Karan says that the organisers are in no mood to shell out money they used previously. “Standard rates for DJ used to be in the range of Rs 50,000. Even if we are quoting Rs 20,000 we are getting feedback that someone is doing in Rs 8,000. For us, half of the price goes to sound and equipment guys, so economics is not working out. The sound and equipment guys are hiring boys to play music for them and spoiling the market as they also are without any work,” he adds.Moni added that till last year they charged Rs 3-10 lakh as a package including band where for just DJ it was Rs 1 lakh but people are not ready to shell out even half of that price.Unclear guidelinesHotels, lounges and discs are still not sure about the last-minute guidelines that may arrive. “As per the current scenario technically, there cannot be music after 10-10:30 pm. We are not sure what will be the guideline for the New Year eve. When a guest comes to bash, they visit with a mindset to enjoy past midnight. That is the reason people are not confirming their parties and skipping bigger events. Many of them are holding gala dinners instead of big bashes,” said DJ Dub Monster. He is based in Chandigrah but is frequent to Lucknow and has played here on NY-eve twiceSmaller partiesDJ Rony, who plays at Club Momentz, under a monthly contract, has taken over the charge of the event. “Since the gatherings are small, we are not calling a celebrity DJ from Delhi or Mumbai. Instead, our in-house DJ took over the four small events that will be held at our club,” said Jugal Sachdeva.Due to Covid protocols and standard operating procedures, everyone is organising smaller events at their places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/not-the-time-to-disco-this-ny-s-eve-say-djs/story-yp0BulYcKvPyN4s8TAN6GM.html

Police said that the surrendered Maoists were given immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 each and will be provided other facilities under the Chhattisgarh government’s surrender and rehabilitation policy. “Eight Maoists surrendered on Monday evening under our drive which is called ‘Lon Varratu’. Out of these eight, Bhima Barse (28), Sona Tati (20), Madka Barse (21) and Pitte alias Bhima Mandavi (35) among who were among the Maoists involved in the killing of MLA Mandavi,” said Dantewada’s Superintendent of Police (SP), Abhishek Pallava. The others who surrendered are Aytu Bhaskar (25), section commander in platoon number 13 of Maoists, Raju Karam (25), head of Chetna Natya Mandli and Mahesh Kumar Dodi, the SP added. “We have started a drive “Lon Varratu” which has been very successful in Dantewada district and till now a total of 226 Maoists have surrendered in the district,” said the SP. Under “Lon Varratu”, which in local Gondi language means ‘Return Home’, about 50 hypersensitive Maoist villages have been selected and pamphlets about the details of the left-wing rebels have been put in the village by the villagers with an appeal to surrender. The initiative was launched in June.However, tribal leaders allege that in “Lon Varratu” drive, the common tribals now find themselves trapped between police and Maoists. “Who has given rights to the police to declare a person as Maoist? Have they submitted the list of Maoists to the court? Common people who are farming in their village are declared as Maoist under this campaign,” said Soni Sori, a tribal leader of Bastar. She further said that on one hand, the tribals are pressurized to surrender and on the other hand, Maoists torture them for cooperating with police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-maoists-surrender-in-chhattisgarh-s-insurgency-hit-dantewada/story-zHeV5taRPkeGkjWPQTw2iL.html

29-12-2020||India||CM Palaniswami resumes poll campaign day after no to coalition govt||Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami resumed his 2021 assembly election campaign on Tuesday from Namakkal district, a day after ruling out the possibility of the AIADMK heading a coalition government after the 2021 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu. However, he maintained that all constituents of the AIADMK-led alliance that fought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are together. The AIADMK partnered with the BJP and other regional parties to fight last year’s general elections. “As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, people will not accept a coalition Cabinet. That is the AIADMK’s stand,” Palaniswami had said on Monday after landing at the Coimbatore airport addressing for the first time the question of power sharing. Though the national ally hasn’t contradicted the AIADMK’s decision, it is yet to formally reciprocate on the continuing alliance and Palaniswami’s candidature. BJP state leaders had in previous months made comments on running a coalition government and picking the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu. AIADMK’s chief ministerial candidate Palaniswami, launched the party’s campaign Tuesday titled, “Vetrinadaipodum Tamilzhagam’ (Tamil Nadu’s victorious march) by meeting people door-to-door and addressing the public. He will present a ‘report card’ of the party’s achievements over the last ten years since it has been in power and a vision for the state. December 19 was Palaniswami’s first day of campaigning which he kicked-off from his home constituency in Salem as the AIADMK seeks a third consecutive term in the ensuing assembly elections. When asked about BJP not formally endorsing him as the chief ministerial candidate, Palaniswami had told reporters Monday that the AIADMK made the announcement (in October) as they were starting the election campaign. BJP’s state president L Murugan had met Palaniswami at the state secretariat on Monday morning to submit 50-lakh signatures they received in support of the New Education Policy. Following the meeting, Murugan told reporters that the AIADMK-BJP alliance was strong and that all questions on the alliance will be answered in two-three days. This came after AIADMK’s public meeting on Sunday in Chennai when AIADMK’s deputy coordinator K P Munusamy had lashed out against critics of the Dravidian rule and national parties. “There is no scope for a coalition government and there is no need for it. If any party comes to us with that intention, I urge you to rethink,” Munusamy had said on Sunday.Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam had announced in November in the presence of union home minister Amith Shah that their alliance with the BJP will continue. Since then the BJP’s state leaders have said that it is procedure only for their national leadership to take decisions and make public announcements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-palaniswami-resumes-poll-campaign-day-after-no-to-coalition-govt/story-TnAkuf7J29hEcDNGNaKzUK.html

They will be prepared to act as and when required, he said, adding the forces have also been directed to prepare a database of their personnel who will be among the first to get the vaccine.Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Director General S S Deswal had told PTI in an interview last month that the CAPFs will play a major role in the anti-coronavirus vaccination programme in the country and their healthcare facilities will also be part of this drive.These forces, with an estimated strength of about 10 lakh personnel, include the BSF, CRPF, CISF and SSB apart from two other central forces NDRF and NSG.A mock drill for administering the Covid-19 vaccine was carried out by the government on Monday in some select districts of four states to test the systems deployed and find out pitfalls before the commencement of the actual drive.Another official said apart from Covid-19 measures, at the annual national conference of directors general and inspectors general of police action plans have been formulated for preparing a robust cyber security plan for their organisations and personnel.It was also decided during the meeting, held virtually between December 2-5, that police organisations should prepare a record on how various challenges they faced were tackled and what solutions were deployed.“This would help in better planning to tackle future challenges in the internal security, terrorism, left wing extremism, criminal investigations and border security domain. Every police organisation has been asked to prepare their record-sheet as per the task they render and expertise,” the second officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capfs-to-provide-assistance-in-waste-disposal-during-covid-19-immunisation/story-hI1cKeFlPbn6L9HP4WtwuL.html

He asked me to bury him here only. Let him rest peacefully for now,” the 16-year-old is heard saying on video.According to local people, the family was staying in a two-room shanty which was allegedly built on an encroached land. The father was engaged in litigation with a neighbour for five years and a local court in Neyyatinkara had ordered him to evacuate the land in June.On December 22, when police and revenue officials arrived at his house, he poured kerosene on himself and his wife and threatened to light themselves if they were forced out.His children later said it was only a threat and police officials aggravated the situation and in the scuffle that followed their bodies had suddenly caught fire.A police officer also received minor burn injuries while trying to save them. In the dying declaration, the boy’s father told a magistrate that he was “only threatening and police officials were responsible for the accidental fire”.Local people said despite his poor background he used to distribute free food for urchins in the area almost every day.Though police denied any involvement, saying the couple burnt themselves accidentally, the embarrassed government has ordered a probe into circumstances that led to their deaths. The state human rights commission has also asked the police to submit a report. The government said a new house will be built and it will bear the education expenses of children, aged 16 and 19.The high court had stayed the lower court’s order on evacuation but it did not reach the family in time. State opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has asked the government to take action against erring police officials who allegedly drove them to death.Many organisations and leaders have pledged to help the children. The mother will be buried near the same grave later in the day.State police chief Loknath Behera has asked Thiruvananthapuram rural police superintendent B Ashokan to submit a report at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-of-teen-pleading-with-cops-to-let-him-bury-his-father-sparks-outrage/story-EiG2sGScx8u19kqJZsOXIL.html

The 77-year-old R Sathyanarayana Rao said it’s his brother’s wish and one can’t force him to change his mind. When pointed to “lot of expectations” that people had on Rajinikanth’s planned political debut, Rao said: “We too believed that (he would launch the party)”. “He (Rajinikanth) has cited health reasons. So, we can’t force him. It’s his wish (not to launch party). Whatever decision he has taken, that’s definitely right”, Rao told PTI.ALSO WATCH | ‘Only I know the pain’: Rajinikanth won’t enter politics, cites health reasons  He said he spoke to Rajinikanth on Monday enquiring about his health.

29-12-2020||India||Customs officer accused of molesting Uzbek nationals forced to retire||The government has compulsorily retired a customs superintendent posted at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport for allegedly molesting two woman passengers from Ukbekistan, a finance ministry official said.“The superintendent was first suspended for his alleged misconduct and later on December 21 he was served the notice of compulsory retirement under the Fundamental Rule (FR) 56(j),” the official said, requesting anonymity. FR 56(j) deals with premature retirement of senior officers.The action was taken against the officer on the basis of an incident on the night of May 2, 2019. That night two women Uzbekistani passengers arrived from Tashkent. One of them was taken outside the CCTV coverage area upon reaching the green channel and was detained for an hour. Later she was allowed to leave as there was no seizure of any contraband, the official said.Also Read: From child marriage to revenge porn: 10 set-backs for women in 2020The second Uzbekistani passenger was similarly detained for over 30 minutes and then she, too, was released without any seizure of contraband, he said.“Both the passengers were confined alone in a room with the superintendent without the presence of any woman customs officer and both the passengers were allegedly subjected to sexual harassment and molestation,” he said.Later, one of the passengers testified in front of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and identified the officer, accusing him of molestation and obscene sexual acts in the preventive room, he added.“On the basis of inquiry and analysis of video footage, the official was given compulsory retirement. Further inquiries and criminal proceeding will, however, continue,” he said.The department of revenue (DoR), an arm of the union finance ministry that also controls the customs department, suspended the official while the matter was investigated under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. “The committee held detailed enquiries and finally recommended his compulsory retirement under FR 56(j) on charges of ‘gross misconduct’, ‘sexual harassment of grave nature’ besides ‘acute adverse impact on the image of the department’ and lowering the morals of the officers of the service,” the official said.“Taking a holistic view of the record of the officer, the committee concluded that his (accused) conduct is such that his continuance in service would be a menace to public service and injurious to public interest,” he said.Notwithstanding the order of compulsory retirement, the departmental inquiries and criminal proceedings, if any, against the superintendent will continue, he said. “Appropriate action may be taken by the disciplinary authority as and when the charges are proved as compulsory retirement under FR 56(j) is not a punitive measure,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-officer-accused-of-molesting-uzbek-nationals-forced-to-retire/story-defhZknsqMJ4eotUkUPZ1L.html

29-12-2020||India||PM Modi inaugurates New Bhaupur-New Khurja stretch of Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the 351-km ‘New Bhaupur- New Khurja section’ in Uttar Pradesh of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor(EDFC) via video conferencing. During the event, he also inaugurated the EDFC’s Operation Control Centre (OCC) at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.While counting the innumerable benefits of the dedicated freight corridors, PM Modi attacked the opposition and said that the lack of investment in developing the infrastructure of the railways “shows how the previous government before us used to work”. “The plan to develop the dedicated freight corridors have been on paper since 2006 but the work started after 2014. Zero kilometres of the corridor was constructed in eight years, while in the last six to seven years we have built 1100 Kms,” he compared.The Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor is a 1875-km stretch that connects Punjab’s Ludhiana to Dankuni in West Bengal. The project is aimed at decongesting the railway lines and to make the transportation of goods smoother without any delays. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath who was also present during the virtual inauguration of the project also claimed that the speed of freight trains will double from 25km/hour to 75 km/hour.Talking about the modern and technologically advanced OCC at Prayagraj, PM Modi said that the Made in India state-of-the art structure shows the strength of new India. He added that the government has always focussed on infrastructural development for the growth of the nation. The boost in connectivity with the development of the freight corridor will also help Kisan Rail and farmers to transport their harvest on time. The OCC, which will be the command centre for the entire route, is said to be one of the largest control centres in the world. Apart from EDFC, the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor is also being developed. The 1506 km stretch will connect Mumbai to Uttar Pradesh’s Dadri.Adding to the list of benefits, the Prime Minister said that the dedicated corridor will reduce the logistical cost of the railways network thus influencing the price of the goods. It will also increase the ease of doing business and attract greater foreign investment, PM Modi added.He also talked about Atmanirbhar Bharat and gave the example of Raebareily modern coach factory that has till date produced 5000 rail coaches and has now begun exporting too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-inaugurates-new-bhaupur-new-khurja-strtech-of-eastern-dedicated-freight-corridor/story-DtoU5Mg9u3q6d0PKYqOdOI.html

She was issued summons to appear before the central agency on Tuesday. Talking to the media, Raut, who is also the chief spokesperson of the Shiv Sena, said more time has been sought. “We have asked for about four more days,” said Raut. “I have still not seen the notice but will reply to it as, despite differences, we respect the central agencies. It is an action out of political vendetta and everybody knows it. I am a Rajya Sabha MP and a lawmaker. I will respect the law despite some people holding it hostage and managing it to evade action,” he added. Taunting the BJP, the Sena leader alleged that those indulging in financial scams tend to join the BJP. “We have committed no wrong and we are not afraid,” he underlined. According to sources, Varsha Raut has sought time till January 5 next year.Reacting to the new development, BJP leader Kirit Somaiyya said such delay exposes Raut. “This is a third notice to Varsha Raut.

A shortlist will be announced shortly and then later a detailed list will be out,” said a source.State in-charge Ajay Maken is holding meetings with leaders and party workers, and for this, he had met Pilot recently in Delhi.While Pilot is skipping events in Jaipur and reaching out to Delhi, it can be seen as a halt in the state’s political storm or there is another storm brewing that is making Pilot maintain the silence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rajasthan-saga-continues-pilot-maintains-distance-from-jaipur-on-foundation-day/story-z5dqqXdVpTKBMo2WW8QqIO.html
29-12-2020||India||India-China military talks on standoff paused due to change of guard in PLA||The ninth round of military dialogue between India and China is expected to take place once the newly-appointed PLA Western Theatre Commander Gen Zhang Xudong completes his military familiarisation and troop deployments on the Indian border. Gen Zhang, who has never served on the Indian border or Tibet, took over from Tibet veteran Gen Zhao Zongqi on December 21. Gen Zhao was the principal implementer of Bejing agression in Doklam in 2017 and in East Ladakhin May 2020. According to senior officials, the December 18 meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) ended on a positive note but the ninth round of military talks are crucial as both sides are expected to work towards working out a written disengagement and de-escalation agreement. “ It is work in progress and till such time a firm agreement is not chalked out, India is holding positions on East Ladakh,” said a millitary officer.As for the dates for the ninth round are concerned, the Indian understanding is that this could be due to the new PLA Western Theatre Commander taking over as military leader of Tibet and Xinjiang. The process of induction of a new military commander takes time as Gen Zhang is expected to visit key deployments and receive his operational briefings about the situation along the 3488-kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC).For now, Indian officials said they expect the new military commander to take a similar line against India as the last one since Beijing appeared to be pulling the strings to keep the East Ladakh in stand-off mode to achieve its strategic objectives during the 100th year of Chinese Communist Party in 2021.Also Read: Donald Trump defies Chinese warning, signs off on law on next Dalai LamaPresident Xi is expected to project China as the global economic and military power ahead of the Communist Party of China’s main centenary celebrations in July next year. It was in this context that President Xi had, in his speech at the Central Economic Work Conference earlier this month, skipped any negative references to the challenges ahead for the economy, a contrast from his speech at the forum last year when he had spoken of “downward economic pressure”.As part of this script in East Ladakh, the PLA is expected to keep up the pressure, notwithstanding the fact that the entire bilateral relationship with India has been put to stake on a piece of mountainous land between finger 4 and finger 8 on the north banks of the frozen Pangong Tso.The Chinese propaganda media, on its part, is, as usual, blaming India and right-wing nationalism for hyping up the threat from the Middle Kingdom and using it to decouple economic ties. The Communist Party mouthpiece has reminded India of military power differential between two neighbors even though it is unproven and untested. It has also tried to ridicule Indian Army Chief Gen MM Naravane December 23 visit to the Ladakh front-line on southern banks of Pangong Tso by saying that the troops who accepted sweets from the military commander will be the ones to “get dragged down” in case India does not withdraw.The Indian Army dominates the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline on Kailash Ranges after specialised troops on August 29-30 pre-empted a Chinese plan to force the 1959 line on the southern banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-military-talks/story-9MxucWK9WPx3J8bTuD2sgM.html

According to police sources, Gowda had asked his official gunman and escort to leave him alone on Monday evening. He had left his home in Shakarayapatna in an old personal Santro car with his driver and came to Gunasagar at around 6 pm. He then asked his driver to leave him as he had to meet someone.His last call is said to have made enquiries about train timings from a friend in Kadur.

The dry run will also help health authorities identify the shortcomings and sort out the issues before vaccines are administered to people.The two-day dry run is being held in four states.The health ministry, meanwhile, said on Monday that India’s recovery rate has increased to 95.83 per cent.It also said that India’s Covid-19 cases per million population are among the lowest in the world (7,397) and the global average is 10,149.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Monday wrote a letter to chief secretaries of all states to instruct the concerned authorities for their active support to the health ministry in identification, preparation of database, vaccine delivery, storage, security, shipment and vaccination of beneficiaries.The Centre on Monday maintained the Covid-19 restrictions on various activities, noting that while there has been a continuous decline in active cases in India, there is a need for surveillance, containment and caution due to a surge globally and the emergence of a new variant of the virus in the UK.In a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that it has issued fresh guidelines for surveillance with regard to Covid-19 that will remain in force till January 31, as it asked the states and union territories to keep a strict vigil to prevent any rise in cases during the New Year celebrations and the winter season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-16-432-new-cases-of-covid-19-recoveries-cross-9-8-million/story-LDIIsi2QbHsEo24IMPV2AI.html
29-12-2020||India||Delhi Airport says it’s ready for Covid vaccine distribution challenge||Distributing vaccines around India will pose plenty of logistical headaches given the size of the country, its vast population and number of coronavirus cases, now at more than 10 million.For its part, India’s busiest airport is “completely ready” to handle Covid-19 vaccines, according to Delhi International Airport Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, but there could be issues elsewhere considering more remote areas may not be equipped with sufficient equipment and containers. “One of the key challenges will be the availability of cold chain across India,” he said.New Delhi’s airport -- Indira Gandhi International -- will be a main handling point and has facilities to store 2.7 million vials of vaccine at 2-to-8 degrees Celsius, as well as cooling chambers that can keep temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, Jaipuriar said.“As soon as we get an indication on what’s going to be the flow, we will do the final tune up and then we will be ready to go,” Jaipuriar said in an interview with Bloomberg News during a tour of the airport’s facilities on Dec. 22. He said there was also capacity to potentially export vaccines to nearby countries.India is relying largely on two domestically made vaccines from Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Serum Institute of India Ltd., which has partnered with AstraZeneca Plc to produce at least one billion doses. Ultra-cold storage requirements for Pfizer Inc.’s shot make it an unlikely choice for widespread use given India’s patchy health networks and infrastructure, especially in rural areas where the bulk of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion people live.According to Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, a measure of the best places to be in the Covid-19 era, India is a long way down the list, ranked No. 39 out of 53 economies in December, below even the U.S. and Brazil. New Zealand -- with its closed borders, vaccine deals and elimination of the virus in the community -- remains No. 1.India, along with China, the world’s most-populous nation, both slipped in the ranking versus November. While both countries have secured over two billion shots with multiple developers, that’s less per capita coverage than many smaller places.“This is a huge logistics exercise that needs to be worked out in detail for the vaccine to reach every nook and corner,” Jaipuriar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-airport-says-it-s-ready-for-covid-vaccine-distribution-challenge/story-9AHCVXtZwhbOv3lF2lh4DK.html

Amid these concerns, one of its employee unions, Air India Employees Union (AIEU), has written to the civil aviation minister, seeking an urgent appointment to discuss various pending staff issues, including provident funds, medical and welfare facilities.The letter dated December 26 urged the minister to let their medical scheme continue as is for serving and retired employees. They also appealed for their provident fund trusts to continue even after Air India is privatised. Also Read: Air India pilots upset over cut in pay rollback, won’t work after duty timeSeeking urgent attention on their issues, the letter stated, “AIEU would like to place on record that there is a practice of availing the benefit of leave encashment at the time of retirement. Several employees depend on this benefit to lead a decent retired life. Several employees will suffer huge financial losses. Therefore, AIEU would like to propose that the employees should be paid leave encashment allowances till March 31, 2021.” The union also demanded that their charter of demands that has been pending since January 2002 must be settled before disinvestment, and arrears should be paid to all the employees. In January this year, the government invited bids for selling 100% of its holding in Air India and its international budget arm Air India Express Ltd, and 50% in the ground-handling joint venture Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.Air India had a total of 14,032 employees, including 9,426 permanent and remaining on contract as on November 1, 2019, as per the Preliminary Information Memorandum issued on January 20 this year.

29-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Dummy vaccination to be carried out on day 2 of dry run today||It is the second day of the vaccination dry run in four states where necessary infrastructure and processes are being tested before the expected rollout of Covid-19 vaccine in January.The two-day end-to-end dry run is being carried out in Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, Rajkot and Gandhinagar in Gujarat, Ludhiana and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr) in Punjab and Sonitpur and Nalbari districts in Assam.While Monday’s exercise included mock registration of volunteers, officials said that Tuesday is when they will be called for the vaccination drill.District Immunisation Officer of Nawanshahr, Dr Davinder Dhanda, said that each centre has a waiting area, an injection room, and an observation room where the person undergoing “dummy vaccination” on Tuesday during the dry run would be kept for half an hour.Prior to the dry run, a special training workshop of personnel was held on Monday. Yesterday’s exercise also tested the functionality of Co-WIN, an online platform for monitoring the delivery of Covid-19 vaccine, deployment of team members, checking cold storage, transportation arrangements and other arrangements while following all necessary protocols.The dry run was being carried out in five locations with 25 test beneficiaries (healthcare workers) for each session.“We have recorded this in the Co-WIN App and sent SMSes to the chosen patients. We have monitored the time taken for different processes and the logistics involved. This will be used in real-time simulation,” Krishna district Collector A Md Imtiyaz told reporters.Officials said that these SMSes will be treated as identity proof for patients’ entry into their allotted centres on Tuesday. Each centre is equipped with a team of five doctors.A report on the dry run listing the issues involved will be submitted by the states to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare besides the State Task Force for necessary action.The exercise comes at a time when drug regulators are expected any day to take a decision on giving emergency approvals to pave way for the first shots to be given. The country targets to deliver doses, likely to be in a regimen of two, to 300 million people by the summer - one of the largest logistical exercises to be undertaken outside of the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-dummy-vaccination-to-be-carried-out-on-day-2-of-dry-run-today/story-1WVXEcJHbFMtJHJd0V9hWI.html

She had skipped the earlier two summons citing ill health, ANI further reported.In September last year, the RBI had capped the withdrawal limit and restricted the activities of the PMC Bank after an alleged fraud of Rs 4,355 crore came to light.The Enforcement Directorate had later seized and identified movable and immovable assets worth more than Rs 3,830 crore owned by Housing Development Infrastructures Ltd (HDIL) in connection with the case. Raut, meanwhile, called the summons an act of cowardice.“Targeting women of a household is an act of cowardice. We are not scared of anyone and will respond accordingly.

These are pieces of paper, nothing else,” he added.The Shiv Sena leader also claimed that he has a list of “120 BJP leaders who are fit case for a probe by the ED for money laundering”.Yuva Sena president and state minister Aaditya Thackeray termed the ED action “politically motivated”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-bank-scam-case-ed-asks-sanjay-raut-s-wife-to-appear-before-it-today/story-ztf0TSz6O1Wlafsc4woPzM.html

After four years, he was formally inducted in the army and continued to serve as personal guard to the Dalai Lama through his schooling in Sera, Drepung and Gaden monasteries for the next 4 years,In the most critical turn of events in March 1959, when the Tibetan uprising was crushed and the threat of Chinese military attacks was ever-growing, on the fateful night of March 17 1959, Dalai Lama accompanied by tens of thousands of Tibetans fled into exile to India.Dawa was the one of the guards who accompanied the Dalai Lama. On arriving safely in India on March 31, the accompanying personal bodyguards and a group of volunteers returned to Tibet to mount a resistance against the Chinese forces.At the time as the youngest of them, Dawa and another bodyguard were asked by the spiritual leader to accompany him to Mussourie where he established his first residence.In accordance with the Dalai Lama’s instructions, he joined the Tibetan Homes School founded in Mussourie as one of its first 50 students and later served in the Central Tibetan Administration as a translator and facilitator for Tibetan refugees arriving in Nepal.He then pursued his further studies in the US. He immigrated to Minnesota through the resettlement policy in 1966.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-surviving-bodyguard-of-dalai-lama-dies-in-minnesota/story-pKzZMvcgQP0apT8ERprH2H.html
29-12-2020||India||Post-Covid economic recovery: Can the rich also hurt growth?||Although it sounds counter-intuitive, this question is important from a macroeconomic perspective. There are two ways in which this can happen. Because the rich save more, they bring in the bulk of domestic sources of investment, especially equity and debt. Equity markets in India are extremely overvalued if the current price-to-earnings multiple is any indicator. To be sure, this rally has also been aided by a surge of inflows from advanced countries, where interest rates have plummeted to an all-time low and investors are looking for more attractive options globally. This inflow has led to a surge in India’s foreign exchange reserves. Because these dollar reserves can move at a very short notice, they cannot be invested in long-term productive purposes and must be held in risk-free and highly liquid forms. In an Indian Express column on December 15, Jahangir Aziz, the chief emerging markets economist at JP Morgan, underlined the economic headwinds these reserves have created for India by undermining the fiscal space (https://bit.ly/2M4BwaG). “Consequently, despite the apparent lack of fiscal space at home, RBI has been funding other countries’ fiscal deficits. Since April this year, RBI has bought $70 billion of foreign assets, presumably mostly US government bonds. That’s roughly 2.7 per cent of GDP. Put differently, while the government has limited its support to the domestic economy, it has, via RBI, invested almost 3 per cent of GDP in foreign assets just in the first half of this fiscal year”, Aziz wrote. If the Reserve Bank of India were not to hold these reserves in this manner, rupee appreciation could make Indian exports lose their competitiveness. To be sure, imposing controls on movement of such money could get rid of these policy pressures, but it would also mean that stock market rallies like the one we are witnessing currently, and the income growth they bring for the rich, would be far more muted. Another way in which an income distribution in favour of the rich adversely affects growth is the trade route. The rich, because they consume more sophisticated products, tend to have a higher import-propensity of demand than the poor. All things remaining the same, a shift in income distribution from the poor to the rich, can lead to a rise in imports, bring down net exports and therefore GDP. To be sure, this process has been underway in the Indian economy for a long time now. A 2015 Economic and Political Weekly paper by Zico Dasgupta and Subhanil Chowdhury looked at this question by examining India’s imports (https://bit.ly/2WEuI5w). The paper found that the rise in India’s current account deficit was because of an increase in import-GDP ratio driving up the trade-deficit. The paper disintegrated “the rise in the import–GDP ratio in terms of three main commodities—gems and jewellery, capital goods and petroleum” and found that “the rise in the imports of commodities is a result of the demand pattern in the economy”. “Even with an increase in inequality, the rise in the (GDP) growth rate is seen to be mainly because of higher consumption by the rich. This consumption being mainly driven by import-intensive commodities, there is an increase in imports” the authors noted. Granted, both the tendencies explained above are not new in the Indian economy. However, if income inequality were to increase further due to the pandemic, which is what the evidence suggests so far, one would expect these headwinds to growth to become stronger. Important to guard against missing the woods for the tress This doesn’t mean absolute gloom and doom in the Indian economy going forward. It is entirely likely, as Neelkanth Mishra, the co-head of Asia-Pacific strategy and India equity strategist for Credit Suisse, has pointed out, that the economy will see patches of brilliance in sectors where the rich deploy their accumulated savings to compensate for pent-up or even transformed demand. People opting for bigger houses as work from home becomes a norm could be an example of the latter variety. A Bloomberg Quint story using CIBIL data showing that housing loans are leading the revival in personal loans, supports such anecdotal accounts (https://bit.ly/2M58KGV). However, it is important to keep in mind that it will take some time for the overall macroeconomic picture to emerge clearly. Given the widespread consensus on the damage to the incomes and employment for the non-rich, it would be premature to write-off long-term damage to the economy.This is the second of a two-part series. The first part (https://bit.ly/3mRPFo7) discussed whether the rich can drive economic growth in post-covid India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-covid-economic-recovery-can-the-rich-also-hurt-growth/story-nx1StPvrCMGG1QNsdgV5HK.html

The caller was using filthy and vulgar language. He questioned me as to why I was opposing Revanth Reddy becoming TPCC President. The caller himself made the conversation viral on social media wherein my photograph and Revanth Reddy’s photographs were displaying. I brought the matter to the notice of the Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad. He told me to lodge the complaint with the Commissioner of Cyberabad since the incident happened there. Then I wrote a complaint and gave it to the ACP He has forwarded it to the Inspector, Raidurgam,” he wrote in the letter.The senior Congress leader said that in his 42-year political career he opposed many leaders across party lines, but never received such threats in his life, and requested the DCP to provide him sufficient protection (security).Notably, Rao on December 25, threatened to resign from the party, along with other party leaders, if Revanth Reddy, who has a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) background, is made the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hanumantha-rao-demands-police-protection-citing-threat-to-life-from-revanth-reddy-s-supporters/story-5GNPvPufU87WiHVw9cjJEN.html
29-12-2020||India||Congress’ Sonia Gandhi hits out at ‘black’ farm laws||The Congress celebrated its 136th foundation day on Monday, with interim president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra using the occasion to extend their support to the farmers’ protest against a set of contentious agricultural laws, but Rahul Gandhi’s decision to skip it for a quick overseas visit cast its shadow on the event. Party veteran A.K.Antony hoisted the party flag at the Congress headquarters in New Delhi to commemorate its 28 December, 1885 foundation. Sonia Gandhi and former party president Rahul Gandhi, who left on Sunday on a visit abroad, weren’t present on the occasion.Sonia Gandhi, who has been avoiding public functions in recent weeks, extended her warm wishes to party workers and backed the farmers’ protest in a 3-minute, 45-second video message. She asserted that “black laws” were being imposed on the farmers. “We have to strengthen the Congress party at the ground level. … let us take a vow today that we will uphold the constitution and democratic values that our country represents,” she said. The Congress celebrated its foundation day against the backdrop of a protest by thousands of farmers, mainly from northern India, who have massed on Delhi’s borders in the winter cold since November 26 to protest against the three farm laws enacted in September by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government.The protestors are demanding that the Centre revoke the three laws, which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates known as minimum support prices (MSPs).Priyanka Gandhi, who was present at the flag hoisting ceremony at the party headquarters, said the government, which has accused the opposition parties of misleading the farmers, should listen to the protestors.“To say that this is a political conspiracy is wrong. I feel that the words being used for farmers are a sin. The government is answerable to the farmers and the government should talk to the farmers and take back the laws,” she said. She said soldiers protecting India’s borders are the sons of farmers and the government should understand that farmers are the “annadatas” (food givers) of the country.Farmers’ leaders, who ended negotiations with the government claiming a stalemate after meeting home minister Amit Shah on December 8, are set to resume the talks on Wednesday. The government has said it is willing to offer a written guarantee that minimum support prices would continue, but refused to repeal the laws.She didn’t comment on Rahul Gandhi’s overseas visit. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala confirmed that Gandhi had left the country on a visit abroad, but did not disclose the location. “Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has left for abroad for a short personal visit and will be away for a few days,” Surjewala told PTI.The ruling BJP questioned the timing of Gandhi’s visit. “So much of noise was made for farmers’ protest by the opp (opposition), where is #RG now? Short holiday? Seriously? If you are so concerned about the farmers, you should have been out there on the streets with them n not holidaying,” BJP leader Khusbhu Sundar wrote on Twitter. Congress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal defended Rahul Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi has gone to see his grandmother. Is it wrong,” Venugopal told ANI. “Everybody has the right to undertake personal visits. BJP is indulging in low-level politics.

Speaking on the occasion, the PM said the service will bring a major change in the farm sector and increase the strength of the country’s cold supply chain. Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also attended the event.“The Prime Minister termed the Kisan Rail Service as a major step towards increasing the income of the farmers of the country. He expressed happiness that even during the Corona pandemic, 100 Kisan Rails were launched in the last four months. He said this service will bring a major change in the economy related to farming and will also increase the strength of the country’s cold supply chain,” a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said.The train, starting from Sangola in Maharashtra and culminating in Shalimar in West Bengal, will cover a distance of 2,132 km with more than 400 tonnes of cargo at a speed of 54.6 kmph in around 39 hours. It is carrying pomegranate, custard apples, grapes and oranges.“The Kisan Rail project not only shows the commitment of the Government to serve the farmers but also serves as a proof of how fast our farmers are ready for new possibilities,” the PM said.At present, nine rakes of Kisan Rail trains are plying along 10 major routes, according to the ministry of railways. “It is the participation and support of the rural people, farmers and youth that makes the government’s efforts successful. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO’s) and cooperative groups like women’s Self Help Groups get priority in agri-business and agri-infrastructure. Recent reforms will lead to expansion of agri-businesses and these groups will be the biggest beneficiaries. Private investment in agriculture will support the government’s effort to help these groups,” the PM said.The PM’s remarks have come amid a deadlock between protesting farm unions and the centre over three agricultural laws passed by the government in the monsoon session. Several farmers groups rejected the laws saying they left them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and eroded the government’s procurement and price support system.The government, meanwhile, has repeatedly assured farmers that market yards will not be abolished, and minimum support prices will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-flags-off-100th-run-of-kisan-rail-trains/story-SThVQ17X67NGLDeN1twELK.html
29-12-2020||India||Covid-19 force star student to drop out||In March, Nimisha Kashyap was ecstatic. She was stuck at home due to the Covid-19-induced nationwide lockdown but based on her stellar academic record, she was promoted from Class 6 to 7. Her school, Raja Harish Chand Bal Niketan in Lucknow, was forced to cancel annual examinations in line with government directives, and decided to advance students to the next class.Kashyap 13, was an outstanding student who had topped her Class 6 examinations. She was eager to start her studies.But by April, her happiness had turned to despair. With the nationwide lockdown shuttering the wholesale shop her father Pradeep Kumar Kashyap worked in, the family had no money to pay her school fees of Rs 500 a month. In May, her name was struck off the school academic rolls. “All the excitement of buying new books for class 7 evaporated. I had to sit at home and turn the pages of old Class 6 books every day,” said Kashyap, a resident of Raja Bazar in old Lucknow.The Kashyaps live in a one-room apartment in a cramped neighbourhood. The financial crunch has left them with no money to repair their television since January. Pradeep’s wholesale cloth shop has slashed his monthly salary from Rs 12,000 to Rs 8,000. “It was all very difficult to pay fees. I will get Nimisha enrolled next year,” said Pradeep.Kashyap now spends most of her day at home. “After a few hours of study, I play Ludo and other games with the neighbourhood children in the evening when they are free from their online classes and homework,” she added.Her mother Soni and elder sister Deepanshi, an undergraduate student, try to keep her engaged by assigning her tasks from old text books. “We feel really bad for her. My husband’s meagre income made it difficult for us to pay the school fees. Hopefully, at her age, dropping a year of school will not make much of a difference in her life. We are hoping everything will be normal from the next year,” her mother said.Kashyap said more than studies, she misses sharing a classroom with her friends. “All my friends are now in Class 7. Next year, when I go to school, I will have to make new friends all over again,” she rued. Another thing she hopes to get back to is a game of badminton with her best friend Palak.Pradeep said the family agonized about the decision to make her drop out of school but realised that it was not possible to manage household expenses and pay school fees at the same time. “I had to look after other needs of the family, too. In the next few months, things should become normal and I will again enrol her in school,” he said.Kashyap wants to get a government job in the future, and work with a nationalised bank. “I hope she can still realise her goal,” said Pradeep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-force-star-student-to-drop-out/story-qX112xYiDMRX0WSe5GQomN.html
29-12-2020||India||How we played: At first, haltingly, and then with creative defiance||For many of us, a year canters by to the rhythm of major sporting events. You could keep time to the passage of Grand Slams for example: The southern hemisphere summer of the Australian Open is winter for most of us; Roland Garros heralds the European spring; Wimbledon is the lull of an English summer; the US Open is autumn in New York. Perhaps you live by the more continual beat of football leagues: the race to the finish line, the Champions League crescendo, the lull of a mid-year break, the opening of the transfer window and the fevered speculations that come with it, the beginning of a new season...Instead, it all came crashing down. All sense of time, or the joys of sports, collapsed as the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the world. One by one, almost every sporting event around the globe was cancelled or postponed (almost, because there were odd pockets of resistance; football in Nicaragua never stopped, for example). In one word, it was unprecedented. Nothing like this had ever happened in the history of modern sports; the closest comparable situation comes from World War II, but even then, there was no disruption to sports in many countries, the US being a prime example. Also Read | MHA extends Covid-19 guidelines till Jan, says need to be vigilant over new variantIt’s not like there was much choice. Back when it still seemed like the pandemic was an epidemic that was happening only in China, a football match went ahead as scheduled in Milan. Atalanta, based out of the small northern city of Bergamo, were playing Spanish club Valencia in the Champions League. For the Italian club, this was historic — it was their first ever appearance on Europe’s biggest footballing stage. Around 40,000 fans travelled from Bergamo to watch their team in action. There were 2500 fans from Spain too. Two days later, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Italy. It was in Bergamo. A week later the disease was on the rampage — first through Bergamo — and then, with a sense of ominous inevitability, through the rest of Italy, which became the epicentre of the disease in Europe. About a third of the Valencia squad tested positive too. Later, the match would be called “Game Zero”. The head of pulmonary diseases at a Bergamo hospital described it as a “biological time bomb”. In the face of such devastation, sports had to go. That’s easier said than done. The Olympics come around once every four years; in the sporting world, arguably, nothing is bigger. Tokyo, the hosts of the 2020 Games, held out for a long time. There was little doubt that with thousands of athletes and spectators from around the world congregating in one place (and then travelling back to their own countries at the end of the Games), the Olympics had the potential of turning into a dystopic Covid-19 hot zone of epic proportions. Even as event after event in the sporting calendar was wiped off, the Olympic organisers insisted that their Games would go on. It took the utter carnage of Olympic qualifying events across the world to finally bring the message home; the Games were postponed to 2021. By this time, it was April. Countries were going into lockdown. Forget sports, there were no vehicles on the road, flights grounded, offices, markets, restaurants and movie theatres shuttered. Hello, dystopia. Cloistered in their homes, athletes got creative with their training. Those with well-equipped gyms at home, like Virat Kohli, used this rare window off from cricket’s usual packed calendar to take their fitness to new levels. Our crack shooters rigged DIY shooting ranges at home and competed in online tournaments. Olympic athletes shared their innovative home drills with fans on social media: some used gas cylinders for weight training (don’t try it at home), some used 20 litre water canisters. Amit Panghal, the only Indian boxer to reach the top of the world rankings, went back to his village and put farm implements to use for some mind-bending workout routines. Simone Biles, arguably the greatest gymnast ever, performed routines never-seen-before all by herself in an empty gymnasium. Mondo Duplantis, the pole vault world record holder, and Renaud Lavillenie turned their backyards into vaulting facilities, followed by many of the world’s top vaulters, which finally culminated in a backyard vaulting championship online. India’s top-ranked table-tennis player Sathyan G installed a ping-pong playing robot in his living room. Outside the confines of athletes’ homes and backyards, sporting infrastructure was being put to a very different use: from Rio’s legendary Maracana stadium, London’s 2012 Olympic venues, to Delhi’s cavernous stadiums built for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, all were turned into field hospitals to cope with the pandemic. As the months passed on with no sports, uncertainties deepened: Will Roger Federer play a Grand Slam again? Will Liverpool, one of the greatest footballing squads of this decade, be denied their chance of winning the English league for the first time in 30 years — a league they had dominated with spectacular football till all sports ground to a halt— if no more play was possible for the season? What happens to the larger sports industry— the thousands around the world who are dependent on their livelihood from sporting events like stadium attendants, ticket sellers, catering people, groundskeepers, pubs and restaurants and street-food vendors around stadiums — already reeling from this unprecedented cancellation of sports?Emsi, a labour market data company based in the US, estimated that the cancellation or postponement of every sports event from mid-March to May in the US could result in 1.3 million jobs and USD 12.3 billion in earnings to vanish. Though sports began to resume in small clusters globally after that, the economic impact of this year has been devastating. The losses are yet to be counted, but considering that the biggest sporting bodies in the world —from Cricket Australia to the top Premier League clubs — furloughed staff, and that events as big as the IPL, cricket’s richest property, lost half its value in sponsorship, the financial impact will be terrible and long-lasting. Slowly, as the world began opening up again, sports resumed. With it, a new word entered the lexicon: the bio-bubble. A “safe” zone where athletes and officials, after having tested negative for Covid, would be confined for the length of a tournament, repeatedly tested, and kept isolated from the outside world. It was an act of great resilience--the players at the IPL, for example, spent 80 days in a bio-bubble in the UAE. Many of England’s cricketers spent a month in the English bio-bubble that restarted cricket, headed straight to the IPL bubble, before seamlessly transitioning to another bubble in South Africa. That brings us to another reality: sports without fans. The sight of a match unfolding in an empty stadium went from a rare occurrence as the consequence of some penal action to becoming the “new normal”. Historic things happened in empty stadiums: Liverpool finally became the champions of England after their three-decade wait; Barcelona were drubbed 8-2 by Bayern Munich and bundled out of the Champions League bio-bubble, sparking a bitter division between Lionel Messi and the club; Lewis Hamilton broke Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 F1 race wins, a record once thought unbreakable; Rafael Nadal won his 13th French Open title (the most wins in a single slam by any player) and tied with Roger Federer as the winner of most Grand Slam men’s singles titles at 20. The stadiums may have been empty, but athletes found a new voice this year, the voice of protest. In that England Test series that saw the resumption of cricket, each match began with both the host country and the visiting West Indies players taking a knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. A BLM flag fluttered from the West Indies balcony, and the players from the Carribbean raised a black-gloved fist as they knelt in homage to American sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith’s Black Power salute at the 1968 Olympics. Protests by athletes are almost always seen as an overstepping of boundaries, as something to be penalised with maximum prejudice; Carlos and Smith were ostracised for decades; they were called ‘dark-skinned stormtroopers’. Hardly anything had changed more than 50 years later, when Colin Kaepernick took a knee in 2016 to protest against police brutality and was thrown out of the NFL, never to play again.Now sportspeople were doing it everywhere; footballers were taking a knee, Lewis Hamilton wore tshirts with blunt political messages highlighting police brutality in the US against black people as he went on his record spree. One of the strongest statements was made by Naomi Osaka as she marched to her second US Open title inside a bio-bubble in the pandemic-ravaged city of New York. Osaka wore seven black masks, a different one for each match she played in New York. Each mask bore the name of a Black person killed by police action in the US. Both Osaka and Hamilton took part in street protests as well. The pandemic dominated the year with such ferocity that it’s easy to forget that there were a couple of months at the beginning of this year that were not consumed by it, when sports happened in stadiums thronging with fans. It is important than to remember those months; remember, for example, the thrilling run of the Indian team at the Women’s Cricket World Cup in Australia, powered by teen batting sensation Shafali Verma, where they reached the final, losing to hosts to Australia. Remember, also, Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash while traveling with his daughter for a youth basketball tournament outside Los Angeles (all nine people in the helicopter died). It seems like a lifetime away..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-we-played-at-first-haltingly-and-then-with-creative-defiance/story-1BgjEIlTQdsyqiUM9RoGsO.html
29-12-2020||India||North India including Delhi braces for cold wave in run-up to New Year||A cold wave is likely to grip parts of the national capital with moderate to dense fog in the next four days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains.“In Delhi we are expecting moderate to dense fog so visibility may be under 200m in some parts of the Capital. The western disturbance which was affecting the Western Himalayas has just passed so there is moisture in the air and wind speed is also likely to reduce. Its going to be very cold also leading to development of fog,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Early morning fog on Monday disrupted flights at the Delhi airport but officials said since none of the runways needed to be closed for operations, as the runway visibility did not drop below 50 metres, the impact on operations was minimal.“Some departing flights were delayed as low visibility procedures were put in place. This caused delay but since the airport is not operating flights at its full strength as it used to, the delay was not much. Roughly around 25-30 flights were affected and none of the flights were cancelled on Monday due to weather in Delhi,” according to an official from the Delhi airport.The national capital this year has already recorded the second highest number of ‘cold wave’ days in December since 1993. The highest number of cold wave days since 1993 were recorded in 2018 when there were eight ‘cold wave’ days according to the regional weather forecasting centre, Delhi.This year is also likely to record 7-8 cold wave days if cold wave conditions set in from Tuesday as forecast by IMD said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.This October was the coldest Delhi has experienced in 58 years--the mean minimum temperature for the month was 17.2 degrees C and November was the coldest in 71 years with a mean minimum temperature of only 10.2-degree C.“La Nina is a global weather phenomenon but as forecast the winter was not only early but also has been colder than normal. The first half of December was not as cold and we are expecting relief from extreme cold during the first week of January but minimum temperature is likely to dip in the next three days particularly on December 31 due to abundant snowfall in the hills,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are prevailing in many pockets over Punjab; in some pockets over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi; in some pockets over Saurashtra and Kutch and cold wave conditions are prevailing in isolated pockets over Rajasthan, IMD said.IMD in its impact based warning said exposure to dense fog is associated with respiratory complications particularly for people with asthma, bronchitis and other lung conditions. It can increase episodes of wheezing and coughing as dense fog also has high particulate pollution. Dense fog may also disrupt road traffic, railway and flight schedules, Met department has cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/north-india-including-delhi-braces-for-cold-wave-in-run-up-to-new-year/story-TRS8wfhF7z4g43myEJOE1O.html
29-12-2020||India||Why masks will stay even after Covid-19 vaccination||A tumultuous 2020 that upended how we lived our lives appears to be ending on a happier note with several countries beginning vaccination against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in December. The news of the Sars-CoV2 variant in the UK that spreads faster is a dampener but virologists say so far it is not known to cause more severe disease and is unlikely to impact the effectiveness of existing vaccines, diagnostic tests, or treatments. “There is no need to change the existing treatment protocol in view of mutations emerging in the strain. Further, since Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has always advocated use of two or more gene assays for testing Sars-CoV-2, it is unlikely to miss infected cases using the current testing strategy,” concluded experts at the meeting of the National Task Force on Covid-19 on Saturday under co-chairs of Dr Vinod Paul, member Niti Aayog, and Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. India plans to begin vaccinating 300 million health workers, frontline workers and vulnerable populations as early as January next year, but vaccines do not signal the end of public health precautions for the vaccinated. Also Read | ‘300 million doses by July’: SII chief Adar Poonawalla on CovishieldReducing exposure to the virus by wearing masks, observing social distancing and frequently washing hands will remain the mainstay of social behaviour in 2021 and beyond, till everyone has been vaccinated against the disease that sickened at least 80 million and killed 1.75 million globally since the start of the pandemic in China last year.Though not yet approved in India, all three approved vaccines– Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca-Oxford – are given in two doses four weeks apart and it takes six to eight weeks after the initial dose to achieve the desired immunity for protection. So, those vaccinated will have to continue using behaviours that reduce their risk of exposure to the virus. It’s still unknown how much protection Covid-19 vaccines provide in real-life conditions and for how long this protection lasts. What is known is that everyone can get vaccinated only by 2024. Since the herd immunity threshold for Covid-19 has not been established, we still cannot say how much of the world’s population will have to be vaccinated to stop the spread of infection to those who have not been vaccinated.The effectiveness of the vaccine will also depend on whether it is stored and transported at optimal temperature. it will also depend on health of the recipients since the “warp speed” of development limited human trials data to mostly to healthy adults and those with stable pre-existing diseases. Also read | Covishield vaccine trial: Six out of 249 volunteers drop out ahead of second dose in MumbaiAgain, Covid-19 vaccines have only been tested for their ability to prevent infection and not for prevention of transmission. Most vaccines prevent infection and stop its spread, but some, like the annual flu vaccines, protect those vaccinated from severe disease but don’t always stop them from infecting unvaccinated people. Vaccines train the body’s immune cells to the virus to prevent infection but how effective these immune cells are in crossing the mucous barrier to destroy the viruses resting in the nose is still unknown. If viruses in the nose remain viable, those vaccinated can shed them while speaking or sneezing to infect unvaccinated people in close contact. Vaccines apart, a major upside of 2020 has been the demonstration of unparalleled heroism and resilience amid monumental adversity. Everyone did their bit. Health and frontline workers worked overtime in unsafe conditions to save lives, people stayed locked up at home for months to slow the spread of disease, children gave up school and play, jobless migrants trudged home for days and weeks to escape hunger, and scientists, industry, global agencies and nations forged unprecedented partnerships and worked overtime to make it possible to bring new treatments and vaccines to people within nine months. As a result, the year that began on a sick note following the World Health Organization’s Country Office (WHO) in China discovering a statement about a mysterious “viral pneumonia” of unknown origin on the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission website on December 31, 2019, is ending with hope for a return to normalcy in the not-so-distant future. The current wave in India appears to be waning, with the seven-day daily average for new infections staying below 25,000, down from a single day peak of 97,399 on September 10. Add to this results of antibodies surveys that indicate around 200-300 million have some degree of immunity against Sas-CoV2 and we have a momentum that can help get our derailed lives and economy on track by next summer. But this can happen only if we continue to take precautions and ensure the year-end holidays don’t turn into superspreading events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-masks-will-stay-even-after-covid-19-vaccination/story-arLvpjbwCHzMcIUBAXSxlO.html
29-12-2020||India||No sign of military talks with China on LAC row||There is no indication of when India and China will hold the next round of military talks to defuse border tensions in eastern Ladakh despite both countries agreeing to hold the corps commander-level dialogue at an early date during recent diplomatic talks on the lingering dispute, people familiar with the developments said on Monday. At the virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on December 18, India and China agreed that the next round of meeting between senior commanders should be held at an early date for “early and complete disengagement of troops” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). “Neither side has proposed any date for the military dialogue yet. Any breakthrough in resolving the border row is unlikely without political/diplomatic intervention,” the people cited above said. The two sides have held eight rounds of military talks so far but failed to make any progress in resolving the row. Also Read | India seeks answers from China on Ladakh peace plan. It is a make-or-break questionDuring the eighth round of talks, the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC. Experts said talks were deadlocked because of yawning differences between the two sides. “The basic reason (for talks yielding no results) is that the positions of the two sides on the conditions of disengagement remain too far apart. Unless these conditions are reconciled in diplomatic or political level talks, interaction between the militaries will serve little purpose,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. “Prior to the onset of the winter, there was some incentive for both sides to reach an agreement so that troops could be pulled out before the winter. That incentive could also have disappeared now that troops are prepared to hold ground through the winter,” said Hooda. Also Read | China faces ‘real danger’ of losing goodwill created by decades of good ties: JaishankarWhile India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridge line on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The developments on both banks of Pangong Tso have increased India’s bargaining power during talks with the Chinese side, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-sign-of-military-talks-with-china-on-lac-row/story-DDb0JPPhmJQw1CA2FTjkbK.html
29-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Mumbai, ravaged by the coronavirus disease pandemic – 290,914 cases and 11,076 deaths till Sunday evening – has seen a 50-85% reduction in incidence of dengue, H1N1 flu, gastroenteritis and leptospirosis, infective diseases that plague the city during and after the monsoon every year, according to HT’s Mumbai health reporters. October is one of the unkindest months in India’s commercial capital, with the heat and humidity combining to make it very uncomfortable, and also extremely conducive to the propagation of the diseases named above, but this time, the city seems to have been spared, courtesy an unlikely savior – Covid-19. The safety protocols associated with the coronavirus disease – frequent hand washing, wearing masks, being socially distant, eating mostly home-cooked food – and the restrictions the pandemic has forced upon us, in terms of travelling (it’s so easy to catch a flu on a flight) or even moving about appear to have helped. Mumbai won’t be the first region to have caught a lucky break from Covid-19, though.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageIn July, The Wall Street Journal reported that the southern hemisphere – it usually sees more cases in its winter, which begins around late May and early June – was seeing very few cases of influenza. The report pointed to a 95% drop in flu cases in Chile (at the time the report was written), and a 64% decline in Argentina. In Australia (a country that usually bears the brunt of influenza), a two-week period in the second half of June, saw a 99% drop in flu cases. The report quoted experts who attributed the fall to restrictions that were in place to halt or slow the spread of Covid-19. The near-absence of international travel was cited by some of them as one of the main reasons behind the steep fall in influenza cases, but they also mentioned other newly acquired human habits (hand washing, wearing masks) as contributory factors.In mid-December, Nature reported a similar situation in the northern hemisphere where “the levels of many common seasonal infections remain extremely low.” The report, which acknowledged that the southern hemisphere almost completely evaded seasonal influenza added: “The patchwork of responses intended to fight the pandemic – from temporary lockdowns to mask wearing, social distancing, enhanced personal hygiene and reduced travel – has had a huge impact on other common respiratory illnesses too.” The same report, using data from the FluNet global influenza surveillance system, showed that even the last flu season (2019-20) was cut short by measures announced to fight Covid-19, with the number of cases tapering off in April. Interestingly, the Nature report adds that the viruses that cause the common cold, rhinoviruses, do not seem to be affected greatly – mask or no mask, and whether you wash your hands or not, you are going to catch that cold.Also Read | MHA extends Covid-19 guidelines till Jan, says need to be vigilant over new variantIndia typically sees a surge in influenza cases around this time of the year. This year, anecdotal evidence from Delhi, and the data from Mumbai suggest there have not been as many cases as there usually are. But the data from Mumbai is also revealing – it shows that basic hygiene is among the best prophylactics for a variety of infective diseases.Post script: A paper published on the pre-print server medRxiv by researchers from Yale (including Akiko Iwasaki) shows that the timing of a body’s immune response is perhaps more important than its magnitude when it comes to fighting off Covid-19. According to the paper, which is based on a study of 209 Covid-19 patients (ranging from asymptomatic to those with severe infections), those whose immune systems produced neutralising antibodies within 14 days of turning symptomatic had a much higher chance of recovery than those whose systems produced these antibodies after 14 days (even if they did more). As Iwasaki pointed out on Twitter, this means that any antibody treatment (such as the use of monoclonal antibodies) will therefore have to be used early in the treatment cycle to be successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-JeqGwbJS7L4YONozINUACK.html
29-12-2020||India||PM flags off India’s first autopilot train||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated India’s first automated, driverless train on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line even as he outlined his government’s plans to extend Metro services to over 25 cities by 2025. At an online event, he also launched the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) — which allows users to pay for travel, toll charges and retail shopping, and permits them to withdraw money at the same time — for Delhi Metro’s Airport Express Line. “The inauguration of the first driverless Metro train shows how fast India is moving towards smart systems,” Modi said via video-conferencing. “When our government was formed in 2014, only five cities had metro services. And today, 18 cities have Metro services. By 2025, we will take this service to more than 25 cities.” In 2014, just 248km of Metro lines were operational in the country, but now the network was spread across over 700km, Modi said. “By the year 2025, we are trying to expand it to 1,700km. These are not just figures; they are a proof of ease of living in the lives of millions of Indians,” he added. Modi also emphasised the importance of “Make in India” — a reference to his government’s flagship initiative to promote domestic manufacturing — in expanding metro services, saying this would reduce costs and generate employment. When urbanisation gathered pace a few decades ago, not much attention was given to the needs of the future, he said. “The first Metro in Delhi was started with the efforts of Atal (Bihari Vajpayee) ji,” Modi said, referring to the late Prime Minister. “The metro today is no longer just a medium of public transport, but a great way to reduce pollution. Thousands of vehicles have been reduced from the road due to the Metro network...”Delhi Metro services, which cover 389km on nine routes (lines), began in 2002, when the city-state was ruled by a Congress government led by the late Sheila Dikshit, and Vajpayee was the Prime Minister.Efforts of former chief minister Dikshit in bringing the Metro to the Capital cannot be ignored, Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said. “...the people of Delhi and this country know that the Metro was brought to the city because of the efforts of Sheila Dikshit and the Congress party.”Meanwhile, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said it entered the elite league of 7% of the world’s Metro networks with the introduction of the automated trains. “The driverless trains will be fully automated, eliminating the possibility of human error. The service will be available on Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line...This will be extended to Delhi Metro’s Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) by mid-2021,” DMRC said in a statement. The technology has different levels or grades of automation (GoA), officials explained. In the first grade, or GoA 1, trains are run by one driver. In GoA 2 and GoA 3, the role of the driver is reduced to operating doors and for taking over in case of emergencies; the starting and halting of trains is automated. Finally, in GoA 4, trains are set on a completely unattended operations mode. The first driverless train was flagged off from Jasola Vihar-Shaheen Bagh on the 37-km Magenta Line, which connects Janakpuri West in west Delhi to Botanical Garden in Noida. Altogether five automated trains ran on Monday. All these operated in GoA 3 mode with a driver present to take care of emergency services. Another significant takeaway of the event was the launch of NCMC, which will now be fully operationalised on Delhi Metro’s Airport Express Line. It will enable anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued in any part of the country to travel on the route. The facility will be available on the entire Delhi Metro network by 2022, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Sewa Ram, mobility expert and professor at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said technologies introduced on Monday was a huge leap in the area of urban mobility. “Not only the Metro, the common mobility card should be extended to all modes of transport. This will not only help provide a common platform for people...but will also allow better research data. Researchers will be able to better assess travelling patterns of people and accordingly suggest best plan for development,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-flags-off-india-s-first-autopilot-train/story-1QTnNEImEBNlbrX4cPEuSK.html
29-12-2020||India||Nod for emergency use authorisation expected in a few days: SII’s Adar Poonawalla||An expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to meet this week to examine Serum Institute of India (SII)’s application for emergency use authorisation (EUA) of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca Plc. vaccine candidate against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The Pune-based vaccine maker’s CEO Adar Poonawalla said separately on Monday that approvals were expected in a few days, The subject expert committee of the CDSCO is likely to be convened this week to go through SII’s application, a government official with knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity.“All the data has been submitted to both the regulators. By January we should have the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine licensed in India,” Poonawalla, whose company is manufacturing and testing the vaccine in India, told reporters.Also Read | India’s first indigenous pneumonia vaccine by SII launchedThe regulators he referred to were the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The DCGI is the head executive of the CDSCO. “Eminent experts are examining it (the data) right now and nobody wants to rush through the process. We must give a few more days for the good news to come, ” Poonawalla said. “Then it will be down to the government to decide how much [of the vaccine] to take and when to take as they would be looking at at least 300 million doses by July 2021.” He also said that he was looking at the end of December or early January for the MHRA approval to come in. “Then from India also we are hopeful to get it as currently the Drugs Controller General of India is looking at the data, and not just from India but also data from UK, South Africa and everywhere else. He is doing a great job,” Poonawalla said. Initially, SII is looking at providing 50 million doses to India. The company has already made about 50 million doses that it will be ready to supply after receiving regulatory approvals. Poonawalla noted that India was also a part of Covax, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to vaccines for all countries. “...we have always said that we will keep giving 50% of everything we make to India and to Covax at the same time. So, if we are producing 60-70 million doses every month, there will be plenty of vaccines to go around both to India and to Covax countries, including some of our neighbours like Bangladesh etc. because everybody wants the vaccine, and we are trying to give as much as we can and equitably to nations including India.” Initially, the company may give most of its production to India because to export to these countries, it would need WHO’s pre-qualification. “… that may take another month or so after it is licensed in India. That way India will have priority, and because India is such a large country that we may end up giving a majority of those 50 million doses to India first. Every month we are churning out 40-50 million doses which will go up to about 100 million doses every month by March as by then we are going to commission a third facility that is getting ready. Eventually everyone is going to get it; of course some countries will have to wait a little longer,” said Poonawalla. He also said the first six months of next year were going to be tight for vaccine delivery. “… In first six months there is definitely going to be a situation where there is a shortage globally; nobody can help that. We will see that easing off by August-September because you will have other vaccine manufacturers also being able to supply,” he added.Poonawalla spoke to reporters at the launch of SII’s pneumococcal vaccine, the first made-in-India protection against pneumococcal diseases, caused by bacterial infections.“The subject expert committee is likely to be convened this week to go through the application. Since Pfizer had also sought fresh date to present its case on its EUA application of its anti-Covid-19 vaccine, the committee is likely to give them time on the same date,” said a government official with knowledge of the matter, requesting anonymity Possible approval of the vaccine by the UK drug regulator will likely ease the regulatory process for the candidate in India. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE may be asked to conduct a small bridging study among the Indian population to determine the vaccine candidate’s efficacy on the local population. “Since Pfizer has not conducted a clinical trial in India for its vaccine candidate, the company may be asked to do that first. They could also get a waiver from trials as they already have EUA from other national regulators such as in the US and UK. The ultimate call, however, will be of the experts,” the official cited above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nod-for-emergency-use-authorisation-expected-in-a-few-days-sii-s-adar-poonawalla/story-JIY2VEuBW3B0LUqZvxiWBM.html
29-12-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccination dry run kicks off in 4 states||Health care and grassroots staff in four states — one each in the county’s east, north, west and south — carried out drills for coronavirus vaccinations on Monday, testing the core technology platform, transport arrangements, and the methods for monitoring and reporting serious side effects.The exercise was carried out in Sonitpur and Nalbari districts in Assam, Rajkot and Gandhinagar in Gujarat, Ludhiana and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr) in Punjab and Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh. Further drills will be held on Tuesday.The exercise comes at a time when drug regulators are expected any day to take a decision on giving emergency approvals to pave way for the first shots to be given. The country targets to deliver doses, likely to be in a regimen of two, to 300 million people by the summer – one of the largest logistical exercises to be undertaken outside of the elections.According to officials aware of the process, Monday’s drills largely focused on testing the digital platform Co-Win but transportation, cold storage and crowd management at vaccination centres were also assessed.“Two generic problems were faced by all states that we are trying to sort out: one was during the adverse event reporting wherein the staff had to originally wait for the entire session of 100 people to end before they could upload the information...“Another that has been seen is mapping of pincode against villages; if the pincode is not mapped in the app then the staff on ground will have to do it manually after due verification against the address mentioned by the beneficiary. There is always a margin for error when you are verifying something manually, which is why we will ensure all pincodes are mapped,” said a senior health ministry official, asking not to be named.Also Read: You may need vaccine passport for travel next year: All you need to know about itIn the case of the first problem, this person explained, authorities would need to wait till all 100 people in one session are vaccinated before they can report the side effects, which could lead to a delay. “It has, therefore, been decided to make modifications in the app to allow real-time feeding of adverse event report post vaccination,” said the official.According to Krishna district collector Imtiaz Ahmed, the drills for vaccination centres were held in teams of five. “In all, three chambers were identified for the exercise – registration of beneficiaries in the first chamber, vaccination in the second chamber and evaluation in the third chamber,” he said.There were five vaccination centres for the drill in the district, comprising 25 health care workers.The exercise was videotaped at all five centres. “Reports would be submitted to state- and district-level task forces,” Ahmed said, adding that the state task force will review the feedback to guide further actions and send it to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. An official in Punjab said while Monday’s exercise included mock registration of volunteers, Tuesday is when they will be called for the vaccination drill.“On the first day of the dry run, 25 health beneficiaries were called at each site to check the data entry in Co-WIN app, which is the online portal for monitoring of vaccine delivery,” said Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. Data of 300 health beneficiaries was entered in the portal and all beneficiaries received a message on their mobile phones about the successful registration, Bhaskar said.“The successful registration also showed the proper creation of session sites and its allocation, linking and management. Now, on Tuesday, these 300 beneficiaries will visit their assigned sites in their district for online verification. After completing the verification, we will enter the data in the Co-WIN app that they have successfully reported at the health centre. Once we will give them vaccine shots, we will enter that vaccine has been provided to the health beneficiary, to avoid miss or repetition,” he said.“The dry run is an exercise to assess the entire process of vaccination as to how it will reach the end user through our cold chains,” he added. “We will identify the challenges, once the drive is complete. We will make changes in the plan, if required, so that the final process gets completed without faults,” he added.The initial target of 300 million comprises people who are deemed to need the coronavirus vaccine the soonest. These include health care staff and front-line workers such as police and firefighters, who are followed by people above the age of 50 and those under that age but with comorbid conditions that put them more at risk for a serious or fatal outcome from Covid-19.(With inputs from HTCs in Chandigarh and Hyderabad)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccination-dry-run-kicks-off-in-4-states/story-iz7cUd2pgSsgiorkdqA0eL.html
29-12-2020||India||2020: A year of strange weather events||2020 has been strange and difficult in so many ways that it seems almost criminal to add one more to the mix — the weather. Floods, cyclones, colder winter, unexpected rains, India has seen them all.High rainfall at a time when rainfall is decliningIndia received a total of 1,286.6mm rainfall until December 27 this year. This is the ninth highest rainfall for the January 1 to December 27 period since 1901. It mostly rains during the monsoon months in India, and with even the north-east monsoon on the way out, it is unlikely that this year’s rainfall will fall too behind other years’ in the remaining days of the year. While ending up among the top 10 rainfall years in 120 years itself is adequate to make 2020 an outlier, there is another reason why this year’s rainfall was unusual: it did not follow prevailing long-term trends. The last time rainfall was this high was in 1990 (1201.1mm). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();To be sure, not everything about this year’s rainfall was unusual. The share of extreme rainfall – heavy rain over a smaller area or period of time – was higher than the less intense kinds of rainfall. The share of light rainfall this year (13.4%) was ranked 81st in the 120 years since 1901. The shares of moderate (47.6%), heavy (38.1%), and extreme intensity (0.86%) rainfall were ranked 62nd, 55th, and 20th, respectively. This is in keeping with the long-term trend of an increasing share of heavy and extreme rainfall in total rainfall.For this analysis, rainfall equal to or under 7.5mm in a grid (a box bound by two latitudes and longitudes) was considered light, between 7.5mm and 35.5mm, moderate, between 35.5mm ad 244.5mm, heavy, and above 244.5mm, extreme. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Low winter temperatures although winters are getting warmerIMD considers the December to February period as winter. Average maximum temperature from December 1 to December 27 this year in India is 24.17 degrees Celsius, according to IMD’s gridded temperature dataset. For these 27 days of December, this is the second-lowest average maximum temperature since 1951, the earliest year for which IMD’s gridded dataset exists. This is not in line with the long-term trends in average maximum temperatures for this period, although the 2011-2020 decade has seen a lower average maximum temperature than the last decade. Since the 1970s, maximum temperatures in December have, on average, increased. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The average minimum temperature for December 1-December 27 period seems to have followed the long-term patterns, however, and is not low. It is the 33rd highest since 1951. The average for 2011-2020, too, is lower only than that in the 1951-1960 decade. To be sure, these figures reflect the average for India as a whole. This number can get skewed if minimum temperatures in some regions are high even while another is experiencing a cold wave. A place in the plains is said to be experiencing a cold wave if the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or lower and at least 4.5 degrees below the normal minimum temperature for two consecutive days. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();La Niña could be a possible reason for this year’s strange weatherOne of the reasons for this year’s rainfall and temperature patterns not following the long-term trends could be the onset of a phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean around September. Changes in sea surface temperatures affect global weather patterns. The La Niña and El Niño phenomena, for example, are measured by anomalies or departure from a long-term average in sea surface temperatures (SST) in the tropical Pacific. This is captured by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), which is a three-month running mean of SST anomalies. A positive value of ONI above 0.5 (warmer temperatures) is termed El Niño and often leads to warmer and drier weather, whereas a negative value below 0.5 (colder) is termed La Niña and often leads to colder and wetter weather. The La Niña effect was evident by September, and has only intensified since. The late withdrawal of the south-west monsoon in India is attributed to this. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, La Niña is approaching its peak, but neutral conditions may be as far away as next summer, HT reported on December 25.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-a-year-of-strange-weather-events/story-9wnYWBMrNXnSWycLRbgaYM.html
29-12-2020||India||Public transport takes a Covid hit as commuters switch to private vehicles: Study||Public transport in Delhi has been running with a reduced capacity since a nationwide lockdown was imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and authorities introduced several curbs on travel, according to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The capacity has dipped by 73% on average since March, said the analysis, which added that the people were still wary of using mass transit mode commute. This has, in turn, led to big drop in the ridership of buses and the Metro. The number is borne out by specifics provided by the Delhi Metro Rail Corp. and the Delhi Transport Corp. and also reflected in an increase in the use of private vehicles (simply because most people believe public transport is unsafe at a time when a viral disease is raging through the Union territory). Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe CSE analysis warned of a worrying trend of commuters shifting to private vehicles after Covid-19, which could undo years of work in the city to promote public transport, and as a result increase traffic snarls.CSE also used Google mobility data to show that the movement of people around public transport hubs such as bus stops and metro stations had fallen sharply. This is primarily because people are still apprehensive of contracting Covid-19 and prefer private vehicles over public transport, the analysis concluded.“Public transport has been functioning at a very low capacity during the pandemic. Service capacity of the fleet reduced on an average by 73%, with variations across different phases of the Covid lockdown and post-lockdown period,” the analysis found.The analysis also found that average speeds on Delhi’s roads had almost returned to what they were before the lockdown. According to it, the mean speed increased from 24 kmph pre-lockdown to 46 kmph during the lockdown, but has since slowed to 29 kmph with the end of the lockdown.CSE carried out its road speed analysis on 12 arterial roads, MG Road, NH-44, Sardar Patel Marg, Outer Ring Road, Dr KB Hegdewar Marg, Sri Aurobindo Marg, NH-9, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, GT Karnal Rd, Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, Dwarka Marg and Najafgarh Marg.Also Read | India’s first indigenous pneumonia vaccine by SII launchedSlowing speeds also reflect congestion. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said that traffic congestion was happening because the demand for public transport in Delhi is still low. That can be attributed to the fact that the Union territory, which has seen 623,415 coronavirus disease cases and suffered 10,474 deaths on account of it to date, has also witnessed three distinct waves of the pandemic, perhaps the only region in India to have done so. “The analysis shows that those who own a car and used to travel by public transport before the pandemic, have now moved away from it and prefer using their private vehicle. The transport modes that have resumed are also operating with limited capacity because of the requirement of social distancing norms. So, these are no longer fulfilling the role that public transport used to,” said Roychowdhury.In an earlier analysis carried out by CSE, which HT reported on May 29, experts said that before the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25, as much as 37% of Delhi’s commuter traffic was carried by the Metro, 28% by personal vehicles and 7% by public buses. Researchers predicted then that these choices were likely to shift. “In the next six months, the ridership of Delhi Metro is expected to fall by over from 37% to 16%. Commuter traffic in public buses is expected to fall from 7% to just 1%. The dependence on private vehicles, on the other hand, will increase significantly, from 28% to as much as 38%,” that report stated.Delhi government data shows that the Capital has 11 million registered vehicles, of which 3.3 million are cars. Latest data provided by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) shows that ridership is now around 900,000 a day, as opposed to around 2.7 million pre-lockdown. Similarly, ridership of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses has gone down by 59% since March this year.“The rebound of congestion post-lockdown indicates Delhi is not prepared for transformational changes to cut down the volume of traffic. The pandemic has also derailed the targets of public transport ridership that the city had set for itself,” the analysis said.It added: “For instance, The Delhi Master Plan 2020-21 set a target of 80% public transport ridership by 2020, which could not be attained. The Delhi Decongestion Plan of the union ministry of housing and urban affairs has also provided a roadmap for increasing the share of public transport ridership that provides for strategies including more buses, protected bus lanes, metro network and parking policy and parking charges. But these have not been implemented at a scale.”The report also pointed out that the city is also falling behind on maintaining the number and frequency of public buses. CSE experts said that if these targets are not met in the coming months, it would lead to the undoing of all the work done towards promoting public transport over the last few years.“As far as bus procurement is concerned , against the 2019-20 target of 4,000 new buses, 733 buses were added, taking the total number of buses to 6,261. According to different estimates and directives, the city requires between 10,000 and 15,000 buses,” said Roychowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-transport-takes-a-covid-hit-as-commuters-switch-to-private-vehicles-study/story-7ReL00JA63GkC9rbd81DhM.html
29-12-2020||India||Farm laws stir: Govt, farmers to resume talks on Wednesday||After a three-week hiatus, the Centre will resume talks with farmers’ unions on Wednesday in an attempt to end a politically challenging protest by farmers who have camped on the borders of the Capital since November 26 to demand the repeal of three contentious laws they fear will weaken their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of large agribusinesses.Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal sent out a letter to farm leaders on Monday, proposing the sixth round of negotiations on Wednesday, in response to an e-mail by the unions on December 26 in which they had agreed to restart negotiations and suggested a resumption of talks on Tuesday.Talks will now resume on December 30 at 2pm in the Capital’s Vigyan Bhavan conference venue.In his letter, the farm secretary invited 40 leaders who represent the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of over 400 farm organisations involved in the month-long agitation, over a set of reforms they say will hurt their livelihoods. “In the meeting, the government will discuss issues delineated by you and issues related to farmers in the three laws along with the system of MSP (minimum support price) as well as Commission for the Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 and Electricity Amendment Bill 2020,” the government invitation to the farmers said.The agriculture ministry’s invitation, a copy of which HT has seen, said the talks will be led by Union ministers. Three Union ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — are likely to represent the government, an official said. Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Several Delhi borders remain closed, police suggest alternative routesThe farm ministry letter said officials will discuss issues related to farmers in the three laws, signalling the government’s broad strategy to find a solution by addressing points in the legislation that farmers may have concerns about. Reacting to the letter, Avik Saha, the secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a platform of farm unions, said: “The letter of the government indicates that it is being clever with words and not willing to discuss the agenda proposed by farmers’ organisations and this exposes its double-speak.”The farmers’ platform, however, said it looked forward to Wednesday’s talks and hoped the government would come to the negotiating table with an “open mind”. The farmers walked away from the negotiations on December 8 after meeting home minister Amit Shah. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates, known as MSPs.In their December 26 email to the farm ministry, the farmers, however, stuck to their demand that talks must be geared towards repeal of the laws. The farmers spelt out issues on which they want discussions. They said the first issue they wanted discussions on were the “modalities (that are) to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts”.Second, the unions want “mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative MSP recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission into a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities.”These top two demands are the trickiest and are likely to be a test of the fate of negotiations.Although, the government has made desperate attempts to restart negotiations with the unions, the government is not prepared to scrap its reforms agenda. Instead, the government has proposed a set of concessions and amendments. These include greater oversight of proposed free markets and a written assurance on continuing the mechanism of MSP. The farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution, they stated in their letter.The farmers’ email lastly stated that farmers want “changes to be made in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 to protect the interests of farmers.” The bill proposes to provide cash instead of subsidised power for agricultural use. Farmers say the switch from subsidy to cash could increase the cost of power. These two demands are easier to accede to because the government has already hinted that it is prepared to make the sort of changes farmers want. However, a repeal of the laws, which is unlikely, and a legal guarantee on MSP as sought by farmers are fraught with complicated economic costs, analysts say. “The government is and will be always be ready to discuss every issue. That is the government’s position which the letter to the farmers restates,” an official said on Tuesday.The government has said it would come out with a written assurance on continuing the system of guaranteed prices, or MSPs. Farm leaders have spelt out why the assurance on minimum prices was not enough. The government sets minimum prices for 23 commodities but mainly buys wheat and rice at these floor prices. The MSP is calculated using a measure of cultivation cost known as A2+FL, which is a narrower measure of costs of cultivation that takes into account all expenses of raising a particular crop plus the value of family labour. Farm unions want the government to adopt a comprehensive measure of cultivation costs that include the imputed cost of capital and the rent on the land, called C2 in economic parlance. Farm unions also made it clear that they want the government to buy all 23 commodities, which would bloat its food subsidy bill hugely. Some analysts say such a law makes little economic sense. If MSP is made compulsory, it will upend the natural market mechanisms of demand supply, which usually determine prices. And if MSP is made compulsory and traders find it unprofitable to buy at MSPs, especially during production gluts, they will simply avoid buying rather than face legal action, according to Ashok Gulati, a noted farm economist. Moreover, the government cannot afford to be a monopoly buyer of all farm produce. “There is no question that farmers need support. But they need to be supported in less market-distorting ways,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at think tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, or ICRIER. To be sure, Indian farmers get lower-than-global prices on most items not procured by the government and often have to dump produce below cost of production because of oversupply and the government’s obsession with keeping food inflation low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-stir-govt-farmers-to-resume-talks-on-wednesday/story-h2hCNkyKM8qs4g1uTiHBmK.html
29-12-2020||India||Amid Covid-19, Mahakumbh 2021 to be of shorter format of 48 days||The state government’s announcement of curtailing the otherwise 120 days long Mahakumbh to a 48-day fair in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is getting mixed response. Saint fraternity and apex body of Akhadas-the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad has welcomed the decision. They have, however, urged the state government to ensure all the preparations and facilities be made in a grand way as is done for a full-fledged Kumbh fair. A section of priests, traders, hoteliers, tour operators and vendor associations are unhappy as an abridged Mahakumbh will have a direct impact on their livelihood. Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj pointed out that two months ago they had made it clear to the state government that the decision of holding Mahakumbh in a grand or restricted manner is taken in accordance with the Covid-19 situation and the same will be acceptable to Akhadas. “It is a global pandemic never seen before and affecting normal life everywhere. We understand the concerns. State government has been apprised to take the final decision on this issue in mid-February prior to the first royal bath (Shahi Snaan) falling on the occasion of Mahashivratri on March 11,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Hari Giri. Ganga Sabha, which manages the affairs of sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri, where Kumbh is held, is also of the view that health concerns of pilgrims, saints, priests, local people and Kumbh mela personnel is of vital importance. Ganga Sabha president Praveen Jha said that the Kumbh notification will cover Shahi Snaan but the other five festive baths will be held normally. Kumbh mela administration officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat said that permanent nature work for Kumbh is in the last phase of completion. “Best facilities are being put in place as far as infrastructure, and amenities are concerned for Mahakumbh,” he said. Inspector General of Kumbh Mela Force Sanjay Gunjiyal said that mela administration is preparing in such a way so that they are able to cater to maximum or restricted pilgrims during the fair. “Kumbh force will be managing Makar Sankranti festive bath on January 14 and it will be doing so for all the Shahi Snaans. Already the first lot of Kumbh force has arrived in Haridwar and by first Shahi Snaan the force will be in full strength here and will be on duty till April end,” said Gunjiyal. The trader fraternity seems to be wary of the shortening of Kumbh tenure, fearing may be more restrictions are in the offing which will have a severe bearing on their business and livelihood. Prantiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal secretary Sanjay Triwal lamented that in the past eight months traders have already suffered a lot due to lockdown and other restrictions. “Kumbh fair comes once in 12 years and thousands of traders families depend on the pilgrims’ footfall during four months of Kumbh. Curtailing it to just 48 days is giving a message to pilgrims that Kumbh is not safe, so fewer pilgrims will arrive and subsequently our trade will suffer. We oppose this move and will resort to agitation as this is an undue change in ancient tradition of Kumbh,” said Triwal.

29-12-2020||India||DMK writes to EC, asks it to restrain ruling party from using CM’s photo for welfare schemes||Tamil Nadu’s opposition party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Monday urged the Election Commission to ensure that the Pongal sop announced by chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami reaches people via the Tamil Nadu government and not from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party as it would affect the ‘level playing field’.AIADMK’s coordinator Palaniswami on December 19 while launching his campaign as the chief ministerial candidate for the 2021 assembly elections announced a hamper for Pongal, a multi-day harvest festival (from January 14-17 in 2021) in Tamil Nadu to 2.6 crore people holding ration cards. They will receive Rs 2,500 in cash along with raw rice, cashew, sugar, grapes, cardamom, sugarcane and a cloth bag from the public distribution system through a token procedure. The sop would be rolled out from January 4. “Wherever and whenever it is possible, the party in power abuses and misuses their power for their personal gain and to influence the voters,” DMK’s organisation secretary RS Bharathi wrote in his letter to the state and central officers of the Election Commission of India. He added that the ‘Pongal gift cash’ was being disbursed from the government’s fund and not from the fund of the ruling party but, “the manner and the pattern, in which the tokens are being issued to the public show, as if the ‘Pongal Gift’ is being given by the ruling AIADMK Party, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and Ministers of respective area”.He said that the DMK was not opposed to the scheme as it believes it is necessary in a welfare state to support people owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and those affected by the cyclones. The DMK had demanded that Rs 5,000 be paid to each family, he said. DMK president M K Stalin also said in a statement that the chief minister cannot use AIADMK cadre to distribute tokens for a government scheme and it should be done through ration shop employees.“Though the Model Code of Conduct is yet to be enforced,” the DMK’s complaint letter said, adding that it was improper for the AIADMK government to use its leaders’ identities. “It would affect the level playing field, which is the basic concept of fair election to ensure democracy.”CM Palaniswami on Tuesday will present the AIADMK government’s ‘report card’ listing their achievements in the past ten years since they have been in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-writes-to-ec-asks-it-to-restrain-ruling-party-from-using-cm-s-photo-for-welfare-schemes/story-HvOfl4eajMgBEerWl4eZzO.html
29-12-2020||India||Sale, purchase of farm yield not govt job: Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has backtracked on its opposition to the three central laws aimed at liberalising agricultural trade, and decided to leave the purchase of farm produce to private buyers.According to a statement from the chief minister’s office, the government set up purchasing centres in the countryside during the last season and purchased all the agriculture produce that landed in the centres on humanitarian grounds so that farmers would not suffer losses in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.The government incurred losses to the tune of Rs 7,500 crore from the purchase of paddy, sorghum, maize, red gram and Bengal gram, the statement said. Although the government paid Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for the crops, it had to sell them at lower prices in the market because there was no demand“The government cannot do it anymore. It is not a business organisation or trader. It is not a rice miller or a dal miller. Sale and purchase are not the responsibility of government. It is not possible to set up purchase centres in the villages from next year onwards,” the statement said. The statement was released after an official meeting convened on Sunday by chief minister Chandrasekhar Rao, who has hitherto steadfastly opposed the three farm laws passed by the Narendra Modi government in September.Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates, known as minimum support prices (MSPs).At Sunday’s meeting, the Telangana chief minister told officials that since the new farm laws were being implemented across the country, allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere, there was no need for the state government to purchase farm commodities any longer. He suggested that farmers not bring their entire produce to the markets at one time but in portions so that they get a better price. On December 8, TRS leaders and cadre, led by party working president and the CM’s son K T Rama Rao, took part in the Bharat Bandh (India shutdown) to oppose the new farm laws. KCR, as the TRS leader is popularly known, said he would hold a national conclave in the third week of December and invite all anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forces to protest against anti-farmer and anti-labour policies of the central government. He said he would build a national consensus against the new agriculture laws. But there is no more any talk about the proposed conclave. “We cannot afford to get into a confrontation with the Centre at present because it will affect the state’s interests,” a former TRS MP, who is presently in a key position in the government, said on condition of anonymity. Telangana BJP state president Bandi Sanjay welcomed the change in stand of the TRS government on the farm laws. “At least now, KCR has opened his eyes and understood the reality on the benefits of the new laws,” he said. Senior Congress leader and Kisan Congress national vice-president M Kodanda Reddy lashed out at the chief minister for the U-turn. “It is unfortunate that the government is shying away from its responsibility of purchasing agricultural produce at MSPs,” he said. Reddy alleged that KCR had changed his stand after recently meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “He didn’t even bother calling on lakhs of farmers who were agitating on the Delhi borders, braving the winter chill,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sale-purchase-of-farm-yield-not-govt-job-kcr/story-JUI1ILqTQG6xELbeDbatFP.html
29-12-2020||India||UAE airlines under scanner for air bubble violations||The ministry of civil aviation has found breaches of the air bubble agreement put in place between India and the United Arab Emirates by some UAE airlines that carried unauthorised transit passengers from India.A transport bubble or air bubble arrangement is a temporary arrangement between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are reciprocal in nature, meaning airlines from both countries enjoy similar benefits and are subject to similar restrictions.Under the agreement, airlines are only allowed to carry passengers between the two countries and not beyond. India has put in place air bubble agreements with several countries in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic which led to a suspension of international flightsIn a letter to the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the UAE earlier this month, the ministry of civil aviation wrote: “We are in receipt of reports of violation of the provisions of air bubble arrangement by UAE carriers by carrying unauthorized transit passengers”.HT has seen a copy of the letter, which reads: “We would further request you inform the UAE carriers to ensure that the revised provisions of the air bubble arrangement are followed in true spirit”. Arun Kumar, director general of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), confirmed this. “We have acted upon such inputs and the airlines concerned have been advised and reprimanded,” Kumar said.A second official who is aware of the development said the motive for violating the arrangements to fly transit passengers beyond the UAE to farther destinations may be to earn a profit. “UAE carriers have been carrying hundreds of passengers every day from India, since the air bubble agreement between the two countries was set up in July this year,” making the Dubai to Delhi and Mumbai routes among the busiest in the world amid the pandemic, the official said.HT sent a detailed mail to the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the UAE seeking their response. The authorities hadn’t responded until Monday night. Point number 21, rule A,on the website of the civil aviation ministry mentions that under the air bubble arrangement, UAE and Indian airlines operating flights between the two countries can carry UAE nationals and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority-approved UAE residents.A senior official from the ministry of civil aviation, requesting anonymity, said that under an air bubble arrangement, any airline operating between two countries can only carry passengers from point to point.“No airline can accept transit passengers. For example, if an airline is operating from India to the UAE, it cannot accept on-board a passenger not destined to the UAE (passengers with a visa for any country other than the UAE). However, if a passenger goes to the UAE and then books another flight to travel further, the airline cannot be held responsible,” the officer said. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the significance of putting such a rule in place is to ensure that these passengers do not move beyond point-to-point travel. “These restrictions are imposed so that these passengers can be tracked easily and the government can keep a tab on them if required. In any case it is observed that some of them are carrying infection, appropriate action can be taken only if they are following the rules,” Kant said. Aviation expert Mark D Martin said such a violation was bound to happen. “Air bubble arrangement has many loopholes. Airlines will always want to focus on revenue. Airlines will offer what the consumer wants and even if the transit means two days in a hotel in Dubai and then an onward journey, it is still circumventing the law,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-airlines-under-scanner-for-air-bubble-violations/story-xEQsnmH0HxZr5icABDZNSP.html
29-12-2020||India||China’s move to play political broker in Nepal not working||A team of senior officials of the Communist Party of China that landed in Kathmandu on Sunday continued their interactions with leaders of the Nepal Communist Party on Monday in an effort to broker peace between the two rival factions of the ruling party.Chinese President Xi Jinping last week deputed the delegation led by Guo Yezhou, vice-minister of the international department of the Chinese communist party’s central committee (IDCPC), after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli sprung a surprise on his detractors in the party and dissolved Parliament. Fresh elections to the 275-seat House of Representatives have been scheduled in two phases on April 30 and May 10 next year.Guo Yezhou, who flew into Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport in a scheduled Air China flight with other delegates, is learnt to have been told by President Xi to amp up Ambassador Hou Yanqi’s efforts to keep Nepal Communist Party in one piece. About 7-8 more communist party officials drove into Nepal from the land border.Guo Yezhou’s team met President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday. The President’s office hasn’t given any details of the discussions or the guests except to confirm the Chinese team’s meeting with Bidhya Devi Bhandari, who had signed off on the recommendation to dissolve parliament.The delegation that included Dr Sun Haiyan, DG, China Centre for Contemporary World Studies, Liang Wihan, IDCPC, South Asia Affairs, and Zheng Yoyuwa, senior office bearer, IDCPC, also held meetings with Prachanda, Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, and Baburam Bhattarai, all opponents of PM Oli.“The picture is not very clear. The attempt is to maintain unity, failing which to bring the majority tothe PR-MN side, the clearest road for which is restoration of parliament,” said a diplomat in Kathmandu.PM Oli, who was seen to be reluctant to engage with the Chinese and had previously told off the Chinese ambassador for her interventions, did meet the Chinese team on Sunday evening. PM Oli’s foreign affairs advisor Rajan Bhattarai had described the meeting, which local media reports indicated went on for two hours, as a “courtesy call”.On Monday, Guo Yezhou’s delegation drove down to the Khumaltar residence of former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda who is leading the rival faction within the communist party to discuss the options to stop the party from splitting. Guo will next meet another former prime minister Madhav Nepal who is aligned with Prachanda.Guo Yezhou is a familiar face in Nepal’s political circles and is believed to have played a role in the formation of the Nepal Communist Party in 2018 by the merger of PM Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre. Prachanda and PM Oli had been co-chair of the Nepal communist party as part of the pact signed when the party was formed in 2018.Nepal watchers said President’s Xi’s Communist Party of China wants the PM Oli-led government to rescind the presidential order dissolving parliament and has offered to use its influence with the rival faction led by Prachanda and Madhav Nepal to get them to back off and guaranteed that he would be able to complete his five-year term.The buzz in Nepal’s political circles is that PM Oli stood his ground and indicated that he would rather let the Supreme Court take the call on the presidential order. Five judges of Nepal’s top court have started hearing dozen-odd petitions filed against President Bhandari’s order dissolving the House of Representatives.PM Oli is also learnt to have pointed to his previous discussions with ambassador Hou who at one point, wanted him to step down, and asserted that it would not be possible for him to roll back his cabinet’s recommendation.In a televised address to the nation that followed the dissolution of Parliament earlier, PM Oli had lamented that his rivals within the party hadn’t been letting him function and had planned to move a vote of no-confidence against him.Prachanda and Madhav Nepal, who led the offensive against him, are learnt to be planning to form a government with the Nepali Congress and the Janata Samajwadi Party - the two opposition parties that have been launching sharp attacks at PM Oli for his decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-move-to-play-political-broker-in-nepal-not-working/story-Nec3RBewXAU7lPZH8hExWK.html
29-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Same vaccine for a district in Centre’s roll-out strategy||The Narendra Modi government has decided that the government’s Covid-19 vaccine programme will offer only one vaccine brand in a district to ensure efficient logistical management and prevent any confusion in the minds of either those administering the shots, or the people being vaccinated. HT learns that while states, especially large ones, will have a portfolio of vaccines from different manufacturers -- the thinking is that there might not be enough supply if everyone were to insist on the same vaccine -- they will still ensure that the same vaccine is administered within a district. The people drafting India’s vaccine plan have had several brainstorming sessions to finalize the strategy. The choice of vaccines is a tricky issue. Two -- Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat BioTech already applied for an emergency authorization from the subject expert committee of Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) -- but there could be other vaccines that become available over the course of the year. Also Read | ‘300 million doses by July’: SII chief Adar Poonawalla on Covishield“We looked at different options and it has been decided that a district will receive not more than one brand of vaccine,” said a member of the centre’s expert group on Covid vaccines, who asked not to be named. The official also added that the states have been asked for their choice of vaccines to get an idea of the demand. To be sure, a state may not receive its choice -- supply, after all, depends on what has been approved and how much of it is available.For starters, SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin (the second if it clears phase 3 trials; the first has already cleared them in the UK) are expected to be available. Two other potential candidates, ZyCov-D from Zydus Cadila and Sputnik V, co-produced by Dr. Reddy’s lab (the second has cleared phase 3 trials in Russia) are expected to start their final trials here soon. A second official aware of the plan, who too asked not to be named added: “The choice of vaccines for a district is a critical decision. It will help quell social resentment or law and order problem over vaccination. If we offer choices of vaccine in a district, people might refuse one and ask for another . It could also lead to rumour mongering and a misinformation campaign on social media.” India already has a detailed plan for the supply chain for Covid-19 vaccines even though no vaccines have got approval from the Indian drug regulator so far. To be sure, transporting vaccines will be easier than storing them. All possible vaccine candidates for India, from Serum Institute of India’s Covishield to Pfizer Inc.’s mRNA vaccine will require 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius temperature for transportation. Covishield, developed by the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca Plc., can be stored, transported and handled at 2 degrees to 8 degrees, BioNTech SE and Pfizer’s vaccines need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, but can be kept for up to five days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees . The same temperature can keep Moderna’s product stable for 30 days but if it needs to be stored for longer, the vaccine requires a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius. The Gamaleya vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. Much of the long-distance movement of the vaccines in India will be by air. The last mile transport is likely to be by road. District collectors unlikely in priority list Interestingly, district collectors and other top officials in the district administration might not be included in the list of frontline workers, the first official said. While a demand to add DCs to the priority list was made by some states, the Centre argued that the central government officials, who are at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic, are not getting any such benefit. A state official, however, argued that “vaccination of DCs and other officials would have also sent a strong signal ” (about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/same-vaccine-for-a-district-in-centre-s-roll-out-strategy/story-ZimPdDnuKC9j3zOBGyZGdL.html
29-12-2020||India||‘Exercise caution’: MHA tells states in wake of new Covid-19 strain, new year||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Monday issued an order extending the Covid-19 guidelines for “Containment, Surveillance and Caution” till January 31 and urged people to exercise caution in the wake of the new variant of the virus recently traced in the UK and new year celebrations. “While there has been a continuous decline in the active and new Covid-19 cases, there is a need to maintain surveillance, containment and caution, keeping in view the surge in cases globally, and the emergence of a new variant of the virus in the United Kingdom (UK). Accordingly, containment zones continue to be demarcated carefully; prescribed containment measures strictly followed within these zones; Covid-appropriate behaviour promoted and strictly enforced, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prescribed in respect of various permitted activities followed scrupulously,” MHA said in a statement. Simultaneously, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla wrote a letter to all the state chief secretaries saying, “strict vigil is to be maintained to prevent any fresh surge cases in the wake of new year celebrations and ongoing winter season which are favourable for the spread of the virus”. Also read: India, UK to finalise early harvest trade deals by 2021Bhalla pointed out in his letter that the number of active cases have been declining in the country for past 2-3 months and the overall situation appears “optimistic”.He said that the government has started preparations for administration and rollout of vaccines for Covid-19. “The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) has recommended prioritisation of this vaccine during the initial phases to health care workers, frontline workers, persons aged 50 years and above and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities,” Bhalla said. He said that “the states/union territories may instruct the concerned authorities for their active support to the ministry of health and family welfare in identification, preparation of database, vaccine delivery, storage, security, shipment and vaccination of beneficiaries.”Asserting that there is a concomitant need to exercise care, the home secretary added - “States/UTs, based on their assessment, may impose local restrictions to contain the spread of the virus, such as night curfew”. Last month, the MHA had allowed states to impose night curfews amid rising Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-exercise-caution-in-wake-of-new-covid-19-strain-new-year/story-zn1wuRr8nBSd7fe6i2WXXO.html
29-12-2020||India||BJP amends list of district observers in 24 hours after dissent||The appointment of observers of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) organizational districts in West Bengal on Sunday evening led to dissent in several areas and eventually forced the party to publish a revised list on Monday afternoon. On Sunday, Bengal BJP vice-president Pratap Banerjee, who is in charge of the election office set up for the assembly polls due in about five months, issued several lists, announcing the appointment of new observers, co-observers, convenors, co-convenors and also a few district presidents by state president Dilip Ghosh. Observers were also appointed for all the morchas (fronts). Among the most prominent names in the lists were that of former Kolkata mayor and minister Sovan Chatterjee and his friend Baisakhi Banerjee, a professor, who were appointed as observer and co-convenor respectively for the Kolkata zone. This is the first time they were given official posts in the BJP after Chatterjee, who used to be one of the most loyal followers of Mamata Banerjee, left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and joined the saffron camp last year. Another turncoat, Sankudeb Panda, was made the second co-convenor for Kolkata. Appointed as convenor for Kolkata, Debjit Sarkar, the former president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state unit, is the only face of the old BJP leadership in the Kolkata zonal committee. With dissent brewing in several BJP district units over induction of leaders and workers from the ruling party, the appointments raised eyebrows in several quarters. Simultaneously, rivalry among BJP leaders led to rumblings in districts such as Birbhum and South 24 Parganas. Talking to HT on condition of anonymity, a senior state BJP leader said, “The rumblings among old BJP leaders will die down in no time. One has to understand that there is also a strategic aspect to the appointments in Kolkata and elsewhere. Those who have been made observers, co-observers and convenors will not be able to contest the coming elections.” Baisakhi Banerjee, according to BJP leaders, had earlier insisted that Sovan Chatterjee and she should be given specific roles in the party. The duo stayed away from BJP programmes for months and BJP national secretary Arvind Menon had to hold meetings with them to make them pro-active. “Looking at the current political scenario I think the most challenging area for the next election will be the Kolkata zone. I am fortunate enough to have Chatterjee’s guidance. I will try to do whatever the party decides for me. From my side there will be no dearth of commitment,” Banerjee said. When it was pointed out that neither she nor Chatterjee will be able to contest the coming polls, Banerjee said, “Whatever the party decides for us is the leadership’s priority. We have nothing to say on that.” In the BJP’s Kolkata north organizational zone, which covers the suburban areas in the city’s northern periphery and parts of the North 24 Parganas district, the district unit president Manas Bhattacharya was appointed as observer on Sunday. On Monday, he was replaced by Barackpore Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh. “Initially I was reluctant to take the responsibility as I already have too many,” said Singh. In a similar move, Ramkrishna Roy was named as observer for the Asansol zone where Union minister of state Babul Supriyo is the local Lok Sabha member. He was replaced within 24 hours by Saurav Sikdar. Also, Dr Sawar Dhanania replaced Ramkrishna Paul as observer in the adjacent Burdwan district unit. Among the district presidents who were removed was Shyama Pada Mondal from Birbhum. “I tried to do my best but the leadership’s decision is final,” Mondal told HT after handing the baton to Dhruba Saha, a younger leader, a day before Mamata Banerjee’s rally in the district’s Bolpur town where Union home minister Amit Shah led a grand roadshow on December 20. Mondal and Hari Krishna Dutta, a veteran leader and president of the South 24 Parganas (East) district unit, were made special invitee members of the state unit. “Dutta was failing to manage the ranks but there is resentment among a section of workers over appointment of his successor, Sunip Dutta,” said a senior district leader. Dutta could not be contacted despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-amends-list-of-district-observers-presidents-in-24-hours-after-dissent/story-Xnz6O4Pv4yLGYGxW4neuIN.html
29-12-2020||India||‘Government not a rice or dal miller’: KCR’s sharp U-turn on farm laws||There is no need for the state government to purchase the agriculture produce as the new farm laws were being implemented across the country, allowing the farmers to sell their crop anywhere, said Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao taking a sharp U-turn from his earlier opposition to the very laws. KCR had earlier supported the Bharat Bandh against the Centre-backed farm laws. The announcement comes days after the CM met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Earlier, the CM’s party had voted against the legislation in Parliament.The decision that the process of sale and purchase of agriculture produce would now be left to the market was made at a high-level official meeting convened by the CM on Sunday evening.“The government cannot do it anymore. It is not a business organisation or trader. It is not a rice miller or a dal miller. Sale and purchase are not the responsibility of the government. It is not possible to set up a purchase centre in the village from next year onwards,” read an official statement from the chief minister’s office. ALSO WATCH | ‘Not afraid to quit’: Punjab CM moves bills to counter Centre’s farm laws However, the CM directed that the sale and purchase of commodities at the agriculture markets be done properly. He suggested that the farmers should not bring their entire produce to markets at one time but in phases so that they would get a better price. During the last season, the CM’s office said, the government had set up purchasing centres in the villages and purchased all the agriculture produce on humanitarian grounds to see that the farmers would not suffer losses, on account of the coronavirus pandemic. It said the government had incurred losses to the tune of Rs 7,500 crore due to purchase of paddy, sorghum, maize, red gram, bengal gram and sunflower. Though the government had paid Minimum Support Price (MSP) for these crops, it had to sell them at the lower prices in the market, as there was no demand for these crops. Till recently, the chief minister strongly opposed the legislations on agriculture stating that they would harm the interests of the farmers. In September, when the legislation was introduced in Parliament, the TRS president instructed his party MPs to vote against the bills. KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known, told his party MPs that though the bills said farmers could sell their produce anywhere in the country, in reality, they would enable the traders to go anywhere in the country to buy the produce. The bills would also help the corporate lobby to spread to all corners in the country, he had alleged. On December 8, the TRS leaders and cadre, led by party working president and KCR’s son K T Rama Rao, took part in Bharat Bandh (nationwide shutdown), opposing the new legislations on agriculture. The TRS president also announced that he would hold a national conclave in the third week of December and invite all anti-BJP forces to protest the anti-farmer and anti-labour policies of the government.

29-12-2020||India||Farmers’protest updates: Demand repeal of ‘draconian’ laws, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||Protests against the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws entered day 33 on Monday as the government and the farmers’ union prepare for the sixth round of talks on Tuesday. The farmers’ unions had on Saturday accepted the government’s second proposal to hold the sixth round of talks at a date and time as per the unions’ convenience, having rejected an earlier invitation. On Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Singhu border to interact with the protesting farmers and “challenged” any Union minister to debate the laws with the protesting farmers so that it becomes clear “how beneficial or harmful these laws are.” Kejriwal had earlier visited the Singhu border, which has emerged as the epicentre of the stir, on December 7.Since September, when these legislations were passed, the farmers, predominantly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against what they call “black laws.” Initially, railway tracks were blocked in Punjab and the farmers arrived in Delhi on November 26 and, since then, have been camping on various borders of the national capital. The farmers have repeatedly said that they are prepared for a “long haul” and will not go back till the laws are repealed; the government, on the other hand, has ruled out a repeal, and, instead, has proposed amendments to these.Previous five rounds of talks, including one each on December 1, 3 and 5, have failed to break the deadlock. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s outreach, too, has failed to convince the farmers.Here are the live updates from day 33 of the anti-farm laws protests:Demand repeal of ‘draconian’ laws: Mamata BanerjeeWe are with the farmers.

29-12-2020||India||Can the rich aid post-pandemic economic recovery||2020 was a year of unprecedented economic disruption globally. Thanks to a near total 68-day nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the Indian economy suffered an even bigger disruption. This is why India’s June quarter GDP shrank by 23.9%, more than the drop seen in other major economies. Things improved with the easing of lockdown restrictions. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) has reached 90% in December, just 10% below the pre-lockdown period. Many forecasters have made favourable revisions to their estimates for India’s 2020-21 gross domestic product (GDP). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for example, revised its projections from a 9.5% GDP contraction to 7.5%. GDP growth figures will take a big jump from the June quarter next year as a favourable base effect kicks in. As 2020 comes to end, the big question is not what the December or March quarter GDP growth figures are going to be, but the long-term growth prospects of the Indian economy. A section of economists believes that the pandemic, even though it has hurt the poor in a big way, might not cause significant long-term damage. Speaking to Ira Dugal of Bloomberg Quint, Neelkanth Mishra, the co-head of Asia Pacific Strategy and India Equity Strategist for Credit Suisse, explained the rationale for this view (https://bit.ly/3hhdiFr). “The pain has gone down to the bottom 30%-40% of the enterprises and individuals. While from an inequality perspective that is a disastrous outcome, from an economic momentum perspective that is actually the best possible outcome... The top 10% of the Indian economy consumes more than the bottom 50%. The top 10-20% have come out of the lockdown with a better balance sheet than earlier, because their consumption was more impacted than their income. It is the bottom 50% whose income has been more impacted than their consumption...their balance sheets are much worse. But as we come out and incremental savings which the rich had is deployed with a vengeance, (and) the economic stimulus which has come through...the lasting damage to the economy is much lower”, he said (https://bit.ly/3rmV2zk). If one were to set the normative issue of rising inequality aside, will the Indian economy see a growth boom driven by the rich in the medium term? This question is worth examining seriously and Number Theory will do this in two parts. First, can the rich aid growth? . How big is the income/consumption inequality in India? India does not have a comprehensive income database and consumption expenditure is the best proxy for income data. Because the government scrapped the 2017-18 Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES), we do not have recent data on consumption inequality in India. However, the 2011-12 CES data and the latest income tax statistics can give us some idea about this question. The 2011-12 CES shows that the top 20% of the population had a share of almost 50% in total consumption expenditure. It also tells us that the bottom 80% of the rural population and almost half of the urban households spent half of their budgets on buying food. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) has a share of more than 50% in India’s GDP. These numbers suggest that Mishra’s prognosis of the top 10-20% mattering the most when it comes to driving PFCE and growth is correct. However, there is good reason to believe that CES, like other National Sample Survey Office surveys, undercounts the rich and, therefore, the extent of income inequality in India. A comparison of salary data from the latest available periodic labour force survey (PLFS) for 2018-19 and income tax data for the Assessment Year 2018-19 (fiscal year 2017-18) proves this point. Salaried workers are at the top of the heap in the PLFS database. Their average monthly incomes (Rs 16,160) is much higher than that of casual workers (Rs 8,340 for 30 days for non- public works related work) or self-employed workers (Rs 10,725). The PLFS estimates that out of 356 million workers in India, 90 million were salaried workers. According to the 2018-19 PLFS, average monthly wages for even the top 10% of salaried workers in India were below Rs 50,000. Even for the top 5%, this number is Rs 61,334; 80% of salaried workers do not even earn more than Rs 20,000 per month, the data shows. The maximum income for a salaried worker in the PLFS data is Rs 12 lakh per month. The maximum monthly wage which the PLFS captures is Rs 60 lakh for a self-employed worker.  The picture changes drastically when one looks at the latest income tax returns (ITR) data. Because granular ITR data is not available, one has to work with average income levels. Of the 58.7 million ITRs filed by salary income earners; a number which is about two-thirds of the number of salaried workers estimated by the PLFS, 78.5% reported monthly incomes below Rs 45,000. Monthly incomes do no rise above the Rs 1 lakh mark for 97% of the salary earning class which files ITRs. Anyone who does not earn more than Rs 1 lakh per month can hardly be termed rich today. It is the top 3% of the salary earners who earn 28% of total salary income declared in ITRs in India. The inequality becomes even more acute if one looks at all ITRs rather than the ones filed by salary earners, which shows that the top 0.7% earn almost 40% of the total income declared in ITRs in India.   How important are the salaried/non-salaried rich for the macro economy? Modern economies are deeply inter-connected in nature. This makes it hazardous to speculate on the economic importance of different classes. A highly paid executive’s incomes might depend on a very low-price mass consumption product her company is selling and a relatively poorly paid worker in a tourist resort or a high-end restaurant is dependent on the rich coming and spending there. With this caveat in place, one can try and provide a rudimentary answer to the question posed above. The share of total income declared in ITRs in 2017-18 GDP was 30%. Of this, income declared by salary earners was 11.7%. As a share of PFCE, the share was 19.9% for all salary incomes declared. The top 8% of salary income earners had a share of just 14% in total PFCE. This is less than even 10% of the overall GDP. Even if one were to assume that this class spends all of its income, it is unrealistic to assume that it can generate significant tailwinds for the economy on its own. Put otherwise, the rich can’t drive growth on their own. Abhishek Jha contributed to data analysis for this story.This is the first of a two-part data journalism series, the second part will look at can the rich hurt growth?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-rich-can-aid-economic-recovery-post-pandemic/story-bx4eT14YEsWuNnN65fhhzI.html
29-12-2020||Today's||Covid-19 has had a positive effect too||The pandemic has sewn science and people together in a shared mission. Through this, the disease will deflate by the needles of global vaccination. Vaccines will be licensed and available next year in India. A delivery and vaccination pipeline has been put in place that addresses a complexity and scale perhaps seen nowhere else in the world. Stress-tests of this system are being done. This is extraordinary. But scientists must also introspect and address current and future challenges with grater vigour while learning from this year.As vaccines roll out there are three pressing tasks of public importance and concern, which our scientists need to address simultaneously, with focus, intensity and equal importance.The first is making testing available inexpensively, and on demand, at home. Testing now needs to move from an identification of positive individuals and their contacts to a public health effort. Individuals, housing societies, factories and airports should be able to test, get results in minutes or hours, upload or show the results and move on or isolate. People and communities should be able to know if where they have gone has affected them.The second task is real-time documentation of the genetic variation of the virus in the population. There have been concerns about new variants in London and South Africa with possible increased transmission. While these strains do not seem to pose immediate health concerns, we cannot be complacent about them, or other variants of concern that may emerge. Our molecular biologists and the public health system are working to enhance surveillance of variants. These must also be combined with laboratory tests and matched to studies on clinical outcomes.The third task is measuring the effectiveness of vaccines. Clinical trials, which are carefully structured, discover something called the efficacy, as distinct from the effectiveness, of a vaccine. This is a measure of how the vaccinated perform against disease, upon exposure to the virus, when compared to an unvaccinated group. We know that many current vaccine candidates have high efficacy. The effectiveness of a vaccine is a measure of how it performs, not in a structured clinical trial, but in the real world. This can be measured only during and after vaccine introduction across the diversity of India. Exposure to other diseases, variation in nutrition, the state of one’s health, can all have a bearing on effectiveness. This third task when combined with the other two, will allow us to be assured that we are taking every correct measure going forward.In addition to these important tasks, we as scientists need to grasp our responsibilities firmly. People will always want their problems attended to today. Industry measures returns each quarter. Yet, science and technology, important for both society and the economy, usually measures success in time-scales of years, if not decades. These differences in speed and expectation have always made communication of ideas and delivery of solutions between science on the one hand and society and industry, on the other, complicated. During the pandemic we bridged this challenge and there are lessons for the future to be learnt.Investment in science must, and will, grow. This is an insurance policy for future crises, both foretold and unforeseen. Here, India must lead and increase our commitment to science and, very importantly, its ease of functioning. Our best institutions have been accused of being a short walk from India while attracting the best national talent. The pandemic has taught scientists that addressing the most complex of societal problems can and must take place now. This changed attitude must stay and not swing back into a disconnect between science and society. Similarly, industry and government departments have worked with scientists as never before. This attitude should also stay.The delay between investment in research and return to society can be bridged if we change our institutional functioning. These must allow ease of collaboration with industry and government, ease of internal functioning, and accountability on outcomes rather than accounting for inputs. This will require working together to ensure flexibility for science and scientists and our institutions while, simultaneously, these institutions enhance their connect with society and its goals.The optimism of humans, and our desire to move on, makes us hide the scars and experience of disasters to the corners of our collective brain, leaving it to historians to retrieve and document, decades later, as we move back to business as usual. Scientists, industry and the government must not let us and our institutions go back to a 2019 mindset but work together to invest for the future while delivering for the present. With introspection followed by action, the compact we now have between scientists and people must stay and grow.K VijayRaghavan is principal scientific adviser, Government of India.

29-12-2020||Editorials||Air pollution: CAQM’s role is still hazy||People in the national capital and nearby areas spent almost half of last week breathing severely polluted air. The concentration of ultra-fine PM2.5 and fine PM10 particles in the air was over 10 times the level considered safe for breathing. Blanketed by a layer of smoke and fog, the outdoors were hazardous for the young and the elderly. In the last five years, this description will hold true for possibly any random period of time in the winter. The problem became such that this year, the Supreme Court appointed retired Justice Madan Lokur to oversee the efforts of several disparate authorities — only to be convinced by the government to walk back on the move after it appointed a new statutory body, the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM). With statutory powers that cut across federal lines, CAQM was billed as a super commission, comprising officials from several states and agencies that can take the individual steps collectively pivotal to addressing the problem. CAQM was notified on November 5, almost in the middle of the November 1-15 period when the crisis typically peaks. Experts said the move was ill-timed, and amounted to reinventing the wheel at a time when the problem is most acute. Over the following weeks, many of these concerns were borne out as the authority admitted it needed time to familiarise itself with the problem and the machinery that exists at present. It was on November 13 that CAQM asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to coordinate efforts. More than a month later, there is still confusion about which agency has what sort of role in combating the problem. With the previous SC-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority dissolved, central and state pollution control boards — the agencies that issue directions — have lacked clear policy guidelines for preemptive and mitigating measures. One of the examples of this has been the lack of any curbs on construction work this year (although such a measure has been complicated by the Covid-19 lockdown earlier in the year). Last year, construction work — one of the most significant contributors of dust — was banned for most part of the winter. While it is understandable that any new agency will require time to come up to speed with a problem, Delhi and its neighbourhood should not need to submit itself to the mercy of the weather — at present the only factor that appears to mitigate the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/air-pollution-caqm-s-role-is-still-hazy/story-GTGeiondguWuogDlBEHwsN.html
29-12-2020||Editorials||Infection rates are falling in India, but there is no room for complacency||In the past week, India has, on average, reported 292 new Covid-19 deaths every day, and 21,072 new infections daily — both the lowest in around half a year. Since the peak of India’s first wave in mid-September, both these numbers have dropped nearly 80%. Also in the last week, the positivity rate — the proportions of samples tested that return positive for Sars-CoV2 — is at the lowest ever. This is a key metric key in determining how widespread the virus is in a community. According to the World Health Organization, if the positivity rate remains five per cent or below for two weeks, a region can be said to be keeping its outbreak under control. India’s positivity rate has been below this threshold for 45 days now — a remarkable feat for a country of this size. On the other hand, the grand exercise to vaccinate more than 300 million people by summer appears to be only days away with drug regulators expected to soon take a decision on emergency approvals for vaccines. On Monday, officials in four states carried out vaccination drills, testing arrangements for the first phase of the drive. The calm waters that India’s outbreak is in right now should not be taken as a sign that the tide has turned in the battle against the disease. States are tracking down passengers who have recently returned from the United Kingdom (UK), where a new and more transmissible virus variant has been discovered. On Monday, it emerged that some of them have tested positive for the variant. This serves as a warning sign to not let the guard down. Even if 300 million people are vaccinated by summer in India, it would mean that 75% of the country’s population remains vulnerable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-infection-rates-are-falling-in-india-but-there-is-no-room-for-complacency/story-S7Pk55rT2p50KqpbChyzcI.html
29-12-2020||Editorials||We must realise global health requires a coordinated effort||The ongoing pandemic, with over 79 million people infected and 1.7 million lives lost, has become the most destructive infectious disease outbreak in recent human history with unprecedented human, social and economic costs. Countries are struggling to respond to new infections and virus mutations through a mix of containment measures- periodic lockdowns, domestic and international border-sealing and available, limited medical solutions.International trade and domestic economies were the first to take a hit. By the end of the second quarter, international trade was almost one-fifth less compared to second quarter of 2019. As 2020 closes out and vaccines are getting emergency use approvals, the Covid-19 shock is expected to cause a seven to nine per cent fall in global trade.Countries that were growing economically pre-pandemic, are now witnessing worrying trends. For instance, pre-Covid, unemployment in the United States (US) was at a half-century low but by the second quarter of 2020, its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plunged by nearly 31.4% - a record held previously only by the Great Depression. In the United Kingdom (UK), unemployment hit a three-year high and over 800,000 people lost their jobs. Emerging and fledgling economies like India and South Africa are also experiencing historic contractions.But the impact of Covid-19 isn’t limited to economics and trade. It has magnified fault-lines, exacerbated inequities and inequalities and resulted in shadow pandemics such as mental health crises, violence against women, and disruptions in critical health services, possibly reversing recent improvements. It has forced hundreds of thousands of skilled and unskilled workers out of jobs and is expected to push an estimated 88-115 million into extreme poverty. Countries, rich and poor, have been affected by an economic emergency. Several low- and middle-income countries, battling existing political instability and conflict, coupled with weak health systems infrastructure have borne the worst of this impact. The pandemic has underscored that the world needs to rethink policies and programmes to bring back some semblance of equality and stability in societies. It needs to view global health as a security issue.For too long, the concept of security has assumed an anthropomorphised ‘other’ - an ‘us’ seeking existential security from another state or organisation. Here, state security is threatened in physical or cyber battle by potentially rational or irrational actors, who driven by distrust or ambition or power dynamics, launch threats to a state’s security. While these can be checked with negotiation, mediation and arbitration, or destruction, i.e. war; in case of disease, such an understanding is limited. Disease, and resulting hunger and poverty can cause destabilisation, political unrest, civil disorder, and international conflict– all of which threaten international peace and security. Covid-19 has also shattered the illusion of international collaboration. In the last two decades, these have emphasised good health and well-being, especially through the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals. But in the wake of Covid-19, countries that could launch a coordinated effort to check the impact of the pandemic have resorted to inward-looking policies. Ending the pandemic must be a global goal and a critical determinant of foreign policy, trade, and economic co-operation.Protectionism, isolationism, as seen through vaccine nationalism has reversed the efforts of international bodies and platforms to place health at the centre of the global development agenda. Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the World Health Organization are working with governments and vaccine manufacturers to expedite vaccine research and ensure that the vaccine, when available, is accessible to all. But to ensure success wealthier countries must join hands and lend their support so that all countries can roll-out the vaccine, almost in parallel.As we see the light at the end of the tunnel, as vaccines get rolled out across the world, we need to collectively recognise that global health determines economic trajectories and requires a coordinated, concerted effort. To reap the benefits of globalisation, to ensure an equal world, global health must be central to international collaboration. It determines social and economic development for all. And peace is the logical result.Anjali Nayyar is executive vice-president, Global Health Strategies This article is co-authored by Pratyush Pranav and Anindita Bose, senior associates at Global Health Strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/we-must-realise-global-health-requires-a-coordinated-effort/story-zDKMFpTEvdKX6n2mmxqLjJ.html
29-12-2020||Editorials||Mental health issues are complex for India||The coronavirus crisis poses the greatest threat to mental health since the World War II, with the impact to be felt for years after the virus has been brought under control, United Kingdom (UK)’s leading psychiatrist and the president of the Royal College, Dr Adrian James, has warned. The numbers may rise, he added, as the full impact on disadvant-aged communities, care homes and people with disabilities becomes clear. While Dr James’s assessment/warning is specifically about the UK, the situation is not too different in India.Mental health issues in the context of Covid-19 are more complex and challenging due to a large proportion of socially and economically vulnerable population, high burden of pre-existing mental illness, constrained mental health services infrastructure, less penetration of digital mental health solutions, and, above all, the scare created due to misinformation on social media, says a study Mental health implications of Covid-19 pandemic and its response in India, published in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry in September.After the pandemic began, there were many reports of people suffering from increased stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear in India. In response, the Centre announced intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations and toll-free numbers for psychological and behavioural issues. These need to expanded and made more accessible. The thrust now, as the paper suggests, should also be on developing need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping on par with the evolving epidemiology of Covid-19, they should be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritisation of mental health care resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/mental-health-issues-are-complex-for-india/story-lgcuSxdhNTY13ROF3RY47J.html
