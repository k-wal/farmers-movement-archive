14-12-2020||News||How did slums survive during the lockdown?||Usually, when Adeel Kureshi contacts government officials, it is to demand paved roads, sewers, and streetlights for Pahari Nagar, a sprawling slum settlement in eastern Jaipur. This past April, though, Kureshi was seeing to more pressing needs—making sure residents have enough food and fuel during the raging coronavirus pandemic and stringent lockdown. Kureshi, an informal leader and resident of Pahari Nagar, told us over the phone: “I have tried to make a list of households who are the rozkamane vale, roz khane vale. If they don’t work for one day they will go hungry. So I made sure they got supplies…”Six hundred kilometers away in Bhopal, Om Prasad, another slum leader, was scrambling to ensure residents were keeping the settlement clean and understood how easily the virus can jump from person to person. “The first thing I did [following the lockdown’s announcement] is get the settlement cleaned. The second thing was to build awareness about how the disease can spread between neighbours.”India’s slums received substantial media attention for being potential coronavirus hotspots. Journalists note that slum communities are especially vulnerable to the spread of the virus, and the economic consequences of restrictive mitigation strategies. Slum residents are susceptible given most work in the informal sector and live in crowded conditions, often with inadequate access to essential public services like water and sanitation.Despite widespread concerns, we have little systematic information from slum residents about their pandemic-time experiences. Most reporting has focused on conversations with residents in ‘famous’ slums in megacities like Dharavi in Mumbai. These city-sized slums are unrepresentative of most settlements, which are smaller and in less metropolitan cities.Media accounts also tend to render settlements as uniformly vulnerable and helplessly passive in the face of the pandemic.These portrayals ignore significant variation across slums in their levels of infrastructural development, and neglect the internal structures of self-governance through which these communities solve problems during ‘normal times’.To better understand how slum residents were affected by the lockdown and pandemic, we conducted a phone survey with 321 slum leaders across 79 slums in Jaipur and Bhopal, at the height of the lockdown in April and May 2020. To our knowledge this is the first such effort to canvas these important leaders during the pandemic. What did we find?First, our survey demonstrated that slum leaders are not idly watching the virus spread and economic distress deepen.Roughly six in ten leaders contacted a local politician during the lockdown to request assistance. However, the focus of their lobbying efforts shifted dramatically from ‘normal’ times. 91% of requests during the lockdown were for food rations, instead of more usual demands for public infrastructure. This reorientation makes sense given leaders estimated the average household in their settlement had only enough savings to survive for 24 days.This shift in focus highlights a hidden cost of the pandemic—a reduction in the time leaders have to address pre-existing deficiencies in basic public services. Second, pre-pandemic disparities in infrastructural development also shape the extent to which residents can abide by public health guidelines. 39% of the 1594 households we surveyed across the same 79 settlements in 2015 lack domestic water taps. Accessing water requires them to congregate at communal sources like public taps and truck-fed tanks, where intermittency in water supply creates uncertainty that forces long waits. Slum leaders in settlements with sparser household connections are nearly twice as likely to report public water sources as a problem for social distancing than leaders in settlements with more widespread connectivity. As Vikram, a slum leader in Jaipur told us, “people understand it is dangerous to come to a crowded place for water, but they have to do it.” Approaching‘slums’ as a homogenous category misses how disparities across settlements matter during the crisis.Third, slum leaders are not uniform in their ability to help residents. We asked leaders to enumerate any relief schemes that had been initiated or expanded during the lockdown that slum residents might benefit from. 47% of leaders correctly identified zero or 1 scheme, while 25.5% of leaders correctly identified 3 or more schemes. Slum leaders also varied in their reported ability to get requested assistance from politicians. Two key factors underpinned their influence with city leaders: education and their embeddedness in political party networks. In prior, pre-pandemic research, we found these exact traits corresponded with effectiveness in everyday problem-solving. Leaders who were effective before the pandemic remained more effective during it.Public health experts have called for community-driven solutions to slow transmission and soften the economic blow of containment measures. In India’s slums, such participatory efforts will encounter informal leaders like Kureshi, Om Prasad, and Vikram. Our findings reveal active forms of leadership even in the most underserved areas of India’s cities. However, we also document that slum leaders are deeply dependent on party networks, and that nine in ten are men. These traits inevitably bias the types of residents that leaders are most likely to hear and help. Rather than flatten and simplify slum communities, participatory efforts must recognize these complexities within them.A small silver lining to the pandemic has been in rendering visible the Indian state’s inadequate understanding of important urban communities, ranging from circular migrants to slum residents. Acting on this realization requires more than calls for making cities inclusive. It requires sustained engagement between crises, not a flurry of recognition during them.

14-12-2020||Noida||Data of Noida tech firm leaked, suffers ₹50 crore loss||A sector 39 based IT firm suffered losses of over ₹50 crore after unidentified persons hacked mails of various employees, said police.Elcom Innovations claimed in its complaint that its services were availed by military and paramilitary forces and hence their data were sensitive in nature. The alleged hack was discovered in February and the cybercrime cell investigated the matter following which an FIR was registered on Saturday. The delay in registering the FIR is not unusual in such cybercrimes.“The company has incurred heavy losses and irreparable damage to its reputation after my email and those of several other people in the department were hacked. We deal primarily in contracts with the defence forces, paramilitary forces and other intelligence agencies of the country,” said the firm’s senior vice president in his complaint to Noida police.He said that most of the company’s electronic communication was of sensitive nature and substantial financial value as the products being designed by the company were customised.“The hackers got hold of our bidding prices for various government tenders. They exposed our intellectual property rights leading to duplication of our products and diverted our contracts to other firms,” read the complaint.The company has further alleged that information was also shared with international clients leading to delays and withdrawal of contracts. Suppliers were also provided with profit margin information causing a hike in prices, the complaint read, resulting in a loss of over ₹50 crore.Based on their complaint, a case was filed at the sector 39 police station for cheating (section 420 of the Indian Penal Code) and relevant sections of the IT Act. Police officials said that the company suspects the role of one person and a probe in the matter is underway.“There is evidence indicating it to be an insider job but the investigation is going on for now on all possible aspects and as soon as we have proof, we will take the necessary action against the suspects,” said Azad Singh Tomar, station house officer, sector 39 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/data-of-noida-tech-firm-leaked-suffers-50-crore-loss/story-qttRbpJHBeDsPR95DEGNtI.html
14-12-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Ghaziabad crosses 25,000 mark||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad district crossed the 25,000 of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases reported so far since March, with the state portal, which is updated real-time, reflecting 25,010 overall cases till 7.35pm on Monday. The state control room figures on December 14 stated that only three cities in Uttar Pradesh – Lucknow, Kanpur and Prayagraj – were among those who have crossed the tally of 25,000 cases so far. The first case in the district was detected on March 5, about 284 days ago. Though Ghaziabad district has a high overall tally, the state control room figures of December 14 indicated that it also has a high – 95% – recovery rate, with 1,148 active cases on Monday. “With regular testing, tracing and early referrals, we have been able to isolate infected cases and have been able to keep the fatality rate below 1%, which is about 0.39% at present. To check any further rise and to isolate more cases, we are conducting focussed testing in high incidence areas. This will help us track more cases and check the spread of Covid-19,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to the figures of the district health department, , the share of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara to the total tally of about 24,826 till December 13 was about 24.69%. The three areas continue to be on the list of high incidence localities. Individually, till December 13, Indirapuram had 3,135 cases, Vaishali had 1,506 while Vasundhara had a total of 1,491 Covid-19 cases since March. “Focussed testing should continue in high incidence areas to break the chain of transmission. The discharge rate of 95% and fatality rate of 0.39% indicates that efforts are on by the doctors and healthcare staff in government and private setups. However, we must continue to follow Covid protocols and take all precautions for another couple of months, till a vaccine becomes available,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. On the other hand, the officials of the district health department said that they have completed about 597,599 tests till December 14. They also added that the sample positivity rate of the district in the first 13 days of December has shown a minor decline of 0.3%, as against 4.14% in the month of November. The official figures stated that overall sample positivity rate of the district till December 13 was about 4.9%, with overall 27,755 positive tests reports of patients emerging out of total 566,676 tests conducted, the number of test reports being more than the number of cases as one case may have been tested more than once. The district had the highest positivity rate in June, when the rate was about 19.93%. In July and August, there was a considerable decline and the rate again climbed to 5.92% in September. It was at 4.03% in October and 4.14% in November. The trend now shows a decline in December so far– 3.84%. The official figures, however, revealed that the district is conducting about an average of about 3,500 daily tests this month while the daily average tests were about 4,057 in November and 4,065 in October. “We will ramp up testing further but we are concentrating more on focussed testing in high incidence areas. We want that the positivity rate should come down further. The focussed testing during pre-Diwali and post-Diwali period also helped us isolate a number of positive cases. So, all efforts are being taken up to find positive cases and this will help us break the chain of infection,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-ghaziabad-crosses-25-000-mark/story-a7foak0mU8tT5G171bRDnL.html
14-12-2020||City||SIT submits report in leaseback scam to government||The special investigation team (SIT) formed to investigate into alleged land leaseback scam case on Monday submitted its report to the UP government.Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) chief executive officer (CEO) Arun Vir Singh led the team that investigated the case in Greater Noida’s Bisrakh village. Singh refused to comment on the matter.The case dates back to 2009-’10 when residential land was leased back to people from different states who were allegedly not farmers. As per rules, the Greater Noida authority could have leased-back housing land to local farmers, whose housing land was wrongly notified and acquired by the government.There were at least 150 such cases in Greater Noida’s Bisrakh village.Sources said that the probe established that there were violations in leaseback.“As per the rules a farmer can get land residential land against his land acquired for the development at one place for the use of his family. But in Bisrakh more than one plots were leased back to a farmer,” said an official of Greater Noida authority, not authorised to speak to media.In 2017, then divisional commissioner (Meerut) Dr Prabhat Kumar had appointed Singh to conduct a probe into this alleged scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sit-submits-report-in-leaseback-scam-to-government/story-2ZSOvKZBgIFG5DIF1kQuaI.html
14-12-2020||Noida||Live streams, pictures, videos: Farmers use social media to counter media, send news home||Ghaziabad: Nitin Sengar, a Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) activist from Agra, is busy relaying live streams on social media through his mobile phone on the ground-level situation at the UP Gate protest site to his friends back home. He says that there have been a lot of “controversies” created on social media, so he is giving live updates in hopes of clearing the air. “Social media is abuzz with farmers’ protests but there are certain posts which try to create controversies. I have become more active on the internet now and am live streaming the ground-level situation over the internet. Our farmers are still here and are holding peaceful protests. Everyone who has not been able to join us here needs a regular update,” he said. Hundreds of farmers are busy with ongoing protests at UP Gate since November 28, and have been joined by scores from Uttarakhand and Punjab.“We are also creating posts on various social media platforms and apprising people about the issues with the new farm bills. We also upload videos and pictures of events, whether it is about voicing issues of farmers or giving updates about performance of singers here. We also show how the food is prepared in langars (community kitchen) here and how children of nearby slums are also being served food here, as well as about the police personnel deployed,” said Baldeep Singh, from Moga in Punjab, who is a priest. His friend Jagjeet Singh, who is also a priest from Tarn Taran in Punjab, said that various controversies have been created online which claim to show the “real picture” of the farmers’ protest. “What is being held here and at other borders with Delhi is a massive movement. It is not possible to monitor everyone who comes here. However, it is going on peacefully and it is a protest by farmers. My family is at Singhu border and our groups there are also uploading a lot of videos from there,” he added. The UP Gate protest site is abuzz with activity. Different groups of farmers are tasked with different daily activities – be it holding langars or distribution of water bottles and fruits, or be it keeping an eye on outsiders. With a majority of farmers possessing smart phones, video-calling and giving live updates to kith and kin is a daily normal. “I have uploaded about 20 live videos over social media so far and am regularly updating my family and friends about our activities here. They also like it and share it with others. In this way, even a small video or picture from here can reach hundreds of people. Besides, it also serves the purpose of not having to rely purely on the media to report on every activity that is taking place here,” said Sunny Jagtap, a youngster who arrived from Muzaffarnagar. Apart from social media activities, which have become quite popular at the protest site, a group of children came with their family from nearby Trilokpuri in East Delhi and performed charkhi and daang dances, which are popular performances for Baishakhi and other festivals. “My sons as well as my daughter performed the charkhi and daang at the UP Gate site. They are still in school and we came here after their online classes got over. They learned these at a local Gurudwara and were very happy to perform at UP Gate. It was the nearest protest site to us so we came along with my 60-year-old sister, who lent a helping hand in readying vegetables for the daily kitchen here,” said Santokh Singh, who is from Jalandhar in Punjab and lives in Trilokpuri. On Monday, tonnes of fresh vegetables along with fruits such as kinnu, apples and bananas were brought in at the site. In langars, cooks also prepared loads of jalebis and gajar ka halwa, while another food camp of the BKU prepared kheer for visitors. Apart from regular food which also includes noodles, bread-pakodas, pakodis and tea are regularly served. “We have every food item available, be it different vegetables, fruits or even items such as biscuits, water bottles or fruit juices, among others. We ensure that food is served to everyone who comes. It is also helping us continue our agitation,” said Gurjeet Singh, a farmer who came from Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/live-streams-pictures-videos-farmers-use-social-media-to-counter-media-send-news-home/story-UMLrVlpqCzDt54GioO937M.html
14-12-2020||Noida||Traffic crawls at Chilla border amid continued farmer protest||Noida: Though the Noida-Delhi road at the Chilla border was opened on Sunday by protesting farmers, traffic came to a crawl on Monday due to a hunger strike and demonstrations in the area. The Chilla border, which had been closed to the public since December 1 due to farmers having blocked the thoroughfare, was opened following talks between farmers’ representatives and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on December 12.“Even though the traffic was moving, it was slow. There were barricades placed after every few feet. There was a lot of police force and the farmers were present on the central divider and along the roads. The on-foot movement was also causing the vehicles to move slowly,” said Shweta Bhandari, a Noida resident.Commuters said they fear that with the protests continuing, the border may be re-sealed. A senior Noida police official, asking not to be named, said that they are prepared to block the route again in case the farmer agitation escalates. But for now, the status quo is being maintained.Farmers have occupied the central verge of the road and were camped at the road side, with some of them on hunger strike.“We met Rajnath ji on Saturday but nothing is being done to accept our demands. We will continue on hunger strike indefinitely till the government takes notice of our plight,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).He had started the strike on Sunday and was joined by at least 12-15 farmers. Nearly 60-70 farmers are present at the border where they said they will continue to remain until definite conclusions are reached.A smaller group of protesters from the BKU’s Lok Shakti faction was present at the Dalit Prerna Sthal, where they are on an indefinite hunger strike. Their representatives mimicked the three monkeys of Mahatma Gandhi as a symbolic protest.“The government has become blind to our struggles, is refusing to listen to our issues and demands, and is not speaking on our behalf, all the while not letting us speak as well. We will stay here for as long as it is needed and will continue with our protest,” said Shailesh Kumar Giri, national spokesperson, Lok Shakti.Meanwhile, Noida police said they are on high alert.“Increased forces have been deployed at Chilla border as a precautionary measure. Even the barricades are placed to ensure that there are no issues. Some force is present at the DND Flyway as well as a cautionary measure,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.Police said they are prepared to take necessary action in case the agitation escalates again.“We are monitoring the traffic situation. The intensity of the movement today was slightly slow, though it did not stop. The DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj border areas were better. There were no law and order issues in the city and we are continuing to provide support to the public and farmers alike,” said the DCP.A group of farmers had also gathered at the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate’s office in Surajpur on Monday afternoon, from where they were dispersed after handing over a memorandum of demands to officials.Meanwhile, members of various political parties in the district, going to lend their support to the farmer’s protest at Chilla border, were stopped by Noida police at separate points.“We reminded them about Section 144 that is imposed in the district, along with the Covid-19 regulations, which prevent them from any unlawful gatherings. They were warned that if they protest, action can be taken against them,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/traffic-crawls-at-chilla-border-amid-continued-farmer-protest/story-y1rZ4P4MNv2iNsqlTczVrM.html
14-12-2020||Noida||Amid propaganda and controversies, we will continue with peaceful protests, say farmer leaders on fast at UP Gate||The talk of certain farmer unions meeting the central government and lending support to the three new farm laws is just propaganda, said farmer leaders agitating at UP Gate in Ghaziabad.They said they would continue with their “dharna” to press for the roll back of the laws, which they claim are detrimental to their interests. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Monday said, “We will continue to protest peacefully here. Certain groups meeting with government representatives is just a propaganda to weaken the farmers’ protest. We have already said that this protest is of farmers and we will not allow any outsiders to be a part of it.” “There have also been attempts to stop our people from joining protests here. It is on government’s instance that the borders are getting closed and getting opened,” he said further while referring to the opening of the Chilla border in Noida. On Sunday, a delegation of more than 100 farmers from Uttarakhand extended their support to the laws. Before that, a delegation of 29 farmers from Haryana met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday to extend their support and threatened to protest if the laws were repealed. Also, several pictures and videos emerged from the Tikri border with Delhi, another prominent protest site, in which a group of protesters were shown holding posters of intellectuals and activists in jail, accused in different cases. “This is also a part of propaganda to weaken our protest and create confusion,” said Tikait. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmers’ leader from Uttarakhand, said that more farmers and their groups were coming to support the protest at UP Gate. “More farmers and groups from Uttarakhand, UP and other states are coming in and supporting us. Our December 12 and December 14 protest calls had been successful and further course of action will be decided by our core committee,” Bajwa, added. As of now, the farmers’ groups and the government have held about six talks among them but the deadlock over the three new farm laws has continued. On Monday, the farmers had given a call for protests at respective district headquarters and handing over memorandum of demand to respective district magistrates. A group of farmers including Tikait and Bajwa were among those who were on day-long fast at UP Gate along with others. They said that they were on fast from 8am to 5pm. The BKU and farmers from Uttarakhand, Punjab and UP have been staging protests at UP Gate since November 28 and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the National Highway-9 since December 3. On Monday, a group of protesters at the site jumped to the other, Delhi-Ghaziabad, carriageway and blocked it for about 10-15 minutes before they were called back. As a result, thousands of commuters were left stranded while trying to enter Ghaziabad. “The protesters blocked the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway for about 10-15 minutes but they went back and normal traffic was restored. It created long jam but we soon diverted the traffic coming from Ghazipur towards Kaushambi,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amid-propaganda-and-controversies-we-will-continue-with-peaceful-protests-say-farmer-leaders-on-fast-at-up-gate/story-C0BIwu3oB1pIPqNJecGHeN.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Three-year-old girl killed in roof collapse in Khajoori Khas||A three-year-old girl was killed after a portion of the roof of a single storey house she lived in with her family collapsed on her in north-east Delhi’s Khajoori Khas on Monday morning. Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot to rescue the injured girl from the debris, but despite their best efforts she could not be saved, fire officials said.The girl Manvi (single name) lived with her parents Vikas and Jyoti, and grandfather, Chaner Pal in their single storey home at E-block in Khajoori Khas. The grandfather works as an ambulance driver and owns the house that was constructed many years ago and needed repair work on the roof. The family had also planned to construct one more floor and had hired some labourers to store the construction material on the roof.The workers were in the process of storing the construction material on the roof when it collapsed under the additional weight, said additional deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Devesh Kumar Mahala.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said the roof collapsed on the girl who was inside the house. The other family members were outside the building at the time of the incident. The rescue teams and the locals took nearly half an hour to rescue the girl from the debris and rush her to the hospital, the officer said.“She was trapped under the debris and was rescued by locals with the help of a team from the fire department and the police. The injured girl was rushed to Jag Pravesh Chandra hospital, where she died during treatment,” said the officer.“Since the girl’s grandfather himself was carrying out the construction work and had not involved any contractor, we registered a case of death by negligence against him,” Mahala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-three-year-old-girl-killed-in-roof-collapse-in-khajoori-khas/story-SRr2ktrg84odKDZWOk6LyI.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Collection agent shot dead, Rs 1 lakh robbed; one nabbed||A 24-year-old man was arrested for allegedly shooting dead a 29-year-old collection agent of a footwear factory and then robbing his cash bag in north Delhi’s Pratap Nagar near Gulabi Bagh on Friday afternoon, the police said.The arrested suspect’s three accomplices from Uttar Pradesh, who were with him during the crime, are still absconding. The suspects had targeted the collection agent hoping that his bag would contain Rs 35-40 lakh. They shot him in his chest after waylaying him on the road and fled with the cash bag. They later found that the bag only contained R1 lakh, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.One motorcycle used in the crime and R23,500 of the looted money has been recovered from the arrested man, identified as Harish Kumar, a resident of Delhi’s Ghonda, police said. Kumar worked as a commission agent for readymade garments wholesalers in Chandni Chowk.DCP Alphonse said that on December 11 (Friday) around 2.30 pm, the police were informed about a man having been shot in Pratap Nagar. A police team reached the spot and rushed the injured man to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The dead man was identified as Vikas Garg, a Narela resident, who worked as a collection agent for a footwear factory in Mangolpuri. A murder case was registered and investigations taken up.During the probe, the DCP said, it was learnt that Garg was carrying a bag containing R1 lakh at the time of his murder but the bag was missing. The investigating team scanned the footage of CCTV cameras installed around the crime scene. The police also found a witness who told them that while driving he had seen four men snatching a bag from the victim and then firing at him.“The witness gave us some details about a bike, that the suspects had used in the crime. The owner of the bike was traced and it was found to be registered in a woman’s name. We questioned the owner and her husband. They said the bike was being used by her brother-in-law Harish Kumar. We interrogated Kumar and he confessed to the crime. We then arrested him,” said DCP Alphonse.During the interrogation, the DCP said, Kumar disclosed that while working as a commission agent, he had noticed Garg coming to the Chandni Chowk market for collection often. Kumar assumed that Garg carried huge sums of money in his bag. So, he planned to rob Garg and roped in three men from Uttar Pradesh to execute the robbery.“They tracked Garg’s movements for a few days. On Friday, they executed the plan anticipating that they will get nearly Rs 40 lakh in cash. When Garg resisted their robbery attempt, they shot him and fled with the bag, which contained only Rs 1 lakh,” the DCP said, adding that raids were on to nab the absconding suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/collection-agent-shot-dead-rs-1-lakh-robbed-one-nabbed/story-sCRK99T0XlDUJjRrbb0FxH.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi:Two goldsmiths among 4 held for stabbing and looting 4kg gold worth ₹2 crore from Karol Bagh jeweller||Five days after a jeweller from Karol Bagh was stabbed and robbed of four kilograms of gold ornaments, worth around ₹2 crore, the police on Monday said they have arrested four persons, including two goldsmiths known to the jeweller, for allegedly planning and executing the armed robbery.The suspects had melted the stolen gold and made gold rods, which they had distributed among themselves. Nearly 1.9 kilos of gold rods have been recovered while two more suspects are on the run with the remaining gold, the police said.On December 9, the jeweller, Champak Gayana, was travelling towards Anand Vihar bus terminal in an auto-rickshaw with his employee, Saurabh (single name), when the suspects waylaid them on the busy Vikas Marg near Laxmi Nagar and tried to snatch the bag at gunpoint. When the jeweller held on, one of the suspects stabbed him multiple times in his thigh and fled with the bag, said additional commissioner of police (crime) Shibesh Singh.A case was registered at the Shakarpur police station and multiple teams were formed to the crack the case, even as news of the robbery created panic in the neighbourhood. During the probe, the crime branch team collected information about gangs that operated on a similar modus operandi. The team scanned the footage from CCTV cameras and also activated their informant network.“A CCTV camera footage from where the Gayana and Saurabh had left showed two suspects following them on a motorcycle. Our efforts to trace the motorcycle and the riders led us to a gang led by Mukesh alias Golu and we came to know that they were behind the crime,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh.Golu and his associate Pradeep Bajaj alias Toni were caught from central Delhi on Sunday night. Their interrogation led to the arrest of the two goldsmiths -- Prashanto Santra and Uttam Dagur -- and recovery of 1.9 kilos of the stolen gold, said Singh.During their interrogation, the additional CP said, the four men disclosed that they had planned the robbery four months ago from a hotel in Paharganj. The two arrested goldsmiths knew the jeweller and had passed on the information to Golu and his gang members about the movement of 4 kilos of gold ornaments to Moradabad.Police said Golu was previously involved in 11 cases of robbery and snatching, registered in Delhi and Goa. He was last arrested in Goa and came out of jail in March this year. “Golu returned to Delhi, formed a new gang and executed the robbery with the help of the two goldsmiths. We are now looking for the absconding suspects,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-goldsmiths-among-4-held-for-stabbing-and-looting-4kg-gold-worth-2-crore-from-karol-bagh-jeweller/story-itndL1BzCSBcsnJr4flBPP.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Commission on air quality management is functional, has taken various steps: Centre to SC||The Central government on Monday informed the Supreme Court that the commission on air quality management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas is now functional and has also taken various steps to improve the air quality.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, however, sought some time from the SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, to bring these developments on record by way of an affidavit of the Centre. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represented teenager petitioner Aditya Dubey in the case, had questioned the efficacy of the ordinance on the air quality management, asking what has the commission done so far.Responding to this, Bhati said that the air quality is better in the Delhi-NCR recently, and that pollution due to stubble burning has also come down after December 3.Bhati, however, said she will need at least two days to file her affidavit so as to apprise the court of steps taken by the commission.The bench allowed this request and deferred the matter for a hearing later this week.Dubey, a minor, has filed a PIL in the court, alleging authorities have failed to protect his fundamental right to clean air and health by not controlling air pollution. Days after the top court set up a committee headed by its former judge Madan B Lokur to suggest measures to contain the menace, the government issued an ordinance that superceded all the judicial and other committees set up on the issue of air pollution in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas.The ordinance empowers the agency to make rules, set emission standards, and slap fines of up to Rs1 crore or imprison violators for up to five years.The committee set up under the ordinance is headed by former Delhi chief secretary MM Kutty, besides Secretary Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and five other Secretary/Chief Secretary level officials as its ex-officio members. The commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the NCR, including areas in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, in matters of air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/commission-on-air-quality-management-is-functional-has-taken-various-steps-centre-to-sc/story-kruT3cj6gq26A0PEMUn80M.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Dacoity at Delhi CA’s house solved; six, including former driver, held||Police on Monday said they had arrested six people for alleged dacoity at the house of a chartered accountant (CA) in south Delhi’s Saidulajab Extension.The arrested men had entered her two-storey house impersonating courier delivery boys and held the family hostage at gunpoint on the afternoon of December 9. They made away with ₹4 lakh in cash, four gold chains, one diamond bracelet and other jewellery items and valuables worth ₹5 lakh, they said.The arrested persons include the family’s former driver, an ex-Indian Army jawan, who quit the force after being booked for molestation, and a man from Nepal, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that Shiv Shankar, the family’s former driver, had left the job a few months ago and planned to rob his employer’s house. However, the plan got delayed because of the lockdown, said Thakur.The DCP said that Shankar allegedly had tipped off his associates about the family’s financial condition and availability of cash and jewellery in the house. Shankar, Anil Kumar and Sandeep Kumar alias Fauji, were the key conspirators of the dacoity. The police identified the other three arrested men as Arman Khan, Mohammad Danish and Vijay Rana, a Nepali citizen, the DCP said.“The six men had been planning the dacoity for nearly one-and-a-half months and carried out multiple reconnaissances of the house and escape routes. They used code numbers 1 to 6 to communicate with each other during the crime and wore masks and hand gloves to avoid being identified and leaving fingerprints at the crime scene,” said DCP Thakur.On December 9 around 4.30pm, police said, Shankar brought the six men to the house. Two of them, impersonating courier delivery boys, rang the doorbell. As the domestic help opened the main gate, the duo pushed her inside and cornered all family members at gunpoint. The other four suspects, wearing masks and helmets, entered the house and threatened to kill the family members if anybody raised any alarm, said a police officer associated with the case.“The robbers thought they would get nearly ₹1 crore in cash from the house. However, they could only find ₹4 lakh in cash. So, they ransacked the entire house, collected whatever jewellery and valuables they could find, and fled,” the officer said, adding that the suspects also took away the digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV cameras installed in the house.The family informed the police about the crime and the complainant (the CA) told them that the suspects fled on a red motorcycle and a scooter. The woman’s husband owns a furniture showroom in east Delhi. He was at the showroom at the time of the dacoity, the police said.The police registered a case and scanned footage from CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood. The police found the number plates on the vehicles were fake. Through the CCTV camera footage, the police tracked the routes the suspects took and found that they had come from Zakir Nagar.“The suspects swapped the two vehicles and changed routes to evade police. However, we activated our criminal intelligence network in Zakir Nagar and discovered the involvement of Arman Khan, who is also involved in other robberies and cases registered under the Arms Act. The police caught Khan from Nizamuddin area on December 11. His interrogation led to the arrest of the other five from Delhi and Haryana’s Rohtak,” added Thakur.Police have recovered ₹45,000 in cash and some stolen jewellery which the suspects had sold in Rohtak immediately after the dacoity. One suspect, Chhotu, is still on the run with the remaining money, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dacoity-at-delhi-ca-s-house-solved-six-including-former-driver-held/story-G1GrRdWm9LWf6nBZjBPyuM.html

14-12-2020||Noida||Noida sees best air quality since Nov 17||With favourable weather conditions on Monday, Noida and adjoining cities breathed their cleanest air of the month yet. According to the central pollution control board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI), Noida’s air was “moderate” for the first time since November 17. Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, which were suffering “severe” and “very poor” air over the weekend improved to “poor” levels. “The wind speed on Monday afternoon reached above 15 kmph. Since the stubble burning is negligible and rains on Saturday morning cleaned up the region’s air, the winds entering the NCR are cleaner or are not carrying any extra pollutants with them. Thus, it was comparatively easier for the winds to disperse the locally generated pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). AQI of Noida on Monday was 176 or ‘moderate’ against 322 or ‘very-poor’ a day earlier and 393 on Saturday. Greater Noida’s air was 256 or ‘poor’ against 332 on Sunday and 404 on Saturday. The AQI of Ghaziabad also emerged out of very-poor levels with Monday’s AQI at 243 or ‘poor’ against 318 on Sunday and 415 on Saturday. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The fine particles or pollutants PM2.5 levels improved to their best since December standards, yet they are still around twice or 1.5 times the standards. On Monday PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida was recorded at 99.24 microgrammes per cubic metres (mpcm) against 186.47mpcm a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 119.19mpcm against 212.41mpcm on Sunday. The PM2.5 levels for Ghaziabad on Monday also dropped to 112.49 mpcm against 216.22 mpcm a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 mpcm. According to SAFAR, the AQI is likely to drop slightly on Tuesday and Wednesday. “Surface-level winds are moderate and west-southwesterly and moderate winds and better ventilation conditions are forecasted for today. However, AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate from the Moderate to the Poor category on 15th and 16th Dec,” said a SAFAR forecast on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sees-best-air-quality-since-nov-17/story-uNKuChEXAhdQYJxi3O3FWK.html

Monday also marked the third coldest day of the season so far, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD said that both maximum and minimum temperatures will fall further by a few degrees over the next four days. The humidity is high, but stronger winds will save the region from very dense fog, the weather department said, adding that the fog, however, will be within moderate to dense category over the rest of the week. “The minimum temperature will hover around 8 degrees Celsius for Noida and adjoining region for the next two days. On December 17 and 18, the minimum temperatures will shrink further as the icy cold north-westerly winds will be stronger and the impact of western disturbance that lead to heavy snowing of the mountains will increase over NCR. So, by 17 and 18th of December, the minimum temperatures may shrink to 6 or 7 degrees Celsius,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. On Sunday, Noida had recoded minimum temperature at 13.5 degrees Celsius, and 15.5 degrees Celsius a day earlier. As per the readings from Noida’s automatic weather station at Sector 62, November 23 and November 22 had been the coldest day of the season so far with a minimum temperature of 8.2 degrees Celsius and 8.7 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum temperature for Noida on Monday was recorded at 17.7 degrees Celsius, against 19.9 degrees a day earlier and 20.1 degrees on Saturday.

And tourism zone will be developed as per the policies of UP and central governments with an aim to promote tourism in ancient towns,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.The officials said that the authority will soon hire a consultant to prepare the layout of river front and tourism zone projects. “We have already started the process to hire a consultant and the work on detailed project report of these two projects will start soon,” said Singh. In its 69th board meeting held on Monday at its administrative building in Sector Omega-I, Yeida approved a proposal regarding these two projects, the officials said. Yeida has to create required facilities along the Yamuna so that national and international tourists flock to Mathura and Vrindavan and enjoy the spiritualism in these ancient cities related with Lord Krishna, said the officials. Yeida has also planned to develop a heritage city along the Yamuna Expressway so that the tourists have ample options to engage with during their journey in this region from Greater Noida to Agra that is home to Taj Mahal, they said.“Taj Mahal already attracts the tourists from world over and if we provide the facilities along Yamuna river, then they will enjoy the serenity and it will boost growth in this part of the country,” said the Yeida CEO. The authority has also fixed rates to acquire land for the development of these projects. “We have fixed Rs 2,300 per square metre along with 7% of total land acquired as compensation to buy the land along the expressway. The board has given approval to this proposal,” said Singh.

14-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana shivers as mercury dips below Shimla||The maximum temperature recorded at Ludhiana dipped below Shimla’s on Monday. As per the Indian Meteorological Department’s website, the maximum temperature in Ludhiana was 13.7°C , that was recorded at the Sahnewal observatory, while Shimla’s was 14.9°C. The meteorological department of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) said that the cold wave will persist for a few more days.Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head, department of meteorology, said the current system has occurred due to low pressure, as there has been heavy rain and snowfall at higher altitudes, including Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This has triggered a cold wave due to which mercury in the planes has dipped significantly.The meteorological observatory installed at the university recorded a maximum temperature of 13.4°C on Monday, 7.5°C below the normal temperature. This is also the lowest temperature recorded on December 14 since the observatory was set up in 1970.The minimum temperature was 9°C, 2.8 °C higher than the normal temperature.On Sunday, a record fall in temperature was observed. Dr Sidhu said that the maximum temperature was recorded at 13°C, which was the lowest temperature recorded on December 13.“This weather is called cold and dry days. This will continue for around three to four days wherein the weather will be cold, but there will be no rainfall. Even though the city and its neighbouring districts including Mohali, Nawanshahr, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar had witnessed light rain, but there will be no further showers in the coming days,” Sidhu said.She added that a similar system had occurred in December last year. “During that period, we had witnessed a number of cold days. The temperature during the day had fallen significantly, while not much variation was witnessed at night,” she added.“While the night temperature was around 7°C to 10°C, it is during the day that we witness a sharp dip, and sometimes it remains around 15°C or even below that,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-shivers-as-mercury-dips-below-shimla/story-OJo2sJRzIXvnOJ16hpswII.html
14-12-2020||City||Low visibility, bumpy ride make navigating Ludhiana’s Rahon Road tricky||Overnight rain on Saturday and fog on Sunday morning added to the woes of the residents of Rahon Road near Jodhewal Basti as the stretch is in a dilapidated state. The motorists complained that the broken road endangered commuters. Many of them have even fallen from their vehicles because of the poor condition of the road.The residents lamented that while the municipal corporation is claiming to have transformed the industrial town into a smart city, the shabby condition of Rahon Road exposes its dirty picture.If the bumpy ride was not enough, the plying of heavy trucks on the road is also adding to the commuters’ miseries. The condition of the residents of Prem Nagar Colony in the Meharban area is the worst as polluted water of overflowing dyeing units continues to stagnate and flow into the residential area, posing risk to their health.The broken road is not only posing a problem for four wheeler drivers but also scooterists and bikers.The residents complained that the potholed road was dug up nearly a year ago for laying of underground sewerage pipelines but the work was being done at a snail’s pace.“Each day, commuters fall from their vehicles and get injured. The rain and fog have added to the woes. Instead of addressing the problem, the MC authorities are looking the other way,” said Tarun Jain, a factory owner.Chitranjan Mehta, a migrant labourer from Bihar, said that shopkeepers in the area have also encroached upon the road which has added to the chaos.Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA from Sahnewal, said that he had raised the issue nearly 15 times in the Vidhan Sabha in the past three years. “I have been highlighting the issue at each forum but, nothing is being done to address the problem. The local administration has failed to get the road made and check the problem of overflowing dyeing units in all these years, let alone making Ludhiana a smart city,” said Dhillon.Parveen Singla, superintending engineer (SE), building and road department (B&R), of the MC, said that the work of laying of sewer lines was complete and laying road gullies (for drainage of rainwater) was taking place.“The work is in progress and will be completed soon,” said the SE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-visibility-bumpy-ride-make-navigating-rahon-road-tricky/story-KScBvDOjds7fXUd2GBFVHM.html

14-12-2020||Chandigarh||Minor girl alleges she was lodged at Chandigarh jail, police start probe||Police department have initiated a probe into the complaint of a 17-year-old, who alleged that she spent two days in Burail Jail despite being a minor. The teenager, along with her parents held a press conference at the Chandigarh Press Club on Monday, alleging that her neighbour had been harassing her. She said on October 30, she was returning from her father’s shop when her neighbour passed lewd comments at her, after which both the families came to blows. Taking preventive action, police had registered a case against both the families and sent the girl and her family to jail. However, her neighbour and his parents were Covid-19 positive and were arrested after their quarantine period was over. “My family and I kept telling SHO Amanjot Singh at the Maloya police station that my neighbour had been harassing me for long and he again passed lewd comments at me. But ignoring this, they detained us and we were sent to Burail Jail even when I had told them that I was a minor,” the girl alleged. She showed her documents at the press conference that depicted that she will turn 18 in April next year. After coming out on bail, she lodged a complaint with the Chandigarh SSP’s office. Inspector Amanjot Singh, who is SHO, Sector-39 police station, was handling the additional charge of Maloya police station in October, while the SHO concerned was on leave. “We are looking into the girl’s complaint. The investigation so far has pointed out that her father had mentioned at the police station that she is 18 years old, and even at the time of medical examination as well as before the jail staff, the girl herself had mentioned that she was 18,” said assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South) Shruti Arora. “The inquiry is on, but so far there is no evidence against the SHO concerned. Whoever is found at fault will face action. There are CCTV cameras installed at the police station as well as at her neighbour’s house and these will be scanned,” Arora added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/minor-girl-alleges-she-spent-time-in-chandigarh-jail-police-start-probe/story-cuMqCcgAt8e32EEbxUfxOK.html

14-12-2020||Gurugram||Butterfly park in Sector 52 lies is disrepair, conservation activities on hold||The city’s first butterfly park, commissioned by the forest department in Sector 52 two years ago, has ceased to operate and is currently in a state of disrepair. Officials in the forest department confirmed that presently, there are no butterfly conservation activities underway at the park, which has been shut to public since March this year. Officials also said there are no immediate plans to revive the project.An HT team on Monday found that the park has been gated shut, while the approach road is being used as a parking lot for tempos by independent contractors. However, one can still enter the premises (which forms a small part of the forest department’s 19-acre nursery in Sector 52) from a second entrance, located about 500 metres on Ambedkar Road, just around the corner from Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park.Inside, the butterfly park is a shade of its former self. The lack of upkeep was evident, and in multiple places, one can observe the withering remains of saplings planted by visitors. While the area remains forested, it is overrun with weeds and is not being actively maintained, according to staffers at the department nursery.The butterfly gardens, bathrooms and picnic spots all bore a decrepit look. No butterflies could be spotted either, although, at the time of its launch two years ago, the park was reportedly home to 27 different species.Originally conceived by the forest department in 2017, the butterfly park, named Thousand Shades Butterfly Park, was launched in collaboration with a city-based NGO on May 23, 2018, on the occasion of World Biodiversity Day. At the time, the department had spent nearly Rs 3 crore on setting up the park, including the cost of planting specific vegetation to attract butterflies and setting up indoor and outdoor conservatories for their breeding.The park had one outdoor conservatory, aimed at conserving specific butterfly species, including the common emigrant, mottled emigrant, small gross-yellow, peacock pansy, lemon pansy, common pierrot, blue pansy and great eggfly. An indoor conservatory, specifically aimed at conserving the plain tiger butterfly, which is commonly seen in the region, had also been created, but is no longer operational.Close to 150 different species of host plants — including lemon, bel, akawan, chakunda and harsingar trees — were planted in early 2018 to attract various butterfly species. In the first year of its operation, the park became a popular destination for students and picnickers, hosting educational tours and plantation drives for groups of schoolchildren. As plantation work was to be carried out for a period of five years, ending in 2022, visitors were encouraged to plant saplings to commemorate their time there.Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, and former district forest officer (DFO) with the state forest department, said that breeding activities at the park had stopped even earlier than March 2020.“Sometime in 2019, we realised that the concessionaire had been violating our memorandum of understanding. Visitors to the park were being charged for entry, whereas the NGO was only allowed to raise money via CSR funding. They had also created a pukka road to enter the park, which is not allowed on forest land. The intention was to create a butterfly conservation centre to educate visitors, but the concessionaire was turning it a commercial undertaking,” said Yadav.In fact, the district forest department in 2019 also prosecuted Sanjay Kaushik, the director of the NGO, Uthaan, for violations of the Wildlife Act. “The concessionaire had kept four grey partridges at the site in cages, which is against the law. There were also two emu birds and several rabbits that were kept there. This was nowhere permitted in our agreements. At the direction of the environmental court in Faridabad, the partridges were seized and then released in Sultanpur National Park,” said Yadav.Probing these violations, an internal forest department committee in 2019 had recommended terminating the agreement with Uthaan. “At present, our MoU does not stand. Before we could terminate the agreement, we received a representation from the NGO saying they do not wish to continue as the concessionaire. Then, after lockdown, they stopped maintaining the park entirely,” said a senior forest department official, seeking anonymity.The state forest department is yet to take a call on appointing a new concessionaire or running the park independently. “There is no decision on the cards yet,” said the official cited above.Sanjay Kaushik, founder and director of the NGO Uthaan, refuted the forest department’s allegations, but did not specifically respond to each one, when asked. “All I can say is we are no longer maintaining the butterfly park. Uthaan has not been maintaining it since March this year.”The presiding district forest officer, Jai Kumar, declined to comment on the issue. Vasvi Tyagi, chief conservator of forests, could not be reached despite multiple attempts on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/butterfly-park-in-sector-52-lies-is-disrepair-conservation-activities-on-hold/story-W5AxtDpZOq7cyqxG9UQrMO.html

Gurugram recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 101 — an improvement from 239 (poor) on Sunday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin.

According to the police, the incident took place around 7.20pm when the victim, Ramesh Kumar Goyal, a resident of Pataudi, who owns a cloth shop in the main market, was closing his store. Goyal kept his bag containing the cash in his scooter’s compartment and was locking the iron shutter of the shop, when two unidentified men allegedly walked up to his scooter, picked up the bag and fled. Goyal said that two of his employees, Mohit Kumar and Kundan, who were also present at the spot, ran behind them and nabbed one of the suspects. “They raised an alarm and shouted for help. Before anyone could reach them or inform the police, one of the suspects took out a gun and shot at Mohit’s leg. He fell down, following which the suspect fled from the spot,” he said. Goyal and his other employee took Mohit to a hospital and informed the police control room. The police said it seemed like someone was watching Goyal for the last few days or there might be an insider’s role in the incident. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said they are scanning CCTV footage of cameras installed in the market, but are yet to identify the suspects. “Mohit is undergoing treatment and is reported to be stable. We will question both the employees and neighbouring shopkeepers to know if any such incident has been reported earlier from the market,” he said. A case under sections 379 (snatching, 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) and Arms Act of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against the two unidentified men at Pataudi police station on Sunday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/businessman-robbed-of-2-lakh-by-two-men-in-pataudi/story-63Ch4s8Y5xt6YhrY9gpPZP.html

14-12-2020||Gurugram||District administration mulls reducing reserved bed capacity for Covid patients||Faced with a steady decline in Covid-19 cases, the district health department is planning to reduce the reserved bed capacity for seriously ill patients from 50% to 35% in private hospitals. The department has forwarded the recommendation to district administration for final approval. In the last two weeks, the number of Covid-19 cases has plunged sharply due to which there has been more than 50 percent decline in the number of hospitalised patients. According to district health bulletin, Gurugram on Monday recorded 197 new cases. It is almost after three months that district recorded fewer than 200 new infections, taking the total tally to 54,802. Out of these, 2,156 are active cases. Among them, 195 are seriously ill patients, who are currently hospitalised,1,955 are home-isolated, and six are in Covid care centre. Until December 1, the count of patients admitted in hospitals was more than 400 but with the declining weekly test positivity rate of almost seven percent, the overall caseload has come down. “Since there has been an overall reduction in active cases with proportionate decline in seriously ill patients who require hospitalisation, it has been decided to reduce the reserved bed capacity from 50% to 35%,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. “The health department has given its recommendation to the deputy commissioner on reducing the reserved bed capacity,” Yadav said,adding that hospitals can use the bed for patients suffering from other illnesses.Until September, the overall bed capacity reserved for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus was 25 percent. It included both general and ICU beds along with those with ventilator. The bed capacity was then increased from 25% to 35%. Amid the record surge in Covid-19 cases since the last week of October, hospital beds were fast being occupied by serious new infections from Gurugram, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Haryana and other states.On November 16, the reserved bed capacity was increased to 50% beds in private hospitals to tackle the surge. The general beds were reserved at 50 percent, while Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity was increased to 75 percent. The decision to increase the number of beds was taken based on the directives issued by Niti Aayog. Presently, almost 2,821 beds are reserved across 42 hospitals. It includes 415 ICU beds and 223 beds with ventilator support system and 2,183 general beds. Out of the total reserved beds, only 580 beds are currently occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-mulls-reducing-reserved-bed-capacity-for-covid-patients/story-i3OUqxWXkGhJ6cNGNRdXgI.html

The police said the protesting farmers had not approached the city yet, but they have deployed a large contingent of personnel on the expressway to maintain law and order, and manage traffic.According to the police, farmers from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Rewari, Mahendergarh, and Nuh had gathered at the Banipur Chowk in Bawal on Friday morning in their cars, tractor-trolleys and motorbikes.Abhishek Jorwal, Rewari superintendent of police, said that farmers had held a mahapanchayat and blocked the National Highway 48, which resulted in traffic congestion. “Within minutes, the police personnel removed them from the highway and some local farmer leaders were also put in preventive detention, following which they started protesting on service lanes. The detained leaders were set free in four hours,” he said.The police said the protestors had stationed their tractor trolleys and cars on the highway to block the stretch and had started assembling but the police teams managed to intervene and clear the stretch.Traffic movement was slowed down from Bawal to Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan for more than five hours despite heavy deployment on the stretch.Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap (84 villages) of Haryana, said that more than 1,000 farmers had gathered at Bawal to march towards Delhi but Rewari police did not let them cross the junction and had detained the leaders. “The police cannot stop us from supporting farmers who are protesting at Delhi border points for the past 18 days over the Centre’s farm laws. We will increase the numbers to ensure the strength is enough to cross the stretch or force entry into Delhi. We will intensify the protest on Tuesday and Wednesday,” he said.Security has been strengthened on the 78-kilometre stretch with multilayered barricades at all intersections of the highway in view of the protest called by the farmers.On Monday, a group of civil society members came together under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha Gurugram and handed over a memorandum seeking a roll back of the three laws to the district administration. Addressed to the President, the memorandum stated that the three farm laws were not in the interests of farmers. The memorandum stated that the laws would put an end to mandis (APMC system).RS Rathee, president of the Gurugram Citizen Council and municipal councillor for Ward 34, said that if the government doesn’t agree to the farmers’ demands, they will join the protest at Bawal on Wednesday. “This is the biggest farmers’ movement. We are involving all farmer bodies and workers’ unions to gather in big numbers and march towards Delhi,” he said.Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the farmers have yet not tried to enter Gurugram jurisdiction and were stopped in Rewari and at the Rajasthan border. “We are well prepared and our teams are deployed at all borders to control the farmers’ movement. We will not let any group cross the stretch towards Delhi. We are keeping a track on their movement and teams are on standby,” she said.Police said the traffic movement on Delhi-Jaipur Expressway at the Haryana- Rajasthan interstate border, at Shahjahanpur, slowed from 1pm to 4pm. Around 600 farmers had gathered in the morning and sat on a dharna.Mahavir Yadav, a protestor from Mahendergarh, said they are waiting for at least 2,500 farmers to gather, following which they will march towards Delhi to join their counterparts.Trade unions have urged farmers and their families to support their counterparts in Delhi in large numbers. More than 300 police personnel are deployed at the spot to ensure no untoward incident takes place, the police said.

An associate of the slain terrorists was also captured alive by the security forces.Lieutenant Colonel Keshav Sharma, the officiating commanding officer of Rashtriya Rifles, said, “The security forces recovered a rich haul of arms and ammunition from the site of encounter that included two AK 47 assault rifles, six AK 47 magazines, 300 rounds of AK 47 ammunition, one Thuraya satellite phone, one UBGL, 12 grenades, 300gm of explosive material, three cellphones and Rs 26,000.” “They were sent across for a major terror attack,” he added.

Attempts were made to spread the protests throughout the country but failed,” said Parmar while addressing a press conference here.He said the real farmer was working in the field and those who have gathered at the Delhi borders were mislead by wrong elements. The former national vice-president of Kisan Morcha said the protests were confined to Punjab and Maharashtra because there is a huge business of commissions in the two states.Parmar, who in the past has served as the chairman agricultural marketing board, said the three farm laws brought by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government were for the benefits of farmers. “There is not a single thing written in these laws that is against farmers,” he claimed, adding that there may be some doubts on the effect of these laws but no question mark on the intention of the government.He said when the Indian economy opened in the 1990s only the agriculture sector was left out. “Since then there was demand of various farmers’ organisation to free them from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) system,” he said.He said the BJP has a video of Congress leader Kapil Sibal speaking in the parliament where he advocates abolishing the APMCs. “Unfortunately, today, the Congress has taken a different stand and is supporting middlemen,” he alleged.‘Congress trying to provoke farmers in state’  Himachal Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma on Monday said Congress leaders are trying to provoke farmers in the state for their own political gains. While addressing a press conference in Shimla, Sharma said the Centre’s agriculture laws are in the interest of farmers and the loss is only to the middlemen. “These new laws will curb the loot in mandis,” he said, adding that the farmer’s protests have been initiated by the Congress and Left parties.He said these protests are being staged by miscreants as farmers do not have time to leave their work and stay put at Delhi borders. “The Congress is forgetting that these laws were also promised in its election manifesto and should clarify if they were misleading the farmers then or now,” said Sharma.He said the Left parties are scared by the popularity of present central government and are trying to spoil its image internationally. “People who are now protesting in the farmers’ movement were earlier involved in Shaheen Bagh protests,” he added.Sharma said the Modi government has made a big improvement in the rates of MSP and is the only government that takes decisions in the interest of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anti-national-elements-leading-farmers-protest-himachal-bjp-vice-president/story-c8rY3ELvsoqyKCFjc7SUPM.html

They also appealed the public to boycott products of Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani’s companies.Himachal Kisan Sabha state president Kuldeep Tanwar said the farm laws will ruin agricultural institutions like APMC, end the concept of minimum support price and encourage black marketing, hoarding and profiteering of agricultural products which will not only affect the farmers but also the public.He said it is important that workers, farmers, women, youth, students, socially and economically backward sections of the country unite and fight against the government to stop it from imposing capitalist and corporate policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-himachal-kisan-sabha-citu-threaten-to-march-to-delhi/story-44SQX05qWYKyNfbNS1X6nO.html

The air quality index (AQI) on Monday was 76, falling under the satisfactory category, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The last time Mumbai recorded an AQI lower than this was 68 (satisfactory) on October 19 and thereafter the AQI started rising. It was 90 (satisfactory) on October 20 and fluctuated between the poor and moderate categories up till Diwali (November 14). The AQI remained in the moderate category through rest of November with isolated spikes (on a few days) with poor AQI. However, after almost two months, light showers over the past four days improved the air quality. Mumbai witnessed intermittent spells of light showers between Sunday night and Monday morning allowing a marginal drop in minimum temperatures and considerable drop in maximum temperatures leading to cool conditions. Between 11.30 pm Sunday and 8.30 am Monday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 4.8 mm rain while 13.8 mm was recorded at Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai.

The weather bureau predicted the possibility of light rain for Tuesday as well. “Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) received light to moderate intermittent overnight showers that continued on Monday morning. Satellite images had indicated heavy cloud cover over north Konkan region,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD). Showers are expected till Wednesday, according to the IMD, due to the confluence of northwesterly (coming from western disturbance over north) and southeasterly winds (coming from a low-pressure system over the Arabian Sea) extending over northwest India. “December rain is not routine for Mumbai but showers led to traffic snarls, poor visibility, moist and wet conditions through the city,” said Hosalikar. He highlighted that weather radar images on Monday had shown a cloud patch all the way from Raigad (Navi Mumbai, Alibag, Panvel), over MMR (Mumbai, Thane, Palghar), and Nashik.

14-12-2020||Lucknow||UP govt not carrying out development works in my constituency Azamgarh: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party president and local MP Akhilesh Yadav has alleged that the BJP-led state government does not carry out development works in this district as it houses his parliamentary constituency. He claimed that Rs 52 crore is owed to cane farmers in this district alone, but “the government is not making any payment because it is Azamgarh”. “The Manduri airstrip is ready, but the government is not making it functional as we will start coming here. Why a four-km section of the airstrip could not be completed in four years (of the BJP rule)? This is just because this is Akhilesh Yadav’s constituency,” the former chief minister said, while speaking to reporters Sunday evening.Yadav was here in his constituency to attend a wedding function. He also paid his condolence to former minister Waseem Ahamd, who passed away recently.Exuding confidence that his SP would be forming the next government in the state, Yadav said, “We will take smaller parties along. We will not tell more of our strategy now, otherwise the BJP will start hatching conspiracies.” On the “political” violence in West Bengal, Yadav said, “The BJP does the same (unleash violence). I appeal to the people of West Bengal to vote for (TMC chief) Mamata Banerjee and bring her to power again.” Alleging that law and order in Uttar Pradesh has turned from bad to worse, Yadav said the National Human Rights Commission has sent the maximum number of its notices to the state for violations.Yadav was supposed to take part in a Kisan Yatra here Monday, but the district administration did not give permission for the same.When asked about this, he said, “The Samajwadi Party extends full support to the ongoing farmers’ protest. The government has arrested our party leaders and workers using its police. The farm laws will ruin the agriculture sector, and a handful of people will control farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-not-carrying-out-development-works-in-my-constituency-azamgarh-akhilesh-yadav/story-e4MYcSfAbBTUzronTkstpL.html

Early harvest also reduces input cost,” said Rajiv Kumar from Shahbad of Kurukshetra district, who has 5 acre under the staple vegetable. Farmers say potato prices saw an increase last year, after six years. They say such fluctuation in rates is not a good trend, as some seasons they are not even able to recover their production cost with prices dipping to Rs 2 per kg.Rajesh Kamboj, a farmer of Yamunanagar, said, “We don’t know the reason behind the high prices. This is good news for potato growers, as there have been seasons when we have lost Rs 10,000 per acre, as prices were Rs 3 per kg, like in 2018.” Potato traders claim that prices depend upon the acreage and demand, but they do not have complete clarity of the mechanism. Haryana horticulture department officials said due to continuous fall in potato prices over years, acreage under potato fell to around 20,000 hectare this year from 35,000 hectare in 2013. “There needs to be an assured price, as instability of price of vegetables creates deep uncertainty,” said an official of the horticulture department, adding that this was the only reason farmers are not too keen on diversification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/potato-is-gold-for-farmers-as-rates-stay-high-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/story-2LEqUxGF6LcpxhJoJ3ysuK.html

14-12-2020||Jaipur||Jats from Rajasthan’s 2 districts announce blockade from Dec 25 over quota||Jats from Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and Dholpur districts will launch an agitation at Kherli Mode in Bhusawar near Agra-Jaipur national highway-21 on December 25 to demand reservation under the other backward classes (OBC) category in central government jobs. Bharatpur-Dholpur Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti convener Nem Singh and other Jat leaders held a press on Monday to announce the quota stir, which they called ‘mahapadaw’, from December 25, which is locally remembered as Bharatpur founder Maharaja Surajmal’s Sacrifice Day. “On November 18 at the Jat mahapanchayat in Pathena village, we had given 20 days to the state government to send a recommendation letter to the Centre for granting us quota benefits under the OBC category. The state government has not yet considered our demand,” Nema said. Though Jats get quota benefits in the state, community members of Bharatpur and Dholpur districts have been excluded from reservation in the Union government’s services. These Jats were denied the reservation as they belonged to the ruling class during the pre-Independence era and were not considered socially or economically backward. Though the state government incorporated them in the OBC list in 2017, the issue has been hanging fire with the Centre. Also Read: Low temperatures in Rajasthan, Mount Abu freezes at 0.4 degrees Celsius“We have been forced to launch an agitation as the government has not acted on our demand. We urge people to celebrate Maharaja Surajmal’s Sacrifice Day and then participate in the mahapadaw. National and state highways, and railway tracks will be blocked during the agitation,” Singh said. The Gurjar Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti, led by Kirori Singh Meena, had launched an agitation last month at Peelpura in Bharatpur for the inclusion of Jat quota in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution and a 5% reservation in the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) category for state government jobs. The agitation was called off after reaching an agreement with the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/jats-from-rajasthan-s-2-districts-announce-blockade-from-dec-25-over-quota/story-qTTyoQZzeOsWzkp543hrxJ.html

14-12-2020||Pune||Pune city’s positivity rate drops to less than 10 per cent||Even as the city has witnessed a slight spike in new Covid-19 cases the positivity rate has dipped below ten per cent since the last one week, according to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data.Positivity rate is the number of new cases being reported for every ten tests conducted.The city reported 294 new cases on Sunday with over 4,014 tests conducted and the positivity rate stood at 7.32 per cent. On December 7 the positivity rate was 10.57 per cent which came down to 6.79 per cent and 6.51 on December 10 and December 11 respectively.The reason why the second wave did not have a severe impact in the city as much as it did in other cities is because of the higher prevalence of the antibodies caused due to the first wave, say experts. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “Although we did see a small spike in the number of new cases, it was not as much as Delhi. The fact remains that over 50 per cent of the population in congested areas of Pune were already infected and had developed antibodies against the infection which is why the number of cases did not see a huge spike.” The number of tests, meanwhile, have also been brought in proportion to fewer new cases coming up and lesser contacts being traced, however on Sunday too the civic body collected over 4,000 samples for Covid-19 testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-city-s-positivity-rate-drops-to-less-than-10-per-cent/story-otDwUMrEXLvoJVEXm9pCFI.html
14-12-2020||Dehradun||Sherwood College: Uttarakhand police books 50 people including principal||Uttarakhand police on Monday booked over 50 people including the current principal of Nainital’s famous Sherwood College for not allowing an interim principal to take charge despite court orders. “We have registered an FIR against Amandeep Sandhu (the current principal of Sherwood College) and 50 unidentified persons under section 147 (punishment for rioting), section 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) and section 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said Vijay Mehta, in-charge of Tallital police station in the district. Famous personalities like Amitabh Bachchan, Kabir Bedi, Ram Kapoor, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw have been the alumni of this college. Over the weekend, there was police deployment on the college campus after newly appointed interim principal, Peter Emmanuel, went to take charge but was denied entry by college staff. In October, Amandeep Sandhu was suspended by the college’s management over various issues including a pending inquiry into allegations of lapses in statutory compliances; and Emmanuel was appointed as interim principal. “In October, when I went to take charge, entry was denied to me. I had then moved the high court and went again on Saturday with the court’s orders and police protection. But when I reached the campus, it was locked with all the staff assembled at the gate and not allowing me to take charge,” said Emmanuel. He added that all legal procedures would be followed if the current principal and college staff do not let him take charge of the college. The Sherwood Diocesan College Society is run by the Diocese of Agra, (Church of North India) since 1976. Emmanuel was appointed as an interim principal by the chairman of the Sherwood Diocesan College Society.

The Bishop of Agra is not the legal chairman of the Society and he is imposing himself. An interim principal has been appointed bypassing the legal process using a shortcut while the matter is subjudice.” The dispute started in 1976 after the Lucknow diocese was divided into two parts, Lucknow and Agra, with the latter covering western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/sherwood-college-uttarakhand-police-books-50-people-including-principal/story-wSCTlQrFI3TdW9jY6jZO3N.html

The training will be on the lines of the guidelines issued by the Central health ministry. The priority vaccine beneficiaries include healthcare workers, frontline Covid warriors and those above 50-years of age and below 50 with comorbidities.As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as of December 10, at least 46,055 healthcare workers have been registered under the Covid-19 healthcare workers database information. Out of these 4,078 are from government health facilities and 41,977 are from private health facilities. These include 6,279 from OPD’s, 34,052 from various hospitals and 1,646 from various laboratories.Dr Amit Shah, PMC health officer in charge of vaccination drive, said, “We will undergo the training and then we will know what needs to be done exactly. We have all the government facilities registered under the Covid 19 database and also most private facilities.”“Sometimes a private doctor who has a private clinic is also working with a major hospital which is why they may not register their own clinic which is why it shows as a pending facility,” he said.The guidelines state that the administration must be prepared with the cold storage requirements for four vaccines which are front runners including Covishield, Covaxin, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines all of which can remain stable in 2-8 degrees Celsius.The required preparations are to review cold chain preparedness across the state for the possible introduction of Covid-19 vaccine and guide strengthening measures for the same in view of increased cold chain space requirement. Identify vaccinators across government and private sectors to minimize disruption of routine immunization services while introducing the vaccine. Anyone legally authorised to give injection may be considered as a potential vaccinator.To avoid overcrowding at least 100 beneficiaries would be vaccinated in one session. An ideal session includes a waiting room/area, vaccination room and an observation room with a separate entry and exit points. The session will be conducted between 9 am to 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-vaccination-pune-dist-officials-to-undergo-two-day-training-on-dec-14-15/story-oJ5oM3DFTOoMrU1YHq95HI.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||White tigress, cub die due to birth complications at Delhi zoo||A white tigress and a cub died at the Delhi zoo on Monday due to birth-related complications, officials said. The six-year-old feline, Nirbhaya, gave birth to two cubs on Thursday morning. However, she started developing complications after 24 hours due to her inability to release the remaining cub, Delhi zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said. A group of veterinary doctors and staff attended to the animal in consultation with experts from other zoos and Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, he said. Subsequently, a three-hour-long C-section surgery was conducted on the tigress on Saturday evening. It was found that her uterus had ruptured and the carcass of the cub was floating in the peritoneal cavity. It apparently caused severe infection in the body parts and toxemia (blood poisoning by toxins), Pandey said. Nirbhaya responded to the surgery for more than 24 hours due to intensive care and best possible treatment given to her. However, her condition deteriorated subsequently. She succumbed to her severe illness at around 1.34 am on Monday, he said. One of her cubs also could not survive. The remaining one is being hand reared in the veterinary hospital by a dedicated team and best possible care is being extended. Detailed cause of death would be ascertained after post-mortem and visceral examination, the zoo director said. Before Nirbhaya’s death, the Delhi zoo had three pairs of white tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/white-tigress-cub-die-due-to-birth-complications-at-delhi-zoo/story-O1pdmauZDV7ISynsVSxpGK.html
14-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest: BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) differs with other unions, not on hunger strike||Differences surfaced among farmer unions yet again on Monday after Punjab’s largest association, the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), announced it would not be observing the day-long hunger strike against the contentious central farm laws. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said the decision was taken as the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, comprising 30 other farm organisations, did not consult it on the issue. “There is no plan to hold a hunger strike today or in the next few days,” said Kokrikalan, one of the key strategists of the union. “The joint forum kept our association out of the loop when 14 union leaders had an unscheduled meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah last week,” he said. “The joint forum (of farmer unions) is repeatedly not taking us on board before deciding on the course of the agitation. Our association is not bound by the programmes decided by other unions. Besides continuation of agitations at Tikri border in Delhi, activists of the Ugrahan faction are holding protest marches at the district headquarters in Punjab,” he said. Following the farmer unions’ call to protest outside offices of deputy commissioners, activists held dharnas in Sangrur and Barnala districts to oppose the farm laws. Women, under the banner of the BKU (Ugrahan), organised separate protests in both districts.RELEASE OF ACTIVISTS A DIVIDING FACTOR The Left-leaning Ugrahan group had observed Human Rights Day on December 10 in Delhi where the demand for the release of activists, including Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Sudha Bharadwaj, and Varavara Rao, was raised. The function was held at Tikri border, where hundreds of Ugrahan supporters have been camping since November 28. The joint forum of farmers has disassociated itself from the demand of the release of the controversial activists. However, the leadership of Ugrahan, which has a following in south Punjab, said all unions have the freedom to choose subjects to oppose or support. “The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha was duly conveyed that the issue of release of detained activists should be included as a joint demand of farmers. Leaders of other unions may have overlooked the demand for reasons known to them but the BKU (Ugrahan) firmly believes that these activists should be freed immediately. It has been on our charter of demands,” said Kokrikalan. NOT ON THE SAME PAGE SINCE THE BEGINNING In three weeks, Ugrahan has differed on various occasions with 30 other farm unions of Punjab on the course of the agitation. On November 26, all farmer unions, barring the BKU (Ugrahan), undertook the Dilli Chalo protest, forcibly entering Haryana from Punjab after breaking barricades. The next day, the Ugrahan faction blamed the joint forum for breaching the understanding reached by national farmer unions that activists will undertake indefinite dharnas wherever the authorities stop them. On November 25, Ugrahan had criticised the two-month-long rail blockade by farmer organisations, saying it was wrong as it had hit the industrial and agricultural interests of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-protest-bku-ekta-ugrahan-differs-with-other-unions-not-on-hunger-strike/story-IkYeL5E6G4thZEOWIdsTiL.html
14-12-2020||Mumbai||Celebrity chef Kelvin Cheung arrested for duping Bastian co-owner of $200,000||Mumbai police have arrested popular Canada-born chef Kelvin Cheung on Monday for allegedly cheating a Bandra-based known seafood restaurant’s co-owner to the tune of USD 200,000.HT had first reported about the cheating case filed against Cheung in its December 6 edition.“Cheung was arrested in Delhi and was brought to Mumbai today morning on transit remand. He is being produced in the court in the cheating case,” confirmed Somnath Chasker, the sub-inspector of Khar police station who is part of the investigation team.According to police, Khar police had registered a first information report (FIR) against chef Kelvin Cheung and his father Chi Ping Cheung early this month under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on the complaint of Ranjit Bindra, a resident of Pali Hill in Bandra and co-owner of Bastian.As per the police complaint, Cheung had been working at Bindra’s office for a long time as chef. “While working at the Bandra restaurant, Cheung asked Bindra to invest in popular restaurant franchises in Chicago and Los Angeles with the help of his father. In 2015, the complainant invested USD 200,000 in multiple transactions,” Gajanan Kabdule, senior inspector of Khar police station had said.Police officials said that the money was transferred through a hospitality firm.Last year, Cheung suddenly disassociated with the restaurant claiming his father had passed away. Since then, the complainant’s discussion with Cheung regarding the investments abroad did not go well. Later, Cheung allegedly started ignoring Bindra, who chased his investments in vain, a police officer said.“Recently, Bindra learnt that Cheung has returned to India. He hoped to get his money back, and hence approached police and registered a complaint,” said Kabdule.Police may seek Cheung’s police custody for questioning him about the money transactions.Previously, Cheung had told HT, “I can state that I wasn’t part of any deal with Bastian regarding their investment deal. I haven’t signed any contracts with them and I haven’t received any payments from them as alleged by them.”Cheung’s spokesperson said a statement would be released soon on the current development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/celebrity-chef-kelvin-cheung-arrested-for-duping-bastian-co-owner-of-200-000/story-Eebzt3e0kEx1eJX20i2R1I.html

14-12-2020||Mumbai||Light overnight showers in Mumbai; temperature drops marginally||Mumbai witnessed isolated spells of light showers between Sunday night and Monday morning, allowing a marginal drop in minimum temperatures that led to cool conditions.Between 11.30pm Sunday and 8.30am Monday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 4.8mm rain while 13.8mm was recorded at Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai. Sporadic light showers helped the minimum temperature drop to 22 degrees Celsius, both in the suburbs and in south Mumbai, which was close to the normal mark. The weather bureau predicted the possibility of light rain and thundershowers to continue throughout the day on Monday and similar weather conditions on Tuesday as well. “Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) received light to moderate intermittent overnight showers that continued on Monday morning, with the latest satellite images indicating heavy cloud cover over north Konkan region. Light to moderate rains are expected to continue till Monday afternoon for now,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Rain or thundershowers are likely to continue till Wednesday, according to IMD, due to the influence of the confluence of northwesterly (coming from western disturbance over north) and southeasterly winds (coming from a low pressure system over Arabian Sea) extending over northwest India causing such weather in north central Maharashtra, Konkan and isolated areas in interior parts of the state as well.“December rain is not routine for Mumbai but continuous showers in most places led to traffic snarls, poor visibility, moist and wet conditions through the city,” said Hosalikar.He highlighted that the latest Doppler radar images had shown a cloud patch all the way from Raigad (Navi Mumbai, Alibag, Panvel), over MMR (Mumbai, Thane, Palghar), and Nashik. “Some areas in south Mumbai and parts of Raigad are expected to witness continuous light showers,” said Hosalikar. Meanwhile, apart from Mumbai, Nashik recorded 9.8mm rain, Harnai 4.4mm, Thane 4.2mm, and Mahabaleshwar 2.2mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/light-overnight-showers-in-mumbai-temperature-drops-marginally/story-kqdBZWcYnACm3U3LBl080L.html

14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s AQI to deteriorate as day progresses, says CPCB||Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) improved significantly on Monday morning and stood in the moderate category at 8am. According to the data shared by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the hourly AQI at that hour stood at 173.However, the average AQI is predicted to be in the poor to very poor category on Monday, indicating the pollution levels are likely to rise further during the day.On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI in the national Capital stood at 305 in the very poor category. This could be attributed to Saturday’s rainfall which increased moisture in Delhi’s air, pushing the pollution levels to the very poor category.On Saturday, the AQI was recorded 356, also in the very poor zone. This was a deterioration from Friday’s 295, which is categorised as poor in the AQI scale.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said in the aftermath of Saturday’s western disturbance, high moisture availability with higher air holding capacity and dense fog formation are expected over Delhi, mainly during early morning hours.“This can trigger heterogeneous aqueous reactions to form secondary aerosols (pollution particles converting into secondary aerosols with the help of water content in the air), which can lead to deterioration of AQI,” the forecast read.“AQI is likely to improve from the lower end of very poor to the higher end of poor category for Sunday and Monday. It is likely to marginally deteriorate and drop to the lower end of the very poor category on Tuesday,” Sunday’s forecast added.India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said that dense fog was also likely early Monday, which could reduce visibility levels drastically.“The air quality is likely to remain in poor to lower end of very poor category on December 15. The air quality is likely to remain in poor to lower end of very poor category till December 17 and marginal deterioration is likely to start from December 18,” the IMD forecast added.At the Safdarjung observatory, the minimum temperature on Sunday was recorded 11.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 20.7 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. Minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to remain in the same range on Monday as per the forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-aqi-to-deteriorate-as-day-progresses-says-cpcb/story-ODhEUt3EKo2UjuifRZTzzJ.html

The anti-Gurung faction also sent a veiled threat, saying there can be bloodshed if the state tries to appease both factions of the GJM. No Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader commented on this till Sunday night. Gurung, who was in hiding for three and a half years after being charged under anti-terror law for the violent Gorkhaland agitation in 2017, surfaced in Kolkata on October 21 and pledged his support to Banerjee. He withdrew his support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his ally since 2009. Gurung helped the BJP win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice in a row. But he has now vowed to ensure TMC’s victory in the coming assembly polls. He also addressed a big rally in Siliguri town on December 6. Gurung’s former lieutenant-turned-rival Binoy Tamang, is not willing to shake hands with Gurung and welcome him to the hills. Tamang and his close aide Anit Thapa held a rally on Sunday at Sukna and said there can be bloodshed if the state government tries to appease both factions of the GJM. Tamang also alleged that Gurung is using the Gorkhas to serve his own interest. Also Read: ‘Will enforce only CAA,’ says Vijayvargiya as BJP takes U-turn on NRC in Bengal Anit Thapa, the government-appointed chairman of the board of administrators of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) said, “We have full faith in the chief minister but I request the state government not to keep two khukris (traditional Gorkha knife) in one sheath. There can be bloodshed.” Thapa’s statements indicated that Tamang and his men are worried about an alliance between the TMC and Gurung. The TMC leadership has not said anything in public on this issue till now. The BJP, on the other hand, has raised questions about the police protection provided to Gurung, who is still officially an accused in several crimes, including the murder of a police officer. Also Read: Two Bengal BJP workers killed in 24 hrs, three held amid stir Despite his long absence, Gurung still has a strong base in Darjeeling while Tamang and Thapa failed in helping TMC in the Lok Sabha polls and Darjeeling assembly bye-election last year.

Addressing Sunday’s rally, Tamang demanded bipartite talk between the state government and the GJM faction he leads. “We were the ones who restored peace in Darjeeling in 2017. Those who doused the fire can also lit it,” Tamang said. Gurung, too, addressed a rally at Birpara in Alipurduar district. He accused the BJP of not doing anything for the Gorkhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/gorkha-faction-issues-veiled-threat-to-tmc-caution-against-bimal-gurung/story-8w40jis3FMUOvYrniuzt1K.html

14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The head that wears the helmet||Vishwanath takes all the precautions he can to avoid being hurt. But accidents still happen, and some injuries are unavoidable.The rickshaw puller’s leg is bandaged, though he insists it’s not a serious wound, pointing to the small band-aid strapped onto it. It happened a few nights ago.Delhiwale: A tale of two times“I had dropped off a customer, and was riding to the main road, when suddenly a dog appeared in front of the rickshaw.” Vishwanath instinctively steered the handle, causing the rickshaw to lose balance. “The rickshaw fell, I fell too, and I got a small chot (injury).”This afternoon, Vishwanath is sitting on the passenger’s seat in a north Delhi lane, waiting for customers, but also basking in the warmth of the winter sun. His face is covered in a mask and his head is topped with the kind of helmet labourers wear at construction sites.“I have been wearing it for some months.” He had picked it from a footpath. “This is to protect myself in case I suffer a serious accident... like a speeding car hitting my rickshaw.”So far, he hasn’t encountered any horrid mishap.Delhiwale: A toilet monolith in IndiaA native of Kolkata, Vishwanath says he has no home in Delhi, not even a familiar street where he could retire every night to rest like many other rickshaw pullers in the city. “I sleep on the footpath... any footpath, wherever I happen to be.”Living alone (and being single) doesn’t make him feel lonely, he asserts. “I don’t have time to feel the absence of relatives in Delhi... I work during the day and that makes me so tired that I fall asleep almost the moment I lie down on the chaadar (the bed sheet he spreads on the pavement).”Vishwanath says he has been living in Delhi long enough to have faith in its people. He talks of personally witnessing strangers coming to the aid of road accident victims, for instance. “I myself carried an injured man to the hospital for free, once.” Nevertheless, he feels “it’s better not to rely on others for your own well being.”Delhiwale: Shahnawaz’s private rose gardenAnd then he has the blessings of his taveez, he says, reverently touching the amulet around his neck.Vishwanath starts his working day at 9am and is asleep by 11pm, latest. At night, he takes off his helmet and keeps it by the side of his pillow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-head-that-wears-the-helmet/story-s7zrFpeL3EkTf8lVL761bN.html

14-12-2020||City||Agitation gains traction as hundreds from Haryana rally behind farmers||The ongoing agitation of farmers is gaining momentum in Haryana as support has started pouring in from all over the state. With the protest entering Day 18 on Sunday, movement of tractor trailers, canters and cars towards Delhi became a common sight in Haryana. Locals have also been sourcing vegetables, flour, sugar, sweets and money to send them to the protesters.“We know that they have enough ration to continue with the protest for several months, but we are still doing our part to boost their morale,” said a farmer from Yamunanagar’s Topra, Sandeep Singh. “We do not belong to BKU (Charuni), but we support their decisions. That is why it took only a few hours to make toll plazas free for all vehicles for one day. We all are farmers and we stand united for the cause,” said Balbir Singh, an elderly farmer from Indri in Karnal.With colleges and schools closed due to Covid-19 pandemic, teenagers and youths are also participating in the stir actively by circulating videos, messages and photos from the protest sites on social media to encourage others. “Being a farmer’s son, it is my responsibility to support their agitation as they are fighting for us without even caring about the harsh weather conditions. We are ready to do whatever we could for them,” said. Ramji Lal, a retired professor of political science and a political analyst, said, “This agitation is unique and has brought most of the farmers to a single platform. Haryana chief minister’s statement that the state’s farmers are not supporting the protests has agitated them and increased their participation. If the agitation lasts for a few more days, it is likely to garner more support from Haryana.” BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni, who is the only farm leader from Haryana leading the protest at Delhi’s Singhu border, said, “Government’s behaviour with the farmers and delay in accepting their demands has made the people of Haryana angry. Not only from Haryana, but farmers from other states too are coming out of their houses to make this agitation successful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agitation-gains-traction-as-hundreds-from-agitation-rally-behind-farmers/story-eoFvp1DYrQnH9O2MPA6TgJ.html

14-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents pick holes in admn’s move to increase wards||Even as the UT administration has sent a draft notification regarding increasing the number of municipal corporation (MC) wards in the city from 26 to 35, residents are protesting the move saying the new wards will sideline their sectors.The draft notification was issued on December 10 and objections have been sought from residents and other stakeholders by December 17, after which the final notification will be issued.The resident welfare associations (RWAs) of Sector 38 (West) held a protest on Saturday as Sector 38 is being combined with Dadumajra Colony, Dadumajra village and Shahpur Colony in ward 26. President of the HIG Upper RWA Neha Arora said, “We are an urban sector and it is wrong to combine us with a village and two colonies. Our problems will be ignored while the councillor here will be more involved with Dadumajra village.”President of Sector 38 (West, pocket B) Anand Singh added that they either want the same ward of Sector 38 (West) with Sector 38 and Sector 37 to continue or they want to be coupled with another urban ward. President of the Sector 38 (West) RWA Pankaj Gupta had earlier sent his objections to this move to the administration.Sector 13 RWA also protestPresident of the Modern Housing Complex (MHC) RWA in Sector 13 Col (retd) Gursewak Singh has also written to the UT adviser regarding this. “MHC is a newly-developed area with over 13,000 people residing here. Combining it with Manimajra village is counter productive as it is seen that the needs of village residents are given preference. We want to be combined with Basti Kishangarh and IT Park.”President of Government Houses Resident Welfare Society, Sector 22, Vinod Vashisht added, “Sectors 22 and 17 are heritage areas of the city and form its heart. It is wrong to separate the two as they face similar issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-pick-holes-in-admn-s-move-to-increase-wards/story-DAJq6vzIunp7VREduozHeP.html

14-12-2020||Chandigarh||Year after eviction drive, Chandigarh’s Sector 22 bustling with illegal vendors again||A year after the municipal corporation cleared the Sector 22 market of illegal vendors, squatters have returned to the market besides Kiran Cinema in Sector 22-D.Selling their products from unauthorised spots, vendors have set up shop on the railings, pathways and even corridors in front of stores, while others can be spotted walking around in search of customers.In December last year, MC had removed the illegal vendors and relocated others, while allotting only 97 slots to vendors to carry on with their business in Sector 22 itself as part of a rehabilitation drive.While the corporation had assured of strict action against any illegal vendors thereon, ground reality shows a different picture.“We have been complaining to the authorities for so long, but the illegal vendors are still here. Worse, they don’t wear masks and sit close to each other, completely bypassing social distancing norms,” said Jaswinder Nagpal, president of the Shastri Market Welfare Association (MWA), Sector 22.A shopkeeper, wishing not to be named, said, “Earlier due to lower footfall, nobody was bothered about them. But, around Diwali they became a major nuisance. The officials take note of this, but only during their sporadic visits.”‘Permanent MC inspector needed’Local councillor and senior deputy mayor Ravikant Sharma said before the rehabilitation drive was carried out, one MC inspector was always present at each market, but now a single inspector was required to visit various sectors. “I will bring this up in the MC House meeting so that the previous arrangement can be restored,” he added.The Sector-22 market area falls under the jurisdiction of the Sector 17 police station. However, police officials from there said they weren’t directly involved in removing the vendors. “Police personnel assist the MC teams when they visit the area. Their duty is to ensure the safety of the MC staff on duty,” a police official said.On his part, MC commissioner Kamal Kishore Yadav said he will ask the enforcement teams to visit the market and clear unauthorised stalls.Vending zones dead end for tradersMany relocated vendors are returning to their original location for better business prospects. In Sector 15, vendors are not making any sales. Rattan Kumar, who sells clothes and was shifted here from Sector 17, said, “I hardly sell more than three or four items in a day, while in Sector 17, my sales were much higher. After the lockdown, I don’t even have enough savings to buy new stock for sale, so I sell clothes on commission.”Amarjeet Singh, who came here from Sector 22, added that the MC’s draconian policies had left them with no will to continue. “While we were not charged for setting up shop in April and May, the monthly vending fee has been increased from Rs 2,100 to Rs 2,250. So many promises were made when vendors were shifted here, but now everyone seems to have given up on us,” he rued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/year-after-eviction-drive-chandigarh-s-sector-22-bustling-with-illegal-vendors-again/story-0Jzi70oY0Jh7XisxAmrZ4K.html

The first phase of the protests will be held outside the Directorate of Education here on December 16, 21, 24 and 28, the forum stated.It has called upon the parents to join the forum’s cause against the arbitrary fees charged by private schools in every district.The forum has warned the state education director that if the recovery of all charges raised by private schools this year is not done, then the second phase of their movement will be started.Convenor Vijendra Mehra has demanded the director of higher education to immediately cancel the anti-student and anti-parent notifications of November 10 and December 8 and issue an order banning all other types of charges in addition to tuition fees.The forum has also urged the Himachal Pradesh high court to intervene in the matter and take action against the state government and education director for violating HC orders.Mehra said that as per the notification issued by the Directorate of Education on December 8, the private school managements and parent-teachers association (PTA) have been allowed to take a decision regarding the fees.

IGMCH has only two testing machines, taking 90 and 70 samples at once, respectively.The hospital has been receiving more than 500 samples for testing every day while the reports of only 250 to 300 samples are issued in a day as processing these takes three to four hours.IGMCH principal Dr Rajnish Pathania has said that IGMC Shimla is under maximum pressure as samples from Shimla, Kinnaur and Bilaspur districts are sent here for testing and because of which there is a delay in testing.“Staff shortage is the biggest problem and those who are available are already working for long hours,” said Dr Pathania.He added that about 300 of IGMCH’s staff members have tested positive for Covid and only a handful of them have returned to the duty, making the 24-hour sample testing difficult.In addition to IGMCH, RT-PCR machines have been installed in Kasauli, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College and Hospital, Ner Chowk; Dr Radhakrishnan Government Medical College and Hospital, Hamirpur; Dr YS Parmar Government Medical College and Hospital, Nahan; Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College and Hospotal, Tanda, and Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru Government Medical College and Hospital, Chamba.Meanwhile, the Kanlog Crematorium management has demanded to dedicate the facility for the cremation of Covid victims.They suggested that the non-Covid bodies could be cremated at the Sanjauli crematorium and if the inflow of bodies increases in the future, then the MC can build a temporary shed opposite Kanlog crematorium that is being used as a parking space currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-left-waiting-for-days-to-get-covid-test-result-at-shimla-s-igmch/story-rgXA1ueQMQConXRFSxSUqL.html
14-12-2020||City||Himachal sees two-fold increase in fatalities in over one month||Even as the Covid-19 situation has been gradually improving countrywide in the past over a month, the global pandemic has hit Himachal Pradesh hard during this period.Not only has the hill-state witnessed a surge in the number of infections, but there has been a sharp rise in virus-related deaths.Since November 1, the fatalities have swelled by more than double. The state reported 48,951 infections and nearly 793 deaths linked to the disease as on December 12.There has been a jump of 154% in the Covid-linked deaths during this period. The state has the case fatality ratio of 1.6% against the national average of 1.5% and is among the top five states with a high death rate.The case fatality rate (CFR) is the ratio of deaths and confirmed cases and is an indicator of severity of disease in a given period.As many as 323 people died in November while 158 people have succumbed to the contagion in less than a fortnight in December.Shimla, Kangra worst hit Shimla district, which has seen the maximum case surge in the past month, has also recorded the highest number of deaths. The district has reported 9,056 infections since November.Shimla chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Surekha Chopra said the multiple factors contributed to the spike in Covid-19 cases in Shimla. The hill-town is the state capital and has maximum government offices.Besides, the marriages, social gatherings and ceremonial processions aggravated the situation.As many as 215 people had died of the virus in the district as on November 12. Shimla has the highest case fatality ratio of 2.37%.Medical superintendent of Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) Dr Janak Raj said the case fatality ratio in Shimla was high due to referral cases.“IGMCH is the territory Covid care centre and patients are referred here from other districts, including Bilaspur, Solan, Sirmaur and Kinnaur among others,” said Dr Janak.He also attributed the high death rate to late arrival of patients. “Patients are coming to the hospitals at later stages of infection or when their oxygen level drops below 40%,” he said.Similarly, Kangra, the population-wise biggest district, has reported 157 deaths against 6,636 infections and CFR is 2.36%. A total of 100 people died in Mandi, the second worst hit district in terms of number of infections, it has a CFR of 1.5%.Chief minister Jai Ram in his address recently said that social gatherings were the prime cause of increase in cases. The spike forced the government to introduce strict curbs including the capping of attendees in such gatherings to 50.Higher male mortality The government data also revealed that the death rate is higher in men than in women. Sixty-seven percent of the total deaths reported in the state were men. As many as 531 men have died due to the infection compared to 257 (33%) women, said Dr Nipun Jindal, director, National Health Mission, Himachal Pradesh.Most of the victims had co-morbidities, pre-existing diseases like hypertension and diabetes etc. As per the data, more than 65% of corona death cases had other illnesses in Himachal Pradesh.About 27.9% of the 793 people who have died from coronavirus were in the age group of 61-70. Similarly, 22% were in the age group of 71-80; 21% percent between 51-60 years. Ten percent victims were 80 years or above.The younger people too are vulnerable and about 17% of the victims were in the age group of 11 to 50 years of age. The youngest victim was a 1.5-year-old kid.How infections and deaths have grown Himachal Pradesh recorded its first case on March 20 and first fatality on March 23.

14-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra set for a stormy winter session||Responding to Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis’s claims of “undeclared Emergency in Maharashtra” on the eve of the two-day winter session on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray turned the tables on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), asking if what was happening with the farmers’ protest in Delhi was a “declared Emergency”. Fadnavis criticised the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for imposing an “undeclared Emergency”, criticising the regime for “going after” Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and actor Kangana Ranaut. “We don’t agree with all that they say, but to retaliate the way the government did was unacceptable. The court orders against the government in these two cases have been an embarrassment for it [government],” Fadnavis said, adding that the “arrogance of power” will not take the government far. “There is no such feeling among people. If there is an undeclared emergency in the state, then is there a declared emergency in the country? The farmers are protesting for their rightful demands. But rather than holding dialogues and understanding their emotions, they have to protest in the cold and water cannons are used on them. It is not a sign of goodwill,” said Thackeray, during a press conference held in Mumbai. “It is not our culture to call our annadata (farmers) anti-nationals and terrorists. Earlier, the government imported onions and sugar from Pakistan. Now, has it started importing farmers from Pakistan? Or started giving certificates of Pakistan?” The two-day winter session of the state legislature is expected to remain fiery as the opposition in expected to corner the government over Maratha reservation, fears of the other backward classes (OBCs), alleged U-turn over relief on inflated electricity bills, agrarian issues, among others. Meanwhile, the state government is going to introduce six ordinance and 10 bills. Continuing his attack on the Opposition, Thackeray said, “The cabinet recommends and the governor appoints 12 MLCs as per the size of the house here. In the upcoming session, these 12 seats will remain empty. There should be a discussion on making amendment in the Constitution to fix a time limit for the governor to take a decision on the recommendations of the cabinet.

14-12-2020||City||Mumbai records season’s coldest day; light rain predicted today||The city continued to experience pleasant weather for the third consecutive day, as Sunday was the coldest day of the season. On Sunday, the city also recorded the second lowest maximum temperature for December since 2010. The day temperature on Sunday at the Santacruz weather observatory – representative of the suburbs and Mumbai – was 27.6 degrees Celsius, almost 5 degree Celsius below normal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the lowest December maximum temperature was recorded on December 6, 2017, at 23.3 degrees Celsius. On December 13, 2010, the lowest maximum temperature was 26.5 degrees Celsius. Prior to Sunday, the second coldest December day since 2010 was on December 31, 2014, when the mercury dipped to 27.8 degrees Celsius. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded the day temperature at 27.4 degrees Celsius, also 5 degree Celsius below normal. As the city was under the cloud cover from Sunday morning, light drizzling with traces of rain was recorded in the suburbs, while negligible rain was recorded in the island city, IMD said. Parts of south central Mumbai, eastern suburbs and other areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region received scattered light showers. Humidity levels were 82% in south Mumbai and 77% in the suburbs. The weather bureau has predicted the possibility of light rain or drizzle throughout the day on Monday. “Mumbai witnessed a drop in maximum temperature on Sunday with a feel of chill in the air. The overall weather conditions – cloudy conditions, light drizzling in isolated areas, marginally high humidity throughout the day, and light variable winds (5-9 kilo metre per hour) – were under the influence of the confluence of northwesterly and southeasterly winds extending over northwest India, resulting such weather for north central Maharashtra, Konkan and isolated areas in interior parts of the state,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. He added that satellite images were indicating that such weather conditions are likely to continue for the next two to three days from Sunday. Though the day was cool, the minimum temperatures continued to follow the trend observed all of last week, as the suburbs recorded 23.8 degrees Celsius – 5 degree Celsius above normal – while south Mumbai recorded 23.5 degree Celsius, which was 3 degree Celsius above normal. “The high minimum temperature is due to cloud cover during early morning, which does not allow the trapped heat from the surface to escape,” said an IMD official. Meanwhile, the pollutant-measuring indicator – air quality index (AQI) – was the best for the week on Sunday at 108 (moderate), according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Researchers said it was owing to light showers and moderate wind speed. An AQI of 101 (moderate) has been predicted for Monday. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-records-season-s-coldest-day-light-rain-predicted-today/story-4p75NSDVi2kVMKqzIbMQnN.html

Until March, these government bodies had an outstanding amount of ₹6,200 crore, which by March which has surged to ₹7,208 crore. A senior official from MSEDCL said, “Many urban local bodies have not paid bills for street lights and water supply schemes for years together now.” MSEDCL has now asked the state to ensure 100% payment for streetlights and water schemes by allocating funds to the utility firm. “Earlier too, the state had transferred 50% of the arrears to MSEDCL from funds of the 14th Finance Commission. The state had also asked local self-governing bodies to pay the remaining 50% arrears with delay payment charges and interest. However, they failed to do so,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-power-distribution-firm-s-bill-arrears-from-civic-bodies-cross-7-000-crore/story-w9xQU1xczh8iaHS7RI2tsO.html
14-12-2020||Mumbai||TRP manipulation case: Republic TV CEO arrested||Mumbai Police on Sunday arrested Republic TV’s chief executive officer (CEO) Vikas Khanchandani in connection with the alleged television rating points (TRP) fraud case. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambhe has confirmed Khanchandani’s arrest. The holiday court has remanded Khanchandani in police custody till Tuesday.Despite repeated attempts, Republic TV officials did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. However, in a tweet on its official handle, the channel quoted Arnab Goswami and said, “The truth will triumph. Republic refuses to compromise. We hope the Bombay HC takes suo motu cognisance of this as court remands CEO Vikas Khanchandani to police custody.”Hearing in Bombay High Court today for quashing of FIR in Anvay Naik caseKhanchandani had been questioned previously by the investigators twice before his arrest. During the crime branch’s probe into TRP case, it had been revealed that some cable operators had used dual landing channel number (LCN) technology, which facilitated the viewing of the same channel on two different channel numbers at a time. According to the police, Republic TV officials had contacted cable operators to use LCN and promotional LCN technology to fudge TRPs. Khanchandani was aware of it as he was a part of the channel’s internal WhatsApp group where discussions on LCN took place, the police have said.The police claimed they have discovered the discussions on WhatsApp over fixing LCN to boost Republic TV’s TRP when they had seized the phone of the channel’s chief operating officer (COO) Priya Mukherjee, who has secured anticipatory bail in the case. “Khanchandani did not submit his mobile phone intentionally to the police to hide evidence,” the police had informed the court on Sunday.The probe has revealed that Mukherjee had directed the other accused arrested in the case to manipulate TRP, said police. As Mukherjee was working under Khanchandani, he needed to be questioned in this regard, the police had stated in their remand application, while seeking his custody. The remand plea further stated that the police’s special investigation team (SIT) also wished to interrogate Khanchandani over the allegations of money being paid to cable operators and multi-system operators (MSOs) for boosting Republic TV’s TRP through dual/promotional LCN. Investigators also want to question him to ascertain if he is involved in arranging funds to bribe households which have TV barometers (devise to calculate TRP) installed to unlawfully boost the channel’s TRP.The alleged fraud came to light in October, when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) had claimed that some channels were rigging TRP numbers. SIT has arrested 13 persons in the case so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-manipulation-case-mumbai-police-arrest-republic-tv-ceo/story-q08dxeC17uaP0dElYqhlzI.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||BJP workers vandalised CCTV cameras outside CM’s house: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday posted on its social media handles a video clip and alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders — who staged a protest outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence in north Delhi’s Flagstaff Road — broke CCTV cameras there.BJP leader and mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation Jai Prakash, who is one of the leaders in the protest at the spot, said, “The chief minister’s office was installing CCTV cameras near where we are sitting. There are at least 20-25 women councillors who are sitting on protest who objected to it and didn’t let them install the cameras. Why do they want to install a new CCTV here? Why can’t the CM meet us?”A senior police officer said that some new CCTV cameras were being installed at the wall outside the CM’s residence.“Some councillors from Bhartiya Janata Party objected to it, which led to argument between the two groups outside the CM’s house. Police present at the spot intervened and calmed down both the groups. The situation was normalised and CCTVs are now being installed,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said later, both the groups filed police complaints against each other which are being looked into.AAP spokespersons and Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the incident.Mayors of the three municipal corporations and BJP supporters have been protesting outside the chief minister’s residence for seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-workers-vandalised-cctv-cameras-outside-cm-s-house-aap/story-WyaGPakqGEEbCjARcZvdKI.html
14-12-2020||Health:||Few Covid-19 deaths in India’s old-age homes, survey finds||Old-age homes in India have recorded very low numbers of deaths from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a study of data of more than 3,000 residents in 44 care homes in the three western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. There were 146 Covid-19 cases and four deaths in 44 homes with 3,146 residents, found the yet to be peer-reviewed study, published in the pre-print, medRxiv. This makes the reported Covid-19 cases rate to be 928 per 10,000 residents, the study said. Globally, age is one of the strongest predictors of the risk of death from Covid-19, which hits older adults the hardest even though the majority of cases are in people younger than 65 years. Data from states in India shows that a little over half (53%) of Covid-19 deaths are in people who are 60 years, compared to around 75% of deaths in those aged 65 years and above around the world, according to data reported to World Health Organization (WHO) till October. “There have been accounts of fewer deaths in congested urban slums and old age homes in India, so we investigated data from 44 old-age homes in three states. We found no increase in Covid-19 deaths or all-cause mortality there, even though older persons account for more than half of all Covid-19 deaths in India,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health-Gandhinagar, who is one of the authors of the study. “The study indicates that older persons in care homes are somewhat protected from the new coronavirus infection, in large part because of the protective measures being taken, which included decongesting homes and sending residents home wherever possible, stopping all visitors, giving attendants temporary accommodation within the home if needed, sanitisation all items from outside, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and frequent sanitisation of the premises,” said Dr Mavalankar. The study found that on average, 26% of the residents were sent back to their homes or to relatives before the lockdown to decongest the care homes, and administrators strictly adhered to the government guidelines for social distancing and personal protection. All the homes, including the 15% under-funded ones, made dietary changes were made to add vitamins C and D and multivitamins to the diet and increase physical activity to improve the health of the residents. The residents were also encouraged to make video calls to their families and films and entertainment was added to the daily routine to reduce anxiety. Farmers to step up stir, plan sit-in across country todayAround 18% faced the staff shortage and higher absenteeism during and after lockdown because of commuting disruption. But all 44 care homes had thermometers, 95% had blood pressure measuring equipment, 80% had an isolation facility, 70% with oximeters, 5% had oxygen cylinders. Doctors regularly visited the care homes with the frequency was varying from weekly to even monthly. Only three care homes, however, had resident doctors for medical emergencies and a referral system to take the sick to hospitals with ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. Developed countries, including many with well-funded social welfare systems, such as Sweden, Italy, France, Spain, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States of America, have reported disproportionately death rates in care homes. Delhiwale: The head that wears the helmet“We propose that some people may have an innate resistance to the new coronavirus, as many of these old age homes offered shared rooms for the destitute and people from low socio-economic groups, who may have a more robust immunity because of frequent past infections. Even if you argue that diagnosis may be missed in these groups, I would say that we haven’t come across high death rates across several vulnerable groups, such as people in congested urban slums with shared toilets, homeless shelters, among children with thalassaemia who need repeat blood transfusions, or people with HIV who have low immunity, ” said Dr Mavalankar. Agrees Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi: “It does seem that the death rate in India has been lower than the west. It is unlikely to be genetic since Indians in UK had a higher risk of death, but is conceivably due to different lifestyle. It is possible that treatment protocols with relatively early adoption of steroids and anticoagulation have contributed to lower deaths secondary to inflammation or thrombosis. However definitive evidence is needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/few-coronavirus-deaths-in-old-age-homes-in-india-finds-study/story-a055i1LA6BQQotzfAEU58O.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Construction and demolition waste vehicles to fit cameras, GPS||In a first for the state, the Delhi government is planning to mandate that vehicles carrying construction and demolition (C&D) waste be fitted with GPS devices and cameras, senior government officials said on Saturday. The rule, aimed at curbing unlawful C&D waste disposal, will also make it compulsory for such vehicles, which will be tracked in real-time, to get a separate registration certificate from the civic bodies for operations.Documents accessed by HT showed that the policy was approved by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Thursday and an order making the rules public is likely to be issued this week by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The move comes at a time when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday issued notices to several central and state government agencies in the Capital for not adhering to rules related to construction, demolition and disposal of debris or “malba”.‘Sanitation crisis ahead if AAP dues remain unpaid’: Delhi’s mayorsA senior official in the DPCC who requested anonymity said the policy is a targeted step towards reducing pollution. “As on date, Delhi has no mechanism to take action against the owner/person responsible for dumping debris at unauthorised places. Also, there is no monitoring system in place to track the vehicles being used to collect and dump C&D waste. Most of these polluting vehicles are diesel trucks,” the official said.The directions, once issued, will also allow only CNG fuel-based goods vehicles to be registered for this purpose. Even the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has been asked to “immediately’ discontinue the use of tractor based septage waste collection trucks as it was found to be in contravention of the Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules, the documents read.Six AAP MLAs detained ahead of protest outside Amit Shah, L-G’s residences“Any motor vehicle proposed to be used for the purpose of collection and disposal of C&D waste in Delhi will require registration from the civic agencies in the area under whose jurisdiction it is proposed to be operated. Any goods vehicle proposed to be used for carrying C&D waste will have to be fitted with a GPS monitoring system from an authorised vendor of the transport department. The feed of GPS will be received at the joint control room of the MCDs for proper monitoring. There shall be live tracking of all vehicles used for this purpose,” it stated.The rules have been drafted by a “working group” constituted by the chief secretary on September 30 this year. The committee is headed by secretary-cum-commissioner (transport) Manisha Saxena and comprises officials from the Public Works Department, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, DJB and state transport and urban development departments as members.“The committee observed that often these vehicles dump the waste along roadsides during the wee hours of the night. The MCDs are likely to charge a nominal fee to issue the registration certificates to these vehicles that will be approved only after a GPS device is fitted and a camera installed at the back,” an EDMC official said.The officers of junior engineers ranks and above in MCDs and PWD, and the officers of the rank of assistant sub-inspector of the transport department have been authorised to impose fines on defaulting vehicle owners under these directions. The penalty for any violation will be Rs 20,000 in the first instance, extending up to ₹1 lakh under the Environment Protection Act. Vehicle permits will be liable to be suspended or cancelled after three successive violations, the draft order read.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) called the upcoming rules “an important step towards eliminating illegal dumping of C&D waste that causes pollution as well as environmental damage.”“Electronic monitoring of trucks carrying C&D, proper registration of trucks, centralised monitoring, geo-fencing of operations, and high penalties are important to control illegal littering and promote an efficient collection of waste for recycling and material recovery,” she said. She, however, pointed out that this should be supported by an adequately dense network of collection points to reduce distances from construction sites. Delhi has over 168 designated sites for the dumping of C&D waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-mandates-gps-devices-cameras-for-vehicles-carrying-construction-waste/story-qYbPwdhzW2hanKmFIegTCM.html

Police say have registered a case and are probing the accident.Police identified the dead man as Ankur Chanana, who was a manager at a private bank.According to the police, the accident was reported around 3.15am on Sunday near Keshopur Mandi flyover in Bhupender Nagar. The police found two cars — a Honda City and another Hyundai Verna — that were involved in the accident. “Upon enquiry, we found that the Honda City car was speeding and it rammed the other car from behind. In the accident, the Honda City car driver, identified as Ankur Chanana, a resident of Rohini, working as a manager at a private bank in Moti Nagar, was critically injured. He was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital by the occupants of the other car, where the doctors pronounced him dead,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit.Police said they shifted the body to the mortuary of DDU Hospital for a postmortem examination and informed his family members.

14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt plans to infuse funds for pending priority work||The Delhi government has asked all departments to prepare a list of priority projects lying unfinished due to the lack funds on the back of the pandemic, said a senior government official. The official added that the government was planning to draft a proposal to sanction funds for these projects and table it before the cabinet for approval.Two projects on the government’s priority list are installing CCTV cameras and connecting Ashram flyover with the DND flyway.The CCTV initiative is a flagship project of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. The project was divided into two phases with 140,000 cameras in each phase across all 70 assembly constituencies in the city. While the first phase was completed last year, the second phase was supposed to start after the Delhi elections (February 2020) but could not take off because of the Covid-19 pandemic, said the senior official.The other project – connecting Ashram flyover with the DND flyway – was aimed at reducing traffic snarls in the area. It was announced on December 5 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.“There are several priority pending projects of the Delhi government which got stuck due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They include the Ashram flyover-DND and CCTV projects. The Delhi government is likely to bring a proposal to finish all these projects. Right now, the government has asked all the departments to send a proposal for the pending priority projects. Once the list is ready, the government would take a re-look at the budget. Currently, it is expected to be something around Rs 900 crore. But the estimates can change,” said the official.“The Delhi government was forced to cut its expenses. But it has also realised that there are some projects which needed to be finished as early as possible. The proposal is in the planning stage. It is likely that this proposal will be developed this month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-look-into-pending-priority-projects-infuse-funds/story-tdJcAX3Kxl8LpnGovIcYAM.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Not making the cut: How coronavirus killed tailoring||Grover Tailors in Delhi’s Khan Market stitched suits for former US presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton, and Brazil president Jair Messias Bolsonaro when they came to India.For other customers, their waiting time to get their measurements taken is usually hours, and a month for delivery.Grover Tailors specialises in bespoke suits. For the uninitiated, the essence of a ‘bespoke’ suit lies in the process -- from detailed measurements to creating a unique pattern, each suit is handcrafted after several fitments. It’s considered a craft.Railways innovates, makes side berths comfortableBut the pandemic has left the passionate purveyor of bespoke suits with little business. “Our business is down by 80%,” says Bobby Grover, who runs the shop with father OP Grover. With business and leisure travel, weddings, anniversary celebrations, graduation ceremonies curtailed or cancelled, and with many working from home (in sweatpants rather than suits), people have little reason to dress up. “Looks like most of our clients see no reason to wear suits. We had 35 people working with us, but only 12 are left. The tailors in the city’s high streets such Khan Market and Connaught Place are the most affected by the pandemic,” says Grover. Flamenco artist encourages people back into theatres with jazz dance, salsa and musicIf Savile Row in London is the Mecca of tailoring where the rich and famous from across the world have been going for over 200 years to get their suits stitched, Connaught Place (CP) in Delhi once used to be India’s Savile Row. It used to be home to legendary tailors such as Ranken & Company, Trevillion & Clark (both were run by Britishers), Md Omar & Sons, and S.C. Sharma & Company. While over the years many of these firms have closed, CP still has some true bespoke tailors from the old days whose suits would cost anything from Rs 40, 000 to Rs 4 lakh. These suave, English-speaking tailors, many of who learnt their craft in London, say they survived the ready-made revolution in the 1990s and the 2008 financial crisis—but the pandemic has pushed them to the brink. Take, for example, Vaish at Rivoli. Established in 1940, the shop boasts clients as Maharaja of Jaipur, Maharaja of Rampur, BR Ambedkar, among others. It is Friday afternoon and the shop has no customers – the business, says Sachin Vaish, who runs the shop with his father Ashok Vaish is down 70% compared to last year. “This has not happened in the 80 years we have been in business. Most of our clients are well-travelled corporate executives, lawyers and doctors, who appreciate a bespoke suit. Most have not turned up this year,” says Sachin Vaish. The ongoing wedding season too has not helped. “Before the pandemic, we used to make as many as 25 suits for a wedding, but now weddings are a low-key affair, and we do not have such large orders. It is some of our old clients who love wearing new clothes that have sustained us,” says Vaish who, like his father and grandfather learnt tailoring at Savile Row. Many top tailors tried to work remotely—Grover, for example, took measurements of some clients, with the help of their family, and Sachin Vaish tried out a body measurement app. “But the software has a long way to go before they can become useful to bespoke tailors. We require 35-40 odd measurements and need to understand differences in the client’s body shape and posture. This can’t be done virtually yet,” says Vaish. But it is not just the high street tailors that have been affected. Mohan Singh Place, one of the city’s well- known tailoring destinations with about 70 tailors, and Shankar market in CP, which has about 40 big and small ladies’ tailors, are desolate places these days. As one enters the dimly-lit Mohan Singh Place, one sees dozens of heavy rolls of denim and other clothes at the entrance of each shop on different floors. But the sewing machines are all silent. Set up in 1969, Mohan Singh Place, perhaps the city’s first mall, once known for its fruit and imported goods shops, had by the 1990s become denim heaven, with one tailor stitching as many as 50 jeans a day. The business took a hit in the mid-1990s with the arrival of ready-made denim brands. “But even then our business never suffered this much because we could make a pair of jeans at a much lower price in two hours, “ says Naresh Verma, president, Mohan Singh Place Traders Association. Rajesh Verma, who runs HL Tailors and Drapers in the market, was busy watching a video on his mobile phone on Friday afternoon. “This is what I do these days to pass time,” he says. “The pandemic has altered people’s priorities. Clothes seem to have slipped down that list. It has changed how people thought about dress, and has done away with the existing dress codes,” adds Verma seeking to throw light on the social-psychological aspect of the people’s current disinterest in sartorial indulgences. Not far away in Shankar Market, one of the city’s biggest tailoring hubs for women, Mohammad Arshad, a tailor has been desperately calling his clients. “This is a peak season and I used to make about 15 women’s suits a day before the pandemic, but have made only one suit in the past week. Our clients are women mostly in their late 40s and 50s, and a lot of them do not want to venture out as yet, at least not for visiting their tailor, ” says Arshad. It’s not just Arshad’s shop but the entire market -- which came up in 1957 and has 110 shops and 54 stalls that are mostly in the cloth and tailoring business for women --- is deserted. “Most of my employees have gone home as there is no work,” says Mohammad Javed who runs a tailoring shop in the market.“ I am already thinking of doing something else.” “The next two years are going to be tough. We hope this business of online meetings in casuals will not go on forever. What gives me hope is that human beings like to pamper themselves with new clothes. They will eventually return,” says Vaish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/not-making-the-cut-how-the-coronavirus-crisis-killed-tailors-business/story-sVhfKNVacCLtANIdAeabGO.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal urges nation to go on a day’s hunger strike||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and people across the country to observe a day’s fast on Monday to show solidarity with groups of protesting farmers, who too will go on a hunger strike on that day.Kejriwal also urged the Central government to roll back the three contentious farm laws – which have triggered the protests — that were passed by the Parliament in September, and demanded a new Bill to ensure minimum support prices (MSP) for farmers be drafted at the earliest.Delhi-Jaipur highway partially opened amid farmers’ protest“I request all party (AAP) supporters and people across the country to observe fast for a day tomorrow (Monday) in solidarity with protesting farmers. I shall be observing a day’s fast too… Let’s support our farmers from our homes. I understand that it is not possible for many of us to be physically present at the (state) border points where the protesting farmer groups have gathered,” said the chief minister, in a video press briefing on Sunday.Key farmer leader favours talks, says ‘goalposts shifted’He further said, “In the last few days, I have seen several ministers and BJP leaders calling the protesting farmers anti-national. I have a question for them: So many ex-servicemen, sports persons, artistes, doctors, lawyers, businessmen have been supporting the protests in some way or other – are they all anti-national? During the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011, the Congress had done similar things to bring disrepute to the movement. The BJP is doing the same thing now.”Sanitation crisis amid Covid? Civic body leaders seek funds from Delhi govt“Some people claim that only few farmers from Punjab and Haryana are at the protest. It is their misconception…The new laws make hoarding legal. It will lead to inflation… I urge the Central government to leave behind their ego, roll back the three laws and prepare a new bill to ensure minimum support price for farmers,” said Kejriwal.Both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, however, dismissed Kejriwal’s allegations.BJP leader Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is also the leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said: “These are all baseless allegations. Which minister has ever said anything demeaning about farmers? Instead of doing such cheap politics, Arvind Kejriwal should focus on helping farmers in Delhi who are distressed because of road tax on tractors, high power bill charged on irrigation lines, no subsidies and not being able to get MSP on crops.”Mudit Agarwal, vice-president of Delhi Congress, said: “Arvind Kejriwal is twisting facts. He should first explain why his government notified one of the contentious laws, while the AAP is claiming to be in support of farmers. At one point, he wanted farmers to gather in Burari ground – much in lines with the plans of the BJP. As far as the Anna Hazare movement is concerned, it was Kejriwal who took support of the RSS politically. What happened to the Jan Lokpal Bill for Delhi? On the ongoing farmer’s issue, the Congress stands with the farmers of India. We demand that the three laws be repealed.”Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai had said that several supporters of the party too would participate in a hunger strike in solidarity with farmers and stage peaceful demonstrations across Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-asks-party-workers-nation-to-fast-for-a-day-to-support-farmers/story-pJMCw1En2pjNjZo0JO3VtJ.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||At Singhu border, banners ask protesters to uphold dignity of stir||Several banners came up on Sunday at the farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border requesting protesters not to indulge in any kind of “inappropriate activity” and to uphold the “dignity” of the movement.The move comes after a section of protesters at another protest site, the Tikri border, on Thursday, had held up posters demanding the release of political activists and intellectuals like Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Sudha Bharadwaj and Anand Teltumbde. While Khalid and Imam were arrested for their alleged involvement in the Delhi riots, Bharadwaj and Teltumbde were arrested in connection with the Elgar Parishad case and Bhima-Koregaon case, respectively.Pictures of these posters that went viral on social media had some people alleging that the farmers’ protest against the central government’s farm laws had been “hijacked”.On Sunday, one banner put up by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha -- a grouping of around 500 farmer organisations -- stated, “This is a peaceful and non-violent protest led by the farmers. We request everyone not to indulge in any inappropriate activity and do not raise provocative slogans.”Another banner read, “The farmers are conducting peaceful protests in different parts of the country. Kindly cooperate with them to uphold the dignity of their movement. They (farmers) are innocent and responsible for providing food to the nation.”A poster at the protest site read: “We do not know who is Umar Khalid, who is Sharjeel. Mr. Modi, we are farmers. Repeal our death warrant.”Kulwant Singh Sandhu, 65, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, and among the 35 farmer leaders holding talks with the Center, said, “The banners were put up on to make it clear that we, the protesting farmers, have nothing to do with what had happened at the Tikri border. We are here for a cause and that’s related to farmers only. We have not allowed any political, ideological, or religious leaders to use our protest from day one. And we are being portrayed in a negative light because of some people. We can’t allow this.”Farmer leaders said that they were also keeping a watch on posters that were coming up.For instance, on Sunday, protesters asked a group of poster-carrying students, reportedly from Jamia Millia Islamia, to leave from Ghazipur protest site. “They had come there to extend support to farmers but they were clearly told that this was a farmers-only protest. They left soon after,” said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Tikait faction in UP, adding the protesters need to remain vigilant of “mischievous elements” among them.Protesters said they were disappointed at statements saying their movement had been “hijacked by the Left Maoists elements”. Surinder Kaur, 70, a farmer from Shahabana in Ludhiana, said, “The people of my village have been fighting for the rights of farmers for years.We don’t know who are Maoists or leftists. We are simple people who work hard for a living.”Agitating farmers also said that they were unnecessarily targeted for eating “pizza” or having “foot massagers” at the protest site. “Each and every ingredient used to make pizza is being produced by farmers starting from its base. Why can’t we eat it? There is a section of people who are just trying to trivialise our movement by unnecessarily criticing us,” said Harjeet Singh, 32, a farmer from Tarn Taran in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-singhu-banners-ask-protesters-to-uphold-dignity-of-movement/story-zYfp83Hxrk70qmdheVbj8O.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Traffic respite as highway on Chilla border reopened||Farmers protesting at the Chila border, which connects Delhi and Noida, on Sunday cleared the highway they had occupied for 12 days, allowing police to restore traffic between the two cities. The carriageway, which, goes to Delhi from Noida through the Chila border, had been shut since December 1 by farmer groups from Uttar Pradesh, and was opened early on Sunday, owing to “problems caused to commuters”, according to farmer’s union leaders. However, they said a group of farmers has stayed back and began an indefinite hunger strike as part of their agitations against the three contentious farm bills. Farm leader: Shah agreed not consulting farmers a mistakeMeanwhile, only one carriageway stayed open for traffic on the Delhi-Meerut expressway in Ghazipur, while seven other borders — Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in the outer and south-western parts of the city — were shut entirely.Satish Tomar, in-charge of the IT cell of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said “Police and senior officers requested us to clear the road... Our leaders took a decision, and keeping in mind the problems caused to the commuters and locals, we have cleared both the roads. We, along with police personnel, together removed the barricades and reopened the road.”Key farmer leader favours talks, says ‘goalposts shifted’Tomar said 15-20 farmers, led by their state president, have stayed back for the hunger strike.Farmers have continued to occupy a lane near the central verge at the Gautam Buddha Dwar, on the Delhi-Noida border, slowing traffic moving towards Delhi from Noida.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said, “While traffic moving from Delhi to Noida is smooth as usual, incoming traffic is slow as the farmers continue to block a portion of the road. Sufficient security personnel have been deployed at the border to maintain law and order,” Singh said.At the Ghazipur border, traffic on the Delhi-Meerut expressway carriageway connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad remained unhindered, while the other continued to be completely blocked. The service lane on NH-24 that has been blocked since November 27, also remained closed for traffic on Sunday.Meanwhile, the Delhi traffic police continued to issue traffic advisories on its social media accounts.In one of its tweets early Sunday morning, after the Chila birder was opened, police said, “The Gazipur borders is closed for traffic from Noida & Gaziabad to Delhi due to farmers protests.People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via chilla, Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara & bhopra borders.”In another tweet, advising commuters to take the diverted routes to avoid snarls, police said, “Available open borders to Haryana are the following -- Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chila-border-delhi-noida-road-reopened-after-farmers-clear-out/story-HEg5QXA10KSeXKEFnLj9EO.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers to fast for a day, gathering at Singhu swells||The farmers’ unions, leading protests at the borders of the national capital against the three new farm laws, on Sunday announced that the leaders of all farmer organisations will observe a day-long hunger strike on Monday (December 14) as part of their ongoing agitation. The farmers said that protests will also be held in other parts of the country.Addressing a press conference at Singhu border on Sunday evening, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said that the hunger strike will be held between 8 am to 5 pm. “The leaders of all farmers associations protesting against the new farm laws will observe a hunger strike on Monday demanding complete repeal of the laws. They will observe the strike from their respective places. Besides, dharnas will be held at all district headquarters across the country on Monday,” he said.Govt made record payments under MGNREGS this yearThe unions also disassociated themselves from a delegation of farmers from Uttarakhand, who met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday and extended their support to the three new laws. “Those who met the minister have nothing to do with farming. Some of the farmers who were present in the meeting have other businesses too. They have been brought here from Uttarakhand by a political leader,” said another farmer leader Jasbir Singh.On Sunday, the protests continued across Delhi borders with more farmers joining the stir at Singhu. Among those who had arrived on Sunday, was a group of 40 people, including 15 women, from Ludhiana. Hargovind Singh, 50, said, “Many people from our village and neighbouring villages are already here participating in the protest. We also wanted to be a part of this historic fight for our rights. We saw many trucks and trolleys heading towards Delhi on the way.”Earlier in the day, around 10 trolleys, from Jalandhar, Amritsar and Kapurthalan, also managed to come a little ahead of the space where the farmers are sitting.Kejriwal asks party workers, nation to fast for a day to support farmersJugraaj Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar, said, “The number of protesters are increasing day by day and hence we have to expand the space here. That’s why some of us tried to move forward.” However, they were stopped by the police near the petrol pump and heavy barricading was done to restrict any further movement. Jitender Kumar Meena, additional deputy commissioner of police, said some trucks and tractors of the farmers camping at Singhu border had returned back and some new groups in trucks and tractors arrived at Singhu late on Saturday night and Sunday morning. “These farmers have joined the protest. We continue to maintain adequate arrangement in place. The situation has been peaceful,” he said.Chila border: Delhi-Noida road reopened after farmers clear outThe protesters were seen shouting slogans against the government, singing songs, taking out marches with posters and banners, and attending speeches delivered from the stage, throughout the day at the borders. A group of supporters visiting Singhu border on Sunday, including Harpreet Singh, a class 11 student at a private school in Ramesh Nagar, were seen cleaning the protest site. “Thousands of people are visiting here everyday and there is no limit of food being distributed to everyone here that’s why there’s so much garbage. It’s not good for the health of protesters. So, as I decided to pick plastic waste and bottles as my contribution to the protest,” he said.A group of artists from Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) were also seen making posters and banners in support of farmers at the border on Sunday. Manish, a member of the group, said, “If there will be no farmers, there won’t be any food or any future.”The protest site at the Ghazipur border remained peaceful on Sunday with the farmer groups spending most of their day delivering speeches, raising slogans against the newly passed farm bills, and cooking and distributing food at langars. As the number of farmers at Ghazipur on Sunday remained limited, those camping at the border said that many other groups from different parts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are on their way to join the agitation. “From here, our agitation will only strengthen. More farmer brothers are on their way to join us and strengthen the movement. Our stand has been clear since day one that we want the law to be repealed,” said Rajender Kumar, a farmer from Bulandshahr.Police deployment also remained adequate on Sunday at Ghazipur border with senior police officers taking stock of the situation. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said they are continuously monitoring the situation. “Our forces, along with UP police as well as the paramilitary personnel, are deployed in the area. Farmers are continuing their protests peacefully,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-to-fast-for-a-day-to-protest-against-the-new-laws/story-3CBkwy88qSH8WeqAUVPI5I.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||After niggling troubles, DU students to get an extra hour to upload scripts||Delhi University (DU) officials on Sunday said second and third-year students appearing in the ongoing online open-book exams (OBE) will be allowed an extra hour to submit their answer scripts should they need it, after niggling troubles plagued examinees on the first day of the tests. Earlier, students were allowed four hours to download the question paper, complete the exam, and upload the answer script. Now, students will have five hours to complete the entire process. The second set of open-book exams will be held on Monday, when the order comes into effect.Sunday’s announcement comes after several students, on the first day of the exams on Saturday, complained of troubles while uploading answer scripts. However, the notification ratifying the move, also specified that students who make use of the additional time will need to prove they were unable to submit their scripts within the first four hours, and will need to upload screenshots of the delays or errors.“Screenshots of the failure in uploading answer sheets are recorded by the students after making four-five attempts by way of taking screenshots of the screen and submitting along with the script and saving all such records,” DU dean of examinations DS Rawat said in the notification issued on Sunday. In the event that students are still unable to upload the answer script within five hours, the University has allowed them to mail their papers to the nodal officers of their respective colleges. The email should be sent within 10 minutes of the five-hours elapsing, and students will have to send screenshots of failed attempts to upload the answer on the portal.“Emails sent by students prior to the completion of five hours shall not be accepted,” the notification added. The University has warned students of a possible delay in the results of exams for which answer scripts are sent over mail. “Answer scripts submitted through email in such exceptional cases would entail a delay in result declaration as happened during OBE-1 unlike the answer scripts submitted through online OBE portal,” Rawat said in the notification.The varsity’s decision to conduct OBE as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic was met with staunch opposition from several students and faculty members. Despite this, these exams were held for the university’s 260,000 final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students between August 10 and 31. Several final-year UG students had alleged a delay in the announcement of results and also reported errors in their results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-students-to-get-an-extra-hour-to-submit-online-open-book-exams-answer-scripts/story-3OdxXbpN0wUu7A0KkdLxiI.html
14-12-2020||Mumbai||Personal finance: Investing in times of Covid-19||Covid-19 pandemic has made us feel uncertain about many things; most indicators suggest that the economy has bottomed out and the jury is still out about its recovery. When the stock market crashed between February 20 and April 7 (many referred to this as the coronavirus crash) several people took their money out of equity mutual funds to invest in fixed deposits (FD), ignoring the long-term prospect of wealth creation that corrections allow. The predisposition towards capital protection and income certainty pushes more people to lock away their money in FDs even though interest rates have fallen sharply in the past year. However, not all FDs are the same.FDs are great financial instruments to invest in. But not all FDs are the same nor is it beneficial to invest in them for long periods. Though deemed the safest among all investments, it makes sense to check the pros and cons before buying one. Here are a few things to keep in mind.Go for scheduled banks Scheduled banks work as per the rules mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). People flock to scheduled public sector and major private banks for their FDs and avoid non-scheduled banks like private or small finance banks, even though they may offer high slab rates. However, with amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, co-operative banks are now under the supervision of the RBI. “The amendments are expected to facilitate the making of reconstruction or amalgamation schemes. Earlier, the RBI introduced exposure limits, mandating reporting of large exposures to the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits. These steps are expected to improve the governance situation that ails several co-operative banks,” Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer, BankBazaar, an online market place for financial products and check the credit score, said. As the funds are insured separately, deposits of up to ₹5 lakh are covered in case of a collapse.Avoid investing for long periods of timeThe slowdown in the economy has caused market interest rates to fall. However, with anticipated economic revival, credit demand is expected to increase post-pandemic, thus prompting a rise in market rates. Opening FDs for a long tenure now may lock your FDs with low-interest rates for a long time, said Sahil Arora, director, Paisabazaar.com, which provides virtual debt syndication services plus business support system of banks and financial institution. Instead, he advises depositors to invest in shorter duration FDs. “Depositors should prefer FD tenures of one to two years even if they have financial goals of longer time horizons. This will allow them to re-invest their FDs at higher rates later, as and when the interest-rate cycle turns, without resorting to premature withdrawals,” he said. Besides, investors have to pay penalty ranging between 0.5 and 1% of the interest amount if they withdraw the money prior to the maturity date.Taxable elementsMany FD investors believe that their tax liability ends with payment of Tax Deducted at Source. However, the income earned as interest on the FDs is taxable barring the interest income up to ₹50,000 earned by senior citizens. Suresh Sadagopan, founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories, a professional financial planning and wealth advisory firm, said, “Most people only look at gross returns and not post-tax returns. FDs attract tax at one’s income slab rates and one must factor this before deciding to invest.” Archit Gupta, founder of ClearTax, an online e-Filing website said that factoring income tax liability is important. “The interest earned on FDs is added to your overall income and taxed at the income tax slab rate you fall under. This is of a great disadvantage if you fall in the highest tax bracket,” he said.FDs are an essential component of an investment portfolio. There is no right time to put aside money in FDs, which means that you can always allocate a portion of your savings in them. However, do not put all your money in FDs as they are other financial instruments that can help grow and save your money.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/investing-in-times-of-covid-19/story-vsW5PSLTaLCuVSoZZuSJNO.html
14-12-2020||Delhi||‘Sanitation crisis ahead if AAP dues remain unpaid’: Delhi’s mayors||Delhi’s mayors, who are protesting outside the residence of Delhi chief minister, on Sunday said if the government does not pay the money it owes to the three municipal corporations, it may lead to a sanitation crisis in the Capital with their staff threatening to go on strike. The mayors of the three civic bodies have been sitting outside the CM’s house for the past seven days, demanding funds as per the recommendations of the Delhi finance commissions. They claim the bodies do not have funds to pay their staff and it may lead to protests and strike. However, the government has maintained it does not owe any money to the civic bodies. North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said, “The three corporations have 70,000 sanitation staff, and we lift close to 10,000 metric tonnes of waste and 100 metric tonnes of biomedical waste. But we have not been able to pay them on time. Does the AAP government want a sanitation crisis in the midst of a pandemic... Our sanitation and medical staff will go on strike if we don’t release their salaries.”Sanitation crisis amid Covid? Civic body leaders seek funds from Delhi govt The North MCD mayor also refuted allegations that Rs 2,400 crore was misappropriated by the north body, an inquiry into which has been ordered by the Delhi government. “They (Delhi government) are levelling baseless allegations. We want them to complete the inquiry in the next seven days and if any misappropriation of funds is found, I will resign. But if they will not be able to establish any misappropriation, then Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should resign,” said Prakash. The mayors also said that despite the fact that they were sitting outside the CM’s house in protest, the government has not initiated a dialogue. Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), said, “We have been sitting here for the past seven days and the CM is not concerned. He has not even called us for a meeting. They are just playing politics at a time when we all need to work together.” The AAP called the protest by the mayors an attempt by the BJP to divert the attention from the ongoing protest by the farmers on Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws that seek to open up agricultural trade. On Friday, the AAP government had ordered an inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of over ₹2,400 crore by the North MCD. AAP leaders also demanded a CBI inquiry into it. South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh said they will not leave the protest site till the funds were released. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “In a democracy, state governments have to listen to the concerns of municipal corporations despite political differences. The mayors are sitting outside the CM’s residence for the employees and not for themselves. The least Kejriwal can do is to listen to their concern.” The AAP said the BJP-ruled corporations were interested in only harassing Arvind Kejriwal. “Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCDs know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests. The mayors are well aware that Delhi government has given all the funds due and it is because of their corruption and inefficiency that the MCDs are facing financial ruin. Since they have decided to only protest rather than govern, it is best they resign and let AAP run the MCDs. We will run the MCDs efficiently and within the same budget,” the party said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/will-resign-if-probe-finds-misappropriation-else-cm-should-quit-north-mcd-mayor/story-TcRztCD9iBUWlhFEXiQYlO.html
14-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers’ protest holds up traffic from Gurugram to interstate border on Delhi-Jaipur highway||Over 500 farmers from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana and members of trade unions on Sunday morning blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway at the Shahjahanpur interstate border in Rajasthan as the police did not let them enter Haryana. Hundreds of commuters were stuck on both carriageways of the highway for around five hours, before the police removed the barricades and let commuters move towards Delhi, and then towards Jaipur.The border remained heavily congested between 1pm and 6pm, while the movement of vehicles remained slow on the entire 86-kilometre stretch, from the Sirhaul border in Gurugram till Shahjahanpur, due to a five-layer police deployment at each traffic junction. Heavy police deployment was seen at Sirhaul, Bilaspur, Panchgaon, Manesar, Sidhrawali, Bawal, Rewari and Bhiwadi.Various farmers’ organisations in Rajasthan and Haryana had joined the agitation on the call of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee and had started gathering at the Shahjahanpur border, in Alwar district, on Sunday morning.The protesting farmers staged a dharna at the border point, on the service lane of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway, as the police stopped them from proceeding towards Delhi. The protesters said they are expecting more farmers to join them on Monday to march towards Delhi, even if the police take action against them.A large number of protesters were seen camping on the service roads during the day. However, many of the protesters returned to their homes in adjoining villages and will return on Monday to resume the protests, said farm leaders.A large contingent of police personnel was deployed at the border and jersey barriers were used to create barricades on the stretch. Although no violence was reported, the police said they will deploy teams during the night as well, as a precautionary measure, to ensure that farmers do not cross the stretch.Swaraj India leader and political activist Yogendra Yadav joined the protesters at Shahjahanpur on Sunday morning. He addressed the farmers and said that if they are not allowed to cross the border, they will sit on dharna on the road, in support of the farmers. “We want to join the farmers in Delhi, but we are not allowed to cross Gurugram, due to which we will extend our support sitting here,” he said.Farmers from Rajasthan had gathered at Kotputli and Behror early morning and had marched till Shahjahanpur border. Yadav said that their plan is to join the farmers who are protesting at Tikri and Singhu borders in Delhi.Hannan Mollah, CPI(M) politburo member and general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, and Medha Patkar, the founder-member of Narmada Bachao Andolan, a people’s movement, were also seen addressing farmers.“The farmers have reached Delhi and others are trying to tell the government that these farm acts are not wanted by them and that they never demanded it,” said Mollah.As a preventive step, the Haryana and Rajasthan administrations sealed all their major borders and imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Apart from the police, personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) were also deployed at the border.“The police personnel at all borders are equipped with water cannons, cranes, JCBs and anti-riot equipment to control the situation if any untoward incident is reported. We have stationed teams at all major intersections and routes connecting to other districts and villages across the national highway to stop farmers from entering Gurugram jurisdiction,” said Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar).Commuters who were driving to Jaipur tried to take a U-turn due to the traffic situation but faced difficulties due to the dividers on the highway. Many commuters helped each other and made temporary arrangements with help of bricks and mud to create a makeshift bridge to take a U-turn. “We left Gurugram around 11am and the route was clear. Upon reaching Bawal, we got stuck in traffic and for the last four hours, we have not even moved two kilometres. My twin daughters are not keeping well and my father is seriously ill, and we were travelling to Jaipur to meet him. We will have to return to Gurugram due to the current situation, as we don’t know if there would be more blockades on the stretch,” said Nikhil Kumar a resident of Sector 45 in Gurugram.Another family of three members was stuck for more than three hours due to the congestion. “It is only after reaching Bawal that we saw the protest. The farmers should not block the highway. Instead, they should protest on service lanes so that commuters do not face inconvenience. It is so inconvenient for the women, who all are dressed up for a wedding,” said Rahul Ahuja, a businessman from Panipat, who was going to Jaipur to attend a wedding.Commuters on both sides were using only one carriageway, which led to traffic congestion. The police intervened to create a passage.The move by farmers’ union to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway comes amid protests by thousands of farmers for the last 17 days at various other border points of the national capital, including Singhu and Tikri, against the farm laws that were passed during the monsoon session of the Parliament.The Gurugram police had deployed more than 2,300 personnel on the stretch. The police had blocked the expressway starting at Bilaspur and diverted traffic through the service lane. The barricades were removed in the evening, around 5pm, by which time the number of protesters had also dwindled to around 100 farmers at the spot.Rashid Ahmad, a social activist and lawyer from Nuh, said more than 400 people from Nuh have taken part in this protest and will march towards Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-protest-holds-up-traffic-from-gurugram-to-interstate-border-on-delhi-jaipur-highway/story-yob4K9eQ2KFy730KzxaBgM.html

The four involved in the attack are under arrest.“When we heard about the incident it shocked us and we are worried that many of the members of our senior citizen groups stay alone at home. We decided to create an alert and accordingly a message was sent to all our group members. Often elderly people who are in need of help appoint a caretaker without any proper enquiry. This is risky for them and police verification is necessary, so we have now told all our members to be extra cautious while keeping a caretaker or domestic help,” said Kalapana B, president of Subhashnagar Senior Citizens group. In the Kothrud case, the couple’s son stays in USA and daughter stays in Bavdhan. Both were living alone. Taking advantage of it a caretaker was appointed and later on it was found that he was involved in the robbery. Sudhir Purandare, a senior citizen from Sahakarnagar, said, “Me and my wife stay alone in a big bungalow and we have two caretakers working at house.

Discussions are going on about starting of other passengers trains.” “There are thousands of people working in emergency services between Daund and Pune - like government offices, banks, the police department, blood banks, hospitals and several other services. The number of passengers travelling between the cities 10,000, so it is necessary that the shuttle DEMU train service be started immediately,” said Vikas Deshpande, secretary, Daund-Pune-Daund Pravasi Sangh. The DEMU train service between Pune and Daund, inaugurated in March, 2017, by the then union railway minister Suresh Prabhu, is a 76-km route with 10 halts– Hadapsar, Manjari Budruk, Loni, Uruli Kanchan, Yavat, Khutbao, Kedgaon, Kadethan, Patas and Daund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restrictions-on-unreserved-bookings-for-passenger-trains-eased-pune-daund-shuttle-in-demand/story-bYzSTe5nt09bgicZCQBT7L.html

According to officials, the 2021-22 civic budget will have an allotment of Rs 300 crore for development of these roads. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have observed that the municipal corporation is spending funds on certain roads in old city areas. So, we have decided to focus on developing DP roads and missing links in the coming year. We have estimated an amount for that. At the same time, we have also proposed funds to build a road network for areas recently merged within the PMC limits.” The road department of PMC every year has budget of at least Rs 500 crore.The civic body is in the process of proposing Rs 140 crore for constructing 50 roads in 2021-22 budget.The length of the roads will be around 30km with work consists of widening of existing and developing of missing links. Civic activists have welcomed the move saying most development should now take place in suburbs.Ashish Mane, a civic activist said, “Actually, development of DP roads and missing links should take on a priority. The civic administration has so far focused on the main city areas and spent too much money on redesign and beautification on existing stretches like Jangli Maharaj road and Fergusson College roads. There are suburbs where people want roads. Every citizen is paying tax and s/he has right to get basic facilities like roads. Only some parts of the city have become ‘smart’ and other areas are still waiting for development.” Proposed budget for 11 villages now under PMC limits For the newly merged villages the plan includes development of 23 roads of around 15km. The road department wants Rs 60 core to develop 23 roads here. The department will strengthen and widen roads in the newly merged villages, with laying of storm-water lines culverts and small bridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-rs-300-cr-road-connectivity-plan-to-link-suburbs-with-heart-of-city/story-BX7JWYVlTo6M94IZPakmBI.html

However, not action has been taken so far. “We had petitioned the court on the grounds of illegal and unauthorised construction, after which the court asked the district collector to take action. However, no action has been taken for the past 17 years,” said Kumbhar.Corporator Aba Bagul said, “We are taking steps for reopening of the sports complex. Proper arrangements for release of water from the Ambil Odha during the monsoons need to be done. Tenders for construction of a safety wall along the stream have been sanctioned and the work will begin soon.” Corporator Mahesh Wable said, “The entire structure is in the floodline. Floods have been rampant during past two years .” Social worker Rupesh Ture said, “The problem has been created by the elected representatives who are responsible for the current conditions. The basic issues have remained unsolved till date.” Additional Municipal Commissioner ( Special ) Suresh Jagtap said, “The project has been closed for a long time after some people went to court over some legal issue. Since then it is shut.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-court-order-white-elephant-sits-locked-and-bolted-on-ambil-odha-floodline-for-17-years/story-PoMtX1Q0C6EqNZlPdQzTrI.html
14-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai doctors turn to their hobbies to beat Covid-19 pandemic stress||For doctors working on the frontline, the strain of working through a pandemic has been immense, but it has also led many to find solace in creative pursuits like painting, poetry, dancing, singing and cooking. Dr Kartik Parelkar, 39, an ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgeon with the state-run Sir JJ Hospital, revived his childhood hobby of painting to combat the stress of being on Covid duty. “Being an ENT surgeon, we are the most vulnerable to acquiring the infection while treating a patient,” he said. Dr Parelkar unwinds by painting wildlife scenes. “The colours relax my mind and make me forget the worries. I get lost into the wilderness when I paint the animals,” he said. Dr Anmon Bhargava, 24, is a postgraduate student at the Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (GSMC) (also known as KEM Hospital). Bhargava has set up a recording studio in her hostel room to record songs. “To divert my mind from worries, I started singing when the lockdown was declared in March,” she said. Dr Bhargava mixes her own songs and uploads them to her YouTube channel, which currently has 152 subscribers. “This has turned into my biggest stress buster,” she said.Dr Ganesh Choudhari, 38, an anaesthetic from Solapur, makes humorous comic strips that are inspired by what he sees around him in hospital while on duty. “This not only relaxes my mind after work, but also brings a smile to people’s faces amidst the chaos,” said Dr Choudhari who uploads his comics on Twitter.Dr Harsh Jain, 27, from the medicine department of KEM Hospital has recently started writing poems drawing on his experiences during the pandemic. “One night after a mentally draining day at the hospital, I started writing down my thoughts in the form of poems and gradually, this habit lifted my mood. It is healing,” said Dr Jain.In September, Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of behavioural science and health at University College London in the United Kingdom, published a study that found people who participated in arts-related activities for at least 30 minutes a day reported lower rates of anxiety and depression. City psychiatrists also believe creative activities can be therapeutic. “The simplest form of creativity like gardening, cooking … can cheer [someone] up. It might help soothe some feelings of anxiety and isolation associated with the pandemic,” said psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-turn-to-their-hobbies-to-beat-covid-19-pandemic-stress/story-VlDytIcKsqtwAIDiRpRyqJ.html
14-12-2020||Mumbai||At 64, Mumbai resident clears BA in Economics, Sociology||Nearly half a decade after he passed his senior secondary certificate (SSC) exam, 64-year-old Harish Das, a retired advertising professional from the city cleared his final-year Bachelor of Arts (BA) examination from the University of Mumbai (MU) recently. Das, who cleared his BA exam in Economics and Sociology from the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), went back to academics nearly 36 years after a failed attempt at completing his graduation. “I passed my SSC inter exam as it was called back then in 1972 but could not continue my education due to the circumstances at home. For the next 14 years or so, I continued doing odd jobs until I finally came across a good Samaritan who helped me get a job as a clerk with an advertising firm. In between, I enrolled for BA through IDOL and completed two years but couldn’t complete the third due to my job. Despite not having a graduate degree, through my work and sincerity, I could rise as an advertising consultant and finally retired from my job with an ad agency in 2015,” he said. It was after he retired that Das decided to give himself another chance at academics. “All these years, not having a graduate degree had taken a toll on my self-esteem as wherever I went, people remarked, ‘oh you are not a graduate?’ Even in my professional career, I did not get promotions because I did not have a graduation degree. I was motivated to ace the exam some time or the other,” the Goregaon resident added. Das then enrolled for the course in 2019 and appeared for the examination in October this year, in the online mode due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown. He said he studied on his own with no tutor or coaching as such. “I only used the university notes and my experience, and applied a lot of general knowledge that I had gained over the years while writing my papers,” Das said. As the university declared its results recently, he was elated to find out that he had passed with 42%. “Some said the score is less, but for me, it was a big achievement to do something that I could not do all these years,” he added. Das’s 28-year-old son Tarun, who works as a media director with an ad agency, said that he was proud of his father. “I was also sceptical when he said he wanted to go back to studies. We all know how difficult it is to study when you have professional commitments. But he was determined, and he studied until 2-,3am, while I was working to ensure that he does well in the exam. We are very happy for him,” he added. In the coming days, Das plans to pursue his MA from the university and is determined to work hard. “I know that a degree is not necessarily a certificate of knowledge but, I want to study and be able to say that I have learnt things formally and also teach others to do the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-64-mumbai-resident-clears-ba-in-economics-sociology/story-kjkzKJ8jDqWncwKiL9tRfO.html
14-12-2020||World||Electors meet to affirm Biden’s win; Georgia run-off voting starts||The 538 electors are meeting on Monday to reaffirm President-elect Joe Biden’s 2020 White House victory as early in-person voting began in Georgia for a January special election that will determine which party controls the US Senate for the next two years.The electors will vote separately in their respective states either virtually or in person, in yet another election ritual propelled into public attention because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat, which has now been reaffirmed multiple times by courts, including twice by the Supreme Court.They are committed to vote for the candidate who won their respective states, but “faithless” electors are known to have defected on rare occasions. Ten of them did so in 2016.But they are expected to confirm Biden as the winner by 306-232 electoral college votes as had been projected just days after the close of polling on November 3 and as was certified by states last week in another election ritual getting rare public attention because of Trump’s obduracy.Voters in Georgia, at the same time, started casting their ballots in the January 5 run-off election to elect two US senators. In the fray are incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans. They face Democrats Joe Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.If the Republicans win, their party will retain control of the senate. But if the Democrats win — both of them — their party will take over the upper chamber, completing their hold over Congress as they are already in power in the House of Representatives. And they will be in control of the White House as well, shutting out the Republicans completely.Georgia is a solidly Republican state which, however, voted for Biden in the November 3 presidential election. Trump campaigned there for Perdue and Loeffler earlier this month, but the party fears that his claims of election fraud in the state, as in other swing states that he lost, could discourage Republican voters from showing up for the run-off election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/electors-meet-to-affirm-biden-s-win-georgia-run-off-voting-starts/story-M0LIBPKVwjg71ZtI9CDadN.html
14-12-2020||World||There’s light at end of the tunnel, says first NYC recipient of Covid vaccine||An African American healthcare worker became on Monday the first to get a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in New York, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic, as first doses of the drug were administered to Americans around the country amid much cheering and applause.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel ... I encourage everyone to take the vaccine,” said Sandra Lindsay, a critical care worker, after she was administered a primary shot of the two-dose vaccine at a New York city hospital, as other healthcare workers applauded, joined in by Governor Andrew Cuomo through video link. Many in the African American community are distrustful of vaccines because of a history of racially charged medical experimentations.“First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!” President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet shortly, but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to Lindsay or some other case as first shots of the vaccine began to be administered around the country on Monday. Earlier, he had reversed a White House decision to vaccinate personnel around the president in the first lot. He moved them back to their usual positions in the priority line.Frontline healthcare workers and residents of long-term nursing home facilities have been prioritised by US public health authorities for vaccination, which started Monday following expedited approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech medicine by the drug and food safety regulator and related health surveillance agencies over the weekend. The vaccine’s journey from Pfizer’s manufacturing facility in Michigan was followed breathlessly by news TV crews, for a nation starving for good news. Cameras recorded trucks carrying the vaccines emerging from the facility and cargo flights carrying them from a nearby airport for onward destinations.A local Michigan couple came to the airport to watch the flights take off. That was the stuff of history, like the moon landing, they said.Nearly 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines will be administered at 600 sites around the country immediately, with millions more over the next days.A second vaccine — from Moderna — is on the way as well, and is expected to become available for emergency use through the same expedited process.New York state accounted for more than 35,000 of the nearly 300,000 Americans killed by coronavirus in the United States thus far, according to the Johns Hopkins University. An estimated 65% of the New York deaths were in New York City making it the worst hit in the world. The United States has been the most badly affected in the world with more than 16 million infections and it is undergoing a new surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-s-light-at-end-of-the-tunnel-says-first-nyc-recipient-of-covid-vaccine/story-q1u3Qu4JwJuYLj8NdcdA5L.html
14-12-2020||World||Identical to previous results, Sputnik V stands 91.4% effective against Covid||Russia’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Sputnik V, efficacy stands at 91.4 per cent after the final control point analysis of data procured post 21 days of the first dose, as per the statement. Fresh results from the trial of the vaccine were published by the Russian shot developers on Monday. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Previously, after the second interim data analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial, the vaccine showed the same rate of efficacy in protection against Covid-19, as per the results declared by Gamaleya Center and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on November 24.The Gamaleya Institute along with RDIF released the new data based on a trial on 22,714 volunteers, out of which 78 turned out to be positive for the coronavirus disease. The researchers at the institute said out of 78 cases, 62 confirmed positives had received a placebo. As per the statement, 20 of the volunteers receiving placebo had severe symptoms of Covid-19 while there were no severe cases of the virus in the 16 of the participants who were trialled with the vaccine.The Sputnik V website says more than 50 countries have requested for more than 1.2 billion doses of the vaccine. RDIF, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, had joined hands with India’s leading pharmaceutical company Hetero biologics arm Hetero Biopharma last month to produce around 100 million doses of the world’s first registered vaccine.The developers have also collaborated in India for clinical trials with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. Phase II/III clinical trials have begun in the country after receiving the necessary clearance from Central Drugs Laboratory.“This is another significant step as we continue to collaborate with multiple entities along with the government bodies to fast-track the process for launching the vaccine in India. We are working towards making the vaccine available with a combination of import and indigenous production model,” said G V Prasad, Co-chairman and Managing Director, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. Also Read | Moscow starts mass Covid-19 vaccination with its Sputnik V shotThe Russian vaccine that has got its name from Soviet-era space satellite claims to be unique because it uses two different vectors based on human adenovirus allowing a stronger and longer immune response to the virus in contrast to the vaccine using single and same vector for two doses.“Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so-called “spikes” forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body’s stable immune response,” as per Gamaleya institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/identical-to-previous-results-sputnik-v-stands-91-4-effective-against-covid/story-McZ9j0lJcbJwuyVJnG9lzL.html
14-12-2020||World||First Covid-19 vaccine administered in the US, tweets President Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Monday announced the administration of the first Covid-19 vaccine on Twitter as shipments of frozen vials reached the United States to battle the coronavirus disease. Marking the onset of what will be the largest vaccination campaign in the US history, shots made by Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech are the first authorised for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other countries also have given their nod of acceptance for the vaccine, including the UK, which started vaccinating last week.First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, the first of nearly 3 million doses being shipped in staggered batches this week made their way by truck and by plane around the country Sunday from Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory. Once they arrive at distribution centres, each state directs where the doses go next.Also read: US set for first Covid-19 shots as shipments begin arrivingThe US will vaccinate health care workers first, who along with nursing home residents, have spent months battling a coronavirus that still is surging in the country and around the world. Authorities are expected to rush against time to rapidly get the vaccine into the arms of millions, not just doctors and nurses but other at-risk health workers such as janitors and food handlers — which will be immediately followed by a second dose three weeks later.According to FDA – the world’s most strict medical regulator – the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears safe and strongly protective. The agency has also laid out the data behind it in a daylong public meeting last week for scientists and consumers alike to see. Experts have pointed out that the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches as they rev up people’s immune systems, forcing hospitals to stagger employee vaccinations.(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-vaccine-administered-in-the-us-tweets-president-donald-trump/story-SIdxPEoYwWdpHaeF92HEJM.html
14-12-2020||World||US set for first Covid-19 shots as shipments begin arriving||Hospital workers begin unloading precious frozen vials of Covid-19 vaccine Monday, with the first vaccinations against a scourge that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans expected later in the day.“It feels like the cavalry is arriving,” Robert C. Garrett, CEO of Hackensack Meridian Health, said as New Jersey’s largest health network awaited delivery.Shots made by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech are the first authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration -- beginning what will become the largest vaccination campaign in US history. Several other countries also have OK’d the vaccine, including the UK, which started vaccinating last week.For health care workers who, along with nursing home residents, will be first in line for vaccination, hope is tempered by grief and the sheer exhaustion of months spent battling a coronavirus that still is surging in the US and around the world.“This is mile 24 of a marathon. People are fatigued. But we also recognize that this end is in sight,” said Dr. Chris Dale of Swedish Health Services in Seattle.Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, the first of nearly 3 million doses being shipped in staggered batches this week made their way by truck and by plane around the country Sunday from Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory. Once they arrive at distribution centers, each state directs where the doses go next.Some hospitals across the country spent the weekend tracking their packages, refreshing FedEx and UPS websites for clues.More of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will arrive each week. And later this week, the FDA will decide whether to green light the world’s second rigorously studied Covid-19 vaccine, made by Moderna Inc.Now the hurdle is to rapidly get vaccine into the arms of millions, not just doctors and nurses but other at-risk health workers such as janitors and food handlers — and then deliver a second dose three weeks later.“We’re also in the middle of a surge, and it’s the holidays, and our health care workers have been working at an extraordinary pace,” said Sue Mashni, chief pharmacy officer at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.Plus, the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches as they rev up people’s immune systems, forcing hospitals to stagger employee vaccinations.A wary public will be watching closely to see whether health workers embrace vaccination. Just half of Americans say they want to get vaccinated, while about a quarter don’t and the rest are unsure, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Health Research.The FDA, considered the world’s most strict medical regulator, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears safe and strongly protective -- and laid out the data behind it in a daylong public meeting last week for scientists and consumers alike to see.“Please people, when you look back in a year and you say to yourself, ‘Did I do the right thing?’ I hope you’ll be able to say, ‘Yes, because I looked at the evidence,’” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “People are dying right now. How could you possibly say, ‘Let’s wait and see.’”Still, emergency use means the vaccine was cleared for widespread use before a final study in nearly 44,000 people is complete -- and that research is continuing to try to answer additional questions. While effective against Covid-19 illness, it’s not yet clear if vaccination will stop the symptomless spread that accounts for half of all cases.The shots still must be studied in children, and during pregnancy. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said late Sunday that vaccination should not be withheld from pregnant women who otherwise would qualify.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not to give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-for-first-covid-19-shots-as-shipments-begin-arriving/story-4zjc6kuPXrjkRg3ZDPBfJN.html
14-12-2020||World||Families marry off daughters to ease finances amid Covid-19||The man first caught a glimpse of Marie Kamara as she ran with her friends past his house near the village primary school. Soon after, he proposed to the fifth-grader.“I’m going to school now. I don’t want to get married and stay in the house,” she told him.But the pressures of a global pandemic on this remote corner of Sierra Leone were greater than the wishes of a schoolgirl. Nearby mining operations had slowed with the global economy. Business fell off at her stepfather’s tailoring shop, where outfits he had sewn now gathered dust. The family needed money.Her suitor was a small-scale miner in his mid-20s, but his parents could provide rice for Marie’s four younger sisters and access to their watering hole. They could pay cash.Before long, Marie was seated on a floor mat in a new dress as his family presented hers with 500,000 leones ($50) inside a calabash bowl along with the traditional kola nut.“The day they paid for me was on a Friday and then I went to his house to stay,” she says flatly, adding that at least now she gets to eat something twice a day.Many countries had made progress against such traditional and transactional marriages of girls in recent decades, but Covid-19’s economic havoc has caused significant backsliding: The United Nations estimates that hardships resulting from Covid-19 will drive 13 million more girls to marry before the age of 18.Though most such marriages take place in secret, Save the Children estimates that this year alone, nearly half a million more girls under 18 are at risk of being married off worldwide, most in Africa and Asia, but also in the Middle East. One aid organization said staffers in a remote corner of Sierra Leone overheard a relative offering up a girl as young as 8 for marriage earlier this year. When chastised, the grandmother later denied doing so.In most cases, needy parents receive a dowry for their daughter — a bit of land or livestock that can provide income, or cash and a promise to take over financial responsibility for the young bride. The girl, in turn, takes on the household chores of her husband’s family and often farm work too.In pre-pandemic Jordan, only about 10% of girls were married before the age of 18, a much lower percentage than in Africa or South Asia. The number, though, was greater among Palestinian and Syrian refugees there and they are ever more vulnerable, according to the Girls Not Brides organization.“Sadly, we have seen an increase in child marriage in refugee camps since the beginning of the pandemic as families struggle to cope,” said Tanya Chapuisat, the UNICEF representative for Jordan.India’s harsh lockdown to contain the virus in late March caused millions of impoverished migrants to lose their jobs in cities and many journeyed back to the towns and villages they had left in search of work.With schools closed and pressure on household finances mounting, marrying off young girls has become a more viable option for reducing expenses.The ChildLine India recorded 5,214 early marriages in just four months of lockdown between March and June 2020 across India, considered to be a vast undercount as the majority of cases are not reported, the organization says.In one instance, a 13-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh notified police that her unemployed father intended to forcibly marry her, said officer Narendra Nath Srivastava. The marriage was averted but not before he took 50,000 rupees (about $675) from the boy’s family.“As the money transaction had taken place, the father was arrested because we feared that the poor girl could have been pushed to child trafficking,” the police officer said.Similarly, in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province, child protection services reported 17 child marriages that were stopped or later dissolved in the first 10 months of the year.“It’s a small number compared to reality. We know that,” said Fauzia Masoom, director of Sindh Child Protection Authority.Intervention is only sometimes effective at preventing the marriages, even where they are illegal. In many countries the legal age to marry is 19, often there are loopholes for parental consent that are used in cases of economic need and early pregnancy to blunt social stigma.Child protection authorities in Bangladesh said they received an 8:30 p.m. call back in June warning that a child marriage was to take place within the hour.The girl’s family thought they could use the lockdown to marry off their daughter in secret. As soon as the officials arrived, however, the groom and his family ran away.Authorities counseled the girl’s family on the consequences of early marriage for their daughter — an end to her education and likely a pregnancy before she is ready. The family said they were desperate because the father was out of work due to the Covid-19 crisis, but promised not to have her marry before she becomes an adult.Then they simply waited for officials to leave and held the wedding at two in the morning.—-In Sierra Leone, the rate of marriage under 18 had dropped from 56% in 2006 to 39% in 2017 — a major achievement in the eyes of child protection activists. Then Covid-19 hit, schools closed in March and child marriages accelerated as many village girls who had been attending classes in nearby towns returned home to their parents.It wasn’t clear when or even if school ever would resume and many parents feared their idle daughters would get pregnant out of wedlock, said Isata Dumbaya, who manages reproductive and maternal health for Partners in Health Sierra Leone.“When you marry, your father is no longer responsible for feeding you, for paying your fees or doing anything else for you,” she said. “And if you come from a house with a lot of other children, indeed, this is one less person (to feed).”The willingness to sacrifice a daughter in periods of economic hardship underscores the lives many young girls have in this part of Africa. They are largely seen as household help as children, sent out to gather firewood or water at sunrise, and often the last to be fed at mealtime, until they join their future husbands to perform the same chores and more.Many of the girls’ mothers were themselves married off as teenagers, said Dumbaya, and see early marriage as normal. “They do not see it as harming their children,” she said.It’s a mindset that Sierra Leone’s first lady, Fatima Maada Bio, knows first hand and has been working to change with her “Hands Off Our Girls” campaign since her husband took office in 2018.Bio managed to escape to the United Kingdom as a teenager after learning her father intended to marry her off to someone. A cousin told her father the pair were headed upcountry. Instead, Bio was taken to the airport without his knowledge and did not marry the man chosen for her.She has made it her life’s work to help other underage girls: “Early marriage in all forms is legalized rape,” she told The Associated Press in a recent interview.Sex with underage girls is illegal in Sierra Leone, but it is rarely enforced. Police say cases aren’t reported because the families already have agreed to the marriage whether the brides have or not.While the billboards with the first lady’s image and “Marriage is My Choice; Education is My Right” still line the roadsides, Covid-19 precautions mean the campaign has had to scale back many of its outreach efforts. That means fewer face-to-face meetings with Sierra Leone’s traditional leaders who are known as paramount chiefs, some of whom govern swaths of the country so remote they lack an FM radio signal let alone internet.“Unfortunately when you can’t congregate, you are limited,” she said. “Not everybody here is conversant with technology where you can say, ‘Let’s have a Zoom meeting.’ And even if you have a community meeting, how many people can log in?”As a result of the lack of contact and scrutiny, Sierra Leone’s first lady acknowledges that she does not have a complete picture of the rising rate of child marriages.“I believe that a whole lot of girls would have gone through early marriage silently because movements were restricted and we can’t reach them,” she said.___Sierra Leone closed its borders before the country had registered its first Covid-19 case. As a result, the country has seen only 2,434 confirmed cases and 74 deaths. Only 76 of those cases were confirmed in Kono district, but the economic toll here has brought many families already living on the edge to a breaking point.Underage marriages are now on the rise across ethnic groups and religions, according to interviews with school officials, traditional leaders and the health workers who treat the young and pregnant.The men are always older, though most child brides don’t even know their husbands’ ages. Some don’t even know their own in a country where few have birth certificates. The schoolgirl Marie thought she might be 16, though most of her classmates are 12.Gladys Katingor, a midwife in Koidu, has seen girls as young as 13 come in pregnant, some with husbands old enough to be their grandfathers. The nurses here say some of the youngest ones only develop breasts with their pregnancies.Most of the time since Covid-19 there is not even a marriage ceremony at the local mosque or church: Parents simply accept suitors’ proposals and then deliver their daughters to the groom’s home, paramount chiefs say.And even when the marriage turns violent, the girl is pressured to stay.Kadiatu Mansaray, now 15, says her widowed mother pushed her into marriage during the pandemic because of financial hardship and because the teenager’s prospects for a husband already were considered limited as she had gotten pregnant once before at 12. She can’t be sure just how much money was offered as a bride price: She was crying too hard at the ceremony to see straight.“I was not ready to get married. I wanted to learn something first,” she says.The man had met her while she was washing clothes in a nearby brook in this forested corner near the border with Guinea. The divorce came as swiftly as the marriage.A month after leaving her husband, Kadiatu’s left eye is still blackened from his last beating. Her offense, he said, was sharing their limited food with others.“He told me: ‘We don’t have money to buy food. I asked you not to give food to others and you did anyway.’”Now she’s back in the village with her mother, walking to the closest village of Kombayendeh on market days to sell oranges.Early marriages were happening so often in this part of Sierra Leone that traditional leaders in the Lei chiefdom instituted a new bylaw imposing a 500,000 ($50) fine on anyone having sex with a minor, even if the man is married to the child. Yet local leaders in Kombayendeh can’t recall a single fine being issued.On rare occasions, some teenagers manage to escape early marriage with the help of supportive relatives but that assistance is often temporary.Naomi Mondeh was just 15 and had only finished the fifth grade when her parents said that they could no longer afford her schooling. A man from neighboring Liberia working in the timber trade offered the cash-strapped family a 50-kilogram bag of rice.“They came and told me that someone wants my hand in marriage, and they said: ‘Naomi, you know our situation now. We do not have anything. And there is a man who wants to marry you and help you,’” she recalled. “They told me that if I reject him, they would not take care of me anymore.”Naomi didn’t know his age, or that he already had one wife. Soon she was competing for attention and money with another woman. Her husband often would leave her alone with no money for food. Only through the generosity of neighbors could she eat during his long absences.She complained bitterly to her parents, but her fate was sealed.“They said: ‘Your husband already married you, so you must be patient.’ But I told them that I can’t be patient with this kind of marriage, this type of forced marriage that you put me into, I can’t be patient with it.”Even amidst the rainy season when roads turn to sludge, isolating her village from the rest of the world, Naomi was able to escape in November by motorcycle taxi to Koidu, the largest nearby town, where an aunt was willing to take her in.Only now her parents know where she is. They have told her she can stay while they try to work things out. Naomi is resolute, though, that she is done with her husband and is learning how to become a seamstress.“There is nothing that will make me to return to him again because there will be more suffering for me. I will stand firm to not go back.”___Since many rural areas in Sierra Leone do not have secondary schools, teenage girls often move in with relatives or friends in distant towns to continue their education. Mariama Conteh, who estimates her age at 17 but seems much younger, had left her remote village near the border with Guinea to live with an aunt in Koidu and attend school. Then in April a 28-year-old man in their compound expressed interest in her.It took a month for Mariama to say yes over her aunt’s threats to send her back to her village, where her father is struggling to feed two wives and 10 other children and her mother would be embarrassed by her return.“The people in the village would mock us,” she says. “It would be shameful for me and my mom.”She bursts into uncontrollable sobs when she thinks of the future she once hoped for. Her older sister was able to go on to senior secondary school before she was married, something now completely out of reach for Mariama.“It is what it is,” she says, now 7 months pregnant and soon to put a baby on her back instead of a schoolbag. “It has happened.”Mariama’s husband senses her unhappiness but is enthusiastic about the pregnancy and hopes the baby will be a boy. So does Mariama.If she has a daughter, one thing is certain, she says: “I will not give my child to anybody. I will take care of her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-marry-off-daughters-to-ease-finances-amid-covid-19/story-CQVp3wKpnZTSvRYrfgkJqI.html
14-12-2020||World||London may move into toughest tier of Covid-19 restrictions||London is likely to be placed into the toughest tier of Covid-19 restrictions following a sharp rise in coronavirus infection rates, the BBC reported on Monday, as one of the world’s richest cities struggles to contain the disease.Earlier this month, the government implemented a three-tiered system of restrictions in England to try to keep a second wave of the virus under control following a month-long lockdown. More than 40% of citizens were placed in the highest risk category.However the capital, whose 9 million people and world-leading financial centre make it the engine of the British economy, is currently only in the second highest tier of restrictions.A countrywide review of the tier system is scheduled to take place on Dec. 16, although London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was possible a decision on London could come as early as Monday.“We’ve seen over the last few days a big increase in the virus,” Khan told Sky News.Health secretary Matt Hancock was due to speak in parliament at 1530 GMT.The main difference between the top two tiers is that bars and restaurants, which can stay open under certain conditions in tier two, must close their doors in tier three and can only operate takeaway services.There are also additional restrictions on socialising, but workplaces and schools are told to remain open.Data published last week showed case rates per 100,000 people in London stood at 191.8, putting the city ahead of regions that have stricter rules in place, such as the West Midlands.Based on that data, the government raised concerns about the spread of the virus in London schools and announced a programme of mass testing. On Sunday, one region of the capital unilaterally decided to close its schools altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-may-move-into-toughest-tier-of-covid-19-restrictions/story-YMsMP0WD6rwMXqFLpXtAjJ.html
14-12-2020||World||US Election 2020: What happens when the electoral college meets||More than one month after voters cast their ballots in the US presidential election, the electoral college meets on December 14 to cast their ballots. The US constitution gives the electors the power to choose the president and when all the votes are counted, president-elect Joe Biden is expected to have 306 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed to elect a president, to 232 votes for President Donald Trump.Here’s everything you need to know about the electoral college and what happens next:What is the electoral college?The electoral college is a middle ground between electing the president by popular vote and having US Congress chooses the president. Under the US Constitution, states get a number of electors equal to their total number of seats in Congress: two senators plus however many members the state has in the House of Representatives. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states award all of their electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in their state.Why is the concept of the electoral college criticised?The electoral college has been the subject of criticism for more than two centuries mostly because the person who wins the popular vote can nonetheless lose the presidential election. That has happened twice in the last two decades — in 2000 with the election of George W Bush and in 2016 when Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.Who are the electors and what do they do?Presidential electors typically are elected officials, political hopefuls or long-time party loyalists. The electoral college doesn’t meet in one place. Instead, each state’s electors and the electors for the District of Columbia meet in a place chosen by their legislature, usually the state capitol.Electors cast their votes by paper ballot: one ballot for president and one for vice president. The votes get counted and the electors sign six certificates with the results. Each certificate gets paired with a certificate from the governor detailing the state’s vote totals.Those six packets then get mailed to various people specified by law. The most important copy, though, gets sent to the president of the Senate, the current vice president. This is the copy that will be officially counted later.Are electors obligated to vote for the candidate who won in their state?In 32 states and the District of Columbia, laws require electors to vote for the popular-vote winner. The US Supreme Court unanimously upheld this arrangement in July. Electors almost always vote for the state winner anyway, because they generally are devoted to their political party.What will happen next?Once the electoral votes are cast, they are sent to Congress, where both houses will convene on January 6 for a session presided over by vice president Mike Pence. The envelopes from each state and the District of Columbia will be opened and the votes tallied.If at least one member of each house objects in writing to some electoral votes, the House and Senate meet separately to debate the issue. Both houses must vote to sustain the objection for it to matter, and the Democratic-led House is unlikely to go along with any objections to votes for Biden. Otherwise, the votes get counted as intended by the states.And then the next step is Inauguration Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-what-happens-when-the-electoral-college-meets/story-Ms9xqQu7FVjqun9IEWgKSO.html

We didn’t have anything to do with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-had-nothing-to-do-with-suspected-us-treasury-email-snooping-says-kremlin/story-ORHTFIH8leXA4X766YZ7aI.html
14-12-2020||World||Saudi ‘mini Ritz’ corruption crackdown evokes awe, fear||Hoards of cash, some of it squirrelled away in false ceilings and water tanks, have been seized in a widening anti-corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia that has evoked both awe and fear. The clampdown, which has ensnared top-ranking military officials as well as low-level bureaucrats, is widely dubbed as a “mini Ritz” operation, a reference to a 2017 swoop that saw princes and tycoons locked up in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel on graft charges.In dramatic gumshoe-style investigations published on state media, the official anti-corruption agency Nazaha says it has caught bribe-seekers “red-handed” in live raids and sniffed out illicit cash hidden in attics, an underground safe and even a mosque.The crackdown has led to dozens of arrests in recent months and sent confiscated cash to state coffers -- and has won praise from the public.Saudis have been offered a toll-free number to report any suspected cases of corruption.“The message (Saudi) rulers are sending to the corrupt is that ‘you won’t be going to the Ritz, you will be going to a real prison’,” a local official told AFP, declining to be named.“Anyone taking bribes and kickbacks now fears, ‘are we next?’“Underscoring the seriousness of the campaign, Nazaha reported in October the arrest of one of its own employees for corruption.Saudi Arabia, which ranks 51 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s corruption index, has for decades faced endemic graft and the deeply ingrained social practice of “wasta”, or using influence and personal connections to get ahead.But the issue has gained a new spotlight since November 2017, when the opulent Ritz-Carlton became a gilded prison for dozens of elites swept up in a purge that critics labelled a shakedown and a power grab by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Following weeks of detention, wealthy princes and businessmen were released after agreeing significant financial settlements, with authorities saying they recovered more than $107 billion.- ‘One sheriff in town’ -The recent drive, targeting everyone from powerful defence chiefs to low-key municipal, health and environment officials, reinforces the iron reign of Prince Mohammed, the 35-year-old heir to the throne who already controls all major levers of power.As one observer in the kingdom put it, the drive emphasises that “there is only one sheriff in town”.Prince Mohammed told the advisory Shura Council last month that the anti-corruption campaign had yielded 247 billion riyals ($66 billion) over the last three years in addition to assets, real estate and stocks worth billions more.But the crackdown has raised concerns, with Human Rights Watch warning earlier this year of “unfair legal proceedings” in an opaque judicial system.There has also been hushed speculation over whether the clean-up was a cover to replenish state coffers amid a sharp economic downturn.One Saudi academic said he suspects the “real targets are not the corrupt, but fines and new sources of revenue”.There is no transparency, the academic told AFP, over how the government will utilise the seized cash and assets.Others have suggested that the campaign aims to weed out security officials not deemed loyal enough to the rulers.“While I imagine there are a few political opponents caught in the corruption net, the primary reasons for the crackdown are ending corruption, spurring development and raising badly needed funds,” David Rundell, former chief of mission at the US embassy in Riyadh, told AFP.“And it seems to be working. Many Saudi businessmen tell me that corruption has declined -- not gone away, but declined and become less socially acceptable,” he added.- ‘Undermine opponents’ -Local observers describe the drive as necessary shock therapy to steer the petro-state away from a decades-old culture of excess and poor accountability that it can ill-afford in an age of soft oil prices.The widespread “cancer” of corruption was “endangering development and prosperity”, depleting “five to 15 percent” of the annual state budget, Prince Mohammed told the Shura Council.But raising speculation that it was also a tool against political rivals, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote in July that the kingdom was preparing “corruption and disloyalty charges” against deposed former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who has been detained since March.Saudi authorities have not publicly commented on the reasons for his detention.Further triggering shockwaves, joint forces commander Prince Fahad bin Turki -- a senior royal -- and his son Abdulaziz bin Fahad, the deputy emir of northern Al-Jouf region, were fired in late August and placed under investigation for corruption.Such moves illustrate an attempt by the Saudi establishment to “undermine possible opponents”, Capital Economics said in September.“The experience of the 2017 anti-corruption purge is that this could undermine renewed efforts to increase foreign investment in the kingdom,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-mini-ritz-corruption-crackdown-evokes-awe-fear/story-ObOO6oJfWuWKLzoyiCCNTI.html
14-12-2020||World||South Korea orders schools to shut as Covid-19 cases spike||South Korea ordered schools to close from Tuesday in the capital Seoul and surrounding areas as it battles its worst outbreak of novel coronavirus since the pandemic began, surpassing the previous peak in February.Schools in the capital region would move classes online until the end of the month, in the latest ratcheting up of social distancing measures which so far have failed to reverse the spike in infections.The school closure is a step towards the imposition of Phase 3 social distancing rules, a move that would essentially lock down Asia’s fourth-largest economy.Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said such a step required careful review, as the government comes under mounting pressure to do more to step the rise of infections.“The government will not hesitate to make the decision to upgrade to Phase 3 if it is considered necessary as it takes into account the opinions of related ministries, local governments, and experts,” he told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from his office.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) on Monday reported 718 new coronavirus cases, down from the record daily increase of 1,030 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 682 were locally transmitted, it said.Most of the new cases were in Seoul, the neighbouring port city of Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province, home to over 25 million people.South Korea’s total infections now stands at 43,484, with 587 deaths.The government launched a massive tracing effort involving hundreds of troops, police and officials to help track down virus carriers.Health authorities said a recent wave of infections mainly centre around gatherings with friends and families, which limits the effectiveness of social distancing rules. Drawn up from the reproduction rate, or the number of people who become infected from each positive case, the number of daily infections could rise up to 1,200, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a briefing.“It is more than ever important to actively partake in social distancing and minimise the chances of contact,” said Jeong. “Please refrain from visiting crowded venues and cancel all gatherings with family and friends.”Some experts said the government and the public needed to do more.“This is the time to send an impactful message to the public, so that they can take voluntary actions,” said Kim Dong-hyun, president of Korean Society of Epidemiology and a professor at Hallym University College of Medicine.Under a Phase 3 lockdown, only essential workers would be allowed into offices and gatherings would be capped at less than 10 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-orders-schools-to-shut-as-covid-19-cases-spike/story-q9uxYRpoVcbkIoAhpK1n0H.html
14-12-2020||World||US agencies hacked in monthslong global cyberspying campaign||US government agencies were ordered to scour their networks for malware and disconnect potentially compromised servers after authorities learned that the Treasury and Commerce departments were hacked in a monthslong global cyber espionage campaign discovered when a prominent cybersecurity firm learned it had been breached.In a rare emergency directive issued late Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity arm warned of an “unacceptable risk” to the executive branch from a feared large-scale penetration of US government agencies that could date back to mid-year or earlier.“This can turn into one of the most impactful espionage campaigns on record,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch.The hacked cybersecurity company, FireEye, would not say who it suspected — many experts believe the operation is Russian given the careful tradecraft — and noted that foreign governments and major corporations were also compromised.News of the hacks, first reported by Reuters, came less than a week after FireEye disclosed that nation-state hackers had broken into its network and stolen the company’s own hacking tools.The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple US federal agencies that will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.The DHS directive — only the fifth since they were created in 2015 — said US agencies should immediately disconnect or power down any machines running the impacted SolarWinds software.FireEye, without naming any specific targets, said in a blog post that its investigation into the hack of its own network had identified “a global campaign” targeting governments and the private sector that, beginning in the spring, had slipped malware into a SolarWinds software update. Neither the company nor the US government publicly identified Russian state-backed hackers as responsible.The malware gave the hackers remote access to victims’ networks, and Alperovitch said SolarWinds grants “God-mode” access to a network, making everything visible.“We anticipate this will be a very large event when all the information comes to light,” said John Hultquist, director of threat analysis at FireEye. “The actor is operating stealthily, but we are certainly still finding targets that they manage to operate in.”On its website, SolarWinds says it has 300,000 customers worldwide, including all five branches of the US military, the Pentagon, the State Department, NASA, the National Security Agency, the Department of Justice and the White House. It says the 10 leading U.S. telecommunications companies and top five US accounting firms are also among customers.FireEye said it had confirmed infections in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including in the health care and oil and gas industry — and had been informing affected customers around the world in the past few days. It’s customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.It said that malware that rode the SolarWinds update did not seed self-propagating malware — like the NotPetya malware blamed on Russia that caused more than $10 billion in damage globally — and that any actual infiltration of an infected organization required “meticulous planning and manual interaction.”That means it’s a good bet only a subset of infected organizations were being spied on by the hackers. Nation-states have their cyberespionage priorities, which include Covid-19 vaccine development.On Sunday, Russia’s US embassy described as “unfounded” in a post on its Facebook page the “attempts of the US media to blame Russia for hacker attackes on US governmental bodies.”The Treasury Department referred requests for comment to the National Security Council, whose spokesman, John Ullyot, said the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it was working with other agencies to help “identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI said it was engaged in a response but declined to comment further.President Donald Trump last month fired the director of CISA, Chris Krebs, after Krebs vouched for the integrity of the presidential election and disputed Trump’s claims of widespread electoral fraud.In a tweet Sunday, Krebs said “hacks of this type take exceptional tradecraft and time,” adding that he believed that its impact was only beginning to be understood.Federal agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers looking to gain insight into American government personnel and policymaking.Hackers linked to Russia, for instance, were able to break into the State Department’s email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation. A year later, a hack at the US government’s personnel office blamed on China compromised the personal information of some 22 million current, former and prospective federal employees, including highly sensitive data such as background investigations.The intrusions disclosed Sunday included the Commerce Department’s agency responsible for internet and telecommunications policy. A spokesperson confirmed a “breach in one of our bureaus” and said “we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.”Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday a “potential vulnerability” related to updates released between March and June for software products called Orion that help monitor networks for problems.“We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson said in a statement. He said it was working with the FBI, FireEye and intelligence community.FireEye announced on Tuesday that it had been hacked, saying foreign state hackers with “world-class capabilities” broke into its network and stole tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. The hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec, said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.“I suspect that there’s a number of other (federal) agencies we’re going to hear from this week that have also been hit,” Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack — and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Mandia said there was no indication they got customer information from the company’s consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-hacked-in-monthslong-global-cyberspying-campaign/story-0wZvid8hOmThecXG1JZP9K.html

14-12-2020||World||Italy considers new Covid-19 restrictions for holidays||Italy is considering more stringent nationwide coronavirus restrictions during the Christmas and New Year holidays as concerns rise over a possible spike in infections in January. After some restrictions put in place last month were eased, crowds of shoppers flocked to many city centres on Sunday, as Italy reported 484 coronavirus-related deaths. On Saturday, Italy surpassed Britain as the European country with the worst death toll.The government could decide to put the country under so-called “red-zone” lockdown rules from Dec. 24 to at least Jan. 2, extending night curfews, banning non-essential movement and closing shops, bars and restaurants on weekends and holidays, with the exception for those selling essential goods, Italian media reported. A decision is expected after a Monday morning meeting between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, ministers and the scientific committee that has been advising the government since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency. It would follow a similar move by Germany, which on Sunday said it would close most shops from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 after reporting 321 COVID-19 deaths and 20,200 new cases.“The crowds are unjustifiable, irrational, irresponsible,” Regional Affairs minister Francesco Boccia told Italian daily la Repubblica.He said “business and health are not reconcilable at the moment”, adding that he endorsed Germany’s decision. Earlier this month, the government had approved rules to avoid a surge in infections over Christmas and the New Year, banning midnight mass and halting movement between towns.. It decided that on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, Italians will not be able to leave their towns and a current nighttime curfew would be extended until 7 a.m. on New Year’s.

This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe,” Lee said in a national broadcast.Singapore has also signed advanced purchase agreements and made early down-payments on promising vaccine candidates including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac, setting aside more than $1 billion for shots, authorities said.“We have acquired sufficient doses of the vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents,” the health ministry’s director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, later told a media briefing.The United States, Canada and a handful of other countries have approved the Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE vaccine, with a mass inoculation programme underway in Britain and one getting going in the United States.Lee also said Singapore would lift some anti-virus curbs from Dec. 28, including allowing groups of eight to congregate in public, up from a limit of five.“Our situation is now stable,” Lee said. “Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel.”Singapore has reported only a handful of local cases of Covid-19 over the last two months.Of Singapore’s more than 58,000 cases, 29 people have died - one of the world’s lowest fatality rates. More than 70 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide with 1.61 million deaths, according to a Reuters tally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-approves-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-expects-first-shots-by-year-end/story-4UEyf6GwyngHgHOAavdTDN.html
14-12-2020||World||‘Pure propaganda’: German scientist rebuts Chinese media on Covid origin||A top German biochemist quoted by Chinese state media as saying that the coronavirus did not originate in Wuhan has called it “pure propaganda” and said there is no evidence to suggest that the virus did not come from the central Chinese city.Earlier this month, Chinese news outlets quoted Alexander Kekule, director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle, Germany, as saying that the virus originated in Italy.“The novel coronavirus running rampant around the world is not the Wuhan variant, but a variant that mutated in north Italy,” China’s national broadcaster quoted Kekule as saying in an interview on German television.“The starting point of the pandemic is not in Wuhan, ” official news agency Xinhua quoted him as saying. In an emailed interview with the Hindustan Times, Kekule strongly denied the version of his argument published in Chinese state media, saying his words were twisted out of context.“Chinese media are quoting from my recent bestseller book Der Corona-Kompass (The Corona Compass, available only in German so far) and from an interview I gave about the book in the popular German TV show Markus Lanz,” said Kekule, who also holds a chair as University Professor and Director of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Martin Luther University in Halle.“The origin of the virus in China is described in detail in my book, and also the Chinese efforts to conceal the magnitude of the outbreak at the beginning. I never stated that the virus originally came from Italy, this is pure propaganda,” he added.The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, 2019, before spreading across China, and triggering a global pandemic.China has denied that it deliberately hid information about the spreading virus in January or earlier.A year into the Coronavirus pandemic, China has effectively controlled the spread of Covid-19 within its borders, putting in place efficient lockdown and contract tracing measures and conducting mass testing for the virus for every small outbreak.At the same time, Beijing, in the face of global criticism, has been trying to change the virus-origin theory and shift the blame outside. Several theories are in circulation – the origin could be the Indian subcontinent including India and Bangladesh or Saudi Arabia, Italy, the US and the US military, or imported frozen packaged food.Kekule’s interview to a German channel was similarly picked up to fit into the narrative.By the time the German expert reacted, his interview had spread across Chinese social media, with many thanking him for clearing China’s name.“Unfortunately, they are taking one or two phrases out of context, giving my statement a made-up twist. Chinese state media are referring to my account of the outbreak in Northern Italy and my critique of the WHO and EU in this context,” Kekule said.“There is, however, no scientific basis to deny that the virus originally came from China… I explained (on the television show) that the virus came of course from China, but the “G” variant was able to prevail in northern Italy because the outbreak was not detected there for several weeks, paving the way to the pandemic around the globe, including re-imports to China.”Kekule explained that the “G variant” (carrying a D614G mutation in the S gene) of the virus emerged in northern Italy, possibly because the outbreak went undetected for several weeks there.“The G variant is most likely more contagious than the variant originally detected in Wuhan. This might be the reason why it spread world-wide from Italy. Since July 2020, more than 99% of the virus strains analysed worldwide are G variants, i.e. the viruses presently circulating have their common origin in Northern Italy.”The German scientist said that he went on the same television show to explain his position.“The same evening I spoke again on the TV show Markus Lanz and we made it crystal clear that I had been misquoted in an act of propaganda,” he said.“Science tells us, that humankind must change its behaviour towards nature, including the habit of killing wild animals that carry dangerous viruses,” he said.“When even nations refuse to take responsibility of their actions, how should individuals learn to change their dangerous habits?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-expert-denies-saying-covid-origin-not-in-wuhan-as-china-passes-the-buck/story-C97H1gRVT4VjBQ4CwLGTAK.html

We will only rest after it is brought to an end.”The next general elections in Pakistan are scheduled for 2023.This was the first time in the recent history of the country that the PML-N held a public meeting at Minar-i-Pakistan, the first rally at this venue for its Vice President Maryam.Similarly, it was Bilawal’s first appearance at a political gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan. His late mother, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, held a historic public meeting at Minar-i-Pakistan in 1986.After the sixth power show held in Lahore, PDM called a meeting of top party leaders to discuss strategy for the next rally that will be held in Larkana.According to a report by ARY News, the meeting would be attended by JUI-F chief, Maryam Nawaz, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and other leaders.Anadolu News has reported that tens of thousands of opposition supporters rallied in Pakistan’s northeastern city of Lahore on Sunday, despite a government ban on public gatherings due to coronavirus.

14-12-2020||World||EU chief negotiator Barnier still sees hope to clinch Brexit trade deal||European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday he still has the firm belief that a Brexit trade agreement is possible, and whittled the outstanding disputes to be settled ahead of the New Year to just two.Barnier said that the nine-month negotiations had come down to finding settlements on fair-competition rules and fishing rights, no longer mentioning the issue of legal mechanisms for resolving future disputes that also long dogged the negotiations.“Two conditions are not met yet,” he said as he entered a meeting to brief the 27 EU nations on progress in the talks. He is expected to continue negotiations with his UK counterpart David Frost later on Monday. “This deal, it is still possible,” he added.Both sides are teetering on the brink of a no-deal Brexit departure, but have committed to a final push ahead of Jan. 1, when a transitional period following Britain’s Jan. 31 departure from the bloc is to end.On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ditched a self-imposed deadline and promised to “go the extra mile” to clinch a post-Brexit trade agreement that would avert New Year’s chaos and costs for cross-border commerce.Barnier is willing to accept British trade with no tariffs or quotas, but only if they respect the rules and regulations that have made the EU’s single market of almost 500 million consumers so successful. “Free and fair competition, fair and free, equitable and open, the two go together,” Barnier said.Johnson, however, says he does not want British business to be hemmed in by EU restrictions, especially if those restrictions would have to be progressively adapted to mainland standards in the future.On fisheries, Barnier demanded “an agreement that guarantees a reciprocal, I insist, reciprocal access to markets and waters.” It highlighted that just as EU fishermen crave to continue working in British waters, the UK seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports into the 27-nation bloc.Johnson has made fisheries and UK control over its waters a key demand in the long saga of leaving the EU. It has been four-and-a-half years since Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU and — in the words of the Brexiteers’ slogan — “take back control” of the UK’s borders and laws.Johnson said over the weekend that the “most likely” outcome was that the two sides wouldn’t reach a deal and would trade on World Trade Organization terms, with the tariffs and barriers that would bring.Exporters and importers face customs declarations, goods checks and other obstacles. EU citizens will no longer be able to live and work in Britain without a visa — though that doesn’t apply to the more than 3 million already there — and Britons can no longer automatically work or retire in the EU.Without a deal, the disruption would be far greater. The UK government has acknowledged a chaotic exit is likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foods. Tariffs will be applied to many UK goods, including 10 per cent on cars and more than 40 per cent on lamb, hurting the UK economy as it struggles to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-negotiator-barnier-still-sees-hope-to-clinch-brexit-trade-deal/story-mLPMAHN9mUls5ovXg0BhBI.html

The Tuebingen-based company says the study is expected to include more than 35,000 participants at sites in Europe and Latin America.“With the start of the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study, we have reached another important milestone in the development of our vaccine candidate, CVnCoV,” Franz-Werner Haas, the CEO of CureVac, said in a statement Monday.The company expects first results of its phase 3 study by the end of March.CureVac began development of its mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate last January.Earlier studies showed that the newly developed vaccine was “generally well tolerated across all tested doses and induced strong antibody responses,” the company wrote. ”The quality of immune response was comparable to recovered Covid-19 patients, closely mimicking the immune response after natural Covid-19 infection.”Another German company, BioNTech, helped develop the first vaccine approved for use in the United States, together with US company Pfizer. It is also based on mRNA technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-curevac-begins-phase-3-study-of-possible-vaccine/story-gqfvzotYTfpEaxMi8yB1UK.html

A launch pad for the new rocket is due to open in 2021.The Angara has however been dogged by manufacturing delays and technical issues, including the discovery last year of a defect in its engines that scientists said could destroy it in flight.The defence ministry and space agency Roscosmos said Monday’s launch, from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in the country’s northwest, had been successful however.Roscosmos has suffered a series of setbacks and corruption scandals in recent years, including during the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country’s far east where contractors were accused of stealing state funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-successfully-test-launches-heavy-lift-space-rocket-after-long-hiatus/story-sEtraPWgu3kobADoBYoxgP.html
14-12-2020||World||Early in-person voting begins in Georgia Senate runoffs||What could be the main event in Georgia’s twin US Senate runoffs -- early in-person voting -- begins Monday. More than half of the record 5 million votes in the November 3 general election were cast during the two-week early voting period. Early in-person voting could be even more important in the January 5 runoffs because of the short time frame for voters to request and send back ballots by mail, as the two races decide which party will control the US Senate. “It’s very important,” Democrat Raphael Warnock, who is challenging Republican US Senator Kelly Loeffler in one of the races, said Friday after a speech to labor union canvassers. “It’s how we won in the general and it’s how we’re going to win in the runoff.” No one expects turnout to be as high in the Warnock-Loeffler contest or the race between US Senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. But Bernard Fraga, an Emory University professor who studies voting, said overall turnout could rise as high as four million. More than 125,000 people cast ballots in October on the first day of early in-person voting before the general election. Gabriel Sterling, election system implementation manager for the Georgia Secretary of State, said he expects a surge of people on Monday. Some Atlanta-area early voting sites in October and November saw people frequently lined up for hours. “As always, on the first day of early voting, it’s kind of like when the iPhone comes out,” Sterling said last week. “People want to go get the new iPhone at the Apple store. They’re going to stand in line for a while.” One question is how many mail-in ballots will be cast in the election. By Friday, 1.2 million mail-in ballots had been requested and 200,000 returned. In the general election, Democrat Joe Biden won 65 per cent of the 1.3 million absentee ballots that were returned, a record fueled by the coronavirus pandemic. More than 86,000 voters who did not vote in November had requested ballots as of Friday, according to statistics from Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks voting. Fraga said it’s possible that mail-in ballots, if anything, will be even more favorable for Democrats in the runoff because of attacks on the integrity of mail-in voting by President Donald Trump and many Georgia Republicans. “I don’t think Republicans are going to be voting by mail even at as high of rates as they did in November,” Fraga said. That means early in-person voting, which Trump narrowly won in November, could be even more important for Republicans. Both parties may also drive voters toward the early polls with Christmas and New Year’s holidays looming before January 5. “Any compressed timeline means people will be less likely to vote by mail,” Fraga said. Each of Georgia’s 159 counties must offer at least one location for early voting during business hours, with many in metro Atlanta offering multiple locations, extended hours and weekend voting. Early voting will run as late as December 31 in some places. Preparation for early voting has been marred by squabbles over cuts to early polling places. Cobb County, once a suburban Republican stronghold trending Democratic, planned to cut early polling places from 11 to five. The county election manager said employees are exhausted and she didn’t have enough to staff more than that. After an outcry that closures would harm Black voters, the county will open two more locations and relocate a third. Heavily Republican Forsyth County is cutting early voting locations from 11 to five and cutting hours, rejecting on Tuesday an effort to expand sites and cuts. Elections Director Mandi Smith told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that fewer voters and a shorter ballot won’t require as many sites. Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta said the move will make lines longer and make voting harder for people who don’t speak English well. Forsyth Republicans applauded the move, saying on the party Facebook page that the county rejected the “Democrats scheme” for more sites. The GOP reasoned that even early in-person voting is prone to cheating, although it didn’t explain how, with voters required to appear in person with photo identification. “We fought to protect the integrity of our elections and not allow opportunities for more fraud,” the party wrote. Republican Hall County, with a large Latino population, is cutting early voting sites from eight to four. Democratic Douglas County will also have fewer voting sites. The Center for New Data, a nonprofit group, counted 42 early polling sites statewide scheduled to close for the runoff. In some cases, polling places are being relocated nearby. The center found voters at polling locations slated to close waited an average of 49 minutes before the general election, compared to an average of 43 minutes at locations staying open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-in-person-voting-begins-in-georgia-senate-runoffs/story-06YYOWPezFL9Myi7tzTaSL.html

14-12-2020||World||Indian-American TIME’s ‘Kid of the Year’ Gitanjali Rao focuses on effective Covid-19 vaccine distribution||Young Indian-American scientist Gitanjali Rao, TIME magazine’s first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’, has said she is brainstorming about solutions for the effective vaccine distribution to address a pressing challenge posed by the coronavirus, and has set her sights on preventing future pandemics. In an interview with PTI, the 15-year-old inventor said she was focussed on using technological tools to offer solutions for vaccine distribution, a challenge that confronts the world grappling with the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Rao was named by TIME magazine this month as the first-ever ‘Kid of the Year’ for her “astonishing work using technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying”. She was selected among over 5,000 nominees for the honour. “I definitely do want to look at the pandemic. The next biggest problem we’re going to face is vaccine distribution and prioritisation. So I’m looking at my potential data and analytics approach towards that,” Rao said. “But I think the next biggest problem that I’ll probably look towards solving is preventing future pandemics from happening because I think it’s safe to assume that this isn’t the last one and we probably will have another one before 100 years,” she said. Rao says she is still at a “brainstorming and observing” phase but is looking at the whole idea of vaccine distribution and how widespread it needs to be. “Also, how important it is because everybody needs to receive this vaccine. So I’m looking at how we can use predictive analytics and data models in order to create a plan of how vaccine distribution will roll out,” she said. TIME had said in its profile that “exceptional leadership” is what made the “brilliant” Rao stand out for the honour. “Rao not only researches scientific tools such as artificial intelligence and carbon nanotube sensor technology and applies them to problems she sees in everyday life, like cyberbullying and water contamination. She also shows other kids how to tap into their curiosity, aspiring to create a generation of innovators,” it said. Rao said it was very “exciting” to be named Kid of the Year “but more than that it’s honoring and humbling to be that face of Generation Z as well as have the opportunity to be featured on the cover of TIME among so many other fantastic people. I’m so beyond humbled and I’m just excited to see where this keeps going”. The youngster, who through her work is an inspiration for many, counted her parents - Bharathi and Ram Rao - and the family as her “biggest inspirations”. Rao said she had always received an incredible amount of support from her parents. “If I wanted to play a certain sport, learn something new, I had all the resources in front of me,” she said. Rao recalled how her mother brought nearly a dozen books for her in third grade on clouds when she wanted to learn about the subject. “Experiences like that are what changed my life forever, having that support and being able to do what I love without any backlash,” she said. Rao said she was also “truly inspired” by scientists and inventors who go beyond themselves and innovate for positive change, particularly Jonas Salk, who invented the polio vaccine and never patented it. “He never claimed it as his own because he wanted it to be something that everyone could use, and I really aspire to be that selfless and put others before me,” Rao said. The young scientist, who has been featured in Forbes list of 30 Under 30 achievers, was named America’s Top Young Scientist and is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) promoter, wants to see more young girls being given opportunities to study and work in the field. “I think another thing is just showing them role models in the field and I honestly aspire to be one of them,” she said, adding that when she was in second grade, she did not know females could be scientists. “I didn’t know it was possible because everybody I had seen in the media and learned about was a male. I was excited personally to learn that a girl could be a scientist which is almost problematic because I was able to learn about that but what if people didn’t have that inspiration, didn’t have that opportunity for growth. We just need to involve more girls in STEM by showing them that they can do it,” she said. Rao has also been working tirelessly on creating a community of innovators and has so far mentored thousands of students. She runs workshops for students from across the globe who want to become innovators and solve global problems. “Everyone comes out of that workshop with one solution and a process that they can take to implement it in the real world. If I can do it, you can do it and anyone can do it,” she says. Rao says she is interested in working on several things in the future and wants to look at genetic research with product design involved. “Hopefully whatever I’m doing, I’m changing the world for the better,” she said. For Rao, her own passion right now is working on solutions for the contamination of natural resources. “I’m looking at water contamination specifically and water parasitic contamination is the biggest problem that I’m seeing out there today. I really want to find a way to prevent that from happening,” she said, adding that she is using genetically engineered microbes to detect parasites in water. “I’m using living things to find living things which I think is a very interesting concept,” she said.

14-12-2020||World||Despite Trump’s claims Georgia voters ready for runoffs||Many Republican voters in Georgia are angry. They’re convinced that widespread voter fraud — claims that are baseless — cost President Donald Trump the election to Democrat Joe Biden.But will those concerns put them on the sidelines for runoff elections Jan. 5 that will determine party control of the US Senate? No way, said Trump supporter Lori Davis.“Everyone that I’m around, we’re ready to vote now,” said the 57-year-old businesswoman, as she awaited the arrival of Vice President Mike Pence at a rally for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Augusta on Thursday.Trump has relentlessly promoted false claims that the election was rigged against him and he has savaged Republican elected officials he perceives as standing in the way of his quest to subvert the results. Some Trump allies have gone as far as calling for voters to skip the Georgia runoffs altogether — alarming words for the GOP campaigns banking on a strong turnout.But interviews with voters and party activists in the state suggest there’s little sign that Trump’s voters are planning to stay home in protest. Most Republican voters interviewed said they were prepared to put their skepticism aside to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in their races against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.“There are people who are discouraged about (Trump) losing Georgia or being behind. But I haven’t talked to people who’ve said, ‘Oh, the heck with this, it’s all rigged anyway,’” said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which has done canvassing of GOP-leaning voters.Phillips was among those who worried that the distrust could affect Republican enthusiasm. But he said his group’s weeks in the field, combined with a recent visit from Trump, have eased his worries.Trump’s December 5 campaign stop in Valdosta, Georgia, was his first since he lost the state to Biden by about 11,700 votes — a result that was confirmed by two recounts, including a hand tally of all ballots. But those recounts haven’t stopped the president from blasting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.Kemp has rebuffed Trump’s call for a special session of the legislature to subvert the election results, while Raffensperger has repeatedly said there is no evidence of systemic fraud or irregularities in the November election.Trump and his allies have continued to push false claims of fraud. Trump turned up the heat on Kemp via Twitter early Monday, pushing him to take action on the requests for legislative action or hamper the reelection bids of incumbents Perdue and Loeffler.“What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is,” Trump tweeted. “Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.” What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.Sidney Powell, who was removed from Trump’s legal team last month, has teamed up with Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who is known for his representation of several high-profile clients, particularly in defamation cases. The lawyers have repeatedly encouraged Georgia Republicans not to vote in the runoff election and questioned whether Perdue and Loeffler have sufficiently backed Trump’s efforts.“Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election?” Wood said during a recent rally in a suburb north of Atlanta.Trump has asked his supporters to get out and vote. The “seats are the last line of defense to save America and protect all that we’ve accomplished,” he said at the recent Georgia event. During the rally, Trump weaved back and forth between pressing his own grievances about the election and encouraging the crowd to turn out for Perdue and Loeffler.“You know a lot of people, friends of mine, say ‘Let’s not vote. We’re not going to vote because we’re angry about the presidential election,’” Trump told the crowd.“But if you do that, the radical left wins,” he said.Phillips said he believes that message is getting through to the conservative base much more so than any isolated calls for boycotts or even the president’s broadsides against Kemp and Raffensperger.“These aren’t people taking their cues from CNN or conventional political media. They listen to the president directly. And they’re open to his message and our message of not letting (Democratic Senate leader) Chuck Schumer finish the job,” Phillips said.Republicans are depending on voters such as Terry McCreary, a 65-year-old retiree in Cherokee County. McCreary calls himself a “conservative independent,” but he’s voted almost exclusively for Republicans since casting presidential ballots for Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s.McCreary says he finds it “hard to believe” Biden won the election fair and square. McCreary cites several misleading and disproven theories that Trump and his allies have pushed in recent weeks.“It just doesn’t feel right,” he said from his home in the Atlanta suburbs.But none of that, McCreary said, will keep him from voting in the runoffs. “I’m concerned about the election on Jan. 5” being legitimate, he said. “But I always vote. Every time.”Perdue and Loeffler have tried to placate Trump and his supporters by backing a lawsuit from Texas that sought to overturn Biden’s win but was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday, and by calling for Raffensperger to resign, citing unspecified “mismanagement” in the election.Nonetheless, they’ve faced pushback from hardcore Trump supporters. As the pair strained to speak at Trump’s rally in Valdosta, cries of “Fight for Trump” filled the crowd, largely drowning out the senators.Jeanne Seaver, a Republican activist in Georgia who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign, said she believes that Republican voters will still come out to support Perdue and Loeffler despite the anger on the ground.“I think if Donald Trump says get out and vote for Kelly and David, then the Trump folks are loyal to Donald Trump and will get out and vote,” Seaver said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-trump-s-claims-georgia-voters-ready-for-runoffs/story-QgIOMsKb4k9NEHjJ2Qnz1M.html
14-12-2020||World||Donald Trump cancels plan for early vaccination of White House staff||President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was reversing an administration directive to vaccinate top government officials against Covid-19, while public distribution of the shot is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Trump made the announcement hours after his administration confirmed that senior US officials, including some White House aides who work in close proximity to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, would be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week under federal continuity of government plans.“People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,” Trump said in a tweet. “I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.”It was not immediately clear what the scale of the vaccination program was supposed to be, according to two people briefed on the matter, or what effect Trump’s tweet would have on the government’s efforts to protect top leadership.News that White House staff would receive the vaccine early drew criticism on social media. Trump and his aides have consistently flouted the Covid-19 guidelines issued by his own administration, including hosting large holiday parties with maskless attendees this December.Officials said earlier Sunday that doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer would be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation’s top leaders. They said the move was meant to prevent more Covid-19 spread in the White House and other critical facilities. Trump was hospitalized with the virus for three days in October.“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot had said. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”The two people briefed on the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The New York Times first reported that top US officials would get early access to the vaccine.The move to vaccinate top US officials would be consistent with the rollout of rapid testing machines for the coronavirus, which were similarly controlled by the federal government with kits reserved to protect the White House complex and other critical facilities.According to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is not yet enough information to determine whether those who have had Covid-19 should also get the vaccine.Pence has not come down with the virus, and his aides have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine as the administration looks to boost public confidence in the shot.The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart, meaning Trump administration officials would receive the final shot just weeks before leaving office.Aides to President-elect Joe Biden have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine and have been working to establish plans to boost virus safeguards in the West Wing to keep the 78-year-old Democrat healthy.According to a Capitol Hill official, lawmakers have not been informed how many doses would be made available to them, adding it would be premature to speculate who might receive them. The official was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-cancels-plan-for-early-vaccination-of-white-house-staff/story-Cro6xKItnPvrOk4z4F1kFP.html

He’s asked Fauci to continue on in his role as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and to also be his chief medical adviser.Biden said earlier this month that he would “be happy” to take the vaccine in public, just as former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have said they would.“When Dr. Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that’s the moment in which I will stand before the public,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-will-follow-fauci-s-guidance-on-when-to-take-covid-vaccine-report/story-6TUN5wNaCGWXH75ubvN6yI.html
14-12-2020||World||First batch of Pfizer coronavirus vaccines arrives in Canada||The first Covid-19 vaccines landed on Canadian soil on Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, and some Canadians are expected to roll up their sleeves for a shot as soon as Monday. Canada and the United States are set this week to become the first Western nations after the UK to begin inoculations with the newly approved vaccine.“The first batch of doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine have arrived in Canada,” Trudeau said on Twitter on Sunday night above a picture of a cargo plane apparently used to transport the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE.The initial 30,000 doses will go to 14 sites across Canada. The most vulnerable people, including the elderly in long-term care facilities and healthcare workers, will be first in line for shots.The vaccines left Belgium, where they were produced, on Friday, and traveled to Germany and the United States before being split up and sent to different parts of Canada. “The intent here is to ensure that we continue to have regular drip feed of vaccines in the coming weeks,” with 249,000 doses expected by the end of the year, Major-General Dany Fortin, who is in charge of vaccine distribution, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp earlier in the day. While it is “good news” that the vaccine has arrived, Trudeau said: “Our fight against Covid-19 is not over.” Forecasting a rapid acceleration of the spread of the novel coronavirus during the second wave, Canada’s federal health authorities called on Friday for provinces to impose more health restrictions heading into the holidays.The country has had 460,743 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 5,891 new infections reported on Sunday. On Friday, health officials said Canada could see 12,000 new cases a day by January.The highly contagious respiratory disease has claimed 13,431 lives in Canada, including 81 on Saturday.‘BRIDGE TO RECOVERY’“While we have a long way to go, this marks the beginning of our bridge to recovery,” Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on Twitter of the vaccine arrival.Canada is expected to approve a second vaccine from Moderna Inc “reasonably soon” and the country will be ready to accept shipments of it by the end of the week, Fortin said earlier.Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said on the CBC the review of the Moderna vaccine was ongoing and that important data was expected later this week.She also outlined guidance about potential allergic reactions to the Pfizer shot after reports of two such incidents on the first day of vaccinations in Britain.On Saturday, Canada said anyone with vaccine allergies should not take the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.“If you have an allergy to a vaccine or this vaccine or any components of the vaccine, you should not get it,” Sharma said. “But if you have other allergies, you can go ahead and get vaccinated.” Health Canada will be monitoring people who are inoculated for adverse reactions or side effects, she said.Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses, given about three weeks apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-batch-of-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccines-arrives-in-canada/story-gEHXbvVcwczacvJjflZGRO.html
14-12-2020||World||Suspected Russian hackers spied on US Treasury emails||Hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, according to people familiar with the matter, adding they feared the hacks uncovered so far may be the tip of the iceberg.The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. US officials have not said much publicly beyond the Commerce Department confirming there was a breach at one of its agencies and that they asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate.National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot added that they “are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The US government has not publicly identified who might be behind the hacking, but three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be responsible for the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major US cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts.The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately return a message seeking comment late Sunday. The cyber spies are believed to have gotten in by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by IT company SolarWinds, which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a “supply chain attack” - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties.In a statement released late Sunday, the Austin, Texas-based company said that updates to its monitoring software released between March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a “highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.” The company declined to offer any further detail, but the sheer diversity of SolarWind’s customer base has sparked concern within the US intelligence community that other government agencies may be at risk, according to four people briefed on the matter. SolarWinds says on its website that its customers include most of America’s Fortune 500 companies, the top 10 US telecommunications providers, all five branches of the US military, the State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Office of President of the United States.‘Huge cyber espionage campaign’The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the US government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department.The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.”The FBI and US National Security Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior US official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-russian-hackers-spied-on-us-treasury-emails/story-yzw2lne8vP8Q5Ih8XA4aCK.html
14-12-2020||World||14 dead in migrant shipwreck between Venezuela and Trinidad||The Venezuelan government said Sunday it had found 14 bodies after a ship carrying migrants bound for Trinidad and Tobago was wrecked en route.The government said in a statement that 11 bodies were found by a Coast Guard patrol on Saturday afternoon, and “today, following up on the events that occurred, we found 3 dead, 2 adult males and 1 female on the beach.”The Trinidadian Coast Guard had said Saturday that Venezuelan authorities informed them that “11 bodies had been recovered that day in waters near the Venezuelan coastal town of Guiria,” in the northeastern state of Sucre.Preliminary information suggested that the boat left on December 6 with more than 20 people on board.Venezuelan opposition deputy Robert Alcala, who represents Sucre state, said that migrant departures to Trinidad often used precarious boats loaded with too much weight.The deputy said the boat was “allegedly detained in Trinidad and was returned to Venezuela,” as part of the island nation’s response to the arrival of Venezuelans fleeing their country’s economic crisis.Citing a police report, he said that the bodies were tied together supposedly to protect themselves from heavy waves and were in an advanced state of decomposition.The Trinidadian Coast Guard, however, said that it had not intercepted any boats from Guiria.Venezuela has been crippled by a political and economic crisis causing runaway inflation, long queues for petrol, shortages of water and gas, and power cuts.The UN estimates that more than five million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015 due to the crisis, some 25,000 of whom fled to Trinidad and Tobago.About 100 people have disappeared during the dangerous journey from Guiria to Trinidad between 2018 and 2019 alone.The island nation, with a population of 1.3 million, says it has facilitated the registration of 16,000 Venezuelans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-dead-in-migrant-shipwreck-between-venezuela-and-trinidad/story-6B2EtUVILfI5a4uXVkIrsL.html

14-12-2020||World||Joe Biden considering former USEPA chief Gina McCarthy for domestic climate czar: Reports||President-elect Joe Biden is considering appointing Gina McCarthy, who headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Barack Obama, as domestic “climate czar” in charge of coordinating climate policies across federal agencies, according to two people familiar with the plan. Biden is also now considering Michael Regan, an African American who runs North Carolina’s environmental agency, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the two sources said.If appointed, Regan would be a surprise choice over one-time frontrunner Mary Nichols, who is retiring from the California Air Resources Board, as environmental justice activists and civil rights leaders push for more diversity at the incoming administration.The Biden transition team did respond to requests for comment. McCarthy, Regan and Nichols did not respond to requests for comment. Biden has made tackling climate change a pillar of his upcoming administration, seeking to restore the United States as a global leader on the issue while forcing all federal agencies to rethink their roles in tackling the problem. Biden, the former Democratic vice president under Obama, selected John Kerry to serve as his global climate czar, making him part of the U.S. national security team and tasking him with coordinating with other counties on the environment.If selected, McCarthy, who currently serves as the president of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a leading national environmental group, would serve as the domestic counterpart to Kerry.Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm is also under consideration, the sources said.Biden is expected to make a slate of announcements later this week that will be heavily scrutinized by the nation’s environmental groups, the sources say, including his pick to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, domestic climate czar and the Interior Department. The sources stressed the choices have not been finalized and the situation remains fluid. Nichols was long considered a frontrunner for the EPA but her nomination now looks less likely as the president-elect seeks to diversify his Cabinet appointments, the sources said.Dozens of environmental justice groups in California recently wrote a letter to Biden opposing Nichols, saying she too often sided with the industry. In an interview with Reuters last week, Nichols defended herself against the criticism, calling it “disappointing” and saying she stands by her work and the people who carried it out.In recent days, Regan has emerged as a surprise leading candidate, according to three sources familiar with the process. Regan has run the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality since 2017 and has been part of the push to hold big companies like Duke Energy accountable for pollution. Under his leadership at the North Carolina agency, Duke Energy agreed to the largest coal ash cleanup in the United States in January.

14-12-2020||World||US government agencies hacked; Russia a possible culprit||Hackers broke into the networks of federal agencies including the Treasury and Commerce departments in attacks revealed just days after US officials warned that cyber actors linked to the Russian government were exploiting vulnerabilities to target sensitive data.The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity arm are investigating what experts and former officials said appeared to be a large-scale penetration of US government agencies.“This can turn into one of the most impactful espionage campaigns on record,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch.The hacks were revealed just days after a major cybersecurity firm disclosed that foreign government hackers had broken into its network and stolen the company’s own hacking tools. Many experts suspect Russia is responsible for the attack against FireEye, a major cybersecurity player whose customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple US government agencies who will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.The attacks were disclosed less than a week after a National Security Agency advisory warned that Russian government hackers were exploiting vulnerabilities in a system used by the federal government, “allowing the actors access to protected data.”The US government did not publicly identify Russia as the culprit behind the hacks, first reported by Reuters, and said little about who might be responsible.National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement that the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”The government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said separately that it has been working with other agencies “regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.”President Donald Trump last month fired the director of CISA, Chris Krebs, after Krebs vouched for the integrity of the presidential election and disputed Trump’s claims of widespread electoral fraud.In a tweet Sunday, Krebs said “hacks of this type take exceptional tradecraft and time” and raised the possibility that it had been underway for months.“This thing is still early, I suspect,” Krebs wrote.Federal government agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers.Hackers linked to Russia were able to break into the State Department’s email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation.Reuters earlier reported that a group backed by a foreign government stole information from Treasury and a Commerce Department agency responsible for deciding internet and telecommunications policy.The Treasury Department deferred comment to the National Security Council. A Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed a “breach in one of our bureaus” and said “we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.” The FBI had no immediate comment.The Washington Post reported Sunday, citing three unnamed sources, that the two federal agencies and FireEye were all breached through the SolarWinds network management system.Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday in an email to The Associated Press that it has a “potential vulnerability” related to updates released earlier this year to its Orion products, which help organizations monitor their online networks for problems or outages.“We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,” said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson in a statement.The comprise is critical because SolarWinds would give a hacker “God-mode” access to the network, making everything visible, said Alperovitch.Last Tuesday, FireEye said that foreign government hackers with “world-class capabilities” broke into its network and stole offensive tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. Those customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them. He said there was no indication they got customer information from the company’s consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams said it seemed clear that both the Treasury Department and FireEye were hacked using the same vulnerability.“The timing of the release here is, I think, not at all a coincidence,” said Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec.He said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.“I suspect that there’s a number of other (federal) agencies we’re going to hear from this week that have also been hit,” Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack — and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Neither Mandia nor a FireEye spokesperson said when the company detected the hack or who might be responsible. But many in the cybersecurity community suspect Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-agencies-hacked-russia-a-possible-culprit/story-wo2zKqzVsilRCnQXcnOePM.html

14-12-2020||World||Pfizer may offer shots to trial volunteers who received placebo||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE may soon allow participants in its Covid-19 vaccine trial to learn whether they received a placebo, rather than the real thing, and get the actual shot if they wish.“Pending required approvals, Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide an option for clinical trial participants who received the placebo to get the vaccine at scheduled time points in the study,” Pfizer said in an emailed statement. “This option will be voluntary and implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is being conducted.”The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees human trials of new drugs and vaccines, didn’t immediately comment.Regulators and ethicists have debated for months over whether to keep participants blind to what they received or to give all trial volunteers the vaccine, which was found to protect people against the deadly virus. Placebo groups are important for comparisons, and giving everyone in the trial the vaccine may reduce the possibility of identifying long-term side effects.John Vanchiere, who leads a trial site at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, said he plans to email the 245 people who participated in the trial through the center to give them instructions pending a final decision on unblinding the trial.Allowing participants who received a placebo to now take the vaccine itself might also hold implications for other vaccine developers, including Moderna Inc., which could receive emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 experimental vaccine as soon as this week.A go-ahead may allow some 19,000 people who received placebos to get Pfizer’s shot, which is in short supply. Pfizer’s emergency use application provided data from 37,586 volunteers, the majority of whom were in the US, according to the FDA. Of those, 18,785 people received a saline placebo.Vanchiere said he has vials of Pfizer’s vaccine stored in an ultra-cold freezer and could start administering the shots as soon as Monday, the same day the vaccine is expected to start being offered to health-care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-may-offer-shots-to-trial-volunteers-who-received-placebo/story-QEvzW6JGEr08qyWiIyh5RO.html
14-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine shipments begin in historic US effort||The first of many freezer-packed Covid-19 vaccine vials made their way to distribution sites across the United States on Sunday, as the nation’s pandemic deaths approached the horrifying new milestone of 300,000.The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, the first to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ushers in the biggest vaccination effort in US history — one that health officials hope the American public will embrace, even as some have voiced initial skepticism or worry. Shots are expected to be given to health care workers and nursing home residents beginning Monday.Quick transport is key for the vaccine, especially since this one must be stored at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Early Sunday, workers at Pfizer — dressed in fluorescent yellow clothing, hard hats and gloves — wasted no time as they packed vials into boxes. They scanned the packages and then placed them into freezer cases with dry ice. The vaccines were then taken from Pfizer’s Portage, Michigan, facility to Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, where the first cargo plane took off amid what airport officials called a “jubilant” mood.Also Read | How Britain approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine before US and EU“This is a historic day,” said Richard W. Smith, who oversees operations in the Americas for FedEx Express, which is delivering 630-some packages of vaccine to distribution sites across the country. United Parcel Service (UPS) also is transporting a share of the vaccine.Helping with the transport of the vaccine has special meaning to Bruce Smith, a FedEx package handler at the Grand Rapids airport, whose older sister, Queen, died after she contracted the coronavirus in May. She was hospitalized in Georgia one day after he saw her on a video chat, and they never spoke again.“I think she would be ecstatic to know that something that has ravaged our family — that a family member is going to be part of such a big project,” said Smith, 58, whose nephew, Queen’s son, also got sick and is still undergoing therapy for stroke-like symptoms. “It is very, very important.”Tracked with GPS-enabled sensors, the initial shipments were expected to contain about 3 million doses, with many more to come. Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with another 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. Doses of the vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, are given out based on each state’s adult population. Then the states decide where they go first.In California, where health care workers will be among the first to be vaccinated, state health officials are prioritizing hospitals that have adequate storage capacity, serve high-risk populations and have the ability to vaccinate people quickly.Initial surveys have found that even some health care workers don’t want to be first in line. Dr. Graham Snyder, who’s led the vaccine task force at Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC, estimates that about half of its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered.But many health officials expect enthusiasm to grow.“There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune,” said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality at the 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi. Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said. Enough vaccine is being saved so that each person who gets the first dose of vaccine can get a second required shot a few weeks later.Senior US government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, are among those who will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, two people familiar with the matter confirmed.A survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about half of Americans want to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Another quarter aren’t sure, while the remaining quarter say they aren’t interested. Some simply oppose vaccines in general. Others are concerned that the vaccines have been rushed and want to see how the rollout goes.Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the FDA, which approved the Pfizer vaccine Friday, has repeatedly insisted that the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.Speaking to Fox News Sunday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser to Operation Warp Speed, a US effort to get vaccines developed quickly, also said he is “very concerned” about the skepticism about the vaccine in some circles.“Unfortunately ... there’s been a confusion between how thorough and scientific and factual the work that has been done is, and the perception that people are thinking that we cut corners ...,” Slaoui said. “I can guarantee you that no such things have happened, that we follow the science.”He called the development of vaccines from several pharmaceutical companies, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, “a remarkable achievement of science, academia, the industry ecosystem and the US government, working together.”While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not to give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed by an expert panel Thursday and soon afterward could be allowed for public use..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-shipments-begin-in-historic-us-effort/story-QgZvlON4lllzD1764MPaAJ.html

Many saw it, and watched. I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation? This was the way for years.”“I am angry to be put in this situation at all. That because I am a woman, I can work hard my whole life to better myself and help others and yet still fall victim as countless women over generations have. Mostly silently. I hate that some men, like @NYGovCuomo abuse their power,” she said in another tweet.Boylan worked for Empire State Development, the state’s economic development public-benefit organisation, until March 2018, when she became deputy secretary for economic development and special adviser to Cuomo, Fox News said.She further said that her first encounter with workplace sexual harassment was during her mother’s first real job after graduating from college.“When my mom got her first real office job after graduating from college when I was in high school. She was so excited to be taken “seriously.” Her bossed isolated her and kissed her. She never had that type of job again. It was then how I learned how hard it is for women. How hard this world can be for us when we are trying to be taken seriously and help our community. How easily jerks can destroy the lives of women,” Boylan said.“And I promised myself I would never let those kinds of guys win. I would work hard my whole life to put myself in positions of power to change things. To end the violence and corruption. Give voice to the voiceless. I am not stopping. I refuse. I will never give up,” she further said. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

I got more votes than any president in the history of our country. In the history of our country, right? Not even close -- 75 million far more than Obama, far more than anybody. And they say we lost an election. We did not lose. If I got 10 million fewer votes, they say I could not have lost.”Speaking on the situation that would arise if he does not concede by the time of Joe Biden’s inauguration, Trump said, “I worry about the country having an illegitimate president. That’s what I worry about.”“A president that lost and lost badly. This was not like a close election. You look at Georgia. We won Georgia big. We won Pennsylvania big. We won Wisconsin big. We won it big,” he added.On Friday, the US Supreme Court had rejected a bid by Texas’ attorney general to block the ballot of voters in battleground states that favoured President-elect Joe Biden.According to a CNN report, the court’s move to dismiss the challenge is the strongest indication yet that Trump has no chance of overturning election results in court that even the justices whom he placed there have no interest in allowing his desperate legal bids to continue.This comes as the US President continues to repeatedly question the legitimacy of Biden’s win, accusing fraud and impropriety in the elections, and seeking recounts in several states, despite election officials in battleground states having already certified the President-elect’s victory in the presidential polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-want-to-talk-about-that-trump-on-attending-biden-s-inauguration-ceremony/story-aHuN7IPYGNetpsUaZOf6XK.html

The study was based on data from 165 countries.Also Read: How chronic air pollution may trigger more Covid deaths in the country“Working in a healthcare facility without water, sanitation and hygiene is akin to sending nurses and doctors to work without personal protective equipment,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.These elements “are fundamental to stopping Covid-19. But there are still major gaps to overcome, particularly in least developed countries.” According to WHO figures, while health professionals make up less than three percent of the population, they account for 14 percent of Covid-19 cases recorded around the world.“Sending healthcare workers and people in need of treatment to facilities without clean water, safe toilets or even soap puts their lives at risk,” said UNICEF chief Henrietta Fore.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe report also found that one in three health facilities around the world could not guarantee hand hygiene, while one in 10 did not have access to sanitation services.The figures are even worse for the world’s 47 least-developed countries (LDCs), where half of healthcare centres have no access to drinking water, a quarter have no access to water for hygiene purposes, and three in five lack basic sanitation services.The WHO and UNICEF calculated that it would cost around $1 per inhabitant to provide basic water services in these countries’ health centres -- and 20 cents each to maintain such facilities each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-centre-water-crisis-increasing-covid-19-risk-who/story-CVe6AEwpdDTxP6BqoX5NXL.html

New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea later told reporters the gunman had died.The shooting occurred outside the landmark cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, located at Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street, about 15 minutes after the conclusion of an outdoor choir performance on the church steps drew an audience of about 200 people.The choir’s annual Christmas holiday concert had been moved outside in keeping with Covid-19 health safety rules. Only about 15 people were still present when the gunman appeared at the top of the steps, screaming, “Kill me,” and “shoot me,” as he fired a handgun, sending bystanders running for cover in panic, according to a Reuters photographer who was on the scene.Police officers who had taken cover ordered the suspect several times to drop his weapon before shooting him, the photographer said. Members of the choir were already back inside the church by the time of the shooting, which lasted several minutes, she said.Reuters photographs of the gunman showed him wearing a black winter coat, a white baseball-style cap and a face mask emblazoned with the flag of the Dominican Republic, as he stood wielding two pistols, one in each hand. He also was carrying a large backpack strapped to his shoulders. Police said officers recovered two firearms from the scene after the shooting.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that “quick action of our NYPD officers kept the crowd safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-open-fires-at-new-york-church-after-outdoor-concert-shot-and-killed-by-police/story-YMytQTJ7ncqLOklCghvwjL.html
14-12-2020||World||Covid-19: White House, other top officials to get early vaccine access||Senior US government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, while its public distribution is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer will be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation’s top leaders, two people familiar with the matter confirmed. They said the move was meant to prevent more Covid-19 spread in the White House, which has already suffered from several outbreaks of the virus that infected Trump and other top officials, and other critical facilities.It was not immediately clear how many officials would be offered the vaccine initially and whether Trump or Pence would get it.The Trump administration is undertaking the vaccination program under federal continuity of government plans, officials said.“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”The two people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The New York Times first reported the news.The move to vaccinate top US officials would be consistent with the rollout of rapid testing machines for the coronavirus, which were similarly controlled by the federal government with kits reserved to protect the White House complex and other critical facilities.According to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is not yet enough information to determine whether those who have had Covid-19 should also get the vaccine. Pence has not come down with the virus, and his aides have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine as the administration looks to boost public confidence in the shot.The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart, meaning Trump administration officials would receive the final shot just weeks before leaving office.The Trump administration’s vaccination plan could prove to be a boon for his successor, as aides to President-elect Joe Biden have been discussing when and how he should receive the vaccine and working to establish plans to boost virus safeguards in the West Wing to keep the 78-year-old Democrat healthy.According to a Capitol Hill official, lawmakers have not been informed how many doses would be made available to them, adding it would be premature to speculate who might receive them. The official was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-white-house-other-top-officials-to-get-early-vaccine-access/story-8sm6WSfQtqmmUZ1uLuVejL.html
14-12-2020||World||Novelist John le Carre, who defined Cold War era, passes away||David Cornwell, better known as John le Carre, whose brief career in British intelligence gave him inputs for a literary career spanning nearly 60 years and 25 books, has died after a short illness aged 89, prompting a flood of tributes across the globe.Among his most popular works are The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which were among many of his works adapted into films and television series. He worked for the British intelligence services in the 1950s and 1960s during the Cold War.Jonny Geller, his agent, said: “For six decades, John le Carré dominated the bestseller lists and review pages with his monumental body of work. His dramatic launch onto the global scene began with the publication of his third novel in 1963, ‘The Spy Who Came in from the Cold’, and the public revelation of his secret life working with the British Intelligence Services”.“Devoting his life to writing, he went on to define the Cold War era with the help of his character, George Smiley, and through his complex plots and beautiful prose, beamed a harsh light at the injustices of our world”, he added.Writer Margaret Atwood said the “Smiley novels are key to understanding the mid-20th century”, while Brazilian author Paul Coelho tweeted: “John le Carre, you were not only a great writer, but a visionary. Enjoy your new home #Rip”.Based in Truro, Cornwall, John le Carre was named as a finalist of the 2011 Man Booker International prize, but he said in a statement issued through his publishers: “(I) do not compete for literary prizes and have therefore asked for my name to be withdrawn.”In a rare media interview, the author, described by several writers as a “literary giant”, expressed his criticism of Brexit and the politics of Prime Minister Boris Johnson while talking to The Guardian in October 2019.He said: “I think Brexit is totally irrational, that it’s evidence of dismal statesmanship on our part, and lousy diplomatic performances. Things that were wrong with Europe could be changed from inside Europe.”“I think my own ties to England were hugely loosened over the last few years. And it’s a kind of liberation, if a sad kind...Mob orators of the sort we have, the Boris Johnson sort, do not speak reason. When you get into that category, your task is to fire up the people with nostalgia, with anger”.Geller, his agent, also shared a short statement on behalf of the family: “It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell – John le Carré – passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness”.“David is survived by his beloved wife of almost fifty years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novelist-john-le-carre-who-defined-cold-war-era-passes-away/story-mD1nds1LXFylFFdXqVNTKI.html

The moves comes in a bid to ensure a smooth interoperable framework for the multiple partners associated with healthcare delivery to individuals in the country.The National Health Authority (NHA), which is the implementing agency, has also notified the final approved policy.The NHA had placed the draft of the policy in the public domain between August 20 and September 21, to seek feedback and suggestions from citizens and stakeholders soon after the launch of the NDHM by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After extensive stakeholder consultations and feedback, the policy was further modified based on inputs received from the public.Also read: Don’t go during the pandemic - AIIMS appeals as nurses’ union threaten strike“After over a month of soliciting feedback from various stakeholders and the general public, we received 910 comments and suggestions via 6,983 emails and through the website. Many of these inputs and suggestions were found to be quite pertinent and deserving more attention. We incorporated them to revise the draft policy and sent it to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for final review and approval. We are happy that the policy has been approved by the health minister and we can now start the field preparations for the roll-out of the NDHM across India,” said Indu Bhushan, CEO, NHA.The policy acts as a guidance document across the National Digital Health Ecosystem (NDHE) and sets out the minimum standard for data privacy protection that should be followed across the board to ensure compliance with relevant and applicable laws, rules and regulations.Participation of an individual in the NDHE will be on a voluntary basis. Those who wish to participate will be issued a unique health ID after verification through a valid government document, including the Aadhaar card.However, use of Aadhaar card for verification will also be voluntary, and failure or refusal to make use of Aadhaar would not result in the denial of access to any health facility or service under the policy.The National Digital Health Blueprint, 2019, recommends that a federated architecture be adopted, instead of a centralised architecture, for the management of digital health data to ensure interoperability, technological flexibility and independence across the NDHE.Government will now work on the guidelines for the implementation of the policy that is likely to be updated from time to time to make it more relevant in the current times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-approves-data-management-policy-to-digitise-healthcare-ecosystem/story-iDznpSynCwyo1nRt8Qo3zO.html
14-12-2020||India||Don’t go during the pandemic: AIIMS appeals as nurses’ union threaten strike||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi on Monday sought cooperation from its nurses and appealed to their union to not to go on an indefinite strike during the coronavirus pandemic, news agency ANI reported. The premier hospital’s administration has also asked the nurses to return to patient care immediately in a bid to fight the viral contagion.Why are the nurses striking?Around 5,000 nurses announced an indefinite strike, helmed by the nurses’ union, starting Monday, over redressal of their demands, including that related to 6th Central Pay Commission. In a letter to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, the nurses’ union has blamed the “callous attitude of the administrations towards nurses” behind the call for the strike, which seeks a solution towards pay for the nurses falling under the 6th Central Pay Commission. The demand has been turned down by the administration, the letter to the hospital chief states. Delhi: AIIMS Nurses Union announces an indefinite strike from today over redressal of their demands, including that related to 6th Central Pay Commission. pic.twitter.com/9zOvs6rb4Z‘Unfortunate’: AIIMS Delhi chief on strikeGuleria rued the call for the strike and urged the frontline workers to help the hospital fight the pandemic. “It’s unfortunate the union has gone on a strike now, only a few months from when a vaccine will provide the solution. I appeal to all nurses, nursing officers to not go on strike and come back, work and help us get through the pandemic,” Guleria said, according to ANI.Guleria said the nurses’ union had put in 23 demands and almost all of them have been met by the AIIMS administration and the government.Also Watch | Nurses at Delhi’s AIIMS go on indefinite strike, Dr Guleria appeals against itWhat does AIIMS Delhi administration say?The administration countered the allegation and said that the strike is in contravention of Delhi High Court’s directions. “Their demands stand discussed with them for resolution. Union abandoned critically patients on demand of perceived anomaly of fixation of initial pay related to 6th CPC of 2006,” ANI quoted AIIMS’ statement.“Nurses’ Union was apprised that their interpretation is not covered under existing instructions of the Finance Ministry. Because nurses were looking for a hike in salary, the Ministry of Health has considered it sympathetically as a fresh demand for consideration,” the statement read.Health ministry intervenes, warns with actionIn a bid to prevent a major breakdown in medical facilities due to the strike, the health ministry late Monday evening stepped in and demanded that there should be no disruption of nursing function at AIIMS Delhi.“It’s hereby directed that AlIMS Delhi should ensure that directions of Delhi High Court are strictly complied with without fail & there should be no cessation or disruption of Nursing functions in AllMS nor such an action aided or abetted,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Bhushan has also cautioned the nurses that non-compliance by the frontline workers will be treated as an offence under the Disaster Management Act read with the Indian Penal Code and action will be taken accordingly against defaulting authorities and employees.The coronavirus disease has infected 9,884,100 people and claimed 143,355 lives so far in the country, according to the health ministry’s data on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-go-during-the-pandemic-aiims-appeals-as-nurses-union-threaten-strike/story-cA3VDovzw8McoRGcOAH2tL.html
14-12-2020||India||‘Concerns over delays in decisions in SC on important constitutional matters’: Congress leader||Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Monday said there are concerns over delays in decisions in the Supreme Court on important constitutional matters, saying the people’s faith in the top court must remain intact as it has a constitutional duty and mandate to uphold the Constitution. Citing the example of the United States and how the Supreme Court there had taken charge after bitter elections, Sharma argued for a similar role in India as well and urged the country’s top court to intervene wherever required to ensure that justice is done. “We have recently seen elections in a large democracy and major power of the world, the United States of America. We saw the narrative too. Yes, it was bitter and that is how the elections are but once these are over, the institutions take charge and slowly people get over acrimony and the bitterness of elections. Here, I would admire the American institutions too, the way their Supreme Court has been functioning,” Sharma said, addressing the annual FICCI AGM. Sharma, a former union minister, said the judiciary in India is independent and the Supreme Court has a constitutional duty and mandate to uphold the Constitution. Also read: Farmers’ best interests in mind, open for talks - Rajnath Singh amid protest“There are concerns when there are delays on important constitutional matters and the bucket is kicked down the road. As the old saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied. When justice is to be done and when interventions are required, my urge to you would be that it is the expectation of you lords that you should do that. We all have faith in you and that faith must be intact,” he added. About the economy, Sharma said the country and the world have been confronted with an extraordinary crisis due to the pandemic which has created enormous destruction. “India was not thrown off-balance like many other countries. We have witnessed major upheavals in our economy and there was a contraction,” he added. The senior Congress leader said there have been huge losses, including 10 million in the organised sector and 40 million in the unorganised sector. Also read: ‘Hospital beds to fall short’ - Bengal BJP chief vows revenge on Trinamool“It is debatable whether the recovery is V-shaped or K-shaped as deposit of salaries below Rs 25,000 in banks has gone down by 20 per cent and is a cause of worry,” he added. “We need to be more generous. We need not look at this year, which is exceptional, for fiscal deficit and FRBM numbers and we have to breach the limits, even if we have to go towards partial monetisation to give more stimulus to the industry including wage support and guarantees. But as of now, it appears the North Block is clueless about this crisis which we may face in the next financial year,” Sharma claimed. “Perhaps there is room to do more and that is why I urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government to do so,” he said, adding the stimulus was far less than the 10 per cent of the GDP and will take another year to come back to 2019-20 levels. The former union minister also called upon the government to involve chief ministers in resolving the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three new agricultural laws, saying any reform needs to be backed by national consensus. “Today, what we are seeing is turbulence and protests on the farm laws. Reforms must be participatory, not arbitrary. There must be consultations. Nothing should be rushed through or done without building a consensus. That results in what we are seeing - agitation, conflict and the loss of trust,” he said. “I personally feel that through dialogue, negotiations and persuasion, everything can be resolved. We have chief ministers of states and they must be involved and let’s get over this crisis too, together as a nation,” Sharma added. The Congress leader said he is a votary of reforms but they have always been backed by national consensus that gives predictability and confidence to partner countries and investors. “What worries me today is the binary of ‘we versus you’. This is dangerous and it should not happen in our country. We all Indians are patriots,” he said. Sharma said in a democracy the opposition is needed. “The chariot of democracy must have the government as well as a robust, effective and responsible opposition,” he added.He also credited people, society and the government for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic together as a nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-delays-in-decisions-in-sc-on-important-constitutional-matters-congress-leader/story-Gz4uxb5cw4LppE8ZmTlf6L.html

The VHP is likely to convene a meeting in Varanasi to plan out the successful execution of the campaign. According to political observers, the campaign will be crucial in the North-Eastern states and West Bengal. Assembly elections are due in Assam next year where the BJP is in power. Another important state for the BJP which goes to poll next year is West Bengal. “Construction of Ram Mandir is an achievement for the BJP. The campaign will help the party convey this point to the masses,” said a BJP leader, not willing to be quoted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had presided over ‘bhoomi pujan’ of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on August 5. At present, the testing work of foundation pillars of the temple is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nationwide-campaign-to-apprise-people-of-ram-mandir-s-history-to-begin-from-jan-15/story-IMqbeZJUXbCXpEPoOIhQIK.html

Those apprehended by the Lankan navy hailed from Rameswaram and Puthukottai, even as seven boats were also seized, they added. The fishermen were picked up by the island nation’s navy while they were fishing near Neduntheevu there, a senior Fisheries department official said. While 27 fishermen hailed from Rameswaram, the others were from Puthukottai. They are likely to be produced before a Sri Lankan court on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the local fisheries authorities refused fishing permits to 23 Indian boats for allegedly damaging the nets of their Sri Lankan counterparts recently. The Sri Lankan authorities had taken up the matter with Indian officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lankan-navy-apprehends-47-indian-fishermen/story-qpchm3Vtt9r6JdTrEL93jN.html

There is some development activity which has been going on in Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Every nation will continue to make preparations to boost its security based on its strategic interests.“I don’t think there should be much concern in that because we, on our side, are also carrying out similar activities,” Rawat told reporters after the launch of indigenously built state-of-the-art stealth frigate ‘Himgiri’ at Defence PSU Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers here.Indian Armed forces will leave no stone unturned to safeguard the country’s frontiers, he insisted.“China’s attempt to change the status quo on the Line of Actual Control along the northern borders amidst the Covid-19 pandemic necessitated high levels of preparation on land, sea and in the air,” the CDS said.The Indian Army, following the Doklam stand-off in 2017, has taken measures to ensure that the situation does not escalate there any further, he maintained.Indian forces are carefully watching the activities of the PLA at Doklam, where the armies of the two most populous countries in the world were engaged in a 73-day eyeball-to- eyeball stand-off in 2017.Also Read | ‘High levels of preparation underway on land, sea and air’: CDS Bipin Rawat amid standoff with China“We have taken necessary action to counter anything that would be a cause of concern to our national security,” he said, when asked about possible Chinese misadventures in the eastern sector, in the midst of the Ladakh impasse.The CDS further said that the Indian Armed forces have adequate strength and reserves to counter any threat, and is looking to equip themselves with more cutting-edge technology.“Time has come now to look at the future of war fighting, imbibing technology into our systems,” he said.Talking about the continuous ceasefire violation by Pakistan, he said India is fully prepared to deal with it and that it is the other side which should be more concerned about carrying out such activities.Asked whether India should have more submarines or procure another aircraft carrier, Rawat said both have their advantages and disadvantages.“Submarines have a separate place in naval warfare, in domination of the seas, and so does an aircraft carrier,” he said, maintaining that the Navy needs an air wing.The country needs to utilise its large number of island territories for strengthening security along the sea lanes of communication, Rawat said.He also said that islands can be an option for launching naval strike aircraft.“Once we have studied all that and understood in detail, we will take a call,” he asserted.Rawat said that the three forces -- Army, Navy and Air Force -- will be integrated, while retaining the niche capabilities of each service.“We strongly believe that no single force or no single service can succeed in any conflict situation if we are to face conflict with our adversaries anywhere -- whether it is land, air or sea,” he said.The integration will ensure synergised application of the country’s combat potentials, the CDS said.“We have successfully overcome some of the misconceptions about force restructuring by allowing space to each force to develop niche capabilities based on their strengths, and thus enhance our overall combat power,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-pla-carrying-out-development-work-in-tibet-india-ready-for-any-eventuality-says-cds-rawat/story-0iKns97x0LKpBuXNJwmZGJ.html

14-12-2020||India||India, Iran, Uzbekistan hold first meeting on joint use of Chabahar port||India, Iran and Uzbekistan on Monday discussed the joint use of Chabahar port to enhance regional connectivity as the three countries held their first trilateral meeting focused on the strategic trade and transit facility in the Gulf of Oman. The first virtual meeting of the trilateral working group was a follow-up to a suggestion by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev during a summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday that the three countries should jointly promote Chabahar port. “During the meeting, the participants discussed joint use of Chabahar port for trade and transit purposes and enhanced regional connectivity. All sides also noted the significant role played by Chabahar port for the region to deliver humanitarian assistance during the Covid pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The statement didn’t give further details on whether the three sides had proposed any measures regarding the joint use of the port. The meeting was jointly chaired by India’s secretary (shipping) Sanjeev Ranjan, Uzbekistan’s deputy transport minister D Dehkanov and Iran’s deputy transport minister Shahram Adamnejad. All the countries welcomed India’s proposal to hold a “Chabahar Day” on the margins of the International Maritime Summit to be hosted by New Delhi in January next year. India currently operates one of the terminals of Chabahar port that it has developed. The strategic project has been given a waiver from sanctions imposed by the US on Iran in view of its importance in shipping cargo and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The prospects of Chabahar took a hit after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and re-imposed crippling sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. However, president-elect Joe Biden has said he will offer Iran a “credible path back to diplomacy” since dealing with Tehran’s nuclear programme is the best way to achieve stability in the region. These developments had resulted in renewed interest in Chabahar, and the external affairs ministry said last week it welcomes Uzbekistan’s interest in using the port as a transit facility. “This would open up economic opportunities for the traders and business community of the region. Besides Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries have also shown interest in using the port. India seeks to cooperate closely with regional countries on this issue,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-iran-uzbekistan-hold-first-meeting-on-joint-use-of-chabahar-port/story-YWtef36CdFdY1yz8kqIvAM.html
14-12-2020||India||‘Hospital beds to fall short’: Bengal BJP chief vows revenge on Trinamool||With at least two Bharatiya Janata Party workers allegedly killed in political clashes since Saturday, the BJP’s Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh warned the ruling Trinamool of revenge on Monday. “Till date we have broken the law to hold rallies. Now we would violate the law to thrash you. Every single strike will hit the target. Hospital beds would fall short. I am warning you. We can do it,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s Bengal unit. Ghosh was speaking at a Cha Chakra (tea party) at Gangarampur in north Bengal’s South Dinajpur district. “The people of Bengal should see how indecent a leader of a national political party can be and should isolate them (BJP). He is not speaking a political language. This is the language of goons,” said Saugata Roy, Trinamool MP. This is not the first time that the BJP has issued such a dire warning. A day after the attack on BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy on Thursday in South 24 Parganas, Ghosh had said he was “noting everything”.“Thrash us. But thrash us only to that extent which you can take back. I am noting down everything in a red diary. We will return everything with interest. There would be change as well as revenge,” Dilip Ghosh had tweeted. The BJP has also floated a slogan “There would be change as well as revenge”. The slogan is there on the party’s social media account. The slogan is being seen as a reply to TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee’s slogan “We need change, not revenge” before the historic 2011 polls in which she overthrew the 34-year-old Left government. The BJP has alleged that more than 100 party workers have been killed and around 1,500 are languishing in jails after being implicated in false cases during the TMC regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospital-beds-to-fall-short-bengal-bjp-chief-vows-revenge-on-trinamool/story-ynfUUgIUi6NdnhYI4ywwxK.html

14-12-2020||India||Development projects to top agenda for India-Bangladesh summit on Dec 17||Connectivity and cross-border development projects are expected to top the agenda for a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on December 17.The meeting will also focus on giving impetus to bilateral relations after they were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and Bangladesh’s misgivings about the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The two prime ministers will hold “comprehensive discussions on the entire spectrum of the bilateral relationship, including further strengthening cooperation in the post-Covid era”, the external affairs ministry said on Monday.As first reported by HT last month, the two sides are expected to sign four memorandums of understanding (MoUs) during the virtual summit. The Chilahati-Haldibari rail link, which was closed during the 1965 war with Pakistan, will be revived during the summit and some more projects will be inaugurated by the two leaders, Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters in Dhaka on Sunday. This will be the fifth rail link between the two countries.Momen said the “Swadhinata Sarak”, a road linking India with Mujibnagar, the town in Bangladesh’s Meherpur district where the provisional government was formed in 1971, will be opened on March 26 next year to mark 50 years of the country’s independence and to boost people-to-people ties.PM Modi, who had to call off a visit to Bangladesh this year due to the pandemic, is expected to attend the independence day celebrations next year.Momen said the Bangladesh side will raise all issues, including sharing of river waters, at the upcoming summit. Describing India as a “time-tested friend of Bangladesh”, Momen said it was necessary to acknowledge former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi’s contributions to the country’s independence.The Bangladesh side is expected to raise the issue of sharing the waters of the Teesta river. The two sides completed negotiations on a water-sharing deal on the Teesta in 2011, but the agreement has been held up since then due to opposition from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Ahead of the virtual summit, Indian envoy Vikram Doraiswami met Hasina on December 10 and informed her of the Indian prime minister’s desire to take forward ties. A planned visit to New Delhi on December 8 by Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen couldn’t go ahead as he tested positive for Covid-19.With China stepping up development aid for Bangladesh, New Delhi has worked to remove irritants in ties with Dhaka and sped up work on connectivity and transit projects. In July, India provided 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh, days after the first container train made its way to the Bangladeshi side and the first shipment of goods was sent from Kolkata to Tripura via Chattogram port. The ground-breaking ceremony for the 130-km India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, which will supply fuel from Numaligarh Refinery in Assam to a depot at Dinajpur in Bangladesh, was held on December 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/development-projects-to-top-agenda-for-india-bangladesh-summit-on-dec-17/story-atGTGfLqczpbOhA1CdwxUK.html
14-12-2020||India||Centre for new tribunal for Krishna water sharing between Andhra, Telangana||Union Jal Sakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in his letter to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday indicated that the Centre is considering setting up a new tribunal to decide the sharing of Krishna river water between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.Alternatively, the Centre will refer the matter to the existing second Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-II), after obtaining legal opinion, he said.The KWDT-II, headed by Justice Brijesh Kumar, in its judgment on December 30, 2010, allocated a total share of 1,001 tmc ft (thousand million cubic feet) to Andhra Pradesh, 911 tmc ft to Karnataka and 666 tmc ft to Maharashtra in Krishna river water.However, after the bifurcation of the combined state of Andhra Pradesh in June 2014, Telangana has been demanding revised allocation of Krishna water to the two Telugu states since they were separated. The Centre referred the matter to KWDT-II again under Section 89 of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, asking for project-wise allocation of the Krishna water, but the tribunal did not take it up, on the ground that its terms of reference did not permit the same.Telangana chief minister in his letter to the Centre on October 2 this year requested that the matter be referred to a new tribunal or again to KWDT-II under Inter-State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 so that fresh allocations be made to the two states.KCR reminded that the Telangana government had made similar representations to the Centre in 2014 and 2018 as well.In his latest letter to the Telangana CM, Shekawat, however, said the publication of KWDT-II award given in 2010 was stayed by the Supreme Court in 2011 based on a petition by filed the then combined Andhra Pradesh government and after bifurcation of the state, Telangana, too, impleaded in it.He also reminded that Telangana had gone to Supreme Court in 2015 seeking setting up of a new tribunal or re-mandate KWDT-II under Section-3 of the ISRWD-1956 for reallocation of water between the two Telugu states. “This matter is still pending in SC and so, the matter being sub-Judice, the Centre can act only after hearing from SC. But now, Telangana has agreed to withdraw its petition in the SC and therefore, the Centre will consider establishment of a new tribunal or alternatively refer the matter to the KWDT-II, after obtaining legal opinion,” the Union minister said.On the complaint lodged by the Telangana government over the alleged unauthorised expansion of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator project and construction of Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme on Krishna river in the backwaters of Srisailam reservoir by Andhra Pradesh government, the Union minister said any new project on the river would not be allowed.He reminded that his ministry as well as Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had written many times to the Andhra government not to go ahead with the Pothireddypadu or Rayalaseema lift projects until they were technically appraised and cleared by Central Water Commission and sanctioned by the apex council.At the same time, Shekawat reminded that the expansion of Kaleshwaram lift irrigation scheme on Godavari river by the Telangana government seeking to draw another three tmc ft water per day from the river was also unauthorised and should not be taken up.“As per the agreement at the apex council meeting held on October 6, both the states should submit detailed project reports (DPRs) of new projects to the respective boards on Krishna and Godavari rivers immediately for appraisal and subsequent sanction by the apex council,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-for-new-tribunal-for-krishna-water-sharing-between-andhra-telangana/story-4KDodqPuiSEL2HQCj68ubN.html
14-12-2020||India||Centre releases Rs 42,000 crore to states towards GST compensation shortfall||The Union finance ministry announced on Monday the central government has borrowed Rs 42,000 crore since October to meet the shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation to states. In its statement, the finance ministry said that Rs 6,000 crore has been released on Monday, the latest in a series of weekly instalments, of which Rs 5516.60 crore has been released to 23 states and Rs 483.40 crore has been released to three Union territories of Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry. Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim are the five remaining states with no gap in revenue, the ministry added.A shortfall of Rs 1.10 lakh crore in revenue was estimated on account of implementation of GST following which a special borrowing window was enabled in October this year. The government would borrow through this special window on behalf of the states and UTs. Seven rounds of borrowing have been done since October and the amount borrowed in these rounds were released to the states on October 23, November 2, November 9, November 23, December 1, December 7, and December 14.“The amount released this week was the 7th instalment of such funds provided to the States. The amount has been borrowed this week at an interest rate of 5.1348%. So far, an amount of Rs.42,000 crore has been borrowed by the Central Government through the special borrowing window at an average interest rate of 4.7712%,” the statement read.Apart from the funds released through this special borrowing, states that pick option 1 to meet the GST compensation shortfall are also allowed to borrow funds equivalent to 0.5 per cent of their Gross States Domestic Product (GSDP). Also, the entire additional amount of Rs 106,830 crore (0.50 per cent of GSDP) could also be borrowed by the states under this provision, the statement said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-releases-rs-42-000-crore-to-states-towards-gst-compensation-shortfall/story-cAi7AsdgmG0ofZL8Rc6nVN.html
14-12-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee in north Bengal to boost party’s morale, counter BJP||A fortnight after Trinamool congress heavyweight and MLA from Cooch Behar (South) Mihir Goswami switched over to the BJP, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee arrived in north Bengal on Monday to boost morale of party workers and stem out any further erosion in its ranks ahead of the crucial state elections next year.Goswami described his decision to join BJP as a “crusade against immoral and incorrect happenings” in the state, especially against “injustice” in north Bengal, a saffron stronghold.CM Banerjee is scheduled to hold a rally in Cooch Behar (south) on Wednesday. “This is her second district tour this month. Earlier this month she had camped in West Midnapore, West Burdwan and North 24 Parganas. Banerjee, who reached Jalpaiguri on Monday, is expected to meet party leaders of Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar districts and hold rallies with party workers over the next two days,” said a TMC leader. That the TMC is jittery with north Bengal was also evident when the party’s youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee, CM Banerjee’s nephew, and election strategist Prashant Kishor rushed to north Bengal in October to iron out differences in the ranks. North Bengal is crucial for both the TMC and the BJP after the latter wrested seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the region in 2019 and managed to win 18 of the state’s 42 seats. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight seats in north Bengal, the BJP is ahead of the TMC in 35. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats. “She [Mamata Banerjee] has asked party leaders in the north Bengal districts to arrange for rallies with at least 20 workers from each booth. She is likely to send out some message to rebel leaders and boost the morale of booth level workers,” said a TMC worker. Back in Kolkata, the BJP upped its ante against the ruling party in the state, publishing a brochure titled ‘TMC Fail Card’ to highlight the alleged failures and corruption of the Mamata Banerjee administration. “Till date we have broken the law to hold rallies. Now we would violate the law to thrash you. Hospital beds would fall short,” said Dilip Ghosh, the BJP’s head in West Bengal. The BJP has alleged that at least two of its party workers were killed in North Parganas and East Burdwan since Saturday. A few days back, the TMC had launched a report card to highlight achievements of the Mamata Banerjee government in the last 10 years. The TMC also launched a massive outreach program where leaders and workers would be visiting 10 million households with the report card. “We need not say anything. Our achievements have been acknowledged by the union government. We have topped in providing 100-days of work. The centre has said that we have laid down the maximum village roads. We have ranked first in building houses for poor people in rural Bengal. In MSME sector we are also the topper, So what would they (BJP) tell in their failure card and how will they explain,” said Sovandeb Chatterjee, state power minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-in-north-bengal-to-boost-party-s-morale-counter-bjp/story-e5LzMqBb1Y8GxKzjjdwbFJ.html

14-12-2020||India||Drama continues after BTC polls results in Assam; lone Cong winner joins BJP||Results of the election to Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) were announced on Saturday, but the political drama continues in Assam. With no party emerging as the clear winner in the 40-member council, which administers Kokrajhar, Udalguri, Baksa and Chirang districts (collectively called the Bodoland Territorial Region), parties are trying to keep their elected members together for fear of poaching. Though Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) won 17 seats, the United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL), which won 12 seats, joined hands with the BJP (9) and Gana Surakha Party (1) to cross the 21-figure mark needed to stake claim to power. On Sunday, Governor Jagadish Mukhi, who was administering the BTR since March after election was deferred due to Covid-19, accepted the claim made by the UPPL, the BJP and the GSP to form the new executive council in BTC. But wary of the BPF (which was in power in BTC for 17 years since 2003 till the promulgation of Governor’s rule this March), of poaching their members, the BJP-UPPL-GSP combine kept their newly elected members at hotel in Guwahati since Saturday night while keeping a tab on their phone calls. Also read: India’s retail inflation eases in November, is still above RBI’s 4% benchmarkDespite being dumped by the BJP, its partner in the Assam’s ruling coalition, the BPF is said to be trying to win over some members from the UPPL or the BJP to form the next executive council in the BTC. The party needs just 4 members to reach 21. “The BPF is trying to get in touch with our members and offering cash incentives to switch, but that’s not going to happen. Instead, many of their elected members are in touch with us and may join us soon,” UPPL chief and designated chief executive member (CEM) of BTC, Pramod Boro, told journalists on Monday. Boro will take oath of office at Kokrajhar on Tuesday along with a few other members. The ceremony will be attended by Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other dignitaries. “Five members will take oath on Tuesday. Two of them will be from UPPL-a CEM and deputy CEM, two from BJP and one from GSP. The BJP is not staking claim to either the CEM or deputy CEM’s posts,” said state education and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. In a related development, the lone Congress winner Sajal Kumar Singha, who won from the Srirampur seat, switched sides and joined the BJP on Monday in presence of Sarma and other senior party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drama-continues-after-btc-polls-results-in-assam-lone-cong-winner-joins-bjp/story-ypEOgQCzPgGDG6jN19zuyJ.html
14-12-2020||India||To encourage participation, PM Modi interacts with key industries leaders, startups from space sector||Months after the formation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) seeking to open up space infrastructure to the private sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday interacted with key industries, startups and academia from the sector to encourage their participation, Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. “Union Cabinet led by the PM Modi took the historic decision in June 2020 to open up Space sector and enable participation of the Indian private sector in the entire gamut of space activities,” the PMO said.The statement said that several ventures have submitted proposals with IN-SPACe under the department of space. “The proposals pertain to a vast range of activities including satellite constellation, small satellite launch vehicles, ground station, geospatial services, propulsion systems and application products,” it added.During the meeting, PM Modi thanked the participants for providing feedback on the latest reforms. “The decision to unlock India’s potential in the Space sector has heralded a new age of public-private partnership in this sector,” he said. The Prime Minister also noted the pans of companies to make rockets and satellites as he assured complete and wholehearted support from the government.He also said that private investment in the sector will lead to the creation of hi-tech jobs, which will provide a host of opportunities to the talent pool in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), National Institute of Technology (NIT) and other technical institutions. “Just like Indian talent has been able to attain worldwide fame in the IT sector, it will be able to do so in the Space sector as well, as per the official statement,” the statement quoted the PM as saying.In June, the government opened the space sector to private participation in far-reaching reforms. Hailing it as “historic”, the government had said the move will free up the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) to focus on research and development while providing opportunities to expand India’s space exploration and technology through private participation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-encourage-participation-pm-modi-interacts-with-key-industries-leaders-startups-from-space-sector/story-K5c5GlkxE9cMrh76w1zY2O.html
14-12-2020||India||‘Let us shape glorious Goa,” tweets Goa CM as BJP sweeps zilla panchayat polls||The BJP has swept the elections in two zilla parishad constituencies in Goa, winning a simple majority in each of the two district panchayats and leaving the principal opposition party the Congress behind. The Congress is still feeling the effects of losing more than two-thirds of its MLAs to the BJP just a little more than a year ago.The BJP has won 32 of the 48 seats that went to the polls winning both the district panchayats comfortably while independent candidates won seven seats, the Congress four, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party three, and the Nationalist Congress Party won one. One BJP candidate was elected unopposed.The Aam Aadmi Party opened its account in the state for the first time winning a single seat.The party has claimed that the victory is a vindication of the leadership of Pramod Sawant as the chief minister who has faced criticism both from within his party as well as from the opposition for the handling of the lockdown, the pandemic as well as for his pushing through a controversial railway double-tracking project. Also read: Farmers’ best interests in mind, open for talks: Rajnath Singh amid protest I humbly bow down before the people of Goa for the trust they have reposed onto the Bharatiya Janata Party as well as the Govt of Goa working under my leadership. Let us shape a glorious and Swayampurna (Self Reliant) Goa by taking ahead the same trust and confidence!“I humbly bow down before the people of Goa for the trust they have reposed onto the Bharatiya Janata Party as well as the Govt of Goa working under my leadership. Let us shape a glorious and Swayampurna (Self Reliant) Goa by taking ahead the same trust and confidence!” Sawant tweeted soon after the party emerged victorious. “The rural areas in Goa have supported the BJP. Social media agitations, Tamnar project, double tracking, coal IIT... all NGOs, political parties started these agitations and tried to defame the government on social media. This result is a slap on their faces and a certificate for the good work done by the BJP,” state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, said. As the results began to trickle in, the BJP went ahead in early trends and never looked back. The party, however, in a crucial match, lost seats to the opposition candidates in areas where the MLAs have defected from the Congress to the BJP.The result is a significant improvement on the party’s 2015 tally wherein it had won 18 seats while the independents grabbed a lion’s share, winning 15 seats. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party had not participated in the 2015 zilla panchayat polls, instead fielded its candidates as independents. The result has also indicated that the BJP has managed to, for now, win back the support of the politically significant Bahujan Samaj in Goa which had deserted the party in the 2017 assembly elections resulting in the BJP being reduced to a paltry share of 13 seats in the 40-member Goa Legislative Assembly. The elections which were to be held in March this year were postponed on account of the Covid-19 lockdown and were finally held on December 12 but suffered from a poor voter turnout on account of fear of the pandemic as well as disillusionment among voters.The state witnessed a voter turnout of 56.82 per cent with 4.50 lakh of the 7.92 lakh voters eligible for voting having cast their vote, which was more than 10 per cent lower than the voting percentage at the previous zilla panchayat elections held five years ago.The BJP fielded 43 candidates on 48 seats, the Congress fielded 38, while the Aam Aadmi Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party had 17 candidates each in the fray. Seventy-nine people contested as independent candidates.The ruling BJP has a commanding majority among the MLAs, who often sponsor their own candidates for the district panchayat polls with 27 of the 40 MLAs owing allegiance to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party after 12 of the 17 Congress MLAs elected on party tickets back in 2017 having moved to the BJP.The party has however lost crucial seats where candidates sponsored by its MLAs have been defeated by independent candidates or by opposition Congress MLAs including in Santa Cruz, Nuvem and Colvale constituencies where the Congress or the independents have managed to win the seat despite having lost their MLAs to the BJP.With the zilla panchayat bodies performing only a nominal role, the polls are seen more as a preliminary test for political parties ahead of the state assembly elections a little more than a year away in early 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-us-shape-glorious-goa-tweets-goa-cm-as-bjp-sweeps-zilla-panchayat-polls/story-EQj6oN5kXWtBBKVNZmvM8L.html
14-12-2020||India||Process begins for reopening of places of worship in Odisha||After being closed for about nine months due to Covid-19 outbreak, the Odisha government on Monday said the process for reopening religious institutions has started, a top official said.Following decline in single-day Covid-19 positive cases, the authorities are now mulling reopening of religious places for devotees, he said.While the number of daily Covid-19 cases was 644 on November 14, it has almost halved to 322 on December 14. District collectors have been empowered to take a decision to open the religious places in their respective districts after discussing with stakeholders and putting standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place, Chief Secretary A K Tripathy informed in a tweet.There was a state-wide demand to reopen temples, churches and mosques after the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) initiated measures to throw open the 12th century shrine in Puri for devotees from December 23. All public places of worship are closed since March March 22 following the outbreak of Covid-19. The State Endowments Commission has recommended to the state government to reopen temples across Odisha with strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol, said Endowment Commissioner Chittaranjam Mohapatra. Meanwhile, the SJTA has sought the state government’s approval for reopening the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri in a graded manner from December 23, an official said. While the local residents of Puri will get the first opportunity to enter the temple in the first five days of its reopening, the temple will remain closed on January 1 and 2 in view of the possibility of the rush of devotees to the pilgrim town on New Year’s Day.From January 3 onwards, the temple is likely to be kept open for all.Bhubaneshwar, the ‘city of temples’, still preserves 700 temples, around which the religious life of the city revolves. The state capital is not only a major destination for tourists but also for pilgrims. Shree Lingaraj Temple, Ananta Vasudeva Temple, Mukteshwar Temple, Brahmeshwar Temple, Rajarani Temple in the state capital are among the well known religious sites for Hindus.There are above 8,000 temples which are more than 100 years old across Odisha, says Anil Dhir, a history researcher and project co-ordinator of INTACH.The Christian community is also anxiously waiting for reopening of churches as Christmas is approaching. “We have to take permission from the district collector before reopening churches on the occasion of Christmas,” said a senior church leader. The Oriya Baptist Church in Cuttack, Church of Christ in Bhubaneswar, Kritangiya Miracle Church at Kandhamal are some of the places of worship of the Christians.All India Christian Council, Odisha Chapter leader P R Parichha said, there are about 3,000 churches in the state.The number of mosques in Odisha is estimated to be more than 2,000.Madrasa Masjid in Bhubaneswar, Kadam Rasul Masjid and Shahi Mosque in Cuttack are the prominent mosques in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/process-begins-for-reopening-of-places-of-worship-in-odisha/story-wRMk4c0qKOT7BefZZwu8aO.html
14-12-2020||India||WhatsApp refutes in SC claims of ‘unsecure’ payment services system, says ‘Absolutely baseless’,||Messaging service WhatsApp on Monday refuted before the Supreme Court the claims that it’s payment services system was not secure and reliable and can be hacked by Israeli spy software ‘Pegasus’.The ‘Pegasus’ issue was referred by senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal, appearing for Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam, who has filed a plea alleging breach of financial data security of Indians using ‘Unified Payments Interface’ (UPI) services by Amazon Pay, GooglePay and others.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde referred to Venugopal’s submission and told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for WhatsApp, that a serious allegation was made against WhatsApp that it can be hacked.“Krishnan Venugopal has made a serious allegation that your system (WhatsApp) can be hacked by something called ‘Pegasus’,” the bench said.Sibal, while denying the allegations, said, “Absolutely baseless. There is no such pleading (in the writ petition). It is just an oral submission made across the bar without basis.”Venugopal also asserted that another issue in the case was data localisation.“Problem with WhatsApp, Amazon and Google is that when they allow payment to happen and data goes abroad. Critical financial data is allowed to be accessed by companies abroad and RBI justifies it. This is a violation of privacy judgment as my data is being grossly misused as these companies then collect this data and use it for advertisement purposes,” Venugopal said.He added that all the data is being shared with the parent companies in violation of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) guidelines.“The data is being processed by the infrastructure of the parent company. The RBI has allowed WhatsApp, even when the case is pending before the court, to go ahead and share this data with companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc without any circular or formal regulation,” Venugopal further argued.After a brief hearing, the apex court posted the matter for further hearing in January.The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Viswam, a Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, who has alleged breach of financial data security of Indians using UPI services offered by big players like Amazon Pay, GooglePay and challenging the permission to WhatsApp to start UPI services.The plea also sought directions to the Reserve Bank of India for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms are not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.On October 15, the apex court had sought responses from the Central government, RBI, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and others including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, WhatsApp and Amazon Inc on the plea.Viswam has sought directions to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that the data collected on UPI platforms is not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.“In India, the UPI payments system is being regulated and supervised by RBI and NPCI, however, the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations and protecting and securing the sensitive data of users are compromising the interest of the Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services,” the plea said.“The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of “Big Four Tech Giants’, Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations,” it added.The plea claimed that this conduct of RBI and NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been “continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data”, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-refutes-in-sc-claims-of-unsecure-payment-services-system-says-absolutely-baseless/story-aTDoqFB6cWdIwAmzTPsMBK.html

14-12-2020||India||Farmers’ best interests in mind, open for talks: Rajnath Singh amid protest||As farmers leaders in various parts of the country participated in the day-long fast on Monday to protest against the new agriculture sector reforms, further upping their agitation, defence minister Rajnath Singh hailed agriculture as “mother sector” and also underlined that the government is always open to discussion and dialogue.“There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever. The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India’s farmers in mind,” he said, hours before agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the government’s request to farmers to have dialogue with the government.“The hunger strike call given by farmer leaders was successful,” said Baldev Singh, a farmer leader at Singhu border of Delhi and Haryana, where tens of thousands of farmers have gathered since November 27.Elsewhere, a large group of farmers on Monday tried to block the key Delhi-Jaipur national highway at Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border, but were prevented from doing so by the police. At Gazipur, on Delhi-Noida border, the traffic was blocked for some time by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Takait) faction for some time. Rakesh Takait said that the traffic was blocked to tell the administration that they can block the traffic but were not doing it so that people are not inconvenienced. Farmers raised slogans outside the offices of district commissioners and took out protest marches in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, following a nationwide call given by their unions against the new central laws. The Haryana police closed the Ambala-Patiala highway after protesters gathered at the Shambhu border point adjoining Punjab. Many of these farmers were on their way to Singhu border, which has become the epicenter of farmer protests against the three farm laws.The ruling Congress also held protests in Punjab, with the state unit chief Sunil Jakhar participating in one near the Shambhu border. Shiromani Akali Dal workers protested in Amritsar. In Punjab, farmers protested in several districts including Ludhiana, Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Bathinda, Moga, Faridkot, Ferozepur and Tarn Taran.“Farmers held protests outside the offices of deputy commissioners at several places in Punjab,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said. This farmer union had not participated in the day-long hunger strike saying they were not consulted.In Haryana, the farmers came out in large numbers and took out protest marches before holding day-long demonstrations outside the offices of deputy commissioners (DCs) as the agitation against Centre’s three farm laws evoked massive response on Monday. Not only the opposition parties but also different employees associations such as Haryana Sarv Karamchari Sangh and Asha workers association extended support to the peasants protests. The protests remained peaceful. The farmers held protests outside the offices of DCs in Rohtak, Hisar, Bhiwani, Sonepat, Jhajjar, Jind, Fatehabad and other districts and took out protest march after a nationwide call given by their unions. “Everybody should come forward to join this fight for the future of the farming community. We are happy with the support from different sections and sectors,” said Ratan Mann, Haryana BKU (Tikait) state president.In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party workers clashed with police at various places as they were prevented from marching towards collectors’ offices. Clashes were reported from Lucknow, Hardoi, Agra, Gorakhpur, Etawah and some other districts. In Agra, the police used mild force to disperse protesting Samajwadi Party workers.“Samajwadi Party supports farmers’ demands. Its sympathy lies with farmers. The ‘kisan yatra’ was started by the SP on December 7. The party workers are holding dharna at all the district headquarters in the state today. I have been arrested in Sandila and many party leaders are under house arrest,” said SP law-maker Rajpal Kashyap.Reports also came from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala of protests being organised by farmer bodies at district headquarters. In support of farmers, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues and his Punjab counterpart observed a day-long fast and appealed to the Central government to listen to farmers. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot also asked the Centre to repeal the farm laws as being demanded by 32 farmer organisations protesting at the Delhi-Haryana border.As farmers intensified their protests against the newly enacted farm laws, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday asserted that agriculture was a “mother sector” and there was no question of taking any “retrograde steps” against it ever. He also said that government is always open to discussion and dialogue.“There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever. The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India’s farmers in mind,” he said, hours before agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the government’s request to farmers to have dialogue with the government.In view of the nationwide protest, the Delhi Police had enhanced security at city border points. Containers, multi-layered cemented barriers, barbed wires and additional police force was deployed at various borders, where the farmers have been protesting. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-best-interests-in-mind-open-for-talks-rajnath-singh-amid-protest/story-aL5d8eoiMuZ8eIX3FBr9iK.html

14-12-2020||India||Statements by BJP leaders on farmers’ protest ‘most unfortunate’, says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday slammed remarks made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on farmers’ protest, calling it “most unfortunate and condemnable”. Taking to Twitter, the senior Congress leader also urged the Centre to find mutual ground and address the issues raised by the protesting farmers.“The statements issued by BJP leaders decrying farmers’ protest are most unfortunate and condemnable. The government must find an amicable solution and address the grievances of farmers sympathetically instead of blaming gangs, anti-national elements for these protests,” Gehlot tweeted.The Congress leader’s comment comes amid ongoing protests being carried out by farmers in and around the borders of Delhi against the three farm laws that were implemented by the Centre in September.The chief minister also slammed the government for ignoring the concerns raised by the farmers. Gehlot also demanded that the farm laws be taken back. “Farmers are protesting in a peaceful manner. Their protest is for their most genuine concerns, which the government is ignoring. The farm laws that are not in the interest of the farming community must be taken back,” Gehlot said.Earlier in the day, hundreds of protesting farmers from Rajasthan blocked the Delhi-Jaipur national highway in Alwar district after they were stopped by police from marching towards the national capital. While one-way traffic moving from Delhi to Jaipur is open, the Jaipur-Delhi traffic is blocked due to the agitation, according to PTI.As the protest against the farm laws intensifies, thousands of farmers have gathered around and are camping at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The farmers have expressed strong apprehension towards Centre’s new agriculture laws, saying that it will take away the safety cushion of MSP and mandi system due to which they will have to be at the mercy of corporate leaders.However, the government has maintained its stand that the agriculture laws will bring major reforms in the farming sector that will help eliminate the middlemen from the equation, allowing the farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statements-by-bjp-leaders-on-farmers-protest-most-unfortunate-says-ashok-gehlot/story-aE3yCfnCntSphkm0KIDgeO.html

ASA national convenor Sumitra Murmu, KSS national president Phurlchand Tirkey and ABAVP national president Satyanarayn Lakra will be present in the public meetings.“Dharna and demonstrations at the district headquarters in these five states on January 21 and charter of demands will be submitted to the President of India through DCs and DMs. Public rallies will be held at Degagora (Nawadih block) under Bokaro district on December 17 and at Chandil under Seraikela-Kharsawan district on December 18,” added Salkhan.He declared that the rail-roko and road blockade held in five states on December 6 was a great success, claiming trains were blocked at 15 stations and 40 roads and highways were blocked in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odisha.“This movement has been going on for past 16 years and we hope the government of India will honour the rightful demand of 15 crore tribals. JD(U), in spite of being NDA alliance partner at the Centre, has been putting pressure on the Central government for this but the state government has been playing to the galleries,” Salkhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-tribals-threaten-stir-set-dec-31-deadline-for-separate-religion-code/story-mFrBoctpwJgZ7Xenctrh1J.html

Those who should be tilling their fields are sitting in the biting cold. But I am happy people in the country including the army, lawyers, actors, doctors, are with them,” Kejriwal said in the national capital. “We are with farmers too,” the AAP chief said.Kejriwal also said that the new farm laws will force a price rise by 16 times in the next four years. “Not 16%, but 16 times. Twice in one year, four times in two years, eight times in 3 years and 16 times in 4 years. That’s actually allowed in the new law,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.Thousands of farmers have been engaged in a high-intensity stir since late November protesting the three recently-cleared farm laws, alleging that they will reduce their earnings in the market and give more power to corporations. In a bid to resolve the standoff, the government has engaged with farmers in five rounds of talks but without any resolution.Watch: Delhi CM Kejriwal, AAP leaders on hunger strike to support farmers On Sunday, Kejriwal had urged the central government to roll back the three contentious farm laws – which have triggered the protests — that were passed by Parliament in September and demanded a new bill to ensure minimum support prices (MSP) for farmers be drafted at the earliest.“I request all party (AAP) supporters and people across the country to observe fast for a day tomorrow (Monday) in solidarity with protesting farmers. I shall be observing a day’s fast too… Let’s support our farmers from our homes. I understand that it is not possible for many of us to be physically present at the (state) border points where the protesting farmer groups have gathered,” said the chief minister, in a video press briefing on Sunday.The farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, in their “Delhi Chalo” march, had demanded that the ruling dispensation agrees to hear their objections on the clearance of the farm laws which, collectively, have paved way for agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-be-tilling-fields-but-sitting-in-biting-cold-kejriwal-backs-protesting-farmers-at-hunger-strike/story-yDm995XVbpfqX1zvNnN4PJ.html

14-12-2020||India||India to establish regional climate centre for Himalayas, to benefit country, neighbours: IMD chief||India is planning to establish a regional climate centre for the Himalayan mountain region which will not only provide weather-related advices within the country but also to its neighbours, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said on Monday.   Mohapatra said the work for establishing such a centre has already begun and talks are also on with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).China is also building a similar regional climate centre on its side of the Himalayas, he said.    Addressing a webinar on ‘Weather and Climate Services over Mountains Region’, Mohapatra said India has the eastern ghats, western ghats along the east and the west coast and the Myanmar hills in the northeast. Considering the size of Himalayas and its role in India’s hydrology, meteorology, disaster management, ecosystem and many other activities, the world has correctly recognised it as the ‘third pole of the world’, he noted.As a part of the ecosystem, as a part of the land, ocean, atmosphere system, the mountains, including the Himalayas and all other hill ranges play a significant role, Mohapatra stressed. Being a data sparse region, the relative observational network is limited as compared to the plain ranges of the country, Mohapatra observed.   He said there is a scope to improve further the physical understanding of various processes occurring in these mountains regions, their modelling and hence the forecasting and warning services.“At the same time, we have to develop the climate applications scenarios, especially with respect to water sector, industries, tourism, agriculture, specifically in these mountains regions.“We are planning to establish a regional climate centre for the mountains region and it will be providing advices not only to India but also to the entire region in the Himalayas,” he said.The RCC is likely to come up in Delhi, Mohapatra later told the PTI. The RCC will provide weather-related services specially for the farmers and tribes residing there. He added that Himansh, the country’s remote and high altitude research centre, established in 2016, will also undertake weather research activities in the Himalayas.   Mohapatra said a lot of initiatives have been taken by the Ministry of Earth Sciences and IMD for augmentation of observational network with deployment of doppler radars and automated weather stations and with the development of region specific numerical models and application activities with improvement in forecast activities and warning services. He said the disasters in the mountainous regions play a dominant role in deciding socio-economic activities.Mohapatra said natural calamities in Himalayas like the earthquakes are well-recognised --- the heavy rainfall leading to cloud bursts and also many other phenomena that affect the local agriculture, local industry, local bio-system, local lives. “We also have various types of disaster phenomenon in other hill ranges like western and eastern ghats. In the recent times, we all have witnessed that because of the monsoon rains, how the landslides, which have generally realised in the Himalayan ranges or the northeast states... how disastrous landslides have been realised in Karnataka and Kerala states,” Mohapatra said.He added that similar landslides have taken place when cyclones have crossed Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-establish-regional-climate-centre-for-himalayas-to-benefit-country-neighbours-imd-chief/story-ubkJq95x7qprIusS6NUCdJ.html

This is the fourth group of farmers who have extended support to the laws in the last fortnight.According to news agency ANI, the 10 organisations from various states like Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Bihar and Haryana, associated with All India Kisan Coordination Committee, submitted a memorandum to the Union agriculture minister. “Members of All India Kisan Coordination Committee had come from Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Maharashtra and Bihar. They supported farm laws and gave us a letter on the same. They said that the Modi government has done this for the welfare of farmers and that they welcome and support it,” Tomar was quoted as saying by ANI.Earlier in the day, the agriculture minister said that the government is engaging with farmers’ leaders to decide on the next date of talks. The government is ready for discussion anytime and the farmers’ leaders have to “decide and convey” when they are ready for the next meeting, he added. “The meeting will definitely happen. We are engaging with farmers,” Tomar told PTI.Also read | ‘Progressive’ Haryana farmers submitted memorandum backing new farm laws: TomarOn Sunday, a delegation of more than 100 farmers from Uttarakhand had extended their support to the laws. Before that, a delegation of 29 farmers from Haryana met Tomar on Saturday to extend their support to the new legislations and threatened to stage a protest if those are repealed. The delegation, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (Mann) Haryana state leader Guni Prakash, submitted a “letter of support” to Tomar on the farm laws passed by Parliament in September and demanded the government to continue with these legislations.Last week, farmers, representing Har Kisan, an organisation of 116 farmer-owned agricultural enterprises known as farmer producer organisations, met the agriculture minister and asked for a separate meeting with him with more members. The farmers’ group from Haryana said they were not opposed to any amendments that the government may be considering but they want to the laws to be in force.Also read | Several border points in Delhi remain closed for traffic as farmers’ stir escalatesThousands of farmers, largely from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the farm laws and vowed to intensify their agitation if the government did not repeal the laws. There have been five rounds of talks between the Centre and representatives of 40 farmers’ unions so far and they have remained inconclusive. The sixth round was scrapped after they rejected the government’s draft proposal to amend certain provisions of the farm laws and declined to participate in the meeting. The government has made it clear that it is ready for discussion anytime. But the farmer unions have said they would come for talks only if the laws are repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fourth-group-of-farmers-extend-support-to-farm-laws-say-they-welcome-them/story-m9k8x3dVjU7laEEGoMP0TL.html

14-12-2020||India||‘Transition from cute to babe was toughest!’||From the girl-next-door to playing a negative role, then turning seductive and now a ‘lady don’, actor Garima Jain loves exploring different genres. “Though it’s challenging, I have always broken the mould throughout my career. From a cute girl (‘Yeh Hai Mohabbatein’), docile Dushala in ‘Mahabharat’, negative in ‘Shakti’ I then took a bold step of trying the web with ‘Gandii Baat-4’ and ‘Mastram’,” said the actor.She recently wrapped up her shoot of ‘The Prayag Raj’ in Lucknow where she plays a ‘Revolver Rani’-type character. “Strong, fierce, tomboyish and full of ‘tashan’, she is like a lady don! She is like a coconut, softer in terms of love (opposite Adhyayn Suman) and harder otherwise. I have never abused in my life and in this I have hurled ‘galiyan’ left, right and centre and fired umpteen rounds. Learning to shoot was fine but had to do a lot of retakes to get the abuses right,” she laughs. The actor feels that breaking away from an image is tough. “When you do, it looks very tough but once you have done it, it seems like it was nothing! You get ready for new challenges. If I look back, transition from cute to babe was more difficult. People had a set image about me which was challenging to break — convincing people in a way it does not look cheap yet appears sexy and classy! So, it was a complete transition maintaining that thin line.”She is dabbling in various projects. “In the unlock phase, I completed a web-film, ‘Afate-e-Ishq’, with Neha Sharma and Deepak Dobriyal. I shot for ‘Twisted-3’ which was released some time back. I am currently shooting for two projects simultaneously and I was scheduled to shoot for ‘Mitthu Singh Da Vyah’ with Rajpal Yadav but could not do it as the dates were clashing. Also, I have to do some patchwork of ‘Prayag Raj’ which we may do in Mumbai now,” said the actor, who has been in Lucknow before but as a singer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/transition-from-cute-to-babe-was-toughest/story-GrwwleArhln0lgHxLTkVOM.html
14-12-2020||India||‘I always try to add colours to my dark characters’||Actor Zakir Hussain is best known for his negative and comic roles and has done lots of popular films including ‘Sarkar’, ‘Singham Returns’ and ‘Andhadhun’. But, his tall performance as a hardcore-criminal in ‘Sarkar’ has left such a lasting impression that filmmakers cast him largely in negative roles. “Characters like corrupt official, politician or a gangster that’s when I come in mind of casting directors. Industry is such that makers don’t want to experiment with actors much, which makes it tough for actors like me to break the shell,” says the actor, who hails from Meerut. He recently did two schedules of ‘Satyamev Jayate-2’, starring John Abraham and directed by Milap Zaveri, in Lucknow. Zakir is currently shooting for web-series ‘Thulley’, a murder-mystery, in Manali. “In SJ2 also I play a corrupt politician. As an actor, I always try to add colours to my dark characters. In the given parameters and character sketches I do add variety. After ‘Johnny Gaddaar’ and ‘Singham Returns’ people have started adding flavour of comedy to my negative roles.” Zakir has done few character roles too. “I did comedy TV show ‘Beechwale – Bapu Dekh Raha Hai’. I also did OTT series ‘Chacha Vidhayak Hai Humare’ and its second season has also been shot. Personally, I want to do all types of roles but can do only what I am offered. Sometimes, after hearing script, I have even asked for other genre roles, but directors don’t want to experiment much with my characters. I hope someone would do soon…I am every ready to drive a film or web series.” The actor is dabbling well between OTT and films. “I have shot one schedule for ‘Kamal Haasan’s next ‘Indian-2’. In unlock phase, I have also shot for forthcoming OTT series ‘Sandwiched Forever’ which starts Aahana Kumra, Kunal Roy Kapoor and Atul Kulkarni.” Before SJ2, he has shot Sanjay Dutt’s ‘Prasthanam’ and other projects in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-always-try-to-add-colours-to-my-dark-characters/story-wPS4s2dFvQXOVr1OOEx3hO.html

14-12-2020||India||2 employees of leading Odia TV channel held in rape case, Oppn alleges attack on press freedom||The Crime Investigation Department (CID) of the Odisha Police on Monday arrested four persons including two employees of leading Odia TV channel OTV, which is owned by Jagi Panda --- the wife of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Baijayant Panda --- in connection with the alleged gang rape of a 13-year-old girl earlier this year.The action prompted Opposition leaders to say the police in the Biju Janata Dal (BJD)-ruled state were targeting and harassing employees of OTV, which is critical of the state administration.CID officials said two security guards and two employees of OTV were those arrested, adding that the minor girl’s mother lodged a complaint against them in August.On August 30, the mother lodged the complaint in Bhubaneswar, alleging that her minor daughter was repeatedly gang-raped in the months of March and April. The mother worked with OTV as a receptionist for a few months. She also accused a police officer and his associates of raping the minor at gunpoint. The arrests came weeks after the Orissa high court asked the Odisha Police why no action was being taken in the case. Earlier, the DGP, in an affidavit before the HC, had mentioned that there were inconsistencies in the statements of the girl and others.Soon after the arrests, OTV said the organisation and its employees have always cooperated with the police. “There is no prima facie evidence against the arrested persons and so there was no reason for their arrest. On the other hand, police officials who have been accused in the case are yet to be arrested creating doubts about the fairness of the investigation,” the channel said.Senior Congress leader Suresh Routray said the arrests smacked of injustice and publicity stunt. “Why only OTV staff were arrested, and not the police personnel accused in the case? This case needs a proper investigation,” he said. Senior lawyer and BJP leader Pitambar Acharya said the arrest of OTV employees was more of a selective prosecution. “When one’s destruction is near, their brain stops working – this is what is happening with the Odisha government. Intentionally attacking the press freedom, which we term as malicious proceeding, is not a sign of a healthy democracy,” said Acharya.The police’s move come against the backdrop of similar actions --- arrests and interrogations --- of several OTV employees, including its journalists, in a number of cases over the past year. The BJD says all actions were taken according to law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-employees-of-leading-odia-tv-channel-held-in-rape-case-oppn-alleges-attack-on-press-freedom/story-YAVWrx1U1kP7MLktuLCb2K.html
14-12-2020||India||Centre’s telemedicine service crosses 1 million consultations||Union health ministry’s eSanjeevani telemedicine service crossed 1 million tele-consultations on Monday.The ministry had begun online out patient department (OPD) consultations in April this year during the nationwide lockdown announced by the Centre in March to manage coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country.The platform is currently used by patients in at least 550 districts, with the volume of consultations per day increasing to around 14,000, according to the government data.Telemedicine entails delivery of health services from a distance using internet and it not only extends the reach of health services but also improves quality of health services besides saving time and money.“The roll out of eSanjeevani in India is supposedly the first of its kind of digital transformation in the delivery of health services at national scale by a developing country. During the Covid-19 pandemic, eSanjeevani not only brought about a huge digital transformation in the delivery of health services but had also boosted the digital health ecosystem in the country,” said health ministry in a statement.The platform is serving in two streams in 28 states and Union Territories. The eSanjeevani Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWC) enables doctor to doctor tele-consultations, and is being used at around 6,000 HWCs. These centres are being served by specialists and doctors in around 240 hubs which have been set up by states in district hospitals or medical colleges. At least 20,000 paramedics, doctors and specialists have been trained to use eSanjeevani AB-HWC.The second stream eSanjeevani OPD is for providing remote health services to patients within the confines of their homes. It enables contactless, risk-free, and safe consultations between a doctor and a patient. It received a huge reception by both the patients and the doctors, and the Centre facilitated training of around 8,000 doctors who are on board on eSanjeevani OPD. On an average, around 1,500 doctors practise telemedicine daily in around 225 online OPDs, of which 190 are speciality OPDs and about 30 are general OPDs.“Over 10% of the users of eSanjeevani are aged 60 and above. Close to around one-fourth of the total patients have used eSanjeevani more than once.This stands as a testimony to the fact that public has started preferring telemedicine over visiting hospital OPDs for consulting a doctor,” said the ministry statement.Considering the inherent potential and social impact of this emergent digital modality of delivery of health services, the states have designed innovative applications around eSanjeevani OPD.In Kerala, eSanjeevani OPD is being used for providing health services to the inmates of Palakkad District Jail, in Himachal Pradesh, it is being rolled out in old age homes. Quick adoption of eSanjeevani OPD services across the country has enabled launch of wide range of speciality and super-speciality OPDs including alternative medical systems such as Ayush and naturopathy.Kerala is already setting up OPDs on eSanjeevani for providing services of Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram – district early intervention centres for its populace. Each of these 14 online OPDs has a team comprising a psychologist, special educator, speech therapist and a physiotherapist who collectively address common issues pertaining to child development and their future health.Top 10 states with highest consultations through eSanjeevani and eSanjeevani OPD platforms are Tamil Nadu (319,507), Uttar Pradesh (268,889), Madhya Pradesh (70,838), Gujarat (63,601), Kerala (62,797), Himachal Pradesh (49,224), Andhra Pradesh (39,853), Karnataka (32,693), Uttarakhand (31,910), and Maharashtra (12,635).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-telemedicine-service-crosses-1-million-consultations/story-ipx35Bmr5wW5Jxoi6nX8WK.html

Vijayvargiya was among those who suffered cuts and bruises in the December 10 attack. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP have locked horns over the incident that took place in the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The pelting of stones on Nadda’s convoy marked the first such assault on BJP leaders in the poll-bound state. Since Nadda enjoys Z-category security cover, only he was travelling in a bullet-proof car by the state government. Vijayvargiya, who gets Y-category cover, was travelling in a normal SUV provided by the party. “I have been told by the Union home ministry not to travel in normal vehicles. I have not seen the bullet-proof car yet,” said Vijayvargiya, who will be travelling to South 24 Parganas on Monday afternoon to attend an outreach programme of the party. “There is no law and order in Bengal. Every day our workers are being killed,” he added. Several central leaders as well as top state leaders of the BJP are protected by security personnel provided by various central police forces. These people are armed with automatic weapons. Seven people have been arrested by the state police in connection with Thursday’s attack. Union home minister Amit Shah has expressed concern about law and order situation in Bengal. The home ministry has also written to the state, saying the three Indian Police Service officers who were on duty on December 10 be sent on central deputation. The TMC has opposed this. BJP’s national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were also hurt by pieces of stones and shards of glass from the shattered windows and windshields of their cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-attack-on-nadda-convoy-bjp-s-vijayvargiya-gets-bullet-proof-car/story-Sv6ucdKocFbMxdV35nWyLO.html

We are engaging with farmers,” Tomar told PTI. The government is ready for discussion anytime. The farmer leaders have to “decide and convey” when they are ready for the next meeting, he added. Tomar is leading the negotiations with 40 farmer unions, along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce and Industries Som Parkash. Previous five rounds of talks between the Centre and 40 farmer unions’ leaders have remained inconclusive. The government has sent a draft proposal along with written assurance of continuing the minimum support price (MSP) system to them for consideration, but farmer unions have rejected it and demanded repeal of the laws. Earlier in the day, Tomar met Home Minister Amit Shah and discussed about the way forward to end the deadlock. Later, the agriculture minister also met a delegation of farmers led by the All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC) which extended support to the farm laws. This is the fourth group of farmers who have extended support to the laws in last two weeks. Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders observed a day-long fast on Monday even as the agitation spread to different parts of the country with peasant unions staging demonstrations at district headquarters. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engaging-with-farmers-to-decide-on-next-date-of-talks-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar/story-qbUdVRTBt0701Zt4WekhxK.html

Protesters are being beaten up in their homes here and the state government is talking of protesters’ rights in Delhi and calling it an emergency situation,” ANI quoted the BJP leader as saying.On Sunday, Thackeray had hit out at Fadnavis for his “undeclared Emergency in the state” remarks. “If there is an undeclared Emergency in Maharashtra, then is there a declared Emergency in the rest of the country given the manner in which the protesting farmers are being targeted on the outskirts of Delhi,” he had said.Thackeray had also questioned whether pouring water on farmers in cold weather is a sign of harmony. He had also slammed the BJP government for calling protesting farmers “anti-national”. “The BJP should decide whether protesters have support from Pakistan, China or Maoists. You bring sugar and onions from Pakistan. Now farmers are also coming from Pakistan,” the Shiv Sena leader had mocked, as quoted by PTI.The remarks from both the political leaders come amid ongoing protests in Delhi where thousands of farmers, majority of them from Haryana and Punjab, have gathered in and around the borders of the national capital to protest against the three farm laws.The farmers are seeking the repeal of the three laws -- Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- that were implemented by the Centre in September.So far, the Centre’s representatives and leaders of farmers’ unions have held as many as five rounds of talks to resolve the issues but they all have been inconclusive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speak-for-maharashtra-farmers-first-devendra-fadnavis-on-uddhav-thackeray-s-remarks-on-farmers-protests-in-delhi/story-ULWZVK2PsWCvCtH3HnZrmJ.html

The senior physician said, “His conditions remains critical.His kidney is functioning at 25% capacity and he will have to go for dialysis in the near future but I can’t predict the exact date.” When asked if Yadav needs to be shifted to another medical facility, Dr Prasad said, “I have informed the authorities about his health condition. Now, they and the court will decide whether he should be shifted to some other medical facility or not.” He, however, said, “In my opinion, he should go to a highly specialised centre, as he is suffering from multiple ailments and comorbidities.” The former Bihar chief minister has been in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in the fodder scam cases. After two months, he developed health complications and was shifted to RIMS and then to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. He was referred back to RIMS after AIIMS declared him fit in May, 2018. After his return to RIMS, Yadav got parole for three days on May 10 to attend his elder son’s wedding. Thereafter, he was then given provisional bail by the Jharkhand high court for advance treatment at a Mumbai-based hospital in June 2018.He returned to RIMS at the end of August that year. Since then, he is under treatment at RIMS.On August 5, he was shifted to RIMS director’s bungalow, also known as Kelly’s Bungalow, from RIMS’ ward in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases and shortage of beds at the hospital.

He is likely to be released soon. “He is on intermittent non-invasive ventilator. He is conscious, alert and communicating verbally,” said a medical bulleting issued by Dr Koushik Chakraborty and Dr Soutik Panda. Bhattacharjee has been suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for more than a decade. Bhattacharjee had some soft diet orally, although supplementary calorie and nutrition are being given through ryles tube. The bulletin said the catheter was removed. Bhattacharjee’s blood pressure and pulse are stable and his urine output is satisfactory. “He slept well last night,” the bulletin said. Bhattacharjee was rushed to the hospital on December 9 with symptoms of breathlessness. He was first admitted in the emergency ward and later shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A four-member panel of doctors has been formed for his treatment. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed concern about Bhattacharya’s health and rushed to the hospital last Wednesday. In September last year, the CPI(M) leader was admitted at the same hospital after he complained of an acute breathing problem. His blood pressure was found to be quite low and his oxygen concentration had deteriorated. Bhattacharjee recovered in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-of-former-bengal-cm-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-improves/story-qBVie8OYbwxtnUvEGRJApK.html

Vijayvargiya currently has Z-category security.“As per the order of the Union home ministry, I have been provided with a bulletproof vehicle,” Vijayvargiya, who is in Kolkata for a programme in Mathurapur in South 24 Parganas, said according to news agency PTI.The vehicle of the BJP general secretary, who was travelling along with party president JP Nadda, was attacked on December 10 when he was on his way to Diamond Harbour to meet party workers. The windscreen of his car was damaged in the attack.Vijayvargiya, who was not harmed in the incident, told reporters that when he was going to a local hospital to meet the injured party workers, his vehicle was damaged “by lathi- wielding TMC miscreants who along with policemen charged towards BJP workers.” According to BJP leaders, Vijayvargiya and vice-president Mukul Roy sustained injuries in the melee, reported PTI.The party’s Bengal in-charge had sought deployment of central forces in the state with immediate effect and alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee is ‘banking on violence’ to return to power.“Mamata Banerjee knows that the land under her feet has slipped and so she is trying to return to power in the state on the strength of violence. I urge the Election Commission to deploy central forces from now itself in order to put an end to the prevailing atmosphere of political violence and terror in the state,” Vijayvargiya had said on Sunday in Birbhum’s Santiniketan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-bengal-in-charge-kailash-vijayvargiya-s-security-upgraded-after-dec-10-attack/story-cEEnaGtdH05QKz0wXskNFM.html

This has caused major embarrassment for the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in a region where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won two adjacent Lok Sabha seats in 2019. This sudden development has also stoked speculations that Tiwari, who is also the local legislator and a TMC heavyweight , may leave the party in the run-up to the crucial assembly polls due in about five months. The party has called Tiwari for an internal meeting on Tuesday evening and the latter has confirmed he will attend it.In his letter to urban development minister Firhad Hakin on Sunday, Tiwali wrote,“…I am very aggrieved to state that our city was chosen by the Ministry of urban development, Government of India, under Smart City Mission project which if allowed by you, could have received funds amounting Rs2,000 crore which would be very crucial for development of the city.” “… due to political reasons we were not allowed to get benefits of it by the state government,” Tiwari said in the letter which was marked confidential but got leaked to the media on Monday morning. HT has seen the letter. Tiwari also expressed his displeasure over funds not being provided for a number of local projects, such as Prince Dwaraknath Thakur Town Hall in Raniganj, renovation of the town hall at Jamuria and several roads in Asansol, Burnpur, Kulti, Jamuria and Raniganj. Also read | TMC talks to disgruntled minister Rajib Banerjee, expels rebel Suvendu Adhikari’s aide“Asansol was chosen under this (Smart City) project as a result of tremendous work effort of councillors and the entire team of AMC (Asansol Municipal Corporation) but due to political reasons, we were not allowed to get the benefits of this project,” he wrote. “It was promised that funds will be made available by the state government for overall development of this city but it was not done. Similarly, under the solid waste management project, Asansol city could have received another Rs1500 crore from the Centre...but you and your department have not allowed us to get the benefits of these Central Government funds due to which I feel that Injustice has been made to the City of Asansol,” wrote the outgoing mayor. Union minister of state Babul Supriyo is the MP from Asansol while the adjacent Bardhaman-Durgapur seat is represented by another Union minister of state, SS Ahluwalia. The region has a sizeable non-Bengali speaking as well as Muslim population. Asansol is the second biggest city in south Bengal after Kolkata. It is located in the state’s biggest industrial and coal mining belt. “Policies are decided by legislators and he (Tiwari) is one of them. He should have discussed the matter with me. Writing this letter was not the right thing to do. If he wants to leave the party he is free to do so. But I believe he will stay. The BJP is misguiding some people,” minister Hakim said in Kolkata. He claimed Tiwari was not available on the phone. “I called up Tiwari twice but could not reach him,” he added. On Asansol being picked for the Smart City project, MP Babul Supriyo told a local news channel, “I was the Union minister of state for urban development when I chose Asansol for the Smart City project because it is the second highest revenue generator after Kolkata. I wrote to Mamata Banerjee. She never replied.” He said Tiwari has shown courage by writing the letter. “I wrote many letters to Firhad Hakim on this issue. He, too, never replied to any of them. Asansol has been badly deprived. The only work the local civic body has is to put up hoardings of Mamata Banerjee,” he said. Tiwari, on his part, did not take kindly to his letter being leaked. “I have no idea how the letter got leaked. We have to live in Asansol and are answerable to the people. Hakim does not love Mamata Banerjee more than we do. I fight the BJP on the field every day. He should not be talking about the TMC’s doors being open for people to leave. This was a confidential letter. How was it leaked?” he asked. A BJP leader, on condition of anonymity, said, “Tiwari has expressed the grievance of common people. If he wants to join the BJP, we will welcome him. We also keep saying that Mamata Banerjee has deprived the state of Central funds worth thousands of crores of rupees.” Meanwhile, on Monday, Tiwari also wrote to the higher education department that he would like to resign from the governing body of two local colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mayor-accuses-bengal-govt-of-stopping-development-work-for-politics/story-erJOhADRm942Je2E54H3xM.html

The comments were made amid India’s standoff with the neighbouring China in Ladakh.“We are in a standoff situation in Ladakh and based on that there is some development activity which has been ongoing in Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Every nation will continue to prepare for ensuring its security based on their strategic interest,” news agency ANI quoted Rawat as saying.Rawat also confirmed that “high levels of preparation” are underway on land, sea and air as “China attempts to change the status quo on Line of Actual Control (LAC) along the northern border.”Underlining the importance of technology in the armed forces, the Chief of Defence Staff said, “Time has come now to look at the future of warfighting imbibing technology into our systems. We have got adequate forces to counter any threat or challenges that we may face on northern borders.”The comments come as India authorised the defence forces to enhance their stocking of weapons and ammunition for a 15-day intense war as the country is in the middle of conflict with China over border row in eastern Ladakh, news agency ANI had reported on Sunday.The authorisation to increase the weapon and ammunition reserves to minimum 15-I levels from the earlier existing 10-day stocking is to prepare the defence forces for a two-front war with both China and Pakistan. The three services were also given the emergency financial powers to procure items worth Rs 300 crore to buy any equipment which they felt could be of use to them for fighting wars. The defence forces have been buying a number of spares, weapons, missiles and systems for effectively taking on the two adversaries.India has been engaged with China in the Eastern Ladakh sector since May where transgressions have been reported from the Chinese side at multiple locations along the LAC.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-levels-of-preparation-underway-on-land-sea-and-air-cds-bipin-rawat-amid-standoff-with-china/story-iDdi4kOkIiWKHwvZ6NdcwI.html

As the matter could not be heard in detail due to paucity of time, the bench asked the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, to file a fresh status report within a week indicating the updated figures of tests carried out, district-wise infection numbers in the city, number of containment zones.The court also asked the Delhi government whether it was planning a fifth round of sero survey now that the number of infections was coming down in the national capital.Satyakam said the government was waiting for the figures to stabilise before deciding whether to carry out another sero survey.The bench, thereafter listed the matter for hearing on December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-aap-govt-to-increase-testing-in-districts-where-covid-19-infection-numbers-are-high/story-SvXctM0xarlFSwaklniOsO.html
14-12-2020||India||SC asks for Centre’s views on plea seeking to declare Emergency as unconstitutional||The Supreme Court on Monday sought to know the view of Centre on whether the Emergency, imposed 45 years ago, could be declared unconstitutional due to the passage of time. A 94-year-old widow, Veera Sarin, has approached the top court with a prayer to declare the 1975 Emergency as unconstitutional, and demanded Rs 25 crore as compensation for the wrongs committed by authorities who detained her husband and caused her family to suffer mental trauma for several years. Sarin’s husband dealt with precious gems and artefacts and all his goods were confiscated but never returned, she said. The bench of Justices SK Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said: “We are not convinced that after 45 years we can go into something which happened in a particular period of time.”Sarin was represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, who argued that wrongs of history should be set right or else they could repeat. He said war crimes during the Holocaust and the second World War were still being looked into by war crime tribunals. He said that while the petitioner may not insist on compensation, she was entitled to a declaration that for 19 months fundamental rights of citizens were put under suspension which should not have happened in a democratic polity governed by a Constitution. The bench, after holding extensive discussion among themselves, found it hard to agree with Salve. “...We would be disinclined to reopen on such aspects, as there may have been wrongs done but with passage of 45 years, it may not be appropriate to reopen them.”Salve agreed that he was willing to forgo his prayer for compensation but remained firm on the first prayer. “It is too serious a matter to be left out. People of our generation could not do anything then. This lady has no political agenda. She has suffered and has come to court to seek a final closure on this issue. She would be happy to get a declaration that the Emergency declared was wrong.”It was then that the court said, “We would, however, not be disinclined to see whether such a declaration (by court) is feasible or desirable after such passage of time.” The court allowed Salve to file an amended writ petition, restructuring it keeping in mind what the court observed. The matter will be heard next on December 18.Emergency was proclaimed minutes before the midnight of June 25, 1975 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The proclamation was revoked in March 1977.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-for-centre-s-views-on-plea-seeking-to-declare-emergency-as-unconstitutional/story-MUMLJe0QgzX3T9wAFDuEQJ.html

The Aam Aadmi Party is yet to open its account.The elections, which were to be held in March, were postponed on account of the lockdown and were held on December 12 but suffered from a poor voter turnout on account of fear of the pandemic, as many opted not to step out of their homes to vote.The ruling BJP has a commanding majority among MLAs, who often sponsor their own candidates for the district panchayat polls with 27 of the 40 MLAs owing allegiance to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.The party has however lost crucial seats where candidates sponsored by its MLAs have been defeated by independent candidates or by opposition Congress MLAs including in Santa Cruz, Nuvem and Colvale constituencies, where the Congress or independents have managed to win the seat despite having lost their MLAs to the BJP.The BJP is expected to improve on its tally from the 2105 zilla panchayat polls in which the opposition parties including the Congress and the NCP didn’t take part and instead fielded their candidates as independents.In 2015 the Independents won 25 of the 50 seats, the BJP 18, the MGP which was then in an alliance with the BJP won five seats and the Goa Vikas Party, which has not taken part this time won two seats.Both the BJP and the Congress have expressed confidence that they will emerge victorious at the hustings.With the zilla panchayat bodies performing only a nominal role, the polls are seen more as a preliminary test for political parties ahead of the state assembly elections a little more than a year away in early 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-takes-lead-in-early-trends-in-goa-zilla-panchayat-polls/story-O9NzzvcCvN6TTzuqLs8mVL.html
14-12-2020||India||India stood up to China’s ‘aggression’, forced PLA troops back: Rajnath Singh||India has stood up to China’s “unprovoked aggression” on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and fought the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and forced its troops to go back, though Beijing’s assertion of power is creating uncertainty across the region, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday. In unusually blunt remarks while addressing the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Singh said India is at a point in its history when it needs to stand up for itself and make it known that the country “can fight anyone” and take on any challenge to survive. Singh called on industry to step up to forge partnerships to provide the armed forces with the right technology and equipment for defending the country and also for driving the export of military hardware. “The unprovoked aggression on our Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing, how existing agreements are being challenged, how power is being asserted not just in the Himalayas but across the Indo-Pacific, and how uncertain the future of the region and world could be in this backdrop,” he said during the online event. Also Watch | ‘India’s economy likely to return to pre-Covid levels by..’: Rajnath Singh “As you are aware, there is a big build-up of armed forces at the LAC in Ladakh. In these testing times, our forces have shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude. They fought the PLA with utmost bravery and forced them to go back,” he added. The standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh sector of the LAC is currently in its eighth month, and tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in for the winter after several rounds of military and diplomatic talks failed to make headway on disengagement and de-escalation at key friction points. Singh said: “There comes a point in a nation’s history, every now and then, when it needs to stand up for itself, tell that India can fight anyone, that it’s capable of taking any challenge, just to survive.” He further said coming generations will be proud of what the armed forces have managed to achieve this year. Pointing to the debate regarding the comparative military strengths of the two countries, he contended there was “no scope of ambiguity” that India is far ahead of China in leading the world with ideas and soft power. “Whenever there is a situation at the LAC, the most obvious outcome is a comparison between India and China’s military strength. There can be a serious debate on who owns more military might but when it comes to soft power there is no scope of ambiguity,” he said. Buddhism, he said, had a “monumental influence over China, to an extent that before the 1949 revolution, almost 80% of China’s population followed Buddhism”. Singh also quoted a Chinese scholar who had said that India “has culturally dominated and controlled China for more than 2,000 years without sending a single soldier across the border”. Singh also referred to the issue of terror emanating from Pakistan and said the world is only now acknowledging the issue though India grappled with it alone for years. “We have been victims of cross-border terrorism, yet have fought the scourge alone even when there was no one to support us but later, they understood we were right about Pakistan being the fountainhead of terrorism,” he said. Pointing to troops “in the forefront fighting icy winds to guard our borders”, Singh asked if the industry could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the armed forces by using the country’s economic strength to its advantage and forging the right partnerships to provide the right technology and military products to the three services. “We have opened doors to the private sector, incentivised domestic production, are creating defence corridors and doing a lot more. We are also willing to engage in meaningful joint ventures and partnerships with other countries,” he said, adding the industry should produce defence hardware in India for the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-stood-up-to-china-s-aggression-forced-pla-troops-back-rajnath-singh/story-40iHWwZIsSGhynnzXG5HUK.html

The poster also displays a picture of Sidak with her family.While the farmer Jagat Singh’s family celebrated his daughter’s birthday back home, the protesting farmers extended their birthday greetings to the infant by celebrating her special day in a unique way as they gathered together at the demonstration site with three huge cakes and sang ‘happy birthday’ song for Sidak. “My daughter is celebrating back home with her mother and our relatives. When we left our homes, we had vowed not to return before our victory.

Addressing the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in the backdrop of a farmers’ protest against the agricultural reforms entering the 19th day, Singh said the government is “always willing to listen to our farmer brothers”. Describing agriculture as the “mother sector for all others”, he said, “There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever. The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India’s farmers in mind.” Singh added, “We are, however, always willing to listen to our farmer brothers, allay their misgivings and provide them with assurances we can provide. Our government is always open to discussion and dialogue.” Farmers have organised sit-in protests across the country and are observing a hunger strike from 8am to 5pm on Monday. The nationwide protests came a day after farmers blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway. More and more farmers have joined the protests at several entry points to the national Capital. The farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. The Centre has said these reforms will eliminate middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce in commercial markets, but the protesters fear the new laws will allow big corporations to enter agriculture and further end the system of minimum support price. Union minister Kailash Choudhary said on Sunday the Centre will soon hold another round of talks with farmers, adding the government will find “some solution” to end the deadlock. Five rounds of talks have been held so far between the farmers and the Centre but they ended inconclusively. A further round couldn’t be held after protesters rejected the Centre’s offer to amend specific provisions of the new farm laws. Singh said agriculture was one sector that was able to the cope with the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and “come out the best”. He added, “Our produce and procurement have been plentiful and our warehouses are full.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-open-to-dialogues-says-rajnath-on-farmers-protest/story-U8qp7FqeSb9yfTpDl5XoBJ.html

He also hailed the courage shown by the Indian defence forces.“Unprovoked aggression on our Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how world is changing, how existing agreements are being challenged, how power is being asserted not just in Himalayas but across Indo-Pacific,” Singh said while addressing the valedictory session of FICCI’s annual conclave.“There is big build-up of armed forces at the LAC in Ladakh. In these testing times, our forces have shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude. They fought the PLA with utmost bravery and forced them to go back,” he added.The defence minister said the future generations will be proud of what our forces have managed to achieve this year. “Our armed forces fought with them (Chinese military) with utmost bravery and forced them to go back,” Singh said.He also lashed out at Pakistan, calling it the fountainhead of terrorism. “We have been victims of cross-border terrorism, yet have fought the scourge alone even when there was no one to support us but later, they understood we were right about Pakistan being the fountainhead of terrorism,” said Singh.On Sunday, participating in an interactive session at the annual general meeting of the industry body FICCI, foreign minister S Jaishankar called the “events” along the LAC in eastern Ladakh “very disturbing”.

Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

Addressing the valedictory session of FICCI’s annual conclave, Singh highlighted how the proactive approach of the Narendra Modi government led this turnaround.“The Covid-19 pandemic is a massive challenge that impacted the entire world. The pandemic brought along with it a great amount of uncertainty and adversely affected the global economy. India too was impacted by it,” said Singh.The defence minister also said that when the Covid-19 outbreak was first reported, the government’s utmost priority was to save the lives of the people of the country. He said that the government was always certain that “we would bounce back”.“Today, India is back on track with a new vigour in our fight against Covid-19. The role of citizens in successful implementation of the lockdown is no mean achievement,” said Singh. He then went on to describe the steps taken by the Centre to check the spread of the infection and how it became successful with the help of the citizens.Talking about the defence forces, Singh said the armed forces were valiantly defending our borders while the world was fighting coronavirus. “No virus could deter our armed forces from their duty,” he added.“Doomsayers started making prophecies that it will take India two-three years to get back on the track. But we proved them wrong. India bounced back in no time. In Q2, India recorded 7.9% contraction in its GDP. It was a significant improvement in the 23.9% contraction that we witnessed in first quarter,” said the defence minister.He added that Indian economy is likely to return to pre-Covid levels by the end of the current fiscal year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-likely-to-return-to-pre-covid-levels-by-end-of-this-fiscal-year-rajnath-singh/story-kKZdIy5qyUfxep7bIu9NHJ.html

Raab will hold talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in New Delhi on December 15 on bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interest. He will meet environment minister Prakash Javadekar and education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal. As part of the visit, Raab will travel to Bengaluru where he will meet Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on December 17. India and the UK have had a strategic partnership since 2004 that has been marked by regular high-level exchanges and growing cooperation in diverse areas, the external affairs ministry said while announcing Raab’s visit on Monday. Raab’s visit will “pave the way for further strengthening of the partnership across trade, defence, climate, migration and mobility, education and health sectors in the post-Covid, post-Brexit context”, the ministry said. During their meeting, Raab and Jaishankar are expected to review efforts to forge a 10-year road map for the India-UK relationship and discuss a defence logistics agreement. Both countries have also been working closely on climate change, including the India-led Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. India is also understood to have invited UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to be chief guest at next year’s Republic Day celebrations. The UK has stepped up efforts to forge stronger trade ties with key countries amid problems in forging a post-Brexit trade agreement with the EU. Britain and the EU are set to return to the negotiating table on Monday after agreeing to abandon a make-or-break deadline for such a trade pact. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Johnson said last week they would decide whether an agreement was possible by the end of December 13, but later agreed to “go the extra mile”. Von der Leyen and Johnson didn’t set a new deadline but Conservative Party MP Mark Harper suggested the talks could go right to the wire, with less than three weeks until Britain leaves the single European market at the end of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-foreign-secretary-dominic-raab-s-india-visit-begins-today-bilateral-cooperation-in-focus/story-KDSiLjBMJNd7rngcgEH3bN.html

Though the girl’s family launched a search, she could not be traced anywhere.On Monday morning, her body was found near a pond. Police have sent the body for post-mortem and have detained a man.Also read | Two brothers, nephew attacked with sharp weapons in Chandigarh, three bookedThe girl’s death comes in the wake of a massive uproar over the alleged abduction and murder of a five-year-old girl in Nayagarh district in July. The child was playing outside her house before she went missing. Later, her skeletal remains were found from the backyard of her house. The incident triggered a political storm in the state after her parents attempted immolation in front of the state Assembly last month, accusing a minister of shielding the prime suspect in the case.As per the National Crime Records Bureau report of 2019, Odisha has the lowest recovery rate of missing children at 27%. Till 2019-end, 5,503 children were missing in the state. Kerala reported highest recovery rate of 94% among all states.The National Human Rights Commission, in a series of recommendation in 2014, had said that each case of missing children should be treated as cognizable offence and a First Information Report (FIR) be lodged instead of just a station diary. Though investigation of a crime commences with the registration of an FIR in a police station, in case of a missing child, there is no system of registering an FIR across the country. Complaints of missing children, by and large, are treated as any other non-cognizable offence and only an entry is made in the General Station Diary that is followed by an enquiry.It also said every police station should have special squad/missing persons desk to trace missing children and recommended that state police headquarters should evolve a system in which all incidents of missing children are reported to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights within 24 hours of occurrence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missing-odisha-girl-found-dead-body-recovered-near-pond/story-McQHBrcmBRzc4VbqbImgxL.html

He himself is doing so in response to a call given by the farmers protesting at the Singhu border near Delhi. “Fasting is sacred. Wherever you are, fast for our farmer brothers. Pray to God for the success of their struggle,” Kejriwal wrote in a tweet in Hindi. “In the end, farmers will definitely win,” he also said.उपवास पवित्र होता है। आप जहां हैं, वहीं हमारे किसान भाइयों के लिए उपवास कीजिए। प्रभु से उनके संघर्ष की सफलता की प्रार्थना कीजिए। अंत में किसानों की अवश्य जीत होगी।Farmers from various parts of the country are holding protests against the three contentious farm laws that were passed by Parliament in September. The three laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Also Read | Supreme Court to hear plea seeking immediate removal of farmers protesting at Delhi’s bordersThe protest entered 19th day on Monday as the agitating farmers staged sit-ins and hunger strike in nationwide protest on Monday. The fast on Monday is being observed from 8 am to 5 pm in demand to repeal the laws. It comes a day after farmers had blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Shahjahanpur. More and more farmers have been joining the agitation at several border points in the national capital. Several rounds of talks between farmers and the Centre have taken place, but it has so far failed to resolve the deadlock. The farmers are firm on their demand of complete withdrawal of the three laws while the government has offered to make amendments in the laws, which has been rejected by the farmers.Also Read | Farmers begin day-long hunger strike as protest against farm laws intensifiesFarmers’ unions, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system under which government agencies buy their crop at an assured price.

Meanwhile, a meeting was held between agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, minister of state for commerce and industry Som Parkash and Union home minister Amit Shah to solve the impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-our-farmer-brothers-kejriwal-requests-people-to-observe-one-day-fast/story-oywNNd345hzTlPpBwS5GsI.html
14-12-2020||India||Maharashtra: Two-day winter session starts today; likely to be stormy amid contentious issues||The two-day winter session of the Maharashtra legislature starting from Monday is expected to be stormy as the Opposition has vowed to corner the state government on various issues, including reservation to Marathas, relief to farmers, development projects, and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government, on the other hand, has scheduled to table a few key bills, including one proposed for stricter punishment for crimes against women and will also pass budgetary allocation for the newly incurred expenditure on Covid-19 pandemic.The winter session has been curtailed to two days from its tradition two-week duration in view of the pandemic. It is also being held in Mumbai this time instead of Nagpur, where it is held every year. The main Opposition party in the state, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accused the government of running away from the debate on the contentious issues by keeping the winter session short. It also boycotted the customary tea party organised by the government on the eve of the session on Sunday.Alleging that the government does not want to face them, Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “Farmers are in trouble in the absence of compensation for the crop losses due to the unseasonal rains; Marathas are deprived of reservation as the state government failed to protect their quota; women and children are subjected to rising crimes; government retracted on its promise of waiver to the inflated bills… the issues are aplenty but the government does not want to face them on the floor of the House. Instead, they have been suppressing freedom of speech by taking action against those talking against them. This is nothing but undeclared emergency. We will continue the fight on the street in the public interest even if we did not get a chance to raise them in the Houses,” he said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who asked if the use of power against the protesting farmers on the borders of the Delhi was also a “declared emergency”, does not seem to be defensive. The three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – of the MVA alliance made their intent clear by attacking the BJP-led Centre on various issues.The MVA has been supporting the farmers’ protest and have announced that the farm laws passed by Parliament in September will not be implemented.The state government is expected to table Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and the Special Court and Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, 2020, the two bills for special law for stricter action in crimes against women and children. The state government is also expected to table supplementary demands for the budgetary allocation of expenditure on Covid-19-related services for the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-two-day-winter-session-starts-today-likely-to-be-stormy-amid-contentious-issues/story-KZxAljt9vNsK6onCrQllYK.html

Central leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda, among others, who would be camping in the state in the run-up to the elections, would meet the members of these groups. While Nadda met members of the fishermen community in South 24-Parganas on Thursday during his two day visit to the state, Shah had lunch with a Matua family in Bengal in early-November. Shah is expected to visit Bengal again next week and is likely to visit Bongaon in North 24-Parganas district, which houses the headquarters of the Matuas, a Dalit refugee group with origins in Bangladesh and spread over 50 assembly seats in the state. Multiple cells have been formed to work with and maintain liaison with various target groups including teachers, doctors, traders, ex-servicemen, sportsmen and fishermen, among others. Each cell would have one convener and between one to six co-converners. Also read | 3 held in Bengal for BJP worker’s murder; internal feud, claims TMC“As each community has its own set of issues and problems. Each cell working with a particular community would be well-versed with the developments in that community. When our central leaders come to Bengal and meet and interact with these communities these cells will maintain the liaison,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Shah and Nadda are expected to visit the state separately every month till the assembly elections are over. Shah who is expected to visit the state next week could also visit Santiniketan. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections where the BJP won 40% of the vote share in Bengal and bagged 18 out of the 42 seats in the state, the party is now eyeing for the state assembly. Shah wants the BJP to bag at least 200 of 294 seats in the House. Top state office-bearers of the party with knowledge of the development said 294 BJP leaders will be arriving in Bengal from Delhi and other states to work with the local unit for polls. They would be part of a 45-member team to be set up for each constituency; existing district committees will assist these teams, the office-bearers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sets-up-separate-cells-to-tap-target-groups-ahead-of-bengal-polls/story-ClG6QWfhJIgq7KtzlBr9fP.html

In an interview with Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan, he said that there is a delay because of the rumours being spread about the nature of the bills.“The government has successfully initiated dialogue but the farmers’ union have not been able to reach at a unanimous decision. The news which have emerged in the last two days are astounding. Those who believe in the Left ideology are influencing these protests. Attempts are being made to release traitors. This is condemnable and these elements are stopping the movement from arriving at a verdict. And these elements are not farmers, but those who are against Modi,” he told Hindustan.Also Read:Farmers begin day-long hunger strike as protest against farm laws intensifiesThe Union minister reiterated the government’s stand and clarified that the laws were implemented for the farmers’ benefit. “The government intends for the farmers to get maximum price for their produce and enable them to buy licenses in the market, eliminating the role of middlemen. This would result in increased competition and more profit for the farmers,” he said. On being asked why the country’s farmers are protesting against the laws if they were for their benefit, Tomar said it was only the farmers of Punjab and Haryana who were protesting. “The mandi systems in Punjab and Haryana are very strong and decentralised and farmers in these states fear that the laws will alter them. Farmers in other states have welcomed the laws, they even wanted to come to Delhi to show their support but we stopped them in the hope that dialogue will solve the current deadlock,” he said.Also Read: In UP, BJP plans outreach meet with farmers amid protests against agri lawsTomar also targeted the Congress party and said it is being ‘hypocritical’. “On December 8, farmers were not on the roads.

Congress is practising politics of doublespeak as it had mentioned these laws in its manifesto and had tried to introduce them when in power, but couldn’t do that due to other pressures,” he said.Meanwhile, farmers have begun their one-day hunger strike at various border points near Delhi. “We want to wake the government up. So, 40 farmer leaders of our United Farmers Front will sit on hunger strike today at all borders points between 8 am-5 pm.

14-12-2020||India||Kerala local body elections: Final phase today; 9 million voters to exercise their franchise||Four north Kerala districts are going to the poll today in the final round of a fiercely contested local body election in the state. The election assumes much significance as it being held four months before the assembly elections due in April-May. Nearly 9 million voters will exercise their franchise to elect 354 local bodies and two corporations, Kozhikode and Kannur. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan cast his vote at junior basic school in Pinarayi village along with his family. After exercising his vote, the CM said the ruling Left Democratic Front will better its tally this time as people will give a befitting reply to a malicious campaign unleashed by Opposition Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There is a strict vigil in some of polling booths in Kannur and Kasaragod districts as they are notorious for bogus voting and impersonation. Last week, the high court had ordered the two district administrations to ensure smooth polling. The state election commission has deputed 52,285 officials for the polling duty and installed CCTVs in sensitive polling stations. The main fight is between CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front and Congress-controlled United Democratic Front but the BJP-led National Development Front is posing a serious challenge to both fronts in certain pockets. The Left parties usually perform well in local body elections but this time, the situation is not so easy for them as the government is mired in a number of controversies. CM’s former secretary M Sivasankar is in jail in connection with the gold smuggling case and CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri is in Bengaluru jail in connection with a money laundering case related to narcotics drug haul. Counting of the all three phases will be held on December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-local-body-elections-final-phase-today-9-million-voters-to-exercise-their-franchise/story-AS8IOz0UvwWvQr5T5DOXaI.html
14-12-2020||India||Bihar BJP launches counter offensive in support of farm laws with mega outreach||Amid the ongoing farmers’ stir, Bihar BJP on Sunday launched a 13 day outreach campaign to dispel farmers’ concerns over the new farm laws with Union minister for law Ravi Shankar Prasad and state president Sanjay Jaiswal holding a meeting in Patna to stress that the three heavily-contested laws were beneficial for farmers and would cut the middlemen system in the sale of agricultural produce. Prasad said that Bihar, having scrapped the agricultural marketing boards in 2006, was witness to transformation in the farm sector with farmers getting higher income with the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the state.The farmers in the state were now also producing pineapples, strawberries and litchis in bigger quantities, he said. “I want to clarify that farmers would not have to mortgage their land or sell their land. Under the laws, if a company enters into a contract with any farmers to buy a certain product, the company would provide the farmers better agricultural techniques and seeds. What is wrong in it?” he asked. He stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always wanted farmers to become prosperous.“What is wrong if a farmer has the freedom to sell his produce anywhere in the country instead of just having the option of selling it at Mandis?” he reasoned.Prasad also alleged that the “tukdey tukdey” gang was rallying behind the farm protests and added the government would not allow them to succeed. “ I do not want to name these people. Police have filed charge sheets against them for indulging in Delhi riots and they are unable to get bail. There are now voices being raised to free such so-called intellectuals,” he said, apparently referring to the posters put up at Tikri border for release of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Varavara Rao and Sudha Bharadwaj and others booked under Unlawful Activities ( Prevention) Act.Prasad said that only one section of farmers opposing the laws are in the favour of selling produce only in markets of agricultural marketing boards. Prasad added that the Congress, which was now backing farmer agitation, had promised to scrap the practice of marketing boards in its manifesto in 2019. Bihar BJP president, Jaiswal, said that the ongoing farmers stir was being backed by forces who believe in dividing the country. He claimed that only farmers from Punjab were against the farm laws and accused them of being supporters of a ‘middleman system’ in the sale of agricultural produce. “The farmers wanted an assured minimum support price (MSP). The central government agreed to give a written undertaking. But now, they want repeal of the laws. This is all a conspiracy by anti-India forces. Voices are being raised in support of Omar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, who are facing grave charges of making statements against the country. This shows anti- national elements are behind the protests,” Jaiswal said.Also Read: In UP, BJP plans outreach meet with farmers amid protests against agri lawsThe BJP’s campaign will run in all the 243 Assembly constituencies spanning the 38 districts, where party leaders and workers will hold corner meetings with farmers. All the union ministers from the state will participate in the events.“The protesting farmers are behaving in such a manner as if they represent the entire farming community in the country. That’s why the state BJP has decided to launch the campaign in support of the new laws,” Jaiswal said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the new farm laws which they claim will dilute the minimum support price system and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by corporates and hurt their income.

The CPI-ML( liberation) has meanwhile announced the launch of Kisan Sangharsh yatra across the state to drum up support against the newly enacted three farm laws and to corner the BJP led NDA government over the issue.

14-12-2020||India||Sensitise public, police about rights of LGBTQI+ community: NHRC tells Centre||The National Human Rights Commission’s (NHRC’s) Core Group on LGBTQI+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex) communities has given various recommendations to the government on how to sensitise the general public, law enforcement agencies and the medical community about the Supreme Court judgements and recently passed laws so that the rights of these communities are safeguarded. The Core Group, which met last month for the third time since its formation in June 2018, has recommended to the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment that to reduce the stigma of the LGBTQI+ communities, it must spread awareness and popularise the directions given in NALSA 2014 (National Legal Services Authority) and Navtej Singh Johar 2018 judgements, which recognised transgender as the third gender and decriminalised consensual gay sex respectively. Also read | National Council for Transgender Persons formedSubsequently, it said, there is a need to sensitise law enforcement agencies towards people belonging to LGBTQ+ community. “Proper advocacy and sensitisation programmes should be organised in ministries, both at Central and state level, including national and state human rights commission, to have better understanding of the issues which this community faces,” according to minutes of meetings of Core Group discussion, reviewed by HT. It further asks ministries of social justice, labour and skill development to create employment opportunities for transgender community. Several members of the Core Group pointed out during the meeting that acts of violence, extortion and blackmail against the LGBTQI+ community had increased after the abrogation of Section 377 of Indian Penal Code (the 158-year-old colonial law which criminalised consensual gay sex) by the Supreme Court in 2018. The members discussed that even though Section 18 of the Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 provides for penal offences, it clubs acts ranging from discrimination, coercion, boycott, abuse and physical violence in one group. “The provision appears to confuse distinct civil and penal offences, namely, discrimination, domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence, and none of these offences are defined in the law,” according to the minutes of the Core Group discussion. It has been recommended that Transgender Person Act “must not resort to merely extend the application of the existing penal provision but define the atrocities meted out against them with specific and equal punishments as enumerated in Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.” “Strict and mandatory laws against forced sex reassignment surgery and conversion therapy should be formulated. Introduce horizontal reservations within caste, tribe and other categories of reservation for transgender persons in furtherance of the NALSA judgement,” the Core Group suggested. For ministry of health, it was recommended that Indian Medical Association (IMA) should train medical practitioners for medical examination of transgender persons and sensitise them regarding sex, gender, sexuality and self-identity. It asked that an advisory to all medical students be issued to train them about health issues of these communities. Issues pertaining to unavailability of shelter homes, food and housing facilities and violence against transgender both outside and inside the community; serious lack of understanding of LGBTQI+ community among the general population; lack of education; and lack of understanding with regards to community’s varied range of health and mental health also came up during the discussion. NHRC’s Core Group on LGBTQI includes Ashok Row Kavi (chairman founder, The Humsafar Trust), Laxmi Narayan Tripathi (trangender rights activist), Dr. Piyush Saxena (founder, Salvation of the Oppressed Eunuchs), Harish Iyer (advisory board, MINGLE), Anjali Gopalan (founder & executive director, Naz Foundation), Anand Grover (senior advocate, Supreme Court of India), and Rudrani Chettri (Mitr Trust).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sensitise-public-police-about-rights-of-lgbtqi-community-nhrc-tells-centre/story-2HLbZ6mLCjoFGdRldab9bK.html

We are prepared for fast,” news agency ANI quoted a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri as saying.The protest has been going on for nearly 20 days, with the farmer demanding the repeal of the three laws passed by Parliament in September. On Sunday, the protests continued across Delhi borders with more farmers joining the stir at Singhu (Haryana border).The protesters have been shouting slogans against the government, singing songs, taking out marches with posters and banners, and attending speeches delivered from the stage.One farmer even celebrated the first birthday of his daughter by cutting cakes with fellow demonstrators at Tikri border on Sunday. The farmers decorated the protest site with colourful balloons and posters, wishing the little girl a very happy birthday. The poster also displays a picture of the girl with her family.“My daughter is celebrating back home with her mother and our relatives. When we left our homes, we had vowed not to return before our victory. I am fighting for my daughter’s generation and to secure their land rights,” said the farmer Jagat Singh.The government has so far held five rounds of talks with farmers’ organisations including a meeting called by Union home minister Amit Shah offering changes to the laws and written assurances but the stalemate has been continuing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-begin-day-long-hunger-strike-as-protest-against-farm-laws-intensifies/story-ShnAQFiqKDNzRLUOvgjgLP.html
14-12-2020||India||Goa Zilla Panchayat results a bellwether for Assembly polls, counting begins||Counting of votes for the 48 zilla (district) panchayat polls in Goa has begun with the fate of 200 candidates from the ruling BJP, the opposition Congress and regional parties like the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Aam Aadmi Party hanging in balance. Voting passed off peacefully on Saturday but witnessed a sluggish turnout as the fear of the pandemic, the huge gap between the campaign and the actual voting as well as a general disillusionment left its impact. The state witnessed a voter turnout of 56.82% with 4.50 lakh of the 7.92 lakh eligible voters having cast their vote, which was more than 10% less than the voting percentage at the previous zilla panchayat elections held five years ago. The BJP has fielded 43 candidates in the 48 seats, the Congress has fielded 38, while the Aam Aadmi Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party has fielded 17 candidates each while 79 persons have contested as independent. The district administration has issued prohibitive orders around the counting centres in a bid to prevent any law and order problems and large gatherings of persons that often results in clashes outside counting centres between supporters of rival political parties and candidates. The polls were set to be held on March 22 and all preparations were in place and campaigning had concluded when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the one day ‘Janta curfew’-- a day long stay at home request-- which forced the Goa government to postpone polls, initially for two days, then indefinitely. The polls are also seen as a test of Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the ongoing protests against coal, the failure to restart mining and related issues. Both the BJP and the Congress have expressed confidence that they will emerge victorious at the hustings.With the zilla panchayat bodies performing only a nominal role, the polls are seen more as a preliminary test for political parties ahead of the state assembly elections, which are likely to be held a little more than a year later in early 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-zilla-panchayat-results-a-bellwether-for-assembly-polls-counting-begins/story-YGo2XhpxESvBgl8KyoZ7ZI.html

14-12-2020||India||In UP, BJP plans outreach meet with farmers amid protests against agri laws||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh has decided to hold a series of meetings with farmers to counter opposition parties that have backed the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three contentious farm reform laws. Beginning with the ones in Ayodhya and Basti on Monday, the meets would be held till December 18. At these meetings, senior leaders and ministers will explain why the three contentious laws will eventually be beneficial for the farmers. Nearly all opposition parties in the state, including the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Congress and others, have extended their support to the ongoing farmers’ stir demanding the repeal of the legislations. The BJP government at the Centre has indicated that the laws won’t be withdrawn, though it is ready to introduce key amendments to address farmers’ concerns.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and ministers as well as senior BJP leaders, including state chief Swatantra Dev and UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, who was the agriculture minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first government, would also address these farmers’ meetings, party leaders said. “On Monday, the UP BJP in-charge would launch these farmers’ meetings from Basti and Ayodhya,” said state general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla. While deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya would address a farmers’ meeting in Varanasi on Tuesday, ministers Mahendra Singh (Moradabad), Mukut Bihari Verma (Amethi) and Neelkanth Tiwari (Pratapgarh) would be in different parts of the state for the same reason. The UP BJP chief will address farmers’ rallies in Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Badaun on Monday followed by a meeting in Gonda on Tuesday. “The opposition is misleading the people on the issue of farm laws. Such political parties, who cheated and exploited the farmers for decades, are now acting as the biggest well-wishers of theirs,” Swatantra Dev Singh said. He said the BJP would expose the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-up-bjp-plans-outreach-programme-for-farmers-amid-protests-against-agri-laws/story-CVPJ4UGazmxdLXA92ckuWP.html

The police headquarters issued directives to all district police chiefs to make necessary arrangements to avert any law and of order problem. Commissioner of police (Lucknow) DK Thakur held a late night meeting with police officers to issue directives regarding arrangements to ensure peace during the farmers’ protests. A senior police official said the protests on Monday could be more widespread after farmers failed to leave their mark on two previous occasions on Saturday and December 8 (Bharat Bandh call). The Bharat Bandh, called by various farmer unions against three central agricultural laws, drew a mixed response in UP on Tuesday even as about 1,300 people were detained by police to avert law and trouble. Markets and offices remained largely open while Samajwadi Party, Congress, RLD and Left parties’ workers and some other unions held protests in several districts and even held up a train in Prayagraj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-on-alert-over-farmers-protest/story-SNxIz3OkfvT8zjRGQnSiSP.html

Somvati Amavasya festive bathe which falls on December 14 will witness both participation of pilgrims from within the state and other states. Local priests, trader fraternity and seers had resented the blanket ban on Kartik Poornima festive bath on November 30 for pilgrims after which, the local administration allowed Haridwar residents to take Ganga dip but pilgrims from other states were not allowed. This time, with permissions in place, many pilgrims from other states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Kumaon region were seen arriving on Sunday evening itself with many rest houses and hotels already reporting bookings from these states. While there is no blanket ban on the arrival of pilgrims from other states for Somvati Amavasya, restrictions and preventive measures as per standard operating procedures and guidelines for Covid-19 containment will be in place for the festive bath. “But in case there is a huge influx of pilgrims from other states, then we might now allow more pilgrims to enter the state to check overcrowding here,” said Haridwar district magistrate C Ravi Shankar. Administrative and police officials have been directed to ensure strict implementation of social distancing norms and wearing of face masks and to encourage devotees to avoid coming to Haridwar for the occasion. “Anyone found violating the guidelines will be dealt sternly under Epidemic Disease Act 1897 and Disaster Management Act-2005,” said the Haridwar DM.

Somwati Amawasya will be the last festive bath before Mahakumbh so it assumes more importance for administration too. People come for Somvati Amavasya bath with immense faith, though everyone needs to abide by social distancing norms while coming for a bath at Ganga ghats,” said Ganga Sabha president Praveen Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-allows-festive-bath-for-all-on-somvati-amavasya-before-mahakumbh/story-gwr8gEgz20i8PgmqgQl8CL.html
14-12-2020||India||Chinese debt defaults send investors into a tizzy||Despite claims of an economic recovery, Chinese state-owned companies are defaulting on their debts. A string of missed debt repayments by major firms has shaken local as well as global markets. State firms defaulted on a record $6.1 billion worth of bonds between January and October, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s about as much as the last two years combined. The development has rattled China’s nearly $4 trillion corporate debt market, of which state-owned enterprises are estimated to account for more than half. At least 20 firms suspended plans for new debt issues totalling $2.4 billion, all citing recent market turmoil. The mounting non-payment of debt payments is getting worse in recent weeks. A slew of major companies, including German automaker BMW’s Chinese partner Brilliance Auto Group, top smartphone chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup, and Yongcheng Coal and Electricity declared bankruptcy or defaulted on their loans in November. This was enough to send shock waves through debt market. Bond prices nosedived sharply, interest rates soared and the turmoil even spilt over into the stock market, with shares of state-owned firms plummeting.ALSO WATCH | How India & US can tame aggressive China: Senator Mark Warner #HTLS2020 The defaults have angered global investors, who say their faith in the firms’ top-notch ratings, seemingly sound finances and implicit state backing has been violated. There is a panic among investors who believed that the close relationships between these companies and Chinese governments make them safe bets in times of trouble. But investors are a worried lot as the state is no longer willing to support these companies; investments have suddenly become much riskier propositions.“The credibility of government guarantees has been the most important bulwark against financial crisis so far. Now we are seeing signs that this credibility is eroding,” according to Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group, CNN reported.According to Reuters, the Huachen Automotive Group Holdings Co, the parent of German automaker BMW’s Chinese joint venture partner, defaulted late last month exemplifying opaque risks, underdeveloped pricing mechanisms and investor naivety in China’s corporate bond market. “If the company had told investors it was in great trouble, I wouldn’t have bought and held the bonds,” said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Vincent Jin, who bought Huachen bonds early this year. Huachen boasted an AAA issuer rating when it launched its 1 billion yuan ($151.93 million) three-year, privately placed bond in October 2017. It comes from one of China’s poorer provinces, Liaoning, but as recently as April told bondholders it had adequate cash, lots of land and state backing. Creditors were therefore stunned when Huachen not only defaulted but was also dragged to court by a creditor for bankruptcy restructuring. Moreover, one month before its bond delinquency, Huachen transferred its prized 30 per cent stake in Hong Kong-listed Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd to a subsidiary, leaving bondholders with no access to those assets.Chinese companies have been piling on debt for at least a decade, ever since the government responded to the 2008 crisis by going on a borrowing binge. That kept China’s economy moving but at a cost. The corporate debt-to-GDP ratio surged to a record 160 per cent at the end of 2017, from 101 per cent 10 years earlier. The present dispensation under Xi Jinping tried to rein it in, issuing directives on how money was to be loaned and managed. A particular goal has been to curb China’s $10 trillion ecosystems of shadow banking. So-called local government financing vehicles, which were established to fund infrastructure projects, have already defaulted on many trust loans which were part of that shadow system.China watchers say allowing too many defaults could jeopardise the financial stability and near-term recovery. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently pointed out that widespread failures in the sector could spill over into the banking system, causing banks to cut back on lending more broadly, or increase interest rates, the latter of which is already starting to happen. But, analysts have also noted that rescuing some state-owned firms from collapse is probably a dead end, given how financially cumbersome the sector can be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-debt-defaults-send-investors-into-a-tizzy/story-afMgA0xOGHEZ0jHpyyNJSJ.html

These nationwide protests come a day after farmers had blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Shahjahanpur.

14-12-2020||India||Punjab CM calls Kejriwal ‘shameless liar’, slams him for exploiting farmers’ stir||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh targeted his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal for exploiting the ongoing agitation of the farmers to further the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) petty electoral agenda in Punjab with “blatant lies and brazenly false propaganda”.Cornering Kejriwal, the Punjab chief minister went on to call the AAP chief a “shameless liar”.“In sharp contrast to the Kejriwal government in Delhi, which had been thriving on Ambani crumbs and had been touting its power reforms under the Reliance-run BSES as its biggest achievement, the Punjab government had neither signed any agreement with Adani Power nor was even aware of the private players bidding for power purchase in the state,” Captain Amarinder said in an official release.Responding to Kejriwal’s announcement that he will hold a one-day fast in support of farmers, the Punjab chief minister quipped: “In fact, the Kejriwal government that was shamelessly notifying one of the “black farm laws” on November 23, at a time when farmers were preparing to march to Delhi to protest these very farm laws. And now they are indulging in theatrics by announcing that they would be sitting on fast in support of the farmers’ hunger strike on Monday.”He further alleged that Kejriwal and his party are “busy playing politics” while farmers are sitting outside the national capital for the past 17 days to seek justice.“Do you have no shame? At a time when our farmers are braving the winter cold on the roads outside your city, and many of them are dying fighting for their rights, all you can think of is how to make the most of the opportunity to promote your political interests,” he said.Pointing out that Punjab had been purchasing additional power to support farmers during the sowing season for years, Captain Amarinder said it was obvious that Kejriwal and his party “neither knew nor cared about what goes into sowing or what the needs of the farmers are”.“From backstabbing the farmers by implementing one of the black farm laws, to trying to dump them in a corner of Delhi, Kejriwal had proved time and again that he was no friend of the farmers,” he added.Hundreds of farmers have been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi since late November 26 demanding the government to repeal the newly enacted farm laws. However, the government has held six rounds of talks with farmers’ organisations including the meeting called by Union Home Minister Amit Shah offering changes to the laws and written assurances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-calls-kejriwal-shameless-liar-slams-him-for-exploiting-farmers-stir/story-yNxeI33cgoIXJOXdTWXrNO.html
14-12-2020||India||No rule flouted in election to RS from Gujarat: Jaishankar to SC||External affairs minister S Jaishankar has in the Supreme Court defended his election to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat last year, stating that the procedure of voting adopted by the election commission did not flout any law or constitutional provision. Submitting his affidavit in response to a petition by defeated Congress party candidate Gaurav Hemantbhai Pandya, the minister accused Pandya of “misusing the process of law” by filing several election petitions before the top court. Jaishankar also emphasised that the Congress leader’s appeal against the Gujarat high court’s order is based on “misrepresentation of facts and incorrect understanding of law”. Greater integration between foreign and military policies key to cope with challenges: JaishankarWhat lies at the centre of controversy is the election commission’s decision to hold separate polls for the two RS seats vacated by Union ministers Amit Shah and Smriti Irani in May 2019. The polls were conducted on the same day but through separate voting and both seats were won by the candidates put up by the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) – Jaishankar and Jugal M Lokhandwala. The Congress had hoped to bag at least one RS seat on the basis of single transferable vote had the elections for both seats happened together. Defeated Congress candidates, including Pandya, had thus moved high court, which declined to entertain their petitions. Subsequently, they filed their appeals in the Supreme Court. On November 18, an SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, issued a notice to Jaishankar. At that time, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Pandya, asserted that the petition raised important legal issues about the election commission’s power to conduct separate voting for casual vacancies that arise simultaneously. The SC will take up Jaishankar’s response on Monday when the matter comes up for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-rule-flouted-in-election-to-rs-from-gujarat-jaishankar-to-sc/story-WKLkgIOq4nZHJU1IX7yTaI.html
14-12-2020||India||SC irked at delays in releasing orders||A silence of around 10 months, creating confusion around a judgment, has prompted the Supreme Court to criticise delays by high courts in releasing detailed orders with reasons. A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul termed it “unacceptable” that the top court was repeatedly finding itself constrained to investigate how, when and where a judgment was delivered and then released on the websites. “It is an unacceptable situation. How can an order remain unpronounced for months together? Judicial discipline requires promptness in delivery of judgments,” rued the bench when it came across one such appeal in a motor accident claim case during a hearing on Friday. The controversy in this matter was about the actual date when the judgment was delivered by the Delhi high court. Oriental Insurance, the petitioner before the Supreme Court, claimed that this case was last heard by the high court on July 31, 2019. They next heard about it only in May 2020 when the judgment was already released on the high court’s website, without any notice to them. But this judgment was dated July 31, 2019 and not May 2020. Focus on people, not the population | HT EditorialMoving the SC in appeal, the insurance company complained how this judgment could date back to July 31, 2019 when there was neither any order dictated by the judge in the open court on that date nor was the company’s lawyer told that the ruling was in favour of the other side. This contention compelled the SC to seek a report from the registrar general of the Delhi high court. The high court official was asked to report about the dates when this case was heard; when the judgment was reserved; when the judgment was finally received from the office of the high court judge; and when it was finally released on the website. The report from the high court registrar, however, presented a sorry state of affairs. Cannot cure all ills of system, says top courtThe top court, read out from the registrar’s report that although the case was heard by the high court judge on July 31, 2019, it was only on May 15, 2020 that the file was sent to the branch concerned to release the judgment. “We are talking about the period between July 31, 2019 to May, 2020. This is unacceptable. On this ground alone, this order has to go. We will have to set it aside on the very reason of delay in pronouncing the judgment,” said the bench. It also took exception to a part of the registrar’s report which said that the final order was “indicated” by the high court judge when he heard this matter on July 31, 2019. 2001 Parliament attack: When terror struck India’s temple of democracy“Hence, it appears that even concluding paragraph was not penned down. The judgment is stated not to have been reserved. The file was, however, sent back to the registry after nine-and-half months, on May 15, 2020 and the judgment is uploaded on the same date,” noted the bench in its order. Even as the SC acknowledged that the high court judge appeared to be in some personal difficulty for some time, it lamented that the process, which was required to be followed, was not followed. “If a judgment cannot be delivered on the same date or immediately thereafter, the judgment ought to be reserved to facilitate the judge to pen down the order. Result of not doing so is that the appellant (Oriental Insurance), being the aggrieved party, is not able to avail of legal remedies,” added the SC order as it set aside the high court judgment. Classify social media as news media, subject them to journalistic standards, says SC judgeEarlier, in October this year, the apex court had to seek a similar report from the registrar general of the Bombay high court after it noted that while the petition in this matter was dismissed in January, a detailed order recording the reasons was yet to be released. At that time too, the SC had passed a judgment, holding: “Judicial discipline requires promptness in delivery of judgments – an aspect repeatedly emphasised by this Court. The problem is compounded where the result is known but not the reasons. This deprives any aggrieved party of the opportunity to seek further judicial redressal in the next tier of judicial scrutiny.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-irked-at-delays-in-releasing-orders/story-uUIFbzfMzSBTrFzH5CN4eP.html

Oxides of Nitrogen were one culprit. Remember, NOx can be both the uber dangerous PM2.5 in terms of size plus result in ozone when reacting with pollutants like Volatile Organic Compounds – found in some paints and for cleaning.Why bird feeding should stopToday is a good time to discuss the Covid-19 and air pollution link. It has been five years since the Paris Agreement, and we’ve lost a million lives, apart from losing the year. We’ve also seen it’s possible to control air pollution in India. If we didn’t have such high levels of air pollution, would fewer Indians have died of Covid-19?Possible, but let’s look ahead. In India, fuel and industries emit the most NOx. We must rejig our cities for more public transport and make it easier to use non-motorised transport. As far as industry goes, there is no option but to invest in clean production. Both sources are also significant contributors to climate change. Clearly, we know where the dreadful twain of air pollution and climate change meet. Clamping down on Glyphosate availability first step to curb useNow, in 2020, Covid-19, too, has come to roost here. The pandemic might be a freak event, or not. But we can be sure other pandemics lie ahead. In the past, they’ve all hit our respiratory system, so let’s expect the same ahead. History shows us that prevention is the only real cure. To stay safe, we must treat air pollution as the emergency it is-this is key to being both pandemic and climate resilience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-chronic-air-pollution-may-trigger-more-covid-deaths-in-the-country/story-IvtYnwFwQAlovUb1ChuvPP.html
14-12-2020||India||Congress seeks local leaders’ advice on state heads||In a bid to build consensus over the appointments of party chiefs in many states, the Congress is seeking suggestions from block- and district-level leaders on suitable candidates for the top posts, people familiar with the developments said.The move is largely aimed at checking infighting in states and uniting warring factions, a Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity. The Congress leadership has asked the state incharges to start the consensus-building exercise across the country, he added. The process has kicked off in many states, including Telangana and Maharashtra.In Telangana, All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge Manickam Tagore has so far met 160 leaders, including former Union and state ministers, members of Parliament and legislators, to discuss the names for the new state chief and also the party’s revival strategy. “In the next few days, I am going to meet 500 leaders from block to district and state level leaders,” Tagore said. He said the broad-based consultation process has been initiated to evolve a consensus on the state leadership issue and also to formulate the party’s revival plan ahead of the 2023 assembly elections.Congress ahead of BJP in Rajasthan civic body pollsTelangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy resigned from the post soon after the assembly elections in 2018 but was asked to continue till a replacement was found. The Congress managed to win 19 seats in 2018, two fewer than its 2014 tally in the state. The party suffered successive electoral setbacks despite being instrumental in carving out Telangana by bifurcating Andhra Pradesh just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.The party fought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Telangana and the just-concluded Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls under Reddy’s leadership and fared badly in both. While the Congress won three seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party bagged just two seats in the GHMC polls.Shashi Tharoor joins protesting MPs at Jantar Mantar, says govt failed nation and farmers Soon after, Reddy again submitted his resignation, prompting the party leadership to look for his replacement. Similarly, the Congress has started the consultation process in Maharashtra and Mumbai units, according to the person quoted above. Maharashtra Congress unit Balasaheb Thorat is holding a ministerial post in the state. Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole and the Congress party’s Gujarat incharge Rajeev Satav are front runners to replace Thorat.Political analysts say the Congress is facing a leadership crisis in Telangana and over the past 7-8 years, its organisational structure has also collapsed.Hyderabad-based political analyst C Narasimha Rao said the Congress needs to strengthen the organisational structure at the block and the district levels. “Unlike the Bhartiya Janata Party, the Congress has cadre and structure in rural areas. But it is missing the dedicated leaders there. The party should immediately appoint office bearers at block and district levels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-seeks-local-leaders-advice-on-state-heads/story-mEqRtAGbxLt6I4vIJfa7qO.html
14-12-2020||India||Farm leader: Shah agreed not consulting farmers a mistake||Farm union leader Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakaji has said that Union home minister Amit Shah during talks on December 8 had urged farmers to deliberate on the government’s proposal, saying the Centre had made the mistake of not consulting farmers. Kakaji, who previously led a large-scale farmers’ protest in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur in 2016, said: “The home minister requested us to take part in talks. He said the government made a mistake in not holding consultations with farmers prior to the talks.” Key farmer leader favours talks, says ‘goalposts shifted’Kakaji, giving details of what transpired between the farmers and the minister a day ahead of a breakdown in negotiations, said Shah told them that the government was sensitive to the points raised by the farmers and the government would send a formal document of proposals suggesting amendments. “We told the home minister we were not interested in amendments but seek a repeal of all three laws,” Kakaji told reporters. There was no response to a query sent to the home ministry on Kakaji’s comments till the time of going to press.Amid the prevailing deadlock between farmers and the central government over the new farm laws, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Som Parkash met home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. Farmers to step up stir, plan sit-in across country todayMeanwhile, the farmers’ agitation in and around Delhi entered its 18th day on Sunday, with farmers blocking the Delhi-Jaipur highway and sticking to their demand for a repeal of the new agriculture laws that they say were designed to benefit large corporations at the cost of cultivators’ interests, even as the government has maintained it would benefit the sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leader-shah-agreed-not-consulting-farmers-a-mistake/story-oxGKsO5imkQgezFx51s7FP.html
14-12-2020||India||Key farmer leader favours talks, says ‘goalposts shifted’||A key leader of the ongoing protests against three new agriculture laws has expressed dissatisfaction with the agitation, breaking ranks with his colleagues in the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a platform leading the protests. Sardar VM Singh, convener of the AIKSCC, told HT that the agitation was “not going right” and farm unions should not make scrapping of the laws a precondition for talks with government or shut the door on negotiations. If the government were to accede to the farmers’ demand for a law stipulating that no buyer shall purchase farm produce below state-set minimum support prices, then the government should be free to push reforms to modernise the farm sector, Singh said. Farmers to step up stir, plan sit-in across country todayHowever, Yogendra Yadav, a prominent member of the AIKSCC, said the organisation neither agreed with what Singh said nor was he authorised to speak on behalf of the platform. Several leaders of the AIKSCC said they dissociated themselves from Singh’s stand. “The national working group of the AIKSCC condemns and disassociates itself from the statement made by VM Singh. The statement was neither authorised by AIKSCC nor did it follow the protocols of decision making by the working group,” Yadav, along with 13 senior leaders of the AIKSCC, said. Singh, on the other hand, said the farm unions had “shifted goalposts”. “Our initial demand was about legislating a private member’s bill in Parliament to guarantee MSP.” Farmers block Jaipur-Delhi highway in RewariSingh’s organisation, which holds sway over cane and paddy growers from Uttar Pradesh, looks keen to carry on negotiations with the government, a stand that will help give the Prime Minister Narendra Modi administration a window of opportunity to restart stalled negotiations. On Saturday, 15 farm producer organisations met farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar demanding the government continue with the reforms. “If the government brings a law to guarantee MSP, then farmers shouldn’t care about whether Adani or Ambani is buying (produce),” Singh said. Fifth NFHS shows malnutrition and obesity on the riseFarm unions on protest have alleged the reforms will give a free run to agribusinesses owned by tycoons Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani. Singh leads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh. He was behind a landmark suit in the Supreme Court in 2000, whose verdict resulted in better prices for cane growers. Some economists say a law on making MSP binding makes little economic sense. “If private traders don’t find it profitable to buy at MSP when demand is low, they will simply exit the market,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. Singh said the government was wrong to focus mainly on Punjab-based farmers for the talks. “I demand that the government talk to us and farmers from UP and other states. It is up to the government to invite us,” he said, expressing willingness to engage with the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-farmer-leader-favours-talks-says-goalposts-shifted/story-0ZvaWESZozItBYB8kkVFDL.html
14-12-2020||India||Farmers to step up stir, plan sit-in across country today||Farmers will hold sit-in protests at all district headquarters in the country and some of their leaders will go on a hunger strike from 8am to 5pm on Monday, representatives of several farm unions said on Sunday as they planned to escalate their agitation against new agriculture laws, with thousands of more farmers having begun their journey to the Capital from villages in Rajasthan.Earlier, the farmers blocked the Jaipur-Delhi highway at Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan, while police in Haryana, which falls along the way, halted large groups from proceeding to Delhi, raising the likelihood of more access routes to the national capital being blocked.The farmers’ protests, which began with a large group from Punjab that has now camped at the Singhu border, began 17 days ago and have evolved into a larger political controversy, with the members from the ruling government blaming opposition parties for the confrontation.Chila border: Delhi-Noida road reopened after farmers clear outOn Sunday, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Som Parkash met Union home minister Amit Shah along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders from Punjab. It is not clear what was discussed at the meeting. Later in the day, Tomar, while meeting a delegation of farmers from Uttarakhand, said the backlash against the new laws was being created by “people who just oppose and weaken the country”.Opposition leaders reiterated their support for the farmers and called on the government to heed to their demands. “I want to appeal to the central government to put an end to their ego. The governments are formed by the public, the public is not formed by the governments. The three farm laws should be immediately repealed and a bill should be brought to guarantee MSP to farmers,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.At Delhi’s Singhu border, where the largest of the gatherings of the protesters has camped, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni and other union heads held a press conference and said they will observe a one-day hunger strike between 8 am to 5pm on Monday as part of a plan to intensify their agitation. “Also dharnas will be staged at all district headquarters across the country. The protest will go on as usual,” he told reporters.Farmers to fast for a day, gathering at Singhu swellsThe leader also spoke about certain other farmer union members who appeared to break ranks with the protesting groups. “There are groups that are ending protest and saying they are in favour of laws passed by the government. We want to clarify that they are not associated with us. They have been hand-in-glove with the government; they conspired to sabotage our protest. The government is hatching a conspiracy to derail the ongoing farmers’ protest,” added Chaduni.Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said: “Government agencies have been stopping farmers from reaching Delhi, but the protest will continue till their demands are met. Our stand is clear; we want the three farm laws repealed. All farmer unions participating in this movement are together.”‘Opposition trying to destabilize nation through farmers’ stir’: Yogi AdityanathAnother farmer leader, Rakesh Tikait, said: “If the government gives another proposal for talks, our committee will decide on it. We appeal to all to maintain peace during protest.”Including the one at Singhu, seven border points in the national capital continue to remain closed. The farmers’ rebellion was set off by three laws pushed by the government in September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.The government has proposed to amend some provisions for greater oversight but farm unions say they won’t call off their agitation until the laws are fully repealed.Ludhiana as cold as Shimla, undeterred farmers march onFollowing a prolonged stand-off after talks failed last week, the farmers plan to intensify their movement in the coming period. Amid the ongoing demonstration, farmers protesting near Jaisinghpur Kheda area in Rewari at the Rajasthan-Haryana border are waiting for more farmers to arrive, for their march towards Delhi.“Today more people and unions are coming from Rajasthan at the border area. After gathering the crowd, we will move towards Delhi. Among other things, we want the three laws to be repealed. We are standing with the farmers of Punjab and Haryana. We don’t have any separate demands. We are with our union leaders,” said Banwari Lal from Jaipur, who is convener of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-to-step-up-stir-plan-sit-in-across-country-today/story-YrltUF3UqlvXrxBol7KJZI.html

The Prime Minister’s directive followed an alarming increase in the number of breaches and attempted breaches of government computer systems. In an order sent to all general managers in Indian Railways, the Railway Board noted that the national transporter had shifted the bulk of its operations to an Information & Communication Technology (ICT) platform and stressed the need to safeguard critical information.Railways innovates, makes side berths comfortable“It has been observed that, in recent times, an alarming increase has been seen in the number of breaches/attempted breaches to ICT infrastructure of Govt Organisations. The Government of India, at the highest level, is also seized of the need for adequately and appropriately securing the ICT infrastructure,” the Railway Board said in the order, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.“It has, therefore, been decided that certain strength of officials from each Railway Unit with aptitude in ICT hardware, software, networking and compliances may be identified for forming the group for that Unit, to begin with. This group would work under the overall supervision of the nominated CISO (chief information security officer) of the Railway Unit,” the order stated. Southern Railway extends travel relaxation for women passengers in Chennai suburban trainsThe PM, during a presentation on the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020 on September 1, said: “Every ministry has some personnel with technical aptitudes. These are to be identified and trained in cyber security courses within six months. These should then form the cyber security nucleus of that ministry.”In recent times, the railways has had to deal with a slew of cases in which illegal applications were used to book tickets, bypassing the railway firewall. While many such rackets have been busted by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) , newer technology replace those.In November, a meeting was convened by the secretary (Security) in the Cabinet secretariat to firm up the roadmap for implementation of the PM’s directive, the order from the Railway Board stated.According to the minutes of the meeting on the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020, reviewed by HT, these officials will be trained in both practical and theoretical aspects of cyber security through a course prepared by the ministry of electronics and information technology of around six to eight hours. For advanced training, officers who are technically qualified or and have a requisite aptitude for cyber security or information technology will be identified.The training according to the note should enable officers to “troubleshoot”.The Railway Board has also allotted nominations for each railway unit. While the zonal railways have been assigned eight such officers each for generic training and four for the advanced courses, railway public sector undertakings have four each nominated for its regular training courses and two for advanced ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-troubleshooters-to-help-fight-cybersecurity-breaches/story-VAoin5KqG4Fv2oqYI8cx3H.html
14-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||A crowded outdoor vegetable market in Chennai, the HQ of a Muslim missionary group in Delhi, Onam celebrations in Kerala, Ganesh Chaturthi festivities in Mumbai — all ended up being super-spreader events by causing a subsequent spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in their respective cities. Indeed, in every country in the world, events and gatherings of this nature — from parties to a large motorcycle rally to even a biotech conference — have all been super-spreader events. Yet, over the past two months, India has bucked the trend. Govt made record payments under MGNREGS this yearThe elections in Bihar, a state with a population of at least 120 million, witnessed several large rallies and meetings. A review of video footage of these meetings and rallies shows poor Covid-19 safety protocols — not everyone is seen wearing masks, and there is no social distancing. Scenes from some of the large rallies by popular political leaders show tens of thousands of people crowding together, displaying behaviour that is all social and no distancing. Yet, Bihar did not see a spike after these meetings. Sure, the state continues to rely almost exclusively on rapid antigen tests — these are unreliable — but there has been no spike in deaths that points to a corresponding surge in unrecorded cases.As on December 12, Bihar had seen 1,317 deaths and recorded 242,748 cases. That translates into a case fatality rate of 0.54%. The corresponding numbers at the national level were 143,073 and 9,857,345, for a case fatality rate of 1.45%. If Bihar’s fatality rate were the same as the country’s, it would have seen 3,520 deaths to date — and 2,203 deaths are not easily hidden even in a state like Bihar. And anecdotally, there hasn’t been enough evidence of this happening in the state.Fifth NFHS shows malnutrition and obesity on the riseSure, given patchy record keeping in most parts of India, it will be months before data on overall deaths in 2020 can be compared with that in 2019 (or a long-term average) to see whether there is an unexplained spike from unknown reasons. These deaths can then be attributed to Covid-19. This is how, early in the pandemic, The New York Times and the Financial Times found an under-reporting in deaths in many countries. A similar study in India will have to wait. It’s very likely there has been an under-reporting of deaths in most Indian states, but we have no way of knowing the magnitude of this (right now), except to recognise that this has not been significant enough to show up in death records (however patchy these are) or be noticed from a spike in burials or cremations.Cases are a different issue. I have reasoned in past installments of the column that India’s infection death rate (number of deaths to total number of infections) could be 0.1%, which would mean that the country has seen 143 million coronavirus disease infections to date, with Bihar seeing 1.3 million of them.Returning to the issue of super-spreader events, the elections in Bihar are not the only ones to have bucked the trend. So have Durga Puja and Diwali. Centre plans awareness drive for vaccine doubtersThis is something that definitely merits further study — it’s the kind of thing the Indian Council of Medical Research must be doing — because it could shed light on the current and, more importantly, future trajectory of the coronavirus disease in the country.Equally study-worthy (and I have written about this before) are the reasons behind Bihar and Uttar Pradesh’s low Covid-19 numbers, something that can’t be entirely explained by the adequacy of testing, the kind of tests used (UP does far more RT-PCR tests than Bihar and many other states), or poor documentation. Experts believe that Africa’s low Covid-19 numbers can be attributed to a younger demography and exposure to their infectious diseases (including those caused by other coronaviruses). That could be true of UP and Bihar as well — both their populations had a median age of just around 21 in 2011, almost the same as Kenya’s currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-RRa2fyNDkzpdaZ3rw58xKL.html
14-12-2020||India||Govt made record payments under MGNREGS this year||In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre has made a record payment to workers enrolled in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the first eight months of the current financial year, leaving it with just 10% of he money allocated for it to spend in the final four months.The rural development ministry, which administers the world’s biggest job guarantee scheme, was allocated Rs 84,900 crore in two instalments to fund MGNREGS in the year ending in March 2021. Of this amount, it had spent Rs 76,800 crore in April-November. The amount spent in the same period last year was about Rs 50,000 crore. Central schemes help country fare better on wellness index: Survey In fact, the ministry has spent 12 percentage points more than the allocation made in the budget and has the highest expenditure rate among all Central government ministries, shows the Controller General of Accounts website. As the expenditure report shows, a finance ministry official privy to the matter said, there would be no shortage of funds for MGNREGS and additional money will be provided to it as and when needed.Demand for work under the scheme, which mandates at least 100 days of manual work a year for at least one member of every rural household, surged in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the following lockdown, which triggered an exodus of workers from the cities to the countryside.A MGNREGS tracker released on Thursday said the expenditure on the scheme was on account of 10 million more households getting work this year (until November), a 243% increase in person days (work) generated and higher wages paid to workers as compared to the previous year.“The total active job cards this year was 90.2 million and of them 83.09% sought work,” the tracker prepared by People Action for Employment Guarantee, a network of NGOs, said. Finance ministry report says economy witnessing V-shaped recoveryAlthough the demand peaked in May, it slowed in the subsequent months as workers from poorer states such as Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand started returning to cities. The tracker said the average work provided to individual households was less than in the previous years. Till November end, an average household got 41.59 days of work as compared to 48.4 in 2019-20 and 50.88 in 2018-19. Only 1.9 million households got work for the 100 days mandated under the law compared to 4.06 million last year. Of them, 210,000 were in Rajasthan and 350,000 in Andhra Pradesh, which also dipped into their own funds to ensure NREGA workers received money on time. The number of households getting 100 days of work was the lowest in Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu among all Indian states. The report also said that around 13% of the 75 million households who demanded work under the scheme got none. “The data shows that there was surge for NREGA work demand due to pandemic and the government failed to meet the demand,” the report said. Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were the two states where one-fourth of households demanding work were not engaged in manual work even for a single day, the data showed. Rajasthan and West Bengal did well to keep the unmet demand lower than the national average. Jharkhand’s rural development secretary Aradhana Patnaik said the state was one of the best performers. “We have been stagnating around 70 million man days for past three years. But, we have achieved 77.7 million man days against the target of 80 million,” she said. What the Indian markets don’t tell you | AnalysisRajasthan’s MGNREGS commissioner PC Kishan said the scheme’s implementation in the state is demand-driven, hence unmet demand was less and employment provided higher than the previous years. Nikhil Dey, a former member of the MGNREGS Council, said, “We would have been happy if more people would have got at least 100 days of work.... That did not happen and it proves government inefficiency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-made-record-payments-under-mgnregs-this-year/story-njnNUnJmcyDsPG356cBaJM.html
14-12-2020||India||‘Regional language reform has been long-awaited’: Union education minister tells HT||The move to impart technical education in regional languages from 2021 is aimed at ensuring equity, especially with rural students in mind, but “there will not be any compromise on the quality of the IITs”, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank told HT’s Amandeep Shukla in an email interview. Acknowledging that there were concerns from some quarters, Pokhriyal emphasised that the decisions will evolve from a consultative process and only implemented in those IITs that are ready. Here are the excerpts from the interview.Q) You have formed a task force on the teaching of technical engineering in regional languages. Are Indian institutions prepared for such a change?A) I believe that the reform has been long-awaited by the higher education institutes and students who study in regional languages. Our vision emanates from the National Education Policy (NEP) which recommends that “More HEIs, and more programmes in higher education, will use the mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually”. The Official Language Commission, Emotional Integration Committee, National Education Policy (1968), National Education Policy (1986/1992) -- each report, while recommending the use of Indian language as the medium of instruction, also pronounced that Indian languages are a sine qua non (something that is essential if you want to achieve a particular thing) for the educational and cultural development of our nation, enunciating the notion of ‘Equity in Education’.Education minister asks school leaders to make efforts for effective implementation of NEPI am very encouraged with the support of many leading thinkers, intellectuals and even certain directors of IITs and NITs towards the initiative. We have also decided to conduct the JEE exam in the regional languages so that students will not be at a disadvantage because of language.This reform will assist talented students from rural areas in studying in their languages without being alienated. This policy initiative will positively benefit students from rural areas and far-flung areas.Many IITs such as IIT Kharagpur and IIT Roorkee have already undertaken steps to promote the use of regional languages in their teaching in the first year. IIT Kharagpur has started with the development of a policy framework for regional language education not only at schools but also in technical institutes so that language does not become a barrier to learning.Also read: Date for next round of talks with farmers soon - Union ministerQ) Some heads of leading institutions have expressed doubts, reservations or even caution against the move. How do you plan to move ahead?A) One of the main concerns is regarding rankings and quality of the IITs. I would reiterate that “there will not be any compromise with the quality of the IITs”. We want to make IITs world-class. We have declared many IITs as Institutes of Eminence (IOE).Till now, the ministry of education has adopted the approach that all implementation modalities will be taken through a consultative process. The implementation modalities of this decision will also be taken after proper deliberations and consultations. I have taken the lead by holding the first meeting to seek suggestions and understand the issues involved. In this meeting, it was decided to set up a task force to examine all the issues threadbare. Now that the task force is set up, there should not be any apprehensions.Q) Many of our institutions have made a name for themselves globally by teaching in English. How will you ensure this value remains intact? That there is no dilution of standards.A) We are creating an enabling environment for students who are studying in regional languages to excel in technical courses. I think the overall quality will improve because when students understand concepts in their mother tongue, they can think better. We never said English would go away, and we are only saying that in addition to English, an environment should be created in higher education institutes where students from regional languages can also excel.Multiple JEE (Main) in a year could be possibleMany countries have excellent educational systems, and they do not use English as a medium of instruction. If we can educate our students in the mother tongue also, along with English, we will ensure that we can make global citizens who at the same time will be vocal for local.Q) Is it possible that such a step can be taken from the next session itself? Which are the languages in which courses can commence?A) The implementation of regional language in the technical courses will happen in a phase-wise manner, starting from the year 2021. This initiative will be implemented in those IITs which are ready. We understand that there are a lot of issues starting with quality of textbooks, reference material, training the faculty to teach in their mother tongue, using technology to connect various institutes where faculty are available to teach in mother tongue, etc. The task force will outlay the detailed implementation plan of the same.Q) There has been a demand to hold the Common Admission Test (CAT) exam in Hindi and other languages as well. What are your views on it?Also read: ‘Will enforce only CAA,’ says Vijayvargiya as BJP takes U-turn on NRC in BengalA) I am glad that IIMs have already taken the lead by starting a deliberation on conducting the CAT exam in Schedule VIII languages. I believe that CAT applicants will appreciate the language option when made available.Q) The academic session 2020-21 has been badly affected by the pandemic. How are you planning the next academic session? What would the next year of school or college be like for students?A) I have been conducting rigorous, participative and inclusive consultation with students, teachers and parents.

14-12-2020||India||Date for next round of talks with protesting farmers soon: Union minister||The government will soon call farmers’ leaders for the next round of talks to end the deadlock over the farm laws, Union minister Kailash Choudhary said on Sunday as agitators intensified their protest against the central legislation with road blockades and a plan for a one-day hunger strike on Monday. There have been five rounds of talks between the Centre and representatives of 40 farmers’ unions so far and they have remained inconclusive.The sixth round was cancelled after farmers’ leaders rejected the government’s draft proposal to amend certain provisions of the farm laws and declined to participate in the meeting. The government has made it clear that it is ready for discussion anytime. But the farmer unions have said they would come for talks only if the laws are repealed.“The meeting will be called soon. We are ready for discussion. But the date has not been finalised,” Chaudhary, the minister of state for agriculture, told PTI. “We have full confidence. In the next meeting, the issue will be resolved,” he said and added that the government will find “some solution” to end the impasse.Also Watch | Tomar meets Uttarakhand farmers; Shashi Tharoor joins protesting MPs Also read | Some just oppose, weaken the country: Tomar’s latest jab at oppn over farmers’ stirChaudhary said Union home minister Amit Shah and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who is leading negotiations with protesting farmers’ unions to break the deadlock over the farm laws, are holding discussions on the issue.

14-12-2020||India||Some just oppose, weaken the country: Tomar’s latest jab at oppn over farmers’ stir||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday accused opposition parties of running a propaganda against the new farm laws and said these legislations “may cause difficulty for some in the short term” but will help farmers in the long run. Tomar, who is leading negotiations with protesting farmers’ unions to break the deadlock over the laws, was addressing a delegation of more than 100 farmers from Uttarakhand who extended their support to the laws.Tomar said the government faced opposition when it revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. It also faced opposition when it brought the amended citizenship law as well as over the Ram Temple issue. “When the agricultural reforms were brought, there was opposition to this too... There are some people who just oppose and weaken the country. This has become their nature,” the agriculture minister said.Also Watch | Tomar meets Uttarakhand farmers; Shashi Tharoor joins protesting MPs Also read | Arvind Kejriwal says will fast in support of farmers on MondayThe minister said that discussion has been going on for many years on agricultural sector reforms. “Unfortunately, the previous governments who wanted to reform were not able to it. Since they could not try, they did get the credit,” he added. “Manmohan Singh Ji (former prime minister) tried many times but could not do. Today when it is implemented, propaganda is being spread,” Tomar said.Tomar stressed reforms are necessary for a new India. “When reforms are undertaken it will benefit farmers in the long run. But in the short run, some may face difficulty. We know we can achieve no gain without difficulties,” the minister said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn’t bring reform or schemes for the sake of current impact alone but for long-term benefit, Tomar said. The Prime Minister, Tomar said, has fulfilled the long-pending demand of farmers. “Any good government or good leader is one who does such work that not only ensures the country’s safety for now but also boosts growth in the next hundred years,” he said.Also read | New laws meant to make farmers prosperous: ModiTomar, along with minister of state for commerce and industry Som Parkash, met Union home minister Amit Shah earlier in the day as the deadlock between the central government and protesting farmers on the three new farm laws continued for the 18th day and threatened to block the Delhi-Jaipur highway. The Delhi-Jaipur highway was partially opened post 2pm after it was blocked as farmers began a march from Shahjahanpur of Alwar district on the Rajasthan-Haryana border as part of their protests. Police in Haryana did not allow them to march to the national capital resulting in the highway blockade.Farmers’ unions, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system under which government agencies buy their crop at an assured price. The Centre, in its proposal to farmers on Wednesday, had said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-just-oppose-weaken-the-country-tomar-s-latest-jab-at-oppn-over-farmers-stir/story-KAsYIpbgknDZ1N9aVoIoRK.html

14-12-2020||Editorials||NFHS: The good and bad news | HT Editorial||The first phase of the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), results of which have just been released, brings both good and bad news. First, the good news. Several of the 22 states and Union Territories (UTs), for which findings have been released, showed an increase in childhood immunisation. There has been a drop in neonatal mortality in 15 states, a decline in infant mortality rates in 18 states and an increase in the female population (per 1,000 males) in 17 states. Fertility rate decline and increase in contraceptive use were registered in almost all the states surveyed. The bad news is that there has been an increase in stunting and wasting among children in several states, a rise in obesity in women and children, and an increase in spousal violence. In several other development indicators, the needle has hardly moved since the last NFHS.While the results of the remaining states and UTs will be required to work out national averages, the available data provides a glimpse into challenges. There has been a severe disruption in the midday meal scheme in areas due to the pandemic. Several states have take-home meal arrangements for out-of-school children but they have no way of ensuring that in situations where resources are stretched, the intended beneficiary will get the food. The government must begin identifying areas where malnutrition and anaemia among children are severe and work with communities and civil society to improve nutrition and food security policies. Stunting and wasting have long-term effects which include lower abilities in school, increased child mortality, vulnerability to diseases, and chronic illness in adulthood among others.The paradox, in a sign of glaring inequality, is that this is accompanied with a rise in obesity, especially among women and children. Even before the pandemic, the trend towards obesity was driven by the lack of awareness of good food habits resulting in greater consumption of high-fat, high-sugar foods and sedentary lifestyles. Increasing obesity will exacerbate conditions such as cardio-vascular disease, diabetes and hypertension. Though NFHS-5 is not complete, there is enough data to frame positive intervention policies. Community health workers have been in the frontline of the fight against Covid-19. For a start, better nutrition, health and awareness programmes can be mainstreamed into their efforts to begin the process of reversing some of the problems identified in NFHS-5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/nfhs-the-good-and-bad-news-ht-editorial/story-6PUs2HlGG0hGyrBHEmRlGO.html
