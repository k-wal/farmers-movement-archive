27-12-2020||News||SolarWinds: Cyber strategists are back to the drawing board||The SolarWinds hack – a cyber espionage campaign compromising critical organisations of the US – has fundamentally disrupted the power dynamics of cyberspace. It is not only a major setback to the cyber statecraft initiatives of the United States (US) which took years to mature, but also challenges the basic assumptions upon which the West’s strategy for cyber dominance rest. The operation, said to have begun in March, was only discovered this month when FireEye – an American cyber intelligence company – found out that its own network had been breached. The investigation led responders through a proverbial rabbit hole as it became obvious that, before the intruders audaciously pivoted to FireEye’s network, they had “popped” almost 50 other US organisations including the departments of Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy & Homeland Security; companies such as Cisco, Intel, Nvidia, and VMware; and critical agencies such as the National Nuclear Safety Administration. The hack of the decade is being attributed to SVR, the discrete Russian foreign intelligence agency. The tradecraft employed by the spies was brilliant as they managed to evade every defence in a global surveillance dragnet feeding the counterintelligence capability of the US and its allies. By backdooring the update mechanism of a wildly popular IT administration software called SolarWinds Orion, the intruders managed to acquire a beachhead in any of its 300,000 customers. At every step of the “kill chain,” the operators showed remarkable ingenuity. They had no plans to outmatch the strategic cyber offensive might of the US, so the spies tactically blended-in with the environment, exploited “transitive trust” of the computers, and used deception to look like routine processes. Yet, beyond all the technical details, it was the palpable strategic calculus which strikes at the heart of US cyber policy. The intrusion came at a time when the US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) – it has a powerful mandate since the Russian interference into the 2016 presidential elections – declared itself as a formidable force. Its Defend Forward strategy was premised upon undertaking pre-emptive, extrajudicial cyber operations within the adversary’s own information space – neutralising a potential threat even before it was instantiated. However, the strategy did not assume that USCYBERCOM could undertake such expeditionary manoeuvres in every hostile network. The idea was to send a credible deterrence threat by a selective use of “force” to coerce or compel the adversary. USCYBERCOM aspired to strike a ‘tacit bargain’ (from the international relations parlance) with the adversary by ‘signalling’ that any malicious action would lead to the imposition of unacceptable costs. The Defend Forward strategy was based on some broad, sweeping assumptions. First, that the traditional structures of deterrence by denial and punishment remained valid in cyberspace. Second, that cyberspace is a ‘domain’ allowing militaristic power projection at a ‘place and time of choosing.’ There was also a retroactive implication that cyber operations more or less adhered to the law of armed conflict, thus bestowing legitimacy upon Western offensive counteractions. Third, that on a broader scale, pre-emptive cyber operations legitimised by the West would trigger a kind of creative destruction, thus calcifying a rules-based order in cyberspace. The overall strategy was that the establishment of global cyber norms premised upon international law would reinstate the ‘neoliberal institutionalist’ concept of power by punishing states that thrived on impunity. Busy with the 2020 elections and potentially distracted by the threat of Russian disinformation, the US establishment thought that it could somehow stretch Defend Forward into a national doctrine. And so, what was basically an expeditionary manoeuvre, which had evolved in a specific cultural silo of the US cyber apparatus, became the cornerstone of statecraft. The groupthink was obvious as the Cyberspace Solarium Commission – a whole-of-government grand strategy for cyberspace formulated by the US government – even elevated Defend Forward to the hallowed pedestal of “Layered Cyber Deterrence,” a proposed international strategy. All this happened almost overnight even as the evidence of Defend Forward’s success remained limited in the public sphere. It was a perfect storm in the making and the SVR made the best of it. Russia was neither deterred nor compelled; it could not be coerced, nor did it opt for an explicit or tacit bargain. In fact, as a dichotomy which would never ever be encountered in a conventional domain of war like land, sea or air, Russia chooses to see cyberspace using a wholly different assumptive paradigm. Its structures of power projection are purely cognitive. And being an undemocratic entity, such a projection does not impinge upon its internal stability. General-Major V. D. Ryabchuk, the father of Russian strategic deception, alluded that “thought is the first to enter battle.” In that sense, Russia’s cyber actions have successfully managed to break the will, demoralise and eventually deter its adversaries – including those from the West – quite a few times. The fact of the matter is that state-to-state espionage is a-okay, which is what this hack was. Cyber strategists are now back to the drawing board as even the most meticulously derived variables and equations of cyber power look like unfounded abstractions. It is a moment of reckoning for the neoliberal system which was the very foundation of the Internet.

The bank paid it and the Noida Authority executed a registered lease deed in its favour in October 25 and the possession certificate was issued five days later on the payment of stamp duty of ₹66.10 lakh.However, the district assistant commissioner for stamp calculated stamp dues as Rs.82.89 lakh. Since the bank paid Rs.66.10 lakh stamp duty, the district assistant commissioner for stamp in 2014 issued a notice to the bank claiming there was a ₹16.79 lakh deficit with regard to the stamp duty. raised the demand for deficit of Rs 16.79 lakh with a 100 per cent penalty. The cost of plot calculated was at the market value and not according to the authority allotted amount because of which the bank approached the court for resolution.However, on the given date, bank’s advocate failed to appear in court and the then additional district magistrate (Revenue & Finance) Keshav Kumar passed an ex-parte order (issued when either party to the case is not present) for payment of the deficit with a penalty of ₹33.58 lakh.Appealing before the high court, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the bank was ready to deposit the deficit but wished that the matter be heard on merits of the case. In the interest of justice, the court found lapses on the part of advocate (who failed to appear before the ADM) and said the bank should not suffer.“High court judge Mahesh Chandra Tripathi set aside the ADM’s orders and directed that the matter be decided afresh. Bank of Maharashtra has been directed to deposit the outstanding amount with a nationalised bank. Any deposit would be subject to final outcome of ADM proceedings,” said Amrish Sahai, petitioner’s advocate.“On getting the high court order copy and petitioner reply to show cause notice, matter will be decided afresh as per law,” MN Upadhyay, ADM (FR) said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/high-court-directs-noida-admin-to-revisit-decision-to-impose-penalty-on-bank/story-cSIRAWRU7fSfRSyvZM65FJ.html

27-12-2020||Noida||Farmers camped at Chilla border beat utensils to highlight their issues||Farmers camped at Chilla border on Sunday took to beating utensils to highlight their plight and to get the government to withdraw three contentious farm laws that were passed in September this year.The beating of utensils by the farmers at the sit-in protest, symbolically overlapped with the Prime Minister’s monthly radio show — Mann ki Baat — to send out a message.A farmer from Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Bhanu faction said that this was their way of showing the “Mann ki Baat” of an average farmer. “Maybe this will get them (the government) to realize what our issues are,” said Bhanu state president, Yogesh Pratap Singh.The farmers have been camped at the Chilla border for 27 days now, singing old country songs and raising slogans against the new farm laws as they look to intensify their stir.“We will continue to remain patient and we refuse to give up. Our supporters are being stopped and illegally detained or harassed on orders of the government. But that will not deter us from our mission. Our stance is clear and the onus is with the government to sort out the issues ,” said Singh.The group camped at Chilla is constantly being joined by smaller factions from various UP districts. A second group from Aligarh joined them on Saturday, while those who were stopped in Amroha have also reached the border.Chilla border closed on December 1 but was re-opened on December 13. However, farmers alleged that the state was stopping their supporters from reaching them after which the Noida to Delhi side was blocked by agitators once more on December 16.Another faction from BKU’s Lokshakti — that is camping at the nearby Dalit Prerna Sthal — took out a rally on Sunday.“We are the providers for the nation and we wanted to remind the government the same. So, during our rally we fed birds and animals that we saw around us. Our position on MSP and other issues is clear and it is the government who needs to understand that,” said Dr SK Giri, national spokesperson, Lokshakti.Meanwhile, police personnel are hopeful that the next round of meetings between the Centre and farmer representatives will be fruitful after which the border can be re-opened.“Law and order is stable and even traffic is moving smoothly via DND. But hopefully, a consensus will be reached in the meeting on December 29 and we would be able to re-open the border soon,” said a senior police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-camped-at-chilla-border-beat-utensils-to-highlight-their-issues/story-gJxmxKBQjsh8LCHfWdMwoI.html
27-12-2020||Noida||Doctor’s kin allege assault by patient’s family in sector 20||The family of a doctor has alleged that they were assaulted by the relatives of a patient who had come to their clinic in sector 20 for consultation on December 24. A probe in the matter is underway, police said. The incident came to light on Saturday when a complaint in the matter was filed by the family with sector 20 police. “The patient had been complaining of vaginal bleeding for the past two months and was undergoing treatment at our clinic. She had been advised an ultrasound which was conducted on December 24, when she visited us. After studying the ultrasound, my mother (the doctor) advised her to get a DC (Dilation and Curettage) based on the findings of the ultrasound,” said Sheena Sharma, the complainant in the case. She said that the woman and her husband left but came back the next day with other relatives and misbehaved with the staff and doctors at the clinic in which the complainant’s in-laws were manhandled and sustained injuries. “They claimed that they were associated with a prominent news channel and threatened to get the clinic shut down. They broke windows of the clinic and tampered with the machines. My father-in-law tried to talk to them 7, but they kept misbehaving with us, after which we called the police,” said Sharma. The family shared the ordeal on social media as well and claimed that police were delaying in registering their case. However, based on their complaint, an NCR was registered at the sector 20 police station under sections 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 ( Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code against the woman, her husband and other relatives. Videos of the incident show the suspects misbehaving with police personnel, who arrived at the scene. Police officials have denied delays in the matter and said that a probe in the matter is underway. “The suspects have been identified and we are looking into the case. Due action will be taken soon,” said station house officer of sector 20 police station, RK Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/doctor-s-kin-allege-assault-by-patient-s-family-in-sector-20/story-oZHAKc6m4ERcg3EOmnIJCL.html
27-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Sharp drop in malaria, dengue cases||Noida: Gautam Budh Nagar has recorded a drastic drop in cases of dengue and malaria in the district this year as compared to the last year. According to health department officials, the district saw a total of 26 dengue cases this year against 42 last year, while the number of malaria cases dropped to 27 from 450 last year. Crediting sanitisation drives conducted by various departments in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and parallel anti-larvae drive from July till October to contain the mosquito-borne diseases, the officials said that the cases were sporadic and not confined to a certain area of the district. In 2018, GB Nagar had seen over 427 cases of malaria and 27 cases of dengue, the officials said. “The good thing is that there were no mortality due to dengue or malaria this year or in the past two years. The cases were sporadic. However, there were places with high sensitivity that included Yamuna Khadar area, Jewar, and Dadri area around the NTPC plant. Cases were also reported from urban slums including those in sectors 5, 8, 9, Nithari where there were sites fit for mosquito breeding,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, GB Nagar. Sharma said that the malaria mosquito Anopheles breeds from July through October, and the one -- Aedes aegypti mosquito -- that causes dengue comes after August. “The transmission period for dengue is from July onwards till November, while for malaria it is from August and the cases are reported till November first week. Both the mosquitoes breed in clean water and thus the department took help of NGOs to raise awareness to check any still water suitable for breeding,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sharp-drop-in-malaria-dengue-cases/story-wQSTZakhKmVFLuIR0BRiqJ.html

The Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) has devoted ₹121 crore for the air quality improvement and solid waste management in the city, officials said. A committee of officers has also approved the plan under which detailed infrastructure improvement measures have been given a go-ahead, the officials said. The officials of the corporation said that an amount of ₹60.5 crore each will be devoted for air quality improvement and solid waste management. The funds under the Fifteenth Finance Commission were received from the state government, they said. “The plan has been prepared through public feedback and ground level assessment, and will be implemented in the next six months. With the funds, we will certainly improve city’s air quality and also the solid waste scenario. The pollution abatement measures will not only be taken up during winters but will go round the year,” said MS Tanwar, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner. The Ghaziabad city is already in a list of 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh which suffer high levels of air pollution. Under the air quality improvement measures, the corporation has planned for paving of dusty road patches with greenery and cut stones, while 200 parks will be developed with more greenery in place. The funds will also be used for development of a ‘city forest’ near New Bus Adda metro station where about 32 acres of land is available. “This proposal has been pending for long and given in-principle approval by the corporation board. In the middle of the city forest, we will develop a lake while the entire surrounding will be turned into dense forestry. Earlier, the Ghaziabad development authority had shown interest in developing it, but now we have planned to develop it as it is our own land,” Tanwar said. The city forest area suffered major damages way back in 2008 when overflowing drain submerged trees in sewage and damaged hundreds of them. The city will also get 30 big air filters which, the corporation has decided, will be installed at as many locations in major markets and commercial areas to abate polluted surroundings. The corporation has also decided that 579 of its vehicles will be converted from diesel to CNG and a CNG filling station will also come up. They will also procure six more anti-smog guns with each having capacity of 6,000 litres. “We have planned five plants for processing of daily solid waste and all of these will start functioning by April/May. We have also planned to purchase 100 CNG-run autos and 100 e-rickshaws which will be roped in for door-to-door collection in localities having smaller lanes. For city’s internal roads, we will procure five more of mechanised road sweeping machines,” Tanwar added. City mayor Asha Sharma, who is the chairperson of the committee, said that 90% of the funds will be devoted to air quality improvement and improvement of big drains. “Air quality improvement is much needed for the city as pollution levels are high. Besides, overflowing of big drains also cause major issues for many localities. So, these will be taken up on priority and we have planned that infrastructure works will be put in place in the next six months,” she said. Environmentalists said that proper monitoring of implementation of the works is must. “If the corporation is roping in huge funds, they must hire independent experts for evaluation of performance. Besides, they should plan step-wise implementation. If the initial phase yields result, it should be taken up to the next level. Otherwise, using all funds for infrastructure procurement will be futile,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-121-crore-ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-plans-air-quality-and-solid-waste-infra-improvement/story-4rQS0ZSKilKdyqpfZAGdDN.html

As a result, health officials in the district are finding it tough to collect their samples for Covid-19 testing. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that in the wake of the rise of a new variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the UK, the district administration has prepared a list of 425 passengers who have arrived from that country in the past 30 days. “While all of them have been asked to serve the mandatory 28-day home quarantine, the district health department has started locating 260 of them for RT-PCR testing, who have come to India after December 8. Our health officials are unable to trace as many as 46 of them, as either their residences are locked or addresses provided are wrong. When contacted over phone, most of them informed us that they are celebrating the year-end holidays in tourist places like Goa, Manali, and Shimla,” he said. He further said the all UK travellers, who went on holidays, have been cross notified to the district surveillance offices of the districts concerned for their RT-PCR tests. GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that so far, the health department has got results of RT-PCR tests of around 190 travellers, of which two women fliers have tested positive. “Both the infected patients have been admitted to an isolation ward at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. The presence of new variant of the virus among the positive patients can only be ascertained through reports of genomic sequencing, which will be provided by the ICMR laboratory in New Delhi,” he said. A new variant of the virus, VUI-202012/01, was detected in the UK earlier this month, which is reported to be highly transmissible. The state government, in its standard operating procedure, had directed that those who have arrived from that country between November 23 and December 8 had to be in 28-day isolation and tested using the RT-PCR method if they showed symptoms. Those who came later would need to be tested mandatorily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/45-uk-returnees-give-tough-time-to-health-officials-in-gb-nagar/story-Ed2gDtAx5m67FrGIHLHmDN.html

The daily average cases in November and October were 128 and 187, respectively. “The cases per day recorded in December so far has gone to less than 80, which is better than the cases per day recorded in the months of July to November. We have also been successful in containing the case fatality rate (CFR) below 0.4%. At present, the district’s CFR is 0.35%, which is less than one-fourth of the state’s CFR of 1.42%,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. The DM also said that GB Nagar’s testing rate is the best among all districts of north India. “Our testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is much better than other districts in north India. Our health teams are regularly monitoring the factories and other business establishments – besides border areas, to ensure the safety protocols being followed there,” he said. Meanwhile, district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that the preparations for Covid-19 vaccination have been completed in the district. “The district has 13 cold storage points where vaccines can be stored, besides a vaccine depot at my office. We have marked 73 centres, where the shots will be given. We have already prepared a list of 21,543 doctors and other medical staff, who will be inoculated in the first phase. In the next phase, shots will be given to the employees of the authorities, armed forces, mediapersons and police personnel. In the third and last phase, people above the age of 50 years will be vaccinated,” he said. Ohri also said that besides the district’s Covid-19 integrated call centre at Sector 59, a team of doctors will be deployed at every primary health centre (PHC) and community health centre (CHC) to monitor the vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-respite-from-covid-19-as-average-daily-cases-go-below-80/story-wl9X3N9vVmRTyoCuyBzJnM.html

The STF team had gone there to conduct a raid to nab Kuldeep alias KD on whom Uttarakhand police had announced a reward of Rs 20,000. Ajay Singh, senior superintendent of police, STF, said Kuldeep received a bullet injury on his leg but succeeded in escaping while his accomplice Paramjeet was arrested during the combing operation. “We are questioning him about KD and other accomplices. We recovered a country-made pistol from him and some ammunition,” he said. Singh said the STF, team along with US Nagar police, had gone there based on a tipoff to nab Kuldeep. The accused is charged with three murders and extortion in US Nagar district.

In the seven days ending Sunday, Delhi had added a daily average of 835 cases. In comparison, this number peaked at 7,341 on November 14, when the city was grappling with the strongest wave of infections, with new infections and daily deaths touching new highs during the festive period.In what experts regarded as more good news in the city’s fight against the illness, the test positivity rate — the percentage of samples that test positive among all samples collected — continued to hover around the 1%-mark. Experts view the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a number below 5% for two weeks for a region with a comprehensive testing programme.On Sunday, 75,210 tests were conducted, and 40,742 of these used the more accurate reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, which is more reliable than the alternate rapid antigen test.The Capital has collected a daily average of 80,581 samples for Covid-19 tests over the past two weeks.There are currently 6,713 active Covid-19 cases in the city, down from sharply 10,148 on December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fewest-single-day-covid-deaths-in-delhi-since-early-september-govt-data-shows/story-6PvVyAS2v6cMamWS3R6yiI.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Protesters at Burari ground start farming||Farmers protesting at Burari — the official spot for agitation designated by the Delhi Police — have begun farming on the ground premises itself. While on Saturday they sowed onion bulbs on a small part of the land right next to where they are camping, the farmers said they intend to delve soon into full-fledged farming by using tractors to till the soil at the huge ground.“If we find the soil to be fertile, we’ll start growing other vegetables also that we grow in our fields in Punjab. If not, we’ll look to plant vegetables that can survive in poor soil,” said Binder Singh, the Faridkot district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union.According to police estimates, there are between 250 and 400 farmers from Punjab camping at the Burari ground, who had arrived here from the Tikri Border on the first day of the agitation. While some farmers from Uttar Pradesh too had arrived here from the Chilla Border, they had returned after a few days. The Delhi government had set up tents to accommodate thousands of farmers at Burari initially. However, the government removed them earlier this month after farmers refused to avail the facilities, instead choosing to protest at Singhu, Tikri and other border points of Delhi. Farmers here said that last month they had a lot of idle time, which they have decided to utilize by farming. “Looks like we are going to be here for some more months and a few seasons. We’ll grow seasonal vegetables and crops,” said Binder Singh. On Saturday, they only sowed onion bulbs in a land about the size of 30×5 feet. “It took us about two hours to finish the entire work. We are still understanding the nature of soil here, but it is a hard ground,” said Darshan Singh, a farmer from Gollawale village in Faridkot.The produce will be used for cooking for farmers here, the people camping at Burari said. The farmers have asked those in Punjab to bring seeds of different varieties to start their farming. “If the results from the soil are encouraging, we’ll use our tractors to plough the ground. This ground is our home for the time being and the areas around will be our farm land,” said Baldev Singh, another farmer from the same village. The rectangular ground where the farmers are camping is nearly the size of 15 cricket fields. Despite the presence of police and paramilitary personnel near the farmers’ camp, there was no objection to the farming exercise.“The farming they have done so far hasn’t really made any real impact to the field. If we find any serious damage being done by them, we’ll take a call,” said a police officer at the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/protesters-at-burari-ground-start-farming/story-SxiJiGMeJEMVScLtSeH3UM.html
27-12-2020||City||Charging customer for carry bag without prior knowledge not fair||You go to a grocery store, purchase twenty items and at the payment counter you are told that you have to pay for the carry bag in which the goods are being packed. You protest, but since you have already spent considerable time in choosing your groceries and cannot obviously carry all those items without a bag or bags, you pay up.Consumers around the country have been vehemently protesting against this practice and in response to their complaints, several consumer courts have held it to be an unfair trade practice.Retailers have challenged these decisions before the highest consumer court. Last week, the apex consumer court too upheld the views of the lower consumer courts and said such a practice was arbitrary and high handed.Presiding member Dinesh Singh, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, in his order pointed out that the normal practice at retail outlets was to provide the carry bag free of cost. If any outlet wanted to deviate from this practice and charge for the bag, then it should let the consumers know about it, much in advance, before they make their choice of the outlet. Charging for the carry bag at the payment counter, after the consumer had made the purchase, was patently unfair and deceptive, he said.The commission’s order came in response to a clutch of 14 revision petitions filed by Big Bazar, challenging the orders of the lower consumer courts holding its sale of shopping bags to be unfair. Endorsing the lower consumer courts’ decisions through a common order, the apex consumer court directed the retail chain to “forthwith discontinue its unfair trade practice of arbitrarily imposing additional cost of carry bags on the consumer at the time of making payment, without prominent prior notice and information before the consumer makes his choice of patronizing its retail outlets and before the consumer makes his selection of goods for purchase, as also without disclosing the salient specifications and price of the carry bags”“The necessary notice /signs /announcement /advertisement /warning should be in the place and manner as may enable the consumer to make his informed choice of whether or not to patronize its retail outlets, and whether or not to make his selection of goods for purchase from its retail outlets”. the Commission said, while directing the Chief Executive of the retail chain to immediately issue appropriate instructions to all its outlets accordingly. (Big Bazar (Future Retail Ltd ) Vs Ashok Kumar, RP No 975 of 2020, decided on December 22, 2020)The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum II, UT, Chandigarh, had directed Big Bazar to return to the consumer, the cost of the carry bag (charged at Rs 18 per bag), pay Rs100 as compensation, Rs1,100 as litigation costs and also deposit as punitive damages, Rs 5,000 in the Legal Aid Account of the Forum. This was upheld by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, UT, Chandigarh. The apex consumer court said the award was just and equitable.Even though the order is in response to Big Bazar’s revision petition, as of now this view of the commission should apply to other retail outlets that have been imposing similar charges on carry bags too . If they want to put a price on the carry bags at their outlets, they must advertise the fact. Of course that gives consumers the choice of not going to such outlets, but does not stop the practice per se. But who knows, in these times of low footfalls and steep competition from online shops, the ubiquitous carry bag may well become the centre of a battle for a bigger chunk of the market share! And that would certainly bring an end to the practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/charging-customer-for-carry-bag-without-prior-knowledge-not-fair/story-IYCApZvTItFnXrLSZ5jJKI.html

27-12-2020||Chandigarh||The year of the pandemic: Punjab’s financial capital’s losses and recovery||The state’s financial and industrial capital, which once buzzed with activity, was brought to a standstill when it ranked among the worst pandemic-hit districts in Punjab soon after the first case was detected in March. Despite the government imposing a nation-wide lockdown, the highly contagious novel virus took 103 days to cross the 1,000 mark, but it merely took 27 days to reach the 2,000 figure. Once lockdown restrictions were lifted, the virus infected a record 3,000 people in eight days. Come August, the district was raring to cross 10,000 cases. The crisis peaked between July to September as the cumulative Covid tally and death toll touched 955 and 720, respectively. In late August and mid-September, Ludhiana accounted for 22% of all virus-related cases and 29.4% of deaths reported in Punjab. The district, which was once known as the industrial capital, earned the dubious distinction of being the Covid capital of the state, especially in July when shortage of ventilators and oxygen cylinders forced the health department on the back foot. On September 5, Ludhiana ranked among the top 15 cities in the country with a high Covid fatality rate. By the time December rolled around, the district had reported 24,000 infections and 958 deaths. Even as fear and uncertainty gripped the public as they faced the deadly pathogen, the administration, police and health functionaries pulled out all stops to contain the contagion, with numerous frontline workers getting infected or succumbing in line of duty. The year, 2020, which began with the scare of the virus looming large, ends on a positive note with hopes of a vaccine being rolled out coming to fruition. The health department is set to carry out a dry run of the vaccine on December 28 in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. The health department is also planning to hold the third sero-survey in the district to assess the public’s exposure to the deadly virus. The previous survey had indicated that Ludhiana, with 54.6% total positivity and 71.7% urban positivity, may have attained herd immunity.Leaders cutting across the political spectrum, including cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Congress MLA Sanjay Talwar and SAD MLAs Manpreet Singh Ayali, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, tested positive for the virus. Many top-ranking bureaucrats, cops and business men also caught the infection. Anticipating an outbreak of the coronavirus that had already brought multiple countries to their knees, the administration started preparing teams in February and started preparing for all possible eventualities in March. The police, administration, civic body and health department also partook in a combined mock drill in Qila Mohalla and Raikot where volunteers were shifted to the hospital in an ambulance or quarantined. The videos of such mock drills were widely circulated with misinformation regarding a virus outbreak, which sparked paranoia and panic among the people. The rumours were so widespread that the health department had to address a press conference to dispel residents’ concerns.On March 24, a 55-year-old social activist, who resided in Gurdev Nagar, became the first person to test positive for the virus. The health department contact traced all people who may have come in contact with her and asked them to get themselves tested. The confirmation of the first Covid case triggered panic in the district with private medical institutions drawing down their shutters and numerous doctors, mostly senior, going on mass leaves. Patients were left to the mercy of new recruits and nurses. Such was the apprehension that hospital staff, especially technicians, that they refused to work without personal protective equipment. A top doctor, requesting anonymity, said, “We had a hard time explaining that even a face shield and proper precautions can prevent the virus from spreading.” It was also rumoured that Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) principal Dr Sandeep Puri and a professor Dr Rajesh Mahajan had been isolated after they reported flu-like symptoms. Bonn Group MD Manjit Singh was also suspected to have been infected. Finally, the three parties had to dispel the rumours through a video message.While doctors in government hospitals bravely continued to treat positive patients. Rural medical officers (RMOs) also joined the Covid warriors and served at Covid isolation facilities with limited PPE kits and face masks. Civil hospital was converted into a Covid hospital while OPD services were shifted to ESIC Hospital near Bharat Nagar Chowk. Air conditioners and washing machines were also installed in the wards after patients had complained of lack of facilities. Several government doctors remained in isolation for weeks and did not meet their families for over two months.A 42-year-old woman became the first to succumb to the deadly virus. The Amarpura resident, who complained of severe cough and chest congestion, died on March 30 at Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala. Following her death, many departments, both in the civil hospital and ESIC hospital, where the patient had undergone tests were closed and Amarpura became an impregnable fortress. The woman’s two sons, daughter and a few women who had come in her contact were quarantined.Fear paralysed people to such an extent that the relatives of a 69- year-old woman of Shimlapuri, who had died at private hospital on Chandigarh Road after returning from Mohali, refused to claim and cremate her body. After much deliberation, the administration cremated the dead body on April 6 and also organised a bhog .When assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kohli, 52, who had been posted on crowd control duty at New Sabzi Mandi succumbed to the virus, it sent shock waves through the state. The Covid warrior, who was taken ill on March 30 and died on April 18, a day after the death of Kanungo Gurmail Singh, who had also died of the virus. Soon district mandi officer (DMO) Jasvir Kaur and SHO Jodhewal Arshpreet Kaur also tested positive. The health department, police and administration launched a major drive to isolate those who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March as many attendees had tested positive. Three men, two from Jagraon and one from Doraha tested positive and around 100 people were quarantined. As many as 56 devotees, who were stranded in Nanded, Maharashtra, during the lockdown returned from Takht Sri Hazur Sahib on April 27. However, they were rushed to the civil hospital the very next day as some pilgrims had tested positive in other districts. The quarantined devotees raised the matter of poor quality of food at the isolation centres. On May 10, a 56-year-old Nanded returnee from Manuke village, Jagraon, succumbed to the coronavirus disease at the civil hospital.With face masks, PPE kits and sanitisers flying off the shelf, these essential items began to be sold in black and many spurious products flooded the market. In May, doctors at the civil hospital also staged a protest against the substandard face masks and PPE kits. A month later, a team led by Zonal Licensing Authority (Drugs) Kulwinder Singh, seized 1,048 bottles of spurious sanitisers.A 49-year-old head constable of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) lost his life while over 60 RPF personnel tested positive leading to the closure of the RPF office at the Ludhiana Railway station. There was acute shortage of high-flow oxygen cylinders and ventilators in hospitals in July with around 100 patients approaching private hospitals. The death of a 49-year-old on July 24 due to non-availability of a ventilator bed in DMC&H led to a clamour for better facilities in hospitals. Sadly, his body could not be cremated for three days due to a long waiting list in the crematorium. Bursting at the seams, several hospitals such as DMC&H converted their auditorium into Covid case centres to accommodate patients. The government also converted meritorious schools near Nehru Rose Garden and mother and child hospital in Vardhman and several other institutions into isolation centres. At the beginning civil hospital was ill equipped to tackle serious patients of covid-19. They were being referred to Rajinder Government Hospital Patiala. The four ventilators that were allocated to civil hospital were being operted by CMC&H as there was not enough staff for monitoring the ventilators. However, things improved as civil hospital received 18 ventilators. On September 15, Ludhiana reported the highest single-day spike of 438 new Covid cases and 19 deaths. While 323 people lost their lives to the virus in August, September logged 330 deaths.The case fatality rate (CRF) was also the highest in September at 4.3%. However, the percentage of recovered patients also increased with the district reporting a 90% recovery rate. There was decline in infections in October and November. A total of 97 deaths were reported in the month of October. However, the tally of positive cases crossed the 20,000-mark in October. Despite experts predicting a second wave of infections, the district did not witness a significant jump in winter.The health department had warned against a second surge in December. Soon after, the government imposed night curfew. However, no such rise in Covid cases has been witnessed. Recently, state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said Covid vaccination will start in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/the-year-of-the-pandemic-punjab-s-financial-capital-s-losses-and-recovery/story-2r0yl1Em83VbZ3uKstIBSL.html
27-12-2020||Gurugram||City mountaineer receives praise from PM for cleaning Himalayas||A city resident’s campaign of clearing plastic waste from different areas of the Himalayas drew praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.The 35-year-old Gurugram resident, Pradeep Sangwan, is a mountaineer based in Himachal Pradesh. He had established ‘Healing Himalayas Foundation’ four years ago. Sangwan, along with a team of volunteers, has cleared tonnes of plastic and other waste left behind by tourists each year.In his last ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast of the year, Modi, while talking about new resolves for the new year, said there are some people who continuously keep doing something new and keep on realising new resolves.“You must have also felt in your life that when you do something for society then the society itself gives us the energy to do much more. Normal sources of inspiration can accomplish great tasks. One such young man is Pradeep Sangwan,” he said.“Till now, Pradeep has cleared tonnes of plastic waste from different locations of Himalayas,” Modi said, praising Sangwan’s initiative.Sangwan later told PTI, “It is very inspiring that the prime minister acknowledges small efforts by people like me. I thank him for bringing the work, which we are doing for the sake of protecting our environment, to national attention. It will definitely act as a big motivation.”Sharing details of how he launched his campaign, Sangwan said his father was in the Army and also wanted him to become an officer in the defence forces. However, his life took a different course as he could not clear the interview to join the Army.While doing his graduation from Chandigarh’s DAV college, he came in contact with people from Himachal Pradesh, with whom he started to explore the Himalayas in 2007-08.“I moved to Himachal in 2009, where, for the next five years, I undertook extensive travelling, treks, etc. I met a group of people from ‘gaddi’ (shepherd) community in Lahaul when we were doing on such trek from Chandra Taal lake to Suraj Tal lake,” he said.Sangwan said that he along with a friend spent 3-4 days with the members of this community and he was very impressed how, even in a very remote area, they cared so much for their environment. He said the projects of his foundation, which sustains on voluntary donations, are focused on clean-up drives, waste management and other activities in the rural Himalayan region.Each year in December, Sangwan says that he designs a calendar for the following year where volunteers can align their trips accordingly. “While going up for a trek, we collect all the trash. Mainly, we find plastic bottles, multilayer packaging plastic waste, and then we store it at one location on the route. While coming back we bring it back to base village and transport it to the nearest facility. In the process, we engage mainly our volunteers,” he said.“I recall that during a trek to Kheer Ganga in Kullu district, in two days, we got 10,000 plastic PET bottles. Another sad thing we came across is that many people, after drinking, dispose beer and other glass bottles in a reckless manner or break them. We also come across cases where cows were unable to move because of injuries due to glass pieces,” he said.Sangwan stressed on working at the community level for better results in waste management in the Himalayan region. “My focus remains on Himalayan rural region. We mainly work in the districts of Kullu, Shimla, Mandi and Kinnaur,” he said.His foundation has now set up a first waste collection unit, which will be operational soon, at village Rakcham near Chitkul in Kullu district, while a second one will come up near Kheer Ganga base camp. The third and the fourth ones will come up in Lahaul, where Atal tunnel has come up, which is witnessing lot of tourist activity.He sad that in his campaign on social media acted as a powerful tool and more and even film stars like Randeep Hooda, who is from Haryana, have supported and appreciated his cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-mountaineer-receives-praise-from-pm-for-cleaning-himalayas/story-RS9tEuWPUoAz7aC09Ky1tO.html
27-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers bang utensils during PM’s radio programme||Farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Jaisinghpur Khera in protest of the new farm laws banged utensils to boycott Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio programme, Mann Ki Baat, on Sunday. In a mark of opposition, farmers refused to listen to the radio address and raised slogans against the new farm laws while taking out a march at the protest site. Farmers from states such as Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for the past 15 days. They seek to join the farmers’ agitation in Delhi but have been restricted at the Haryana border by the Rewari Police. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September this year. They fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of corporations and put an end to the minimum support price (MSP) on important crops. “When the address started, all farmers started banging plates and other utensils. They refused to listen to the address and took out a march at the site for the duration of the address. Till the end of the address, one could hear the banging of the plates. If the prime minister is not ready to listen to the demands of farmers, we will not listen to him either,” said Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan. Ranjit Singh Raju, coordinator of Grameen Kisan Mazdoor Samiti — one of the farmers’ body under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha — said that the blockade was going stronger with each passing day and various acts of boycott being undertaken by the farmers that will compel the government to listen to farmers. “Our blockade is strong and we will continue to strengthen it further,” said Raju. Santveer Singh Mohanpura, a farmer leader from Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, said that the ongoing movement had become a fight for identity and farmers would not give up till the demands are met. “This is a fight for our identity now. We will not give up despite the government taking an arrogant stance. The government is trying to convey that it won’t back down despite enforcing anti-farmer laws. However, this government is ours and it will bend. Our demands are genuine and we want the government to listen to us,” said Mohanpura, exhorting common people to join the agitation. He said that the agitation at Shahjahanpur will develop on the lines of the blockade at Singhu and Tikri borders. In a separate protest, residents of Gurugram came out in support of farmers and took out a rally at Sadar Bazaar on Sunday. Coming together under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, Gurugram, participants raised their voice against the farm laws and said that they were aimed at furthering corporate interests. Members of the union said that they would start an indefinite dharna (sit-in protest) against the laws from Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-bang-utensils-during-pm-s-radio-programme/story-r9uQ9AymWjjZgNnYEsvEEN.html

27-12-2020||Gurugram||Speeding truck kills five standing on road||Five persons, including four of a family, were killed when a speeding truck rammed them while they were repairing a motorcycle on the roadside near Tauru village around 6pm on Saturday. According to the police, Mohammad Arif, a resident of village Nijampur, located three kilometres from Tauru, had gone to meet a relative at Bhora Kalan in Pataudi and was returning when his motorbike broke down. Abdul Hamid, one of the eyewitnesses and a relative of Arif, said that he received a call from Arif requesting tools and a mechanic to repair his bike. “I went to the spot along with Sahib, who works in my garage as a mechanic. Arif’s wife, son and daughter were standing near the motorcycle. Sahib and Arif started repairing it. I left their side to attend to nature’s call. I was crossing the road when I saw a speeding canter (truck) coming from Kalarpuri village side hitting them. Within seconds, all were lying in a pool of blood,” he said. Hamid said he rushed towards them but only Arif’s wife was breathing. They called the police control room and a private ambulance, but she died on the way to Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College in Nalhar, said police. Locals, upon hearing the collision, rushed to the spot but could not find the driver of the truck. Locals said that the road was empty and rash driving was the cause of the accident. The police said the canter was driven by one Pradeep Singh, of Kalar Puri, located four kilometres from Tauru. He could not control the speed and lost control, leading to the mishap, according to the police. Brahamjit Singh, investigating official from Sadar police station in Tauru, said that Singh left the canter at the spot and fled. “We have already identified the driver. The truck belongs to a Delhi transporter and was attached to a private company. We have impounded the canter and have registered a case against the driver,” he said. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304 A (causing death by negligence), and 427 (causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Sadar police station in Tauru. Arif and Sahib used to work as mechanics, while the others who died were identified as Ayesha, Arif’s wife, and their children Ayaan (2) and Ayesha (6).The bodies were handed over to the families of the deceased on Friday after the post-mortem examination, police said.

27-12-2020||Gurugram||2,500 people take part in marathon to demand justice for victim of road accident||On Sunday morning, around 2,500 people, including friends and family members of Alok Gupta, who died on the city road due to alleged rash driving by juveniles, and activists organised the Gurugram International Marathon between 6am and 9am on Golf Course Road. The slogan of the marathon was — “Juvenile driving kills and justice for Alok Gupta.”People joined the event virtually from other cities, such as Kota, Lucknow, Noida, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. The collision took place on August 23 around 6am, when Gupta was on his way to Noida on his Harley Davidson motorbike. A Ford Figo, in which two juveniles were allegedly travelling on the opposite side, rammed a divider and hit his motorcycle across the carriageway. Gupta succumbed to his injuries. Mihika Wahi Gupta, Gupta’s wife, said that she has taken a stand to create awareness against underage driving. “Underage driving is wreaking havoc in our country. Accidents lead to broken families and, in many cases, the sole breadwinners of family being taken away,” she said. Gaurav Pant, one of the participants, said, “Participants ran different distances supporting the cause. There were different categories, starting from five kilometres to 42 kilometres. I ran for the cause to make people more responsible. The fight will make sure that the culprits are behind bars.” Ambika Chauhan Nair, another participant, said, “The athlete community is using the occasion to express anger against underage driving. The wrong cannot be undone but the guilty must face the consequences.”The accident and the subsequent handling of the case by the police evoked widespread protests by the family and friends of the victim. On September 26, at least 400 people, including family members, friends, cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against the alleged perpetrators. Similar protests were held in Gurugram, Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur. At the time, the police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, who is a friend of the driver’s father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of the IPC. The family of the deceased had demanded that the police should invoke more stringent sections against the accused. They had also demanded that the police make the parents of the juvenile driver and the juvenile co-passenger of the car parties in the case. On October 5, the police had booked the driver under Section 304 Part-2 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The section, which is non-bailable in nature, was added to the FIR after the police sought legal opinion in the case. Later, the police added sections 184 (driving dangerously) and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act against the juvenile driver and Section 199 A of the same act against the car owner. Both were held and released on bail, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/2-500-people-take-part-in-marathon-to-demand-justice-for-victim-of-road-accident/story-ZOBbvlu23fNS8w0sUYLfwK.html

To ensure it is cleaned in advance before the 2021 monsoon, the GMDA has now floated a tender again to finalise a contractor and clear the master sewerage drains.“Cleaning the sewerage drain between Rajiv Chowk and Iffco Chowk is vital as it hasn’t been done for many years. Tenders for this work had been floated before as well but the contractor left the project midway and hence, it has been once again floated. The new contractor will start work afresh,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.A tender for de-silting the drains had been floated in September 2019 as well, following which the previous contractor had been finalised. As per GMDA officials privy to the matter, there were two main reasons behind the contractor leaving the work.“The previous contractor was under the impression that they will clear the sewerage and channel the sludge towards the nearest stormwater drain, which has major implications. They were supposed to clear the drain between manholes. The process essentially involves blocking one manhole completely, use high pressure jetting machines and super suction machines to open the drain running along the next manhole, and then empty the sludge to assigned areas. Subsequently, repeat the process in the other manhole as well. However, when we informed the contractor about the same, they realised they wouldn’t be able to complete the project as this would cost much higher than they had anticipated and in addition, they didn’t have the expertise for executing the same. Hence, they left the work midway,” a senior GMDA official privy to the matter said.Besides major health hazards, mixing of stormwater and sewerage lines results in pollution of the water table and water bodies, and also leads to waterlogging during monsoon.Similar to the previous tender, the GMDA has estimated that the project will cost around Rs 1.36 crore. The finalised contractor would also need to use pan-tilt cameras for recording 360 degrees footage of the entire sewerage line, both before starting the work and after completing it.After finishing the work, the contractor will have to submit both hard and soft copies of the footage as proof of their work and subsequently, GMDA officials will examine the same on ground. Bids for the project will close on January 7 next year and the same will be reviewed the following day, said GMDA officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-refloat-tender-for-drain-cleaning-as-contractor-leaves-midway/story-fjIK5MaRS5VOK0rNjDuNGK.html
27-12-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad sees 35% drop in criminal cases: Data||Faridabad city has seen 35 percent fewer criminal cases this year as compared to last year. The suicide rate has also gone down by 40%, shows the annual police data with officials attributing this sharp decline to the nationwide lockdown declared in March to contain the spread of Covid-19 disease. The police said criminal cases have shown a downtrend across the spectrum. Murders have gone down by one-fourth, rape by one-third, molestation by half, fatal accidents by one-third, and total offences reported have shrunk by one-fifth. Reduced human interactions because of lockdown and quicker response on the part of the police may be among the reasons for this decline, said police officials. OP Singh, commissioner of police, Faridabad, said that crime against property has also shown similar downward trend. Robbery has gone down by one-third, snatching by one-fourth , vehicle theft by one-fifth. “This year, 215 persons were booked under the Arms Act as compared to 237 last year. A total of 907 thieves, robbers, 11 criminals carrying rewards on them, 173 proclaimed offenders and 23 bail jumpers were arrested. These numbers show a sharp decline compared to the year,” he said. Singh said the year also saw better policing as compared to the past. Out of 887 missing persons reported as many as 711 were rescued. Out of 281 elopement cases reported, 237 were solved.Out of 26,979 complaints received, as many as 23,032 were disposed off to the satisfaction of the complainant, which is nearly 85% of the cases reported. Singh said during Covid-19 lockdown, Faridabad Police challaned 67,000 persons for not wearing face masks in public places and distributed 2 lakh masks to people across the city. Faridabad Police also introduced “family police officers” to interact with residents in the first week of December. This community outreach programme aimed to not only enhance the visibility of the police force but also bring them closer to the public, said officials. As a part of this programme, the police have deployed beat officers for families in residential areas with whom they are supposed to interact. Singh said that these officers will serve as a bridge between the police and the public. “These beat officers will provide support to families by acting as facilitators for police services and as consultants on personal safety matters,” he said, adding that until now, 687 family police officers have visited 68,735 families , home delivered 3,297 challans and FIRs to the complainants. The officials have held 12,836 street corner meetings to create awareness about Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, safety precautions and cyber frauds . Singh said 193 people attended these meetings and they received 7,653 calls for help, out of which 6,806 were resolved. The police also formed 320 youth clubs, in which 14,160 people have been engaged for sports , volunteer work and skill upgrade. According to OP Singh, one of the most challenging cases was the Nikita Tomar murder case, which was solved in a record time and challan was filed in the court within 11 days. Singh added that the coming year will be about better policing and ensuring public trust. “We will increase collaboration with people on security measures and involve residents of all areas to ensure proper patrolling to reduce crime. We will keep a watch on criminals out on bail and their movements will be tracked. We will deal with cyber fraud cases more vigorously and will create more public awareness,” said Singh. Faridabad Police had also launched a programme called “Police ki Pathshala”, which aims to change the perception of the youth about the police and teach them about cyber crime, drug abuse and criminal law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-sees-35-drop-in-criminal-cases-data/story-XdBbzGjCK4QOlmxmby6MVP.html
27-12-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 impact on environment: Delayed conservation efforts, waste management systems challenged||The outbreak of Covid-19 this year impacted the city’s immediate environment in more ways than one. While on the one hand, human-wildlife conflict drastically reduced, conservation efforts to protect the region’s flora and fauna, on the other hand, was delayed on account of the Covid-19 lockdown. Meanwhile, the epidemic significantly exacerbated Gurugram’s waste woes, leading to not only an exponential surge in biomedical waste generation, but also in delaying the city’s proposed long-term solutions for waste management. Human-wildlife conflict reduces Earlier this year, following reports of poaching during the lockdown from parts of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and even Nepal, the wildlife department went on high alert, particularly in areas like Gurugram, Faridabad and Panchkula — where the presence of wildlife is densest. While there were no instances of wildlife trafficking reported during the lockdown, department officials said that this past year has been a kinder one for wildlife populations in the region. With much of human activity being depressed between March and July, instances of human-wildlife conflict — which are common in summer months when animals stray into villages in search of water — drastically reduced. After recording at least four leopard deaths in 2019 (the highest in a single year), 2020 saw just one leopard casualty, when a nine-year-old male was mowed down on Pali Road in Faridabad. “That was in October, when traffic movement had greatly increased. Otherwise, there was very little to report in terms of casualties,” said Rajendra Dangi. Conservation efforts hampered The pandemic, however, has also delayed a long-pending wildlife census in Haryana, which is now expected to be taken up only after the current winter season. First proposed in March 2019, the census could not be immediately taken up due to scarcity of funds, as reported by Hindustan Times on February 22 this year. It was slated for the ongoing financial year. With the lockdown throwing various administrative bodies of out gear and making fieldwork much harder, the project faces further delay. Commenting on the matter, Haryana’s chief conservator of forests, ML Rajvanshi, said, “Availability of funds is no longer an issue. We have taken the matter forward with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. This census has been pending for a few years and we would like the survey to commence at the earliest.” Biodiversity registers delayed Covid-19 also threw a wrench in the implementation of the National Biodiversity Act in the state. Delayed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the finalisation of over 6,000 people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs) in Haryana is now expected to be completed by March next year. While initial drafts of at least 6,400 registers — at a panchayat, zila parishad and municipal corporation levels — have already been prepared, these lack quality and will need to be improved through more fieldwork, said current and former officials of the Haryana State Biodiversity Board. The draft PBR mainly consisted of data from earlier wildlife and cattle censuses, and forest surveys. “But the main goal of the PBR is to work with locals and understand their relationship with their biodiversity. This requires a lot of fieldwork, which could not be carried out due to lockdown restrictions,” said a forest department official, preferring anonymity. Commenting on this, VS Tanwar, secretary, Haryana State Biodiversity Board, said, “Covid-19 made it hard for our technical teams to do their work on ground. So naturally, the biodiversity registers are also lacking in quality and rigour. The state biodiversity board has also undergone an administrative reshuffling in June, in light of Covid, and the work had to be halted. Biomedical waste generation surges As per the data with the district concessionaire for biomedical waste management, Gurugram is now producing between 600 to 800 kilograms per day of Covid-related biomedical waste each day — up from 400kgs per day in April, in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown — in addition to at least 3,800kgs of routine biomedical waste. Between April and June, the district reported a 585 percent increase in Covid-related biomedical waste generated, a quantity that has only continued to balloon with epidemiological peaks of increasing intensity. “From operating at 25 percent capacity before the lockdown, our facility in Sector 36 is now operating well above 60 percent capacity,” said a spokesperson for Biotic Waste, the concessionaire for biomedical waste management in Gurugram. Challenges in waste management post-Covid While there is presently no shortfall in the capacity for treatment and disposal of this waste, concerns of mismanagement abound, and handling this waste has proven to be a logistical challenge for stakeholders, as evinced by littered masks, face-shields and gloves, which are commonplace on city streets, particularly in the crowded localities or in the vicinities around healthcare centres. Conversely, mixed municipal waste has also been finding its way to the biomedical waste facility — from households under quarantine due to Covid — leading to operational difficulties. “The biomedical waste incinerator is not meant to burn organic matter. When segregation at source is not enforced, such waste goes into the incinerator and releases fumes which affect the efficiency of the technology, particularly our air pollution control devices. This pushes up the operational cost of treating biomedical waste since it requires increased maintenance,” said the spokesperson of Biotic Waste. To deal with these challenges, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has proposed to set up a separate collection facility for all Covid-19 related waste being generated by households in the city, expected to be ready early next year. While Vinay Pratap Singh could not be contacted despite multiple attempts, an executive engineer in the MCG’s sanitation department, who is privy to the matter, said, “We are slowly moving toward a situation where we have more biomedical waste than treatment capacity. It is important to reduce the load on our concessionaire and set up our own capacity as well. A pilot project is being planned where the majority of household Covid waste will come under our purview.” WTE plant delayed Moreover, the city’s long-term solution for management of legacy waste — in the form of a waste to energy plant in Bandhwari village — has also been delayed on account of Covid-19. Despite being granted an environmental clearance from the environment ministry last November, the project could not see the light of the day in 2020, with the MCG’s redoubling its efforts to manage an increasing quantity of household waste. “It isn’t just a biomedical waste from households which has increased. Since so many people are staying at home, even the general quantity of waste from households has gone up by a large amount. This is why we have been carrying out a larger number of segregation drives this year. Our focus has been on streamlining collection, rather than end disposal,” said the sanitation inspector. Officials, however, clarified that the project is likely to come to fruition in 2021. A spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, MCG’s concessionaire, confirmed that leachate treatment and rehabilitation of legacy waste on site at the Bandhwari landfill is already underway. “In fact, we have been able to treat legacy waste equivalent to about seven metres of the landfill’s height,” the spokesperson said. The MCG has also directed the concessionaire to submit a reclamation plan for the site, in order to build the proposed waste to energy plant. An MCG official in the know of the matter, requesting anonymity, said, “We are aiming to have the legacy waste, about two lakh tonnes, reclaimed by the middle of next year, after which construction on the plant can commence. I cannot say immediately when the plant will be operational.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-impact-on-environment-delayed-conservation-efforts-waste-management-systems-challenged/story-5AOVZXGF8gbcZVel6xNTQI.html
27-12-2020||Noida||Noida: Three cops suspended for unauthorized investigation||Three police personnel deployed with the Surajpur police station have been suspended for allegedly travelling to another state for an investigation of a case pending since 2017 without any permission from the Gautam Budh Nagar police commissionerate.The action was taken on Saturday against two sub-inspectors and a constable who had allegedly travelled to Chandigarh without prior permission, senior police officials said.“The rules regarding inter-state investigations are very clear. The commissioner has to sign off on such requests and prior permissions are mandatory. They were suspended for not following the regulations and going to Chandigarh unauthorised,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.However, the Officials refused to divulge details of the case that was being investigated. A source said that the case was of cheating (section 420 of Indian Penal Code) by a developer under the Surajpur police jurisdiction. The suspended police personnel had first gone to Ghaziabad for a raid after which they travelled to Chandigarh to nab the suspect.A senior police official also said that the issue came to light when information was shared with the Noida police commissionerate from Punjab but police officials refused to comment on whether a complaint was made against the Noida cops for any illegal action during the probe.“Based on the preliminary findings, the three police personnel have been suspended while a departmental inquiry has also been initiated in the matter. We cannot share more details as the case is under investigation,” said the DCP.Noida police had recently arrested three policemen from the Madhya Pradesh cyber cell for allegedly extorting money from a Noida-based suspect who was under investigation in a fraud case in exchange for letting him go scot-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-three-cops-suspended-for-unauthorized-investigation/story-a1kSct8pKOFgKl8428tptK.html

27-12-2020||Delhi||Jashn-e-Rekhta cancels annual event in light of Covid-19 pandemic||Late Christmas eve, Rekhta Foundation announced the cancellation of what would have been the seventh edition of Jashn-e-Rekhta, a three-day festival celebrating Urdu language held annually in December in Delhi. Known to host mushairas, qawwalis, dastaangoi, celebrity conversations, calligraphy, food stalls and so much more, Jashne-e-Rekhta could rightly be attributed with reviving the syncretism Urdu brought with it when it entered the sub-continent. It has to its stellar repertoire artistes such as late poet Rahat Indori, actors Waheeda Rehman and Shabana Azmi, filmmakers Imtiaz Ali and Nandita Das, lyricist Javed Akhtar and singer Harshdeep Kaur among others. Founder of Rekhta Foundation Sanjiv Saraf, says, “Untoward circumstances have compelled us to scrap the 2020 festival. Like everyone else, we thought that Covid-19 will be a temporary crisis and we were still hopeful of hosting the annual event.” Citing that the digital realm is cluttered with online events, Saraf and his team is channelizing all their energy into “keeping the audience engaged in the landscape with something more meaningful.” He adds, “We are producing multi-media content of celebrated art forms of Urdu that are being recorded at Rekhta Studio. They will be broadcast and streamed throughout the year.”The studio, which was a long time in the making, will also help bring to the fore new and unheard talent. “We are working on series of biopics on noted poets. We already have a presence on various podcast platforms,” says Saraf. Although the team is gung-ho about expanding its digital reach, there is a certain pang of missing out on creating a live event. “Nothing beats the euphoria of a live festival wherein the audience is not only a spectator but also participates actively. It is the audience that gives this festival its heartbeat. For three days every year, Urdu lords over Delhi. A sea of Urdu lovers, especially the youth, throng to listen, to learn, to enjoy. The love for the language has been most rewarding,” adds Saraf. Rekhta’s literal meaning is scattered, a vernacular language that may have had its roots in Persian, but one which found its footing in Hindostan. Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, means a celebration of this language, its adaptability and resilience. Saraf, celebrating this spirit, concludes with a couplet by poet Sahir Ludhianvi: “Hazaar barq gire laakh aandhiyaan utthe vo phuul khil ke rahenge jo khilne vale hain.” Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jashn-e-rekhta-cancels-annual-event-in-light-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-gzQ3FX8JmtVcUPw6WfOWVK.html

He also raised questions over the funds used for holding celebrations when the state is under debt.“While more than 1,000 people in the state have died due to Covid-19 and many are fighting the battle against the virus, the BJP leaders shamelessly crossed all the limits of corruption by being involved in various scams such as hand sanitisers, PPE kits, Kisan Nidhi Scheme and CM’s relief fund. Rajiv Bindal had to resign from the position of state BJP president after these scams came to light,” said Rathore.Taking a jibe at the BJP’s claim of making India Congress-free, he said, “BJP will soon be thrown out of power from the state as well as the country as people have seen the true face of BJP.”Rathore termed the state government’s slogan of good governance as false and said soon the country will get rid of the BJP’s misrule.During this, MLA Vikramaditya Singh expressed concern over the rising unemployment in the state and said that the present state government is making no major contribution to the huge claims of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-observes-black-day-as-himachal-govt-celebrates-completion-of-3-yr-tenure/story-wph6WiiTGWy41myrM4DWCN.html

27-12-2020||Kolkata||Personal attacks, rhetoric mark rallies by Abhishek Banerjee, Suvendu Adhikari in poll-bound Bengal||Youth Trinamool Congress president Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday accused former minister Suvendu Adhikari, who joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on December 19, of being “corrupt and spineless” and faced a counterattack in less than an hour. Narrowing down the political battle between the ruling TMC and the saffron camp in poll-bound Bengal to a personal clash, Banerjee, who was recently branded by Adhikari as “tolabaaj” (extortionist), cow and coal smuggler, hit back from a rally at Diamond Harbour, his Lok Sabha constituency in South 24 Parganas district located adjacent to Kolkata. “You called me a tolabaaj (extortionist) while you are the one whose name figures in the Saradha and Narada cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. You were seen in the (Narada) video accepting money wrapped in newspaper. My name is not there in the files. The ED and the CBI won’t be able to do anything to me,” said Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. “You have no spine and joined the BJP for protection,” he added. “If you (Centre) ever get any proof of my involvement in these cases, set up the gallows. I will voluntarily come and hang myself,” he added.Addressing a rally that was preceded by a roadshow at Danton in West Midnapore district shortly after Banerjee’s meeting ended, Adhikari accused his adversary of not only receiving money from coal and cow smugglers but also making money from funds meant for victims of cyclone Amphan or beneficiaries of social welfare schemes. During the roadshow, Adhikari even chanted slogans, asking people to save Bengal from “tolabaaj bhaipo” (extortionist nephew). Also read: Dawood’s aide wanted for serial blast plot nabbed after 24 yearsNone of the leaders mentioned each other’s name but the spirit and content of the vitriolic speeches made things obvious. It is now almost an open secret in Bengal politics that Adhikari left the TMC because he was unhappy with organizational decisions taken by Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On November 10, Adhikari threw his first veiled challenge at the TMC while addressing a public rally at Nandigram, the assembly constituency he represented in East Midnapore before resigning from the assembly. On the year’s last Sunday, however, there were no veils and no pulling of punches. Banerjee dared the Centre and probe agencies. “If you (Centre) ever get any proof of my involvement in these cases, set up the gallows. I will voluntarily come and hang myself,” he quipped At Danton, Adhikari said he did not raise his voice against alleged corruption in the government all these years because he was waiting for a time when the TMC could be ousted from power. “The coming elections will not be held in the presence of the state police. We will have Central paramilitary forces. People will give you a befitting reply,” said Adhikari. “Bengal has to be won and presented to Narendra Modi. It is necessary that Bengal and the country is run by the same government,” reiterated Adhikari. He had made this comment earlier also. On Sunday afternoon, Banerjee said, “Bengal is not an object that can be handed over to the Prime Minister.” BJP national president JP Nadda’s convoy was stoned by some people at Diamond Harbour on December 10. This was Banerjee’s first rally in the district after that incident. It triggered a cold war between the Union home ministry and the state. The ministry unilaterally transferred three Indian Police Service officers who were in charge of Nadda’s security. The state has opposed this. Also read: In veiled message to BJP, AIADMK asserts Palaniswami as CM candidate“People are aggrieved with the Centre’s policies. Some of them may have pelted stones. We should not pelt stones. We have to give our reply to the BJP through the ballot,” he said. Banerjee also targeted the Prime Minister and the Centre. “The Centre has suspended the area development fund given to members of the Parliament because of the Covid-19 pandemic but nobody raised a question when thousands of crores were spent to buy a plane for the Prime Minister,” said Banerjee.“Over the past one month the Union home minister has come to Bengal, big BJP leaders have come to Bengal and Union ministers have come to Bengal because they cannot stop a simple five-feet-one-inch-tall woman who lives in a tin-roofed house. You are no match for even the nails on her fingers,” retorted Banerjee. Countering this, Adhikari said the fight is between people of the districts and a few people who live in south Kolkata and hold all the important portfolios in the cabinet. His veiled reference was to the Banerjee family that lives in Kalighat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/video-shows-you-taking-money-not-me-abhishek-banerjee-challenges-suvendu-adhikari/story-J4O3ELURyDhyJEoMbAdjIN.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||‘BJP ministers fail to highlight a single benefit of farm laws’: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Bharatiya Janata Party despite sending out its chief ministers and union ministers to assure farmers that the newly passed agricultural laws are beneficial has failed to point out a single benefit.Kejriwal was speaking to Punjabi newspaper Rozana Spokesman regarding the ongoing protests staged by farmers’ protests at Delhi borders. “They say no one will be able to seize farmers’ lands, this is not a profit. They say the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system will remain unhindered, this is also not a profit… If BJP plans to implement these laws, they will hurt the nation’s farmers and profit a few rich industrialists. They say they will get good prices in any market but the prices outside are half of selling prices in Mandis. This is also not a benefit,” the Delhi chief minister said.“Today wheat is being sold in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh at Rs 800/quintal, the MSP price of wheat is Rs 850/quintal. Can someone tell the farmers of UP and Bihar where they should go if they have to sell their wheat at a higher price than Rs 850?” the chief minister questioned.Kejriwal pointed out that the step to amend the Essential Commodities Act will affect both farmers as well as the common man. He said that hoarding is a crime and according to him, the amendments enable hoarders to operate freely.Delhi CM appealed to the Centre that only BJP can repeal the newly passed laws and empathize with the protesters who are braving the cold at Delhi’s border where they have been protesting for more than a month.Kejriwal also said that the Aam Aadmi Party has earned the wrath of BJP because of supporting the farmers’ groups’ protests. He alleged that BJP cadres attacked deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and AAP leader Raghav Chadha to express their disliking regarding the party’s stand on the new laws and the protests. He also said that there was pressure from the Centre to transfer the protesting farmers to Delhi’s stadiums.“If we start supporting these bills, these attacks will stop immediately,” Kejriwal said. He also said that he and every single member of the Aam Aadmi Party will support the farmers protesting against the bills.Farmer unions’ leaders and union ministers will sit for another round of discussions on December 29 to discuss the farm bills. Farmers continue to demand that the government repeal the laws and give legal assurances to farmers regarding the system of procurement under MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-ministers-fail-to-highlight-a-single-benefit-of-farm-laws-kejriwal/story-mpB9U7OEuuH775PDmyj6hI.html

Rajiv Yadav, a property dealer and a resident of Rishikul colony from Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, was arrested by the Uttarakhand police team, which is now bringing him to Haridwar.Haridwar superintendent of police (SP) City, Kamlesh Upadhyay, said that forty police teams comprising cops, intelligence unit personnel, special task force (STF) and special operation group (SOG) had been formed to nab the co- accused. “Yes, the police team has succeeded in nabbing the accused Rajiv from Uttar Pradesh. He is being brought to Haridwar and further details will be divulged as soon as the police team reaches here,” said the SP. Rajiv’s location could be traced to Sultanpur area of Gorakhpur district in Uttar Pradesh based on the interrogation of his younger brother Gaurav, who was held on Saturday. Gaurav alias Gambhir Yadav was arrested on Saturday evening, when he was trying to leave for Uttar Pradesh, purportedly to handover money to Rajiv. Earlier, Rajiv’s nephew and the main accused, Ram Tirath, was arrested within hours of the alleged sexual assault and murder on December 20. The shocking case came to light last Sunday, December 20, after the girl, who went missing around 3pm while playing outside her house, was found dead, with her body tied with ropes inside a neighbouring apartment occupied by the two accused.During the post-mortem examination, she was found to have been raped and murdered, causing rage among the locals.Also Read: Encounter between Uttarakhand STF and wanted criminal in UP’s Bijnore, combing operation onPolice were under pressure to arrest Rajiv as family members, relatives, neighbours, social, political and religious organisations were carrying out protests and candle marches on a daily basis.

27-12-2020||Patna||Express train overshoots red signal by 500 metres, crew suspended||Passengers of the Tata Nagar-bound Danapur-Tata express were left stranded for hours after the train overshot the red signal at Hatidah Junction falling under Danapur rail division of the Eastern Central Railway on Saturday morning. The train overshot the red signal, technically known as Signal Passing at Danger (SPAD), by 500 metres leading to suspension of the loco pilot and the assistant loco pilot as per the railway safety protocol. “The loco pilot and assistant loco pilot were immediately put under suspension for crossing the danger signal while driving an express train which left for its destination with different crew”, CPRO said. The incident caused a huge alarm. The standard procedure for a SPAD is to detain the driver, conduct his blood test to ascertain whether he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs and to question him about the cause. SPAD is an offence which can lead to the loco pilot and the assistant loco pilot being discharged from service. It is yet to be ascertained whether the incident occurred because of poor brakes or if the loco pilot (LP) and assistant loco pilot (ALP) forgot to stop the train.According to the ECR official, incidents of platform overshooting occur when the loco pilot does not apply brakes at the right time. In some cases, this can happen if the train crew is engrossed in talks with the fellow personnel. The train usually gains high speed after leaving Mokama junction and as a result, some of its coaches, or the entire train, could have overshot the station by a distance. The distance between the two stations is just 8kms. “Such incidents are taken very seriously by the railways and there is a protocol to be followed. In such cases, the station master alerts supervisors who have to measure the distance overshot. Also, the loco pilot has to be questioned and other details are noted before the train can resume its journey,“ said Rajesh Kumar, chief public relations officer, ECR. He informed that ECR initiated a high level enquiry comprising a four-member team of top officials — senior divisional operating manager, divisional mechanical engineer, senior divisional safety officer and divisional electrical engineer. They will submit the final report within a stipulated period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/express-train-overshoots-red-signal-by-500-metres-crew-suspended/story-9SmrCGJc8wdomAlYl5YqHK.html
27-12-2020||Board||Maharashtra teachers demand release of time table, paper pattern for board exams||Teachers groups across Maharashtra have asked the state education department for more clarity on the conduct of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination for class 10 and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination for class 12, which are likely to be held in May-June next year due to the disruption of studies during the Covid-19 pandemic.In a letter addressed to the department on Saturday, the BJP teachers’ cell said that there was a lot of uncertainty around the board exams this year. “The process for filling of forms has begun for class 10 and 12 students but there is no clarity on the conduct of exams. The department has neither announced tentative dates for the exams nor has it released details on the paper pattern to be followed in the exams. We hope that the paper pattern is not changed because that might lead to unnecessary confusion amongst students,” said Anil Bornare of the BJP Teachers Cell.Over the last few days, several parents and schools have been writing to the department, requesting for clarity over the board exams. With a 25% reduction in syllabus across classes, schools said that they are unsure about the paper pattern. However, a senior official from the state board said that the paper pattern is unlikely to be changed.Also Read: West Bengal Class 10 board exams 2021 to begin from June 1“The syllabus and the paper pattern for class 10 and 12 have undergone changes in the recent years and it is thus not expected to change this year,” said the official, wishing not to be named.In early November, education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that the conduct of SSC and HSC examinations are unlikely before May due to the prevailing conditions in the state with respect to Covid-19.

Addressing party workers at the BJP office here, Adhikari said, “The political party I had been associated earlier has no discipline now. It has turned into a company from a party. I am ashamed of having associated with the party for 21 years.”The former West Bengal minister said that West Bengal needs the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It is due to the self-sacrifice of Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee that we could live in West Bengal. Only the combination of BJP government at the centre and that in Bengal can lead the state towards economic development and tackle the issue of unemployment,” emphasised Adhikari. “I would like to thank our home minister Amit Shahji for accepting us on the land of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar on Saturday. BJP is the largest political party in the world. Now, I am a member of this nationalist, pluralist, disciplined and patriotic party. Our objective would be to make the party win the forthcoming Assembly elections and create the ‘Sonar Bangla’.”Adhikari further accused the TMC-led West Bengal government of depriving 73 lakh farmers of the state by not implementing the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi policy.He claimed, “BJP workers have been beaten mercilessly. False cases were framed against them. 135 workers have sacrificed their lives to steer the party’s ascendancy in West Bengal.”Suvendu Adhikari, a former TMC minister and MLA, joined the BJP in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore in West Bengal on December 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/ashamed-of-having-associated-with-tmc-for-21-years-suvendu-adhikari/story-8YTPt7jB8WDTMzd7XVMKiL.html
27-12-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Let’s not be over-optimistic about corona vaccine||Covid-19 has come as a shot in the arm for vaccine research with several viable jabs in production less than a year after the disease emerged. Yet four in 10 Americans and six in 10 French people in recent surveys say they will not get vaccinated against the virus, even if the shot is free. According to the World Allergy Organisation, anaphylaxis an “acute, potentially lethal, multi-system syndrome” has been experienced by many of the Covid-19 patients, who recently received the jab. Meanwhile, vaccine makers are making hay while the sun shines! Will the vaccine prove to be a miracle cure? Is the vaccine safe and effective? Can it be available and be delivered to the entire population? Making the vaccine available for even 50% of our population is a tall order and getting their consent for a costly injection of a preventive remedy that may have side effects and efficacy, if any, lasting less than a year, may be impractical if not impossible. Take for instance the vaccine for Hepatitis B. Even though it costs Rs 200 for three doses and immunity lasts an entire life, still less than 10% agreed to get immunised. The world has been playing with the flu vaccines for over 100 years, but where do we stand today? If Covid continues its journey of decline in numbers of infections and CFR (case fatality rate), will the vaccine be required at all? One has to recount the experience with polio vaccine, administered orally with no side effects and only meant for children. It took many long years to cover the targeted population. How many years will the corona vaccination require? Can it prove be an unnecessary torture on the one hand and a scam of large ramification on the other? Former chief scientist of Pfizer, Dr Michael Yeadon, has said that “there is no need for any vaccines to bring the Covid-19 pandemic to an end.” Side effects are inherent in vaccinesVaccines usually require years of research and testing before reaching the clinics for vaccination. They have to be proved safe and effective in animal studies, then in small trials in healthy volunteers, followed by large trials in representative groups of people. The aim of a vaccine is to prevent a disease by working with the body’s natural immune response. When a vaccinated person is exposed to the virus, the immune system recognises the pathogen and prevents the person from getting infected. Since the pathogen in the vaccine provokes the body to gird up its defenses, the vaccine is unlikely to be absolutely safe. So if one were to talk about the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine with absolutely no adverse effects, then one should understand that no vaccine is ‘safe’. Choose the lesser evil. If balance of unwanted effects compared with the benefit is clearly in favour of the benefit, it can be called safe. A study in the United States has revealed that the primary efficacy endpoint is the presence of one Covid-19 symptom such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test within four days of the symptomatic period. The Food and Drug Administration noted adverse events, which were mild to moderate, with injection site reactions, fatigue, and headache as the most common. Adverse events potentially related to the vaccine were lymphadenopathy, or large-sized lymph nodes, Bell’s palsy; a form of temporary facial paralysis was reported by four patients in the vaccine group. Appendicitis was the most common serious adverse event, with eight of 12 cases occurring in the vaccine group. There were two deaths in the study in the vaccine group. So, how does one distinguish between Covid-19 and post vaccine exposure symptoms? Symptoms are likely to resolve within three days of vaccination and within one to two days of onset, so any symptoms past that timeframe, or worsening symptoms, are more suggestive of Covid-19.Vaccines are given to healthy people and risk has to be incredibly small. Even Pfizer vaccine does have side-effects, e g headache, chills and muscle pain in over 10% people. One may not be in an undue haste to get the shot out of turn! Wait and watch may be a good strategy.(The writer has worked at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and is president, Society for Promotion of Ethical and Affordable Health Care)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-let-s-not-be-over-optimistic-about-corona-vaccine/story-XDeSGPREJy2rdkwL3T8aSM.html
27-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Oh my love, my darling||The terrified Jungle cat kitten’s throat was parched, her ‘meows’ cracking and at their last strains. Mommy was not responding. The barks of the hounds encircling her were deafening. Any minute now and this cutie pie fur ball would be reduced to mangled shreds, no mommy to rescue her or lament her premature passage to death. And, then, Nature’s miracle... Birder and cat lover, Kunal Gokhale, chanced upon the siege while chasing kestrels and orioles. Five stray dogs hailing from the adjacent slum colony were shooed off and Kunal emitted mesmerising, reassuring sounds. Promptly, the kitten came out of the bushes and attached herself to Kunal’s shoes, sniffing them for a sense of safety.The tiny, hungry creature had sensed that a saviour had come her way, out of the blue. In the kitten’s eyes glimmered a gleam of hope like a distant star. In Kunal’s eyes, intense love shone like a full moon, glazed over by a mist of tears yet to fall. A feeling of ‘mamta’, an irrepressible urge to protect this innocent, helpless waif and reunite her with the mother took possession of the androgynous soul. He took her in his lap and she soon drifted to sleep. In other words, the noblest quality of humanity – empathy – had overwhelmed the situation.Despite his best efforts over the next two nights, Kunal could not unite the kitten and the mother though the orphan has survived in the care of the RESQ Charitable Trust. Mommy was possibly killed by dogs or the kitten had wandered too far from her den while mommy was away hunting to nourish her yielding teats. The incident took place earlier this month in the heart of Pune, Maharashtra, on the verdant Vetal Tekdi hill. But the theme bears a resonance throughout India as stray dogs (or man’s companion animals) increasingly butcher, harass and spread disease in wildlife populations. They act as advance scouts of man’s annexation and beastly gang rape of a mute wilderness. “We don’t know what number of wild fauna the dogs have already killed but they are a constant threat to peafowls, hares, mongoose, Jungle cats, Barking deer, civets etc,” Kunal told this writer.Mommy knows best Folk tales and myths tend to demonise foxes as cunning, vile creatures. But the Indian fox mommy at Chhatbir zoo is a smart cookie. She has outwitted the efforts of the officials to get a decent picture of her three lockdown pups born in the torturous summer of 2020. The authorities were keen to procure pictures of the pups to showcase this rare species of the region because whenever visitors went near the enclosure, mommy would whisk away the pups into the burrow den. The good news is that mommy and daddy were caught with their pants down recently, ie mating again, and the next, post lockdown litter may be in the offing!Mommy fox’s sharpest early warning systems are her long, pointed ears that swivel like an airport radar in an arc of 120 degrees catching and processing the smallest sound. The second she detects movement towards the enclosure from 30-40 metres away, the family vanishes from sight. Even while sun basking with her eyes closed, mommy’s ears are constantly moving to detect any disturbance in the environment around the enclosure. The authorities put up a CCTV camera but she was very suspicious of the alien object in the enclosure. She has even dragged the two blankets into the burrow and regularly takes the chicken and boiled eggs food put in the open by the zoo keeper right down.“While are very happy the foxes are breeding, they have defied all our schemes to photograph the pups,” Chhatbir field director M Sudhagar told this writer. In the meanwhile, let us have a glimpse of what fox pups look like in the wilderness till such time as zoo pictures materialise!vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-oh-my-love-my-darling/story-HZHbof4zQSeZFyWy46F5iP.html
27-12-2020||Chandigarh||The end of autonomy: Panjab University at the crossroads||“The goal of democracy is education, intellectual development, and nobility of spirit, the most important weapons public intellectuals hold against the degeneration of democracy.” Bob Riemen. It strikes a blow at the very core of academic life when the teaching community is mandated to acquiesce to the state authority and be subservient to a governing body that is in turn accountable to a patron seemingly bereft of a broad progressive policy. The diagnosis of the world-wide crisis in education finds a confrontational reflection in the Dutch scholar, Rob Riemen’s essay, The Eternal Return of Fascism, where he accentuates the theoretical feebleness of fascist thinking marked by severe hostility towards freedom in thought and action. Reform indeed is always welcome and necessary, but destroying age old and tested institutions deeply wedded to democratic traditions is unquestionably retrogressive. Take the case of Panjab University, one of the oldest universities in the country, which has been functioning through a governance structure as embodied in the Panjab University Act, 1947. The four year term of the old senate expired on October 31 this year and the elections for the new senate have been indefinitely postponed with no news from the establishment regarding the future course of the university’s governance structure. All important academic and administrative functions of the university have therefore come to a standstill. The situation is indeed dismal. For all purposes, therefore, the Panjab University senate stands dissolved. It must be noted that neither the University Grants Commission nor the Chancellor have the authority to change the governance structure without consulting the constitution of the university. In a milieu of self-righteousness and indifference, the Central government, it is believed, has overreached itself in deciding to replace the senate with a board of governors, the intention being to adopt a corporate model for the university. This is obviously in keeping with the current practice of blatantly sidelining eminent academics and vice-chancellors, and instead making appointments arbitrarily on the basis of party affiliations. Any form of dissent or disagreement with the official policies is thereby discouraged. The conflict apparently is between viewing a university as a seat of diversity and learning or a seat of conformity and indoctrination. Any plans to replace the senate of the university with a board of governors would be a violation of the Panjab University Act. The unresponsive nature of official politics with its failure to veer even a little towards bringing reform in its basic structure rather than completely obliterate it has deepened the sense of alienation and mistrust. At a time when the political discourse in the country is taken to a different level of authoritarianism, the pursuit of a more conducive democratic governing set-up in the form of an elected senate with a membership from various ideological and academic backgrounds was the dire need of the times. This was appropriately envisaged by the forefathers of the university who ensured that such a democratic body would be reliant on animated free discussions, a glowing example of an open field where diverse interests and opinions contribute to a robust critical conversation. In the present predicament there are no signs of initiating even a public debate on governance reforms. The silence of the authorities on the future of the senate is rather intriguing, leaving many faculty members in a state of indignation and outrage amidst the wreckage of age old structures which undergird the university. I wonder if the leadership in power has dwelt on any visionary roadmap for a political ideology to stimulate a new generation of academics in a university that constantly aspires towards new frontiers of knowledge. A far-sighted governing system requires academics with vital administrative experience along with the understanding of new pedagogical practices equipped to confront the present situation in which the valorization of mediocrity has resulted in denigrating those who accomplish their responsibility with sincere impartiality. It is disdainful to be subjected to the arrogance and incapability of the political elite to guide the course of higher education in the interest of the students and the teachers. Sliding downhill towards self-deluding and bureaucratised governing bodies that lack the ability to handle alternative views and guard against any retrogressive decisions, the university faces a crucial challenge to its autonomy. The chasm between the public intellectual and the inflexible establishment stands wider than ever. At this dark hour when higher education is poised on the cusp of ideological dogmatism, a far deeper involvement is required in the ongoing struggle for winning back a more autonomous system of academic functioning. This is possible if an objective exercise is carried out for seeking innovative forms of governance that strive for an unassailable commitment to free thought inculcated in the true spirit of the pursuit of knowledge. It would therefore be egregious to accept a non-elected and selectively constituted governing body that could impede the independent working of the institution. The teachers of Panjab University stand vindicated by their ongoing confrontation and opposition of this assault on the deep-rooted self- governing character of the university. shelleywalia@gmail.com [The writer is formerly professor, department of English and cultural studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh.

27-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn forms committee to monitor adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccine||The UT administration has formed a panel of doctors to monitor adverse effects, if any, among the beneficiaries of the Covid-19 vaccine.The panel comprises doctors from the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Earlier, the Union health ministry had asked to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid-19 vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among the masses.Committee reconstituted to identify adult needs“Under the universal immunisation programme, a system already exists, but it was targeted for children only. Since this is an adult vaccine, we have reconstituted the committee by involving doctors from cardiology, neurology, medicine and anesthesia departments. Vaccinators have already been trained to identify signs of side-effects and deal with common occurrences,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director health services, UT.Detailing about the process, Dr Kang said , “A 30-minute on-site monitoring of people who will be vaccinated will be mandatory post-vaccination. Besides, we will have a 24x7 Covid vaccine help desk functioning to help the beneficiaries.”All beneficiaries will be counselled about the adverse effects that may occur after being administered the Covid-19 vaccine. “These are expected to be minor events such as local pain and swelling, and mild to moderate fever, etc. However, the list of expected events could be different based on the safety profile of the Covid-19 vaccine that finally gets approved for use,” the doctor added.All the adverse effects of the vaccine will be reported through the Co-Win application developed to monitor and manage the Covid-19 vaccination programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-forms-committee-to-monitor-adverse-effects-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-Mi0haB2jRJbPH4fZJ8bKeK.html
27-12-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Pandemic brings down donations at National Burns Centre’s skin bank||With barely any skin donations made since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the nodal skin bank National Burns Centre (NBC) at Airoli has been forced to turn back patients. Before the lockdown, NBC received around 20 skin donations a month and this monthly average has now come down to approximately four. In the last nine months, NBC has received 22 skin donations compared to 200 donations received between March and November in 2019. This year in March, NBC got nine skin donations. Between April and August, not a single donation was recorded at the skin bank. In September, five skin donations were registered, followed by three in October and five in November.Read more: Airoli burns centre to help three countries set up skin banks“People are fearful of contracting Covid-19 so they avoid donating the skin of their loved ones after their death,” said Dr Sunil Keswani, medical director, NBC. “Since the lockdown, we have been forced to turn away burnt patients from other states who need skin transplants. We are trying to reserve the limited resources for patients from Maharashtra,” he said. Being the nodal burn centre in India, NBC gets burn patients from across the country.Donated skin is processed and stored in a skin bank before it is transplanted. It is used to help treat skin that has been badly burned or damaged. In cases of severe burns, for example, covering the area with skin from a donor helps to prevent infections, decrease pain, provide protection, and enable faster healing. If a severe burn injury is not immediately covered with donated skin, an infection can develop, which can have serious consequences.Dr Keswani said NBC has formulated safety protocol so that there is no danger of Covid transmission. “We held meetings with skin banks across the country and have formulated rules to ensure the safety of people. The doctors retrieve the skin in protective suits and the possibility of infecting the deceased relatives is almost nil,” he said.According to NBC, its outpatient department (OPD) has received 229 burn patients between March and November, and 168 patients have been admitted with severe burn injuries. Some of these burns were sustained because of false information that Covid-19  can be prevented by steam inhalation and very hot baths. Most of the burn patients are close contacts of Covid-positive individuals. Read more: Family donates 87-year-old’s skin to Mumbai hospital for burn injury patients“With misleading information going around on WhatsApp that steam inhalation can inhibit or kill the virus causing Covid-19, the cases of scald burns have doubled. People pour hot water directly from the geyser, which burns the skin,” said Keswani.Dr Arvind Vartak, head of the burn unit at Byculla-based Masina Hospital, confirmed this, saying, “Cases of scald burns are the most common which has increased both in children and adults.” Since the lockdown was relaxed, cases of burn injuries have increased with more industrial burn injuries reported in the city. April saw 31 burn patients and this number increased to 54 in November. “With the relaxation of lockdown, the number of industrial burn has increased,” said Dr Keswani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-pandemic-brings-down-donations-at-national-burns-centre-s-skin-bank/story-8CKYl5h2dsNiy123WeeSoM.html

A team from Mumbai ATS has gone to Himachal Pradesh to probe if the racket was linked to any terror activity and also to track the kingpins behind it. Last week, GRP personnel had arrested Himachal Pradesh residents – Lalitkumar Dayanand Sharma, 50, who is a travel firm owner, and Kaulsingh Rupsingh, 41, a driver – and seized 34.4kg of hashish (charas) from them. The Pune unit of GRP had made the arrests after they received a tip-off about two men travelling from Delhi to Pune by train with drugs. The police laid a trap and arrested the duo near Pune railway station with the hashish. “The case is transferred to ATS for further probe, especially to find out the source of the drugs, the people behind the racket, their distribution network and more importantly, if the gang had any links with terror groups,” said an ATS officer. Initial probe has revealed that most of the seized drugs were to be distributed in Mumbai, while 5kg each was to be transported to Bengaluru and Goa, 2kg was meant to be supplied in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drugs-seized-from-hp-men-mumbai-ats-to-probe-terror-angle/story-nnupdzEQckeADFDGmvDoPN.html

According to an officer, ATS Charkop unit busted a drug racket in Lokhandwala and seized 155kg of Mephedrone (MD) and arrested seven accused, including Electricwala five years ago. This year in February, Mandvikar was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch for allegedly threatening and extorting from a businessman. He was charged under Maharashtra Control Of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca), following which he was lodged in a high-security cell of Arthur Road jail. Electricwala, who was lodged in an adjacent barrack, befriended Mandvikar, said an ATS officer.In the trial before the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act court, while the deposition of a prime witness was in progress last month, he was threatened by Mandvikar’s henchmen.After the witness approached ATS, an offence was registered and two persons, Sujit Padwalkar and Kolekar, were arrested. Kolekar had allegedly directed Padwalkar to threaten the witness. During inquiry, Kolekar revealed Mandvikar and Eelectricwala’s names, said the officer. ATS has also taken Mandvikar and Electricwala in its custody and both are in police custody till Monday.During probe, ATS found that the jail guard deployed outside Mandvikar’s cell passed the chit to his aide. The guard is in police custody till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-jail-guard-held-by-ats-for-passing-gangster-s-messages-to-his-aides/story-9ANhVq44JBi528WGsi6JDN.html

IPG includes Boeing pilots, while ICPA represents pilots who fly Airbus.The pilots are upset that though the airline has rolled back 5% in the wages up to the 70% cut it had imposed from April, the actual rollback amounts to only 3% of the total deduction.In their letter to the airline’s director (operations), the pilot unions said despite being patient about the “neglecting attitude” of the management amid the Covid-19 pandemic, they left no stone unturned to ensure smooth operations continue.The pilots alleged that the national carrier’s top management has seen “fit to heap” discrimination against them under the guise of the ongoing pandemic. This, according to the pilots, is being done by unilaterally imposing harsh pay cuts on them while absolving itself from any fiscal responsibility towards the national carrier or its frontline employees.The letter read, “The market is firmly set on the road to recovery and competing carriers are revoking their temporary austerity. This is to inform you that we will no longer extend unconditional co-operation while the top management continues to mock the dignity of our profession.”The pilots had on Thursday also written to Air India’s chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal, rejecting the 5% roll back, and warned of an “industrial action”. The pilots in their letter had said, “This [working for additional hours during Covid-19] generosity amounts to a reduction of about 3% in the current gross pay cut for pilots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-india-pilots-upset-over-cut-in-pay-rollback-won-t-work-after-duty-time/story-Xt9tZZ4jFnAHE65wsADXON.html

Twelve varieties of “green crackers” contained barium nitrate, which has been banned by the Supreme Court, and other nitrates and sulphates. “All these toxins contribute to the composition of air pollution that people breathe and are avoidable additions to already dangerous air quality,” reads the letter by Awaaz Foundation, sent to Thackeray on Saturday. Vidyanand Mothgare, joint director of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, said the state has already issued curbs on the use of firecrackers during New Year celebrations. “Based on the findings of our scientific tests, we have banned some firecrackers. Moreover, guidelines have been issued to district administrations to ensure measures as instructed by the National Green Tribunal,” he said, adding that in places where the air quality is poor, only green crackers may be used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ban-firecrackers-during-new-year-celebrations-ngo-writes-to-maharashtra-environment-minister/story-27oygC10VPXK4MiGapRqfJ.html

27-12-2020||Mumbai||Colleges in Mumbai Metropolitan Region to begin FYJC classes; no clarity on exams yet||Nearly four months after the admission process for first-year junior college began, prominent colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are now set to start the new academic year for students. The three admission rounds to junior colleges had concluded recently. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, VG Vaze College, said that the institute had begun classes from Thursday. “We had completed more than 90% of our admissions, and hence wanted to begin as soon as possible. While there is a 25% syllabus reduction this year owing to the Covid-19 situation, we have asked teachers to ensure that key concepts across subjects are taught to ensure continuity in Class 12,” said Joshi. On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota in jobs and education for the Maratha community, the state education department had stayed the admission process for FYJC students until further orders. Read more: FYJC special round postponed to Dec 28 by Maharashtra govtWhile the state government restarted admissions only this month, stating that they will take place without the 12% SEBC quota, it has recently allowed Maratha students to opt for the Economically Backward Class (EWS) quota, as per its decision on Wednesday. The special merit list for FYJC will be announced on Monday. Chandibai Himathmal Mansukhani College, Ulhasnagar, which has also completed most of its admissions, is planning to reopen from the first week of January. “We are in the process of allotting roll numbers to students now and will start our classes soon. We hope to finish the syllabus by utilising the holidays, for online lectures, and also scheduling extra classes,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal of the college. Even as colleges are set to reopen, the inordinate delay in beginning the new academic year means that they cannot stick to the usual academic calendar. For instance, colleges usually conduct four exams for Class 11 – two unit tests and two semesters – which cannot be done this year owing to lack of time. The government has not come up with any guidelines with respect to the same. “We are hoping that the government takes a decision on the conduct of exams soon so that colleges and students would both know what to do. Also, the paper pattern for the exams should be made clear,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college. Officials from the education department said that colleges would soon be notified about the schedule of examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/colleges-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-to-begin-fyjc-classes-no-clarity-on-exams-yet/story-ThkrNj1rSiunsKtBK8DzIJ.html

Athawale wants to consolidate his Republican Party of India’s (RPI) hold over members of the Dalit community, who are the core voters of his outfit. He would be touring western Maharashtra, Marathwada, Thane and Konkan regions and would also be addressing rallies. RPI will also undertake a state-wide membership drive to attract voters to the party. Athawale will kick-start his campaign from Pune on Sunday where he will address his party workers. The membership drive will be held till January 10, after which organisational elections will be held and completed before January 26. Former state minister and RPI leader Avinash Mhatekar said the drive is planned to build a bridge with the workers. “From the past one year, we had lost our link with our workers and it was necessary to bridge that gap. Our workers are still with us but then we need to guide them. These interactions through tours, intra-party elections and party meetings boost the morale of the workers,” said Mhatekar. In the past few years, the influence of RPI on its cote voter has reduced significantly. It was not able to open an account in the 2019 Parliamentary and Assembly polls. The party in fact yielded its space to Athawale’s arch rival Prakash Ambedkar, who heads the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). Ambedkar’s party was able to garner substantial votes in the two major elections last year, thus making it a major force among Dalit voters. Political analysts say that Athawale had neglected his outfit in the past few years. “RPI did not raise or agitate against any major issue in the past few years. Athawale sat comfortably as a minister and never bothered to grow his party. He now realises that he has to strengthen his base to keep himself relevant, especially when VBA is growing,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rpi-chief-ramdas-athawale-to-campaign-across-maharashtra-to-strengthen-base-among-dalit-voters/story-bjFohm3gr5FnUqWeMk9nBO.html

27-12-2020||City||ED summons NCP leader Eknath Khadse for probe on Dec 30 in land deal case||Senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to its Mumbai office on December 30. The central investigating agency is likely to probe the alleged money laundering angle in the Bhosri land deal case, in which the land was purportedly bought at an undervalued price. Khadse has confirmed receiving the notice with HT and said he will report to ED. The former heavyweight is under scrutiny for allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal in Bhosari near Pune. It is said that the plot was bought by his wife Mandakini Khadse and son-in-law, Girish Choudhary, in 2016 for Rs3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of Rs30 crore. The former state minister had dumped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in October to join Sharad Pawar-led NCP. Without taking any name, Khadse has directed his attack on former Maharashtra CM from BJP Devendra Fadnavis. “He wants to harass me and thus the same case is being probed again and again by different agencies,” Khadse said. He had blamed Fadnavis for all his “miseries” in the past four years previously too. “The land was bought at Rs3.75 crore and the government has already spent Rs14 crore-Rs15 crore on various probes. The case was investigated by the Pune ACB (anti-corruption bureau) as well as by the Nashik ACB. Pune ACB had submitted its closure report before the court. The state had spent Rs3 crore-Rs4 crore on the Zoting committee (appointed by the Fadnavis government) too, to probe the same case. It was also probed by the Income Tax department. This will be the fifth probe in the same land deal,” Khadse said, stressing that he has been targeted. He told reporters at Dhule that people from across the state are calling and expressing sympathy with him. “They also felt that this is a kind of injustice. It appears that they didn’t like the probes one after the other, but decisions have been made and we have to follow them,” he said. In the Pune ACB’s closure report, Khadse was given a clean chit. In its report filed before a Pune court in 2018, ACB had said there was no evidence to prove that the former revenue minister was aware that his wife and son-in-law had purchased the plot. Khadse was a prominent BJP leader from north Maharashtra and enjoys a significant hold in the region. He belongs to Leva Patil, one of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities that has a sizable population in north Maharashtra. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said those who are against BJP are being targeted by using central agencies. “Even Sena leaders have received notices from ED. You [BJP] aren’t strong enough to fight them politically, so you’re making them bow before you by unleashing ED, CBI, Income Tax,” said Raut. Senior NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal echoed the sentiment. “It was bound to happen. Khadse himself had said this when he had left BJP and joined NCP. Those who will speak against BJP, be it Pratap Sarnaik, Khadse or Lalu Prasad Yadav (RJD president), they try to create trouble for them,” Bhujbal told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-summons-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-for-probe-on-dec-30-in-land-deal-case/story-N0xe02qmbxgOKWeraziCvL.html

Apart from this, the Covid centres run by the civic body at Savlaram Krida Sankul and Patidhar Bhavan in Dombivli and Vasant Valley in Kalyan (W) can also be used for storing and managing the vaccinations.“As of now, there are no specific directions on how much vaccines will be stored. However, we are asked to identify places where it can be stored. Phase by phase, we will look for more places like an ice factory where the vaccines can be stored as per the requirement,” added Panpatil.As per the KDMC, a total of 25 small ILRs, 18 large ILRs and 21 deep freezers are required to store the vaccines. The civic body already has 23 small ILRs, 13 large ILRs and 18 deep freezers. Out of these, some are defunct.“We are working on repairing the non-functional storage facilities so that they can be used when the vaccines arrive,” added Panpatil.In the first stage, the civic body has plans to cover vaccination of around 6,000 health workers that also includes the private ones and anganwadi health workers. Further, the civic body will provide the vaccination for policemen and homeguards working from the front. In the third stage, it will cater to senior citizens and persons with comorbidities.“We have done the survey for the health workers and have prepared a list of 6,000. The police department data will be also carried out at their level and further, the third phase of covering common citizens will also be taken up simultaneously by the civic body. Under the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey, we already have certain data while they can also self-register in the coming days,” said Sandip Nimbalkar, medical officer, KDMC.The civic body has also identified a manpower of 150 people to carry out the work of vaccination. These workers are from civic body health department staff and private workers.“We have 600 personnel presently working regularly. Out of them, we can divert 150 of them for vaccination,” added Nimbalkar.As per the health department, only when common citizens are to be immunised, the civic body might approach schools and other places for storing of vaccines.“Right now, we have enough storage facilities. Only after the third stage will we need more places for storage. Our task force will approach others accordingly once the database of the comorbid persons and high risk people are finalised,” added Nimbalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-ready-to-give-vaccine-to-2l-residents-in-phase-1/story-wgkCEzjpJFKG816Qu9wHRL.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Firing in Trilokpuri leaves one dead, two injured; cops say no communal violence angle||One person was killed and three others were injured after two groups clashed and opened fire at each other over a personal enmity in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri on Saturday night, police said. The dead man, identified as Shahid, belonged to one of the groups. Several rounds were fired during the clash between both the groups, who are neighbours, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that the clash started around 10pm over the issue of one group beating up an employee working at the shop of another group. “Bullets were fired by both the groups and some people were injured in the firing. They have been admitted to a hospital. One of the injured, Shahid, has succumbed,” said DCP Singh, adding that no communal angle was involved in the incident.Police said that the clashes broke out between the groups — one led by Kashim and Shahid and another by Mannan. Both the groups resorted to firing at each other. Later, there were unverified reports of a man’s name being circulated on social media as the culprit behind the firing. There were also reports that stones in huge quantity had been recovered from the roof of the above mentioned person’s shop during the 2014 Trilokpuri communal violence. DCP Singh, however, said that this information is yet to be confirmed.Though Trilokpuri has a history of communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims, police said that Saturday’s clash was not communal. Police said the clash was between two groups with criminal antecedents. In 2014, at least 40 persons were injured when riots broke out between Hindu and Muslim residents of Trilokpuri. Delhi Police have then imposed curfew in the area to contain the clashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/firing-in-trilokpuri-leaves-one-dead-two-injured-cops-say-no-communal-violence-angle/story-0B8QbZS0gFXig4wJu2alnN.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt tries new SOP to redress complainants||The Delhi government has drafted a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure complaints received through its departments’ helplines are resolved in time and complainants are updated about its status regularly, said a senior government official.“Several departments of the Delhi government – such as environment, women and child development, social welfare and education – have telephone helplines. While there is a dedicated mobile application for pollution-related complaints, there was a need to streamline the mechanism of other helplines. That is why the new SOP has been drafted,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.“From this week, the SOP is being tried in the women and child development department It will help amend the SOP, if needed, before being adopted across other departments.”Under the SOP, departments have to appoint a joint director-rank officer in charge of grievances. For every complaint received, a report has to be submitted to the officer within three days of receiving the complaint, following which the officer would set a deadline for resolution. It would even apply to complaints whose redressal needs involvement of multiple agencies. said the senior official.From the third day of having received the complaint, the officers have to devise a mechanism to keep the complainant updated about its status from time to time. Departments will have to maintain electronic records of each complaint and complainant.Delhi’s women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said: “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has clearly stated that all complaints and grievances across all departments have to be resolved in a time bound manner. If officers fail to do so, they shall have to explain why. We have streamlined the grievance redressal mechanism keeping that in mind. The idea is to ensure better governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-tries-new-sop-to-redress-complainants/story-S2f6K0CPI9IYeuj6AMjejP.html

27-12-2020||Delhi||At Kundli end of Singhu stir, quieter nooks and cleaner spaces||The Singhu border farmers’s protest site is nearly seven kilometers long and growing. While the first few kilometers near the Delhi side is crowded with protesters, police and the media, little is known at what happens at the other end.That site is situated close to Parker Mall in Kundli, Haryana. Here, the crowds are thinner, fewer garbage mounds and there are a lot of unoccupied spaces with quiet nooks. Here too, one can find colourful tents and tractor-trolleys that bear a striking resemblance to the ones closer to the Singhu border.Janak Raj, an 80-year-old farmer from Jindalpur in Punjab’s Patiala, has been living here for the last one month since the protest broke out against the Centre’s new farm laws. Twenty other farmers from his village had proceeded to the Singh border, or what people here call “the stage area”. “When we came here with our tractor-trolleys, not everyone could go towards the border. People had to park their vehicles as per available space. So I had to park mine here,” he said. Every day, Raj walks, and sometimes hitches a ride, the seven kilometers to the “stage area” and join the other in voicing their protest. “I go to the stage for two hours every day to listen to the speeches. Then I come back and sleep here. That area is too crowded. There is no space to move. It’s better to stay here at the end,” he said.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Will there be 6th round of talks soon? 10 pointsFewer people meant that the site is also much cleaners. There aren’t mounds of disposable plates and cups, food waste or plastic bottles, which are common close to the Singhu border.Gurcharan Singh, 53, a resident of Lassoi village in Sangrur, said, “Our volunteers have been sweeping and cleaning at both the spots. But there are more protesters near the stage area, so the garbage is bound to be more. The government too hasn’t deployed enough sanitation workers.” Over 100 sanitation workers from North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Sonipat Nagar Nigam have been deployed at the spot to pick up garbage from the protest site, officials said.“Clearly that is not enough. We try to wash our cooking utensils by a pit nearby so that the water doesn’t accumulate on the roads and give off an odour,” Gurcharan said.While the elderly find it difficult to take the 14-km to-and-fro journey, the youngsters come to their aid.Rajesh, 25, from Shyamli in Sonepat has been at the Kundli spot since December. “I travel to the stage area every day and listen to the day’s discussions. I return in the afternoon and then discuss it with our elders. It is also easier to talk here since there are fewer loudspeakers,” he said.Langars are here too, and so are entertainment in the form of folk songs -- while some sing Haryanvi Ragini, Sikh farmers offer kirtans. Without equipment though, the audience are smaller.These groups are expected to attempt to move closer to Singhu border as farmer unions on Saturday announced that they would hold a tractor-trolley march on December 30.Rajinder Singh from the Kirti Kisan union said, “The government should discuss modalities of repealing the law. Else, on December 30, we will take our tractor-trolleys and march from Singhu to Tikri and Shahjahanpur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-kundli-end-of-singhu-stir-quieter-nooks-and-cleaner-spaces/story-20nz6cyt4eFjnZ6c8b1epN.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Two more UK returnees test positive, shifted to special ward of Lok Nayak hospital||Two more people who returned to Delhi from the United Kingdom (UK) between November 25 and December 21 have been found Covid-19 positive, senior government officials said on Saturday.The Union government had suspended all flights from the UK on December 23 to prevent the spread of a new strain of Covid-19 that experts fear is more contagious.As on Saturday, the senior official said, at least 21 patients were admitted in the special ward of Lok Nayak Hospital, which has been set up for the UK returnees and their contacts who test Covid-19 positive.The 21 patients so far, include 11 who were identified from the last few flights from UK over Tuesday and Wednesday. Nine others were diagnosed as Covid-19 positive between Wednesday and Friday under a reach-out drive being conducted by the district administration. One other patient is the contact of one of the UK returnee patients, the senior government official said. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“The test result of the last two patients arrived on Saturday, following which they were admitted in the special ward of Lok Nayak. More Covid-19 test results are awaited,” said the senior official, who did not wish to be identified.The swab samples of all UK return individuals, who have tested positive, have also been sent to the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi for genome sequencing to ascertain if they have been infected by the old strain or the supposedly new variant of Covid-19 discovered in the UK. The result of these tests are awaited, said the official.While people arriving from the UK on December 22 and 23 — after the government’s announcement — were directly scanned, tested and quarantined (if needed) from the airports, state governments have been entrusted with reaching out and conducting Covid-19 tests of all passengers who arrived from the UK between November 25 and December 21, even if they had previously got themselves tested on arrival.A senior official in the revenue department said around 14,000 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport between November 25 and December 21 – of which around 1,500 are Delhi residents. The rest are learnt to have left for other states, where the respective government teams are conducting similar tests.The threat from the new strain of Covid-19 comes at a time when Delhi seems to have brought the spread of the infection in control in the state.The state on Saturday recorded 655 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, which is the lowest in 215 days, since 412 cases were recorded in a day on May 26, data shared by the Delhi government showed. The administration conducted 67,115 tests conducted on Friday, of which 40,138 were done using RT PCR and other accurate molecular diagnostic methods.Despite the higher number of RT PCR tests, Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive among those tested – dropped to 0.98%. The city’s positivity rate has remained below 2% for 12 days now. Experts believe that the spread of an infection is under control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for over two weeks.  Meanwhile, district officials have initiated a reach out drive to trace all UK returnees and get them tested.Once a UK returnee tests positives, all her /his contacts are to be tested. The contacts awaiting test results and those who test negative have to complete a mandatory institutional quarantine. They can either opt for a government facility in Chhatarpur or a paid facility in a hotel at Aerocity.The Chhattarpur facility currently has around 80 individuals lodged. Most of them were people sitting in the neighbouring seats of the UK-Delhi flights from which the 11 Covid-patients were identified over Tuesday and Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-more-uk-returnees-test-positive-shifted-to-special-ward-of-lok-nayak/story-CCHnjhKy1z1R0a3Y3yJy4L.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Protesters block Delhi-Meerut Expressway again, third time this week||Traffic on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) was disrupted for five hours on Saturday, as farmers protesting the three farm laws blocked the route at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border. Protesters said they were angry over their supporters being blocked from joining them in different Uttar Pradesh districts. Since December 3, the protesters had blocked the Meerut to Delhi route on the Expressway. Over the last two days, the number of protesting farmers at the site had increased, and it was the third time that the traffic on Delhi to Meerut route was blocked this week.On Tuesday (December 22), the expressway remained closed for nearly 10 hours, while on Monday (December 21) traffic was disrupted for almost an hour.On Saturday, traffic on the route was hit between 11 am and 4 pm and diverted to other borders such as Anand Vihar, Apsara, Bhopura and Khoda. While the Delhi to Meerut route was freed of the blockade in the evening, the other carriageway remained blocked.Traffic on the roads had been affected for the past month when farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were stopped at the UP Gate border by the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh police. Farmers parked their tractor trolleys and other vehicles on the roads and set up camp there as part of their agitation for the repeal of the three laws. Saturday’s blockade was done mostly by the farmers’ groups from Uttarakhand. They claimed that the Uttar Pradesh administration and UP Police had been “harassing” farmers by stopping their vehicles at Uttarakhand-Uttar Pradesh border and in areas such as Rampur, Bilaspur and Pilibhit.“We were coming from Uttarakhand when our tractors and cars were stopped at the Uttar Pradesh border by the police and local administration. When we refused to return, they misbehaved with us. This has been happening for the past one week,” Gurjinder Singh, a farmer from Udham Singh Nagar.Another farmer from Uttarakhand Gurjan Singh said, “Nearly 100 tractors are still stuck in Rampur and Pilibit. Our protest is to condemn such acts. If they (UP administration) will stop us there, we will block the roads here at UP Gate.”“There was no law-and-order situation at UP-Gate. Farmers blocked the road and later opened it on their own,” said Vipin Kumar, city magistrate who was officiating as additional district magistrate (city). “Traffic and local police were deployed to ensure convenience of motorists at the border. Since the blockade was not during peak hours, it did not cause much problems,” said Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh.The Singhu and Tikri borders where thousands of farmers are protesting continued to remain closed while one carriageway at the Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) border is open for vehicles entering Delhi from Noida. Motorists going to Noida are being diverted to other borders such as DND, Kalindi Kunj, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli, and Dallupura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/protesters-block-dme-again-third-time-this-week/story-WA9dfTTL1DafJuTxNYejiM.html
27-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi court pulls up cops for ‘high-handedness, misadventure’ during arrest of murder suspect||A Delhi court on Saturday came down heavily on the Delhi police on their way of arresting a man, accused in a murder case, even when he had obtained a surrender order from the court to join the investigation after he alleged that he, along with his counsel, were assaulted when he had come to the jail for surrender. The judge said that it is a “clear case of misadventure on the part of investigating agency”.Duty magistrate Raghav Sharma said that power of arrest cannot be used as a force for threatening the accused in any manner. It directed the Deputy Police commissioner (DCP) of the concerned district to sensitize its staff on the procedure to be followed for arrest.“The power of arrest with the police authority is given with responsibility as well as sense of duty on their part. The power of arrest cannot in any manner be used as a force for threatening the accused. While there is no doubt that the power of arrest is very much necessary for proper investigation of the case, has to be used with proper reasons and with proper adherence to the procedure established by law,” the court said.The court was hearing an application by a man, Karthik @Chhota Madhu, who through his counsel Purushendra Bhardwaj, had contended that he was assaulted by 2-3 unknown people when he had gone to surrender himself in the Tihar jail complex. The plea had said that all these persons in plain clothes “pounded” on the man and his lawyer and later took him away in a car.The application also stated that the manhandling took place within the compound near Water Park of the Tihar jail complex. On December 25, the court had made preliminary enquiry and had also tried to reach out the Investigating Officer of the case, after it was informed by a CRPF official on duty that the persons who had assaulted Karthik and his counsel were police officials.The official also told the court that the persons who had assaulted the man were police officials while also confirming that they had manhandled the accused and his lawyer when they had gone to surrender.“On being questioned whether entries were made in the register of those police persons (whose IDs were checked by him), he (CRPF official) replied in negative stating that those persons entered a few minutes before the entry of accused and his counsel and therefore, there was no time for making entry in the register as the place of making entry is 10 -15 steps away from the gate where he was present,” the court noted in its order of December 25.On Friday, when the court tried to reach out to the Investigating Officer (IO), his phone was switched off. Irked by this, the court noted that not only did the IO came to the court, but had also switched off his phone to avoid any calls from the court. Terming it “serious disregard of the court”, the judge had ordered the IO and the SHO to appear before it on Saturday.On Saturday, the IO and the SHO told the court that they had got an information that the accused that he may come to Tihar Jail with his 3 - 4 associates to surrender before the duty magistrate at the Tihar jail complex. As per this information, a raiding team was deployed to detain the accused and as soon as they spotted him they detained him immediately and took him to Subhash Place police station.The IO also said that the persons who pounded on the accused persons were the staff of their police station and the accused person was arrested by them.Terming it as a clear case of misadventure, the judge said that the procedural safeguards of arrest which includes showing the ID of the arresting officer and proper regard to the physical liberty of the accused have been violated“In the present case, not only the guidelines have been completely violated but also there is patent disregard to the spirit of procedural law. The concerned DCP Is hereby directed to sensitize the staff regarding the procedural requirements of arrest…,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-court-pulls-up-cops-for-high-handedness-misadventure-during-arrest-of-murder-suspect/story-6k25PuzCUo909tcWjp0xqO.html
27-12-2020||Pune||Delay in results leaves students’ future in lurch||For Vivek Amrutkar, a final-year Bachelor of Engineering student, the last one month has been tough, as he is not able to process his admission for a post-graduation course, nor has he been able to follow-up on job opportunities. He blames the delay in the revaluation process at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Just like Amrutkar, there are hundreds of students who have missed their deadlines to submit marksheets for admissions, or are struggling to join the job market without the passing certificate. “I am a student of Information Technology (IT) and appeared through the online mode for the final-year exams. I failed in three subjects. Due to technical errors in the system I was not able to submit my paper and it continuously showed errors. I am studying IT engineering and I know all the details about technical errors in online exams. I complained about it and demanded a revision of marks. Mow my further studies have gone for a toss as deadlines have passed. Also, I am not able to find a job,” said Amrutkar, who had come to SPPU on Thursday from his hometown Amalner, in Jalgaon district. From December 23 till the afternoon of December 26,, a group of 50 students were seated outside the SPPU main building, as part of a protest called by the Yuvak Kranti Dal. The only demand is to get their results revised properly and get them done immediately, so as to take further admissions or find a job. Students were present from all around the state including, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Amalner, Shegaon and Solapur districts. SPPU V-C on the jobA meeting was held between the protesting students and a committee formed by the SPPU vice-chancellor on Saturday. Accordingly, students with issues in one subject were given revised results, whereas students with issues with two or more subjects will get the revised results on Monday.SPPU vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “I am personally looking into the results related issues and interacting with students about resolving their problems. Students with a problem in one subject have been cleared, but students who are now protesting have issues in two or three subjects. We have formed a committee to do a revaluation of these results and accordingly their revised results will be declared soon.” A state-wide tale of broken dreamsProtesting students had come in full preparation to stay outside the SPPU main building till they get their results revised. Raw food, gas cylinders, blankets and sweaters were all in place. Nehal Doshi, a Bachelor of Arts student from Bhosale Military College in Nashik, had come along with her father. She said, “I got less marks in two subjects, which were actually the easiest. I want to pursue a post-graduation in phycology but cannot take admission. If I do not submit the marksheet in time my entire year will be wasted.” Nehal’s father, Sunil Doshi, who accompanied her from Nashik, said, “I have taken for two days and came to Pune. It is a matter of my daughter’s life and career, so we are helpless.” Yogita Vasant Dongre, a 22-year-old Bachelor of Pharmacy student from Dighi said, “I cracked an interview at an MNC company and got the offer letter, but same issue, they need my graduate certificate. I was failed in three subjects by SPPU. I have given more than 10 applications to the examination department to review my results, but there is no response.” Bharati Mandhyani has a seven -year-old son and has been struggling to get a job. “I wanted to start working once I complete my graduation. I did my Bachelor of Commerce, externally. There was a technical issue in the Economics paper for most of the students, and I was failed. Now I keep my son at my parent’s house and come to the SPPU to get the results revised for the last one month, but no one is responding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/result-delays-disrupt-jobs-further-studies-for-sppu-students/story-SQyn53FzhoreAj8XJHX8iK.html
27-12-2020||Pune||PMC awaits state government nod for medical college recruitment||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to wait for the state government’s permission for recruiting 650 posts for the newly established medical college that will be run by the help of a trust. The medical college has been named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister. As the college will function with funds from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), all resources will be provided by the civic body. With no financial dependency on the state, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol was of the view that the civic body did not require state government’s permission for recruiting staff. Mohol said, “As everything will be managed by PMC and the trust, I was asking the municipal administration to recruit on our own as there are no grants from the state government. But the administration is of the view that for recruitment, the state government’s nod is important.” PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “It is true that the PMC is going to run this college but to avoid any controversy we are approaching the state government for getting the approval for recruitment.” One of the senior officials from PMC said on anonymity, “Though PMC is going to bear all costs and provide infrastructure, it is necessary to have state government’s permission for recruitment. There are many issues like reservation and other technical formalities. It would just be a technical permission. It would not prolong the recruitment process. We requested and convinced the elected members why it is necessary to take the state government’s permission.” The medical college is likely to start by next academic year. It would help get trained doctors for PMC-run hospitals in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-awaits-state-government-nod-for-medical-college-recruitment/story-2ELRGkpeUEk4sJTMXiIIzH.html
27-12-2020||Pune||Man who stole two-wheeler batteries from FTII arrested||The Deccan police have arrested a thief who stole ten batteries of various two wheelers, iron pipes and window grills from the Film and Television Institute of India (FTTI) on December 25 at 9.30pm from campus. The accused gained entry on the pretext of cleaning the campus and took advantage of the situation and decamped with the material which has been recovered from him. The total seizure has been estimated to be worth Rs 18,500 while the tempo in which he was taking the stolen material has been estimated to be worth Rs 2 lakh has been confiscated. According to the police, a tip off was received by police sub inspector (PSI) Kishore Shinde that a tempo carrying stolen material was moving in the direction of Mhatre Bridge. Following the information, PSI Shinde and his team members laid a trap near the area and asked him to stop but he tried to speed away. However, the investigators managed to stop and take him into custody. During interrogation, he identified himself as Rahul Ram Bhandve (32), a resident of Dattawadi. On interrogation, he said that he had stolen the material from the FTII campus and was on the way to dispose the material. He was immediately taken to the police station and a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against him under IPC 379 ( theft) at Deccan police station. The police action was taken under the guidance of zonal DCP Priyanka Nanaware and additional commissioner (west) Sanjay Shinde and other senior officials of zone I. PSI Kishor Shinde said, “We had received a tip off from the informer about the stolen material and a tempo moving suspiciously near Mhatre Bridge. We immediately swung into action, stopped the tempo and arrested the accused. The FTII had asked a person to clean the campus and he had in turn asked Bhandve to carry out cleaning. The accused then stole batteries and other material from the area. He was produced before the court which released him on bail as the entire recovery was completed by the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/man-who-stole-two-wheeler-batteries-from-ftii-arrested/story-sZAN2c5U93hlFviIbfPhjO.html
27-12-2020||Pune||Parents, teachers “welcome” decision to re-open schools||The decision to reopen schools by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the city limits has been welcomed by many parents as well as schools though some have exercised caution. Most parents noted that even though there is a new strain of the virus, there is no need to worry. It is imperative that children are trained to continue taking all necessary precautions while they are out. Manasi Joshi, a parent from the city said that it is great that the schools are reopening. “Though online teaching is going on, the children are now tired of attending school from home. Reopening schools is a good decision. These kids are young and active and they have been at home since March. It is only fair to let them attend the schools,” Joshi said. While talking about the new strain of the virus, Joshi said that social distancing, masks and hand hygiene are a must, but that should not limit children from going to school. “Covid is here to stay. Children should be trained to remain safe. Schools will also be taking all necessary precautions. So, I think children should be sent back to school,” she said. The PMC on Thursday announced that schools in Pune will reopen from January 4. As per the order, class 9 to 12 will reopen in the first phase. Sharing similar views, Archana Kakade, another parent from Pune said that there is risk but along with children, schools also need to take precautions. “The odd even rule is a good rule which can help maintain social distancing. If that is strictly implemented I don’t see why parents would hesitate to send children to school. All necessary precautions will be taken on a regular basis. Children also now know the importance of wearing masks and using sanitizers,” Kakade said. Avinash Takawale, principal of Saraswati Mandir also welcomed the move by the PMC. “The decision is welcomed. We have been taking online classes, and we will continue teaching children with all necessary precautions and safety measures,” said Takawale. Shakuntala Kale, chairperson of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said that once the schools are reopened it is up to the schools to finish the syllabus. “The board is responsible for the examination. Once the schools reopen, the syllabus and practicals will be a decision that schools will be taking,” Kale said.

27-12-2020||Delhi||Man on death row in Bangladesh nabbed from Khanpur by Delhi Police||A 40-year-old man from Bangladesh, who had been given the death sentence in a kidnapping, robbery and murder case in the country but had fled after getting bail a decade ago, was arrested from Delhi with a country-made pistol and two cartridges, police said on Saturday.The man, Mausam Ali alias Sarbar, carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh for his arrest that was announced in Bangladesh for his arrest. He had been living in India illegally after entering the country in 2010. Ali was involved in several heinous crimes in Bangladesh, said additional commissioner of police (crime) Shibesh Singh.Sharing details of the kidnapping and murder case, additional CP Singh said that in 2005, Ali along with his associates – Bacchu, Monir, Gaffar and Zakir – kidnapped a person named Jahidul Islam from his mobile shop in Madhya Nalbunia Bazar in Bangladesh. They murdered him after robbing him of cash and other valuables. Islam’s mutilated body was found in a field, a day after his murder. All the alleged accused were later arrested by the police.In 2010, all the accused were granted bail in the case, but the trial continued. The same year, Ali fled and entered India illegally along with an agent named Sarbar, and his wife. Sarbar lived in Delhi’s Seemapuri and worked as a scrap dealer. All three lived together in Seemapuri for sometime. A month later, Sarbar returned to Bangladesh and never returned. Ali started living with Sarbar’s wife like a married couple. They soon moved to Bengaluru, where Ali started a scrap dealing business, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh.“Since Ali had taken the identity of Sarbar and was living with his wife, we strongly suspect that they may have killed Sarbar. Ali, however, has denied this. We will inform Bangalore police about Sarbar’s wife and request them to interrogate her regarding her husband’s whereabouts and why Ali was using Sarbar’s name and IDs,” added the DCP.In 2013, the concerned court in Bangladesh awarded the death sentence to Ali, while the other four men were acquitted in the case. However, Ali could not be arrested again as he had fled to India in 2010 and never returned.DCP Singh said that Ali was arrested from Delhi’s Khanpur area on Saturday after an informer told the crime branch team that a man wanted in Bangladesh in a kidnapping, robbery and murder case of 2005 was spotted there. The team put Ali’s cellphone on surveillance.“We caught Ali with a pistol and two bullets from Khanpur after his arrival in the city. He has been booked under the Arms Act and Foreigners Act. The Bangladesh High Commission has been informed about his arrest,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-on-death-row-in-bangladesh-nabbed-from-khanpur-by-delhi-police/story-khIuSk0fzd6XUExDGiT1sI.html

However, the district administration has not been able to meet the target. As of Friday, December 25, the administration is carrying out 7,000 daily Covid tests, less than half the target set by the state government. The recommendations had come in view of a possible second wave of infections. The district administration has now set its own target at 12,000 tests. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “There are not many Covid-19 patients now, however, I have asked the district administration to aggressively do contact tracing and survey of SARI and ILI patients. We are also covering comorbid patients to make sure that we meet the target. By next week, I have ordered the administration to test at least 10,000 samples daily.” To increase daily testing, the administration is increasing contact tracing, detection of ILI and SARI patients and also potential super spreaders. The administration estimated that in the worst-case scenario it is possible that the city may have over 48,000 active cases, for which it claims it has enough manpower, medicines, drugs, beds, oxygen, and ICU units with and without ventilators. Although the positivity rate of the city has gone down, there has been a slight spike in the number of daily cases but the number has not been as high as was being estimated before Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-7-000-per-day-pune-dist-fails-to-meet-state-directed-18-000-test-nos/story-pyvTzJCZySpQuZr8xD1XzI.html

The vaccinators have been undergoing a training which is likely to be the same as other universal vaccine programmes, but in addition, will include verification of registered candidates. During a presentation to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the district administration expressed its preparedness for vaccination given the possibility of a “second wave”.As per the presentation, the administration has selected 2,546 vaccinators for the Covid-19 vaccine and a total of 1.97 lakh doses will be needed in phase one.Phase one will vaccinate healthcare workers, front -line workers and then comorbid and members of the population above the age of 50. Dr Ashok Nanadapurkar, district civil surgeon, who was also part of the meeting on Saturday attended by the deputy CM, said, “The administration is fully prepared for the vaccination drive which will take place as per the central government’s policy. Now we are awaiting the vaccine approval and the vaccinators are doctors and nurses who trained to conduct vaccinations. This time, however, the additional factor is a verification process for which we will have separate staff.”The administration has also stated that of the 2,546 vaccinators, 1,445 will be from PMC, 157 from PCMC and 944 from Pune rural. In its first phase the city will need about 91,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, 36,000 for PCMC and 70,000 for Pune rural.

27-12-2020||Pune||143 two-wheeler/pillion riders die in road accidents in 2020||The total number of road accidents related to deaths involving two-wheeler riders and pillions in Pune, has reduced in 2020, compared to 2019. As many as 143 two-wheeler and pillion riders lost their lives in 2020 (January to December 26). Of these 143, nine were wearing helmets at the time of the mishap. Compared to this, as many as 206 two-wheeler and pillion riders died in 2019, 18 of which were wearing helmets.The number of accidental deaths involving two-wheeler riders in 2017 was 212 while the same was 193 in 2018. In addition, 64 pedestrians were killed in 2019 in various road accidents, while only 32 have been killed in 2020. According to statistics revealed by the traffic branch, as many as 127 accidents were reported upto November 2020 which left 290 persons injured, 78 of whom escaped with minor injuries. In 2019, 199 accidents took place in the city which caused 206 deaths and left 463 with grievous injuries, while 163 sustained minorities injuries. According to deputy commissioner of police (Traffic) Rahul Srirame, the fall in the number of accidents is mainly due to the lockdown. “The number of deaths for 2020 has come down because of the prolonged Covid-19 induced lockdown and restrictions in place. The number of two-wheeler riders not wearing helmets who met with death in various accidents has increased. We appeal to citizens and advise them to wear helmets while riding,” said Shrirame. He added that the most of the accident victims died due to serious head injuries, as they were not wearing helmets. A survey conducted by Parisar, an NGO working on traffic safety in Pune, found in 2019 only 46% of two-wheeler riders wore helmets. Pune holds the distinction of having highest number of two-wheelers in the country. Parisar had conducted a detailed study of the 10 busiest junctions in Pune city wherein 5,500 two-wheelers, including 995 two-wheelers with pillion riders were surveyed. As many as 700 photographs were analysed in the survey by the traffic experts and it was found that a meagre 3% of the 995 pillion riders caught on camera used helmets. Ranjit Gadgil, project director, Parisar, said, “Helmet compliance increased when traffic police implemented the law effectively two years ago, but later, the entire system of electronic challans came into place and on-ground presence of policemen was reduced. There was a kind of fear amongst citizens till police were seen on ground and in their absence, citizens increasingly adopted helmetless riding. The police enforcement of helmets requires political support. Police must continue on ground enforcement strategically.” Pedestrian First convenor Prashant Inamdar said, “The focus should be on the enforcement system, and penalty collection system, which will yield good results in the future. We have to look for out- of-the-box solutions to enforce the helmet rule in the city. There is a need to relook at the entire issue once again in the larger interests of citizens.”Total fatal accidents since 2017 – 926 Total injured: 1,900 persons In 2017Fatal accidents where two-wheeler rider or pillion was not wearing helmet - 175 In 2016Fatal accidents where two-wheeler rider or pillion was not wearing helmet - 140In 2018Fatal accidents where two-wheeler rider or pillion was not wearing helmet - 314 Fatal accidents involving youth in 18-35 age group - 136 deaths Number of road accidents in 2020, as per area-wise police stationHadapsar (62) Sinhagad (39) Bharati Vidyapeeth (34) Chatushringi (39) Wanowrie (26) Warje (25) Yerawada (25) Vimantal (22) Dattawadi (14) Koregaon Park (24) Deccan (10) Khadki (10) Mundhwa (07) Bund Garden (07) Other police stations (43) Source for statistics: Traffic police branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/143-two-wheeler-pillion-riders-die-in-road-accidents-in-2020/story-1q6C42o53VxswwKxQ9gg6N.html

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warned that the US is at a “very critical point” in combating the pandemic after many Americans ignored guidance to avoid travel.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageFlying has picked up recently while remaining well below year-ago levels. Figures from the Transportation Security Administration show more than 1 million people moved through US airport checkpoints on five of the past nine days heading into and through the holidays.Admiral Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said the risks entailed by traveling depend mostly on what people do once they get to their destinations, as actually being in an airplane is typically safe.“What we really worry about is the mingling of different bubbles once you get to your destination,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”Vaccinations in the US began Dec. 14 with health-care workers and residents of nursing homes. So far almost 2 million doses have been administered in the country, according to a state-by-state tally compiled by Bloomberg. Those numbers are accelerating as a second vaccine by Moderna Inc. is distributed.Mutant strainHealth officials are on alert for a more infectious Covid strain that’s emerged in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and Japan, although there’s no clear evidence it results in more severe cases of the disease.Travelers coming to the US from the UK face more restrictions because of the new variant, with the US insisting on testing negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departing the country.Also Read | 14 million Americans are without jobless benefits as Trump refuses to budge on billGottlieb, a board member of Pfizer Inc., said that he believes the UK strain is already in the US, and in “a reasonable number at this point.”He saw signs that US new daily Covid-19 cases are starting to plateau, but since hospitalizations and the number of deaths tend to lag by two to three weeks, “we have a very difficult month ahead of us.”President Donald Trump has remained silent about the new variant and the worsening crisis gripping some parts of the US He took to Twitter on Saturday to criticize Democratic governors for taking emergency steps to contain the outbreak.“The lockdowns in Democrat run states are absolutely ruining the lives of so many people,” Trump tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-health-officials-warn-of-post-holiday-coronavirus-surge/story-ITUUi2jvttIFdn97B47ZsJ.html
27-12-2020||World||14 million Americans are without jobless benefits as Trump refuses to budge on bill||An estimated 14 million Americans lost jobless benefits on Sunday as outgoing President Donald Trump continued to resist signing an omnibus spending legislation that provides for $900 billion in Covid-19 relief and $1.4 trillion to keep the federal government funded beyond Tuesday.Trump is demanding $2,000 in direct payments in relief for those rendered jobless by the pandemic instead of the $600 in the bill that was proposed by his own negotiators and passed by both the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led Senate. He is also seeking the federal spending bill to be stripped of certain expenses, including some proposed by his own administration.Congressional leaders have signalled they will try one more time on Monday to put together a package for the president to sign.“Increase payments to the people, get rid of the ‘pork’,” Trump tweeted on Sunday morning, shortly after the unemployment benefits lapsed. “Pork” comes from “pork barrel”, a term used to describe federal funding of local projects at the behest of members of congress.US Congress sent the president an omnibus legislation last week proposing $900 billion in Covid-19 relief that included direct payments of $600 each to those unemployed and assistance to small businesses, airlines and funds for vaccine distribution. The $2.3 trillion package also contained $1.4 trillion to fund the federal government.The outgoing president, who had been largely missing from the protracted negotiations that took place, suddenly announced that he won’t sign the bill as proposed unless the direct payments were hiked to $2,000 and certain expenses were not removed from the federal funding part of the legislation.Trump’s announcement took both Democrats and Republicans by surprise. Democrats had been seeking more in direct payments and had settled for less at the insistence of Republicans and the president’s own negotiators, led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who had personally proposed the amount of $600, as the Washington Post reported.Democrats tried to pass a legislation with the increased amount sought by the president, but Republicans blocked it. Trump has felt frustrated with some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who are unwilling to go along with his efforts to overturn the November 3 election which he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. The president wants Republican lawmakers to force Congress to reject the electoral college vote when it comes up for a final certification on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-million-americans-are-without-jobless-benefits-as-trump-refuses-to-budge-on-bill/story-knvmdcUNNDlW6MTBRhl2OM.html
27-12-2020||World||Maryam Nawaz says ‘incompetent’ Imran Khan was ‘imposed’ on Pakistan||Referring to Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistani Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz on Sunday said that certain forces which follow a “divide and rule” policy had “put together fallen fragments from political parties and formed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf” and imposed on the country an “incompetent man”. Speaking in Larkana on the ocassion of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s 13th death anniversary, Maryam said that like the first women PM in a Muslim country she too wished to struggle for a united Pakistan.Beginning her speech in Sindhi, she said, “In 2008, when there was talk of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government being toppled, Nawaz Sharif quashed such thinking and said that the coming and going of governments is a decision for the people to make, not political parties.”The PML-N further said that “some forces” who follow the “divide and rule” policy had “put together fallen fragments from political parties and formed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf” and, thus, an “incompetent man” was “imposed on us all”.“What does PDM need to say to that man? He himself is saying he knows nothing [...] he is saying people should not assume power without preparation. I say, no one should be brought into power without preparation,” said Maryam.Slamming Imran Khan, she said that while people are “killing themselves out of hunger and desperation due to inflation” he said, ‘What can I do, I have no magic button’.”She further said that “the corrupt” are pardoned, whereas political leaders are “thrown into jail, shot down and made to face the courts”, Geo News said.“But you can never send to the gallows or exile a political ideology [...] which is why, there is no one to take your name, but in every corner of Pakistan, there are people to take Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto’s names,” she said.Recalling Benazir Bhutto, the first female prime minister of the Muslim world, the PML-N vice president said that Bhutto “had to lay down her life” during her struggle and for her beliefs. “Benazir fought for her father’s struggle and vision and then ultimately joined him in the afterlife,” she said while adding “I too wish to struggle for a united Pakistan”.On the Charter of Democracy that was signed between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, Maryam said, “This are not simply strands from history, these were events that were to alter Pakistan’s fate.”The PDM has been holding anti-government rallies against the Imran Khan government on the charges of election rigging, corruption and dominance of Pakistan Army in politics of the country.Maryam and Bilawal are among the major leaders that have said that they will send the Imran-led government packing and have organised six PDM rallies in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Multan and Lahore since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-says-incompetent-imran-khan-was-imposed-on-pakistan/story-JUM17jNRozxkGjNIeDLiXN.html

27-12-2020||World||Explained: What happens if the US government runs out of money on Monday?||US President Donald Trump’s threat not to sign a $2.3 trillion spending package approved by Congress has already shuttered an emergency unemployment aid program and threatens a partial federal government shutdown at midnight on Monday.The bill provides $892 billion in coronavirus relief and $1.4 trillion to keep regular government operations running through the fiscal year.Without Trump’s signature, Congress would need to pass a stopgap funding bill that he is willing to sign to keep federal agencies fully operating.The Trump administration has not said what it will do if the government runs out of money, but previous lapses have led to tens of thousands of non-essential workers being put on leave and others, including those dealing with public safety, forced to work without pay.Here’s what would likely happen if the White House and Congress cannot agree on a spending plan:Pandemic economic assistance: The legislation would provide $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans. Trump, in one of his chief criticisms of the bill, has said the payouts are too small and has demanded the checks be increased to $2000.Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million Americans through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted if Trump signs the bill. The bill would keep the benefits going through mid-March.The spending package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution.All of the relief programs are at risk unless an agreement can be reached.Vaccine distribution: The federal government has already purchased 400 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, or enough for 200 million people, from Moderna and Pfizer but needs additional funds to purchase more doses. It also signed contracts with other companies for vaccines that have yet to be authorized. Private companies, including McKesson, UPS and FedEx, are distributing the doses but have been relying on staff in the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services for support.States have received $340 million from the US government to help offset costs they have borne from the vaccine rollout but say they face a shortfall of around $8 billion. A shutdown would halt plans by Congress to distribute funding to make up for that shortfall.Healthcare: Previous shutdowns have led to widespread furloughs for workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the agencies leading the response to the coronavirus pandemic. A CDC program to track flu outbreaks was halted during a 2013 shutdown; in 2018, the government kept the program running during another shutdown, saying “immediate response to urgent disease outbreaks” would continue.Military: The Defense Department continued operating through the last shutdown, which stretched 35 days through late 2018 and early 2019. During that period, the United States was unable to send paychecks to service members and civilian employees. Active-duty military personnel were considered essential workers; some civilian employees and contractors were furloughed.Law enforcement: The FBI and other law enforcement agencies continued working during previous shutdowns. The FBI Agents Association said after the last shutdown that funding lapses made it harder to pursue cases, in part because they were unable to pay informants. Federal courts largely remained open through the last shutdown because they had enough money available to sustain them through the shutdown.National parks and monuments: National parks and monuments largely remained open during the last shutdown, though some places, such as Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, closed. Other parks remained open with limited staffing, leading to complaints about overflowing trash, uncleaned bathrooms and illegal campsites as visitors fended for themselves.Financial oversight: Market regulators were forced to furlough staff during the last shutdown. The Securities and Exchange Commission kept sufficient staff in place to monitor markets and “respond to emergency situations.” It continued to accept corporate filings.Mail delivery: Deliveries continued as usual during previous shutdowns because the US Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations.Travel: The Transportation Security Administration workers who screen airline passengers continued working during the last shutdown. So did air traffic controllers, who the government considered to be essential employees.The 2018-2019 shutdown came to an end when absences by air traffic controllers raised the prospect of many flights into and out of New York being canceled, provoking a compromise between Trump and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-happens-if-the-us-government-runs-out-of-money-on-monday/story-Sn3sdemcc0WaEJl5jGyk4I.html
27-12-2020||World||Cold chain doubts delay Covid-19 vaccinations in some German cities||Germany’s coronavirus vaccination campaign faced delays in several cities on Sunday after medical staff found potential irregularities in the cooling of the shot produced by BioNTech and Pfizer.The European Union launched a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide.“When reading the temperature loggers that were enclosed in the cool boxes, doubts arose about the compliance with the cold chain requirements”, the District Office of Lichtenfels in the north of Germany’s largest state Bavaria said in a statement. The Pfizer vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112°F) to remain effective before being shipped to distribution centres.Pfizer has designed special shipping containers filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling while in transit. Shots can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2C to 8C – a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals. Besides Lichtenfels, the northern Bavarian cities of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel also held off from inoculating people after uncertainty arose about whether the cold chain had been maintained.“Vaccination against the coronavirus is not about who vaccinates the fastest or who does the most doses. Safety and conscientious work for the benefit of the population has the highest priority”, said Oliver Baer, district administrator of the district of Hof.Similar problems also delayed the vaccination campaign in the southern Bavarian city of Augsburg, daily Merkur reported.Germany’s vaccination campaign officially kicked off on Sunday with residents of elderly care homes being inoculated. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January.Vaccinations will be free and available to everyone from mid-2021 once the priority groups are expected to have finished being inoculated.“This makes us proud and above all confident that we can overcome this pandemic - because vaccinating paves our way out of the crisis,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cold-chain-doubts-delay-covid-19-vaccinations-in-some-german-cities/story-NCSTmTV2RwfI8mFotz4QnM.html

During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union show, Dr Fauci was asked whether he agrees with president-elect Joe Biden’s recent statement on the ongoing pandemic that the darkest days in the battle against Covid-19 is “ahead of us”.“I do,” replied Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “We very well might see a post-seasonal - in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s - surge,” he added.The United States has, so far, recorded nearly 332,000 Covid-19 related deaths, and a report suggests that the country will witness a total of over 567,000 deaths by April 1, 2021. According to the predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), around 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.Earlier this week, Dr Fauci was administered with Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine as a part of a confidence-building effort by health officials. The 80-year-old immunologist said that he feels fine after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, adding that he only felt an ache in his arm that lasted around 24 hours. “Then it went away and completely other than that, I felt no other deleterious type of effects,” he said.Also Read | US testing requirement for UK travellers may not be enough to contain Covid-19 variant. Here’s whyThe United States has rolled out two Covid-19 vaccines - one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna - for health care and frontline workers and for those at high risk. There have been concerns over the recent reports of severe allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of vaccine. However, public health experts have said that those cases as “rare” and “in line with the expectations.”Dr Ashish K Jha, Dean, Brown University School of Public Health, pointed out that over a million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 and less than 10 people have had allergic reactions, highlighting that one in 2,000 courses of penicillin also leads to an allergic reaction. Taking to Twitter, Dr Jha said that though it is important to determine the cause of these reactions, he was pleasantly surprised how well the immunisation drive is going so far. To be clear, we absolutely should identify, publicly report these reactionsBut this is the most high profile roll out of a vaccine in recent historyAm pleasantly surprised how well its goingIts early -- but so far, these reactions are totally in line with expectations||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-seasonal-surge-dr-anthony-fauci-says-worst-of-covid-19-pandemic-still-to-come/story-lisTkEbPUiv9p78RAK2PxJ.html
27-12-2020||World||High-level Chinese delegation in Nepal trying to patch split between Oli and Prachanda||A high-level Chinese delegation led by a vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday to “take stock” of Nepal’s political situation after the dissolution of Parliament and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. Although no specific details about the agenda of the visit are available, the four-member delegation, led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou, will hold high-level talks during its four-day stay in the country, according to highly placed sources. Guo is expected to meet President Bidya Devi Bhandari, Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Kumar Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction of the party, sources said. The Chinese embassy here and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are tight-lipped about Guo’s visit. His visit is aimed at “taking stock of Nepal’s evolving political situation after the dissolution of the House of Representatives and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) amid already-deepened intra-party rift”, My Republica newspaper reported. China is not happy with the split in the largest communist party of Nepal, according to sources. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, will make efforts to patch up differences between the two warring factions of the ruling party - one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda - during his four day stay in Nepal, according to the Kathmandu Post.Earlier, Gou travelled to Kathmandu in February 2018 when Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) - were all set to merge and form a unified communist party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. Later in May, 2018, the two communist parties merged and formed a new party named Nepal Communist Party, the paper said. Gou will assess the situation inside the ruling party and will encourage both factions of the NCP to seek some kind of common ground for party unity, the Post said, quoting party leaders. He will communicate the message of Chinese leadership, including that of President Xi Jinping’s, to the NCP leadership, a ruling party leader said.“Besides this, the Chinese side has not communicated to us anything about the visit,” the leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.China has carefully chosen and sent Gou at a time when unity inside our party is shaken, a Standing Committee member said.Nepal plunged into a political crisis last Sunday after Prime Minister Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. Acting on the prime minister’s recommendation, President Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Meanwhile, President Bhandari has called the winter session of the National Assembly, the upper house of Parliament, from January 1, The Kathmandu Post reported. Assistant Spokesperson to the President’s office Keshav Prasad Ghimire, in a statement on Sunday, said the President has called for the National Assembly session at 4 PM on January 1. Oli-led Cabinet on Friday recommended the President to convene the winter session of the National Assembly. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, had communicated about the visit of Guo to Kathmandu during her meetings with senior NCP leaders of both the Prachanda- and Oli-led factions. Beijing appears concerned over the move of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives and the evolving political situation that saw a vertical split in the NCP. This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal’s internal affairs. In May and July, Hou held separate meetings with the president, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down. A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy’s series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal’s internal political affairs. China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou has made open efforts to garner support for Oli. The CPC and NCP were regularly engaged in training programmes. In September last year, the NCP had even organised a symposium, inviting some CPC leaders to Kathmandu to impart training to Nepali leaders on the Xi Jinping thought ahead of the visit of the Chinese president, his first to Nepal, according to a Kathmandu Post report. In a guarded reaction to the fast-paced political developments in Nepal, India on Thursday said it was an “internal matter” of the neighbouring nation and it was for the country to decide as per its democratic processes. “We have noted the recent political developments in Nepal. These are internal matters for Nepal to decide as per its democratic processes,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi. “As a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development,” he said.

27-12-2020||World||Nashville explosion investigation prompts FBI to search home||Federal agents converged Saturday on the home of a possible person of interest in the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville as investigators scoured hundreds of tips and leads in the blast that damaged dozens of buildings on Christmas morning.More than 24 hours after the explosion, a motive remained elusive as investigators worked round-the-clock to resolve unanswered questions about a recreational vehicle that blew up on a mostly deserted street on a sleepy holiday morning and was prefaced by a recorded warning advising those nearby to evacuate. The attack, which damaged an AT&T building, continued to wreak havoc Saturday on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states.Investigators from multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies were at a home in Antioch, in suburban Nashville, after receiving information relevant to the investigation, said FBI Special Agent Jason Pack. Another law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said investigators regard a person associated with the property as a person of interest.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image had shown a similar recreational vehicle parked in the backyard when the photo was captured in May 2019; an AP reporter at the scene did not see the vehicle at the property in the late afternoon Saturday.There were other signs of progress in the investigation, as the FBI revealed that it was looking at a number of individuals who may be connected to it. Officials also said no additional explosive devices have been found — indicating no active threat to the area. Investigators have received around 500 tips and leads.“It’s just going to take us some time,” Douglas Korneski, the special agent in charge in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said at a Saturday afternoon news conference. “Our investigative team is turning over every stone” to understand who did this and why.Beyond that, the only known casualties were three injured people. Investigators said they were working to identify human remains found at the scene.The infrastructure damage, meanwhile, was broadly felt, due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. Police emergency systems in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, as well as Nashville’s COVID-19 community hotline and a handful of hospital systems, remained out of service.The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted.Asked whether the AT&T building could have been a possible target, Korneski said, “We’re looking at every possible motive that could be involved.”Investigators shut down the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene — an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops — as they shuffled through broken glass and damaged buildings to learn more about the explosion.Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area until Sunday via executive order to limit public access to the area. More than 40 buildings were affected.AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power.“Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.”Ray Neville, president of technology at T-Mobile, said on Twitter that service disruptions affected Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Birmingham and Atlanta. “We continue to see service interruptions in these areas following yesterday’s explosion. Restoration efforts continue around the clock & we will keep you updated on progress,” he said in a tweet Saturday.The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday. The Federal Aviation Association has since issued a temporary flight restriction around the airport, requiring pilots to follow strict procedures until Dec. 30.According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.___Associated Press photographer Mark Humphrey in Nashville and writer John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-explosion-investigation-prompts-fbi-to-search-home/story-e7cHJrVRwCDSpejNBLkvgP.html

The syringe-shaped route showed up on internet site flightradar24.“There are still relatively many people opposing the vaccination and my action may be a reminder for them to think about the topic, to get things moving”, Kramer told Reuters TV on Sunday, adding that his flight should not be understood as a direct call to be inoculated.“Perhaps it was also a bit of a sign of joy, because the aviation industry has been hit pretty hard by the pandemic”, Kramer said.Germany officially kicked off its Covid-19 vaccination campaign on Sunday. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million vaccine doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-pilot-makes-point-with-syringe-shaped-route-in-the-sky/story-a5Ws1hOog98MGQsaHtcwOK.html

27-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has ‘winning formula’: chief executive Pascal Soriot||The Covid-19 vaccine developed by the British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has achieved a “winning formula” for efficacy, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday.The vaccine, currently being evaluated by Britain’s independent medicines regulator, provides “100 percent protection” against severe Covid disease requiring hospitalisation, Pascal Soriot said in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.He added he believes trials will show his firm has achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,” the chief executive said, while saying only that data would be published at “some point”.The UK government announced on December 23 that the developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had submitted their data to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Approval is expected to be granted Monday to roll out the jab, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus shot to be authorised for use by the UK’s independent medicines regulator and has been given to 600,000 of the country’s most vulnerable people since last month. Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot’s efficacy. The vaccine intially showed an average 70 percent effectiveness but that level jumped to 90 percent depending on dosage.- ‘Storm’ over data -Behind this average figure from large-scale trials in the UK and Brazil was a 62 percent effectiveness for those who were vaccinated with two full doses of the shot.For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy.Soriot said he was “surprised” by the initial findings. “We would have preferred a simpler set of results,” he added.The lack of clarity and transparency over the discrepancy in the results was widely criticised. Soriot said he had not expected the pushback that followed.“We assumed people would be a bit disappointed, that’s for sure,” he said. “But we didn’t expect that storm”.Great hopes have been placed in the AstraZeneca shot, originally based on a weakened version of a chimpanzee virus, because of its low cost.AstraZeneca’s vaccine also enjoys a logistical advantage over the Pfizer-BioNTech alternative, as it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least six months.That is a far cry from the -70C needed for Pfizer/BioNTech’s offering and could allow use of the existing refrigerated supply chain to cut costs.- ‘Light at the end of the tunnel’ -In a vote of confidence for its homegrown vaccine, the bulk of Britain’s requirements are expected to be met by the jab.The government has ordered 100 million doses, with 40 million doses scheduled to be available by the end of March.UK officials will hope that confidence is rewarded, not least because the country has been one of the countries most affected by the pandemic with more than 70,000 deaths.A surge in cases has hit nationwide over the past week, falling especially on the southeast of England and blamed on a new strain of the virus believed to be more infectious, which was first identified in the UK.According to one British study the strain is 50 percent to 74 percent more contagious.In an effort to contain the spread of the disease, millions across Britain were placed under tougher lockdown restrictions that came into force on 26 December.Dozens of countries have also imposed travel restrictions on the UK to stop the spread of the new strain.Writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged it had been “a tough year for everyone in this country”. However, he added that “the early roll-out of vaccines - and the incredible work of our scientists and NHS - means we can now see light at the end of the tunnel”.Nearly 200 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be made before the end of the year, the UK drug manufacturer has said, and more than 700 million globally by the end of March next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-has-winning-formula-chief-executive-pascal-soriot/story-jtejjzFsI1XQXlu9YhSJjN.html
27-12-2020||World||UK vaccines could end Covid-19 lockdowns from February: Mail||Lockdowns in the UK could finish by the end of February once a group of up to 15 million vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Mail on Sunday reported, citing government sources.The country’s health service would no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases once that threshold is met, the newspaper said. The UK became the first country in Western Europe to begin vaccinations, when it started using the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE shot on Dec. 8. More than 600,000 people have been vaccinated through Dec. 20.The country has been one of the hardest hit in Europe with more than 70,000 deaths, the most in the region after Italy. Much of the UK has been moved into the harshest Tier 4 restrictions, which prohibit household mixing and forced the closing of pubs, restaurants and many businesses after the discovery earlier this month of a more contagious strain of the virus.The vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc will be rolled out across the UK starting Jan. 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing plans that ministers are drawing up. The government is hoping that 2 million people will get their first dose of one of the vaccines within two weeks of the roll-out of the AstraZeneca shot, the paper said.The Sun newspaper reported that regulators will approve the vaccine as early as Dec. 28. Responding to the report, a Health Department spokesperson said by email that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency will need time to carry out a review of the vaccine data.The Telegraph also reported that mass vaccination centers at sports stadiums and conference venues are expected to launch in the second week of January. The Oxford vaccine is easier to store and handle than the one from Pfizer, making it easier to reach people in secluded parts of the country.The newspaper said that government officials are preparing to hold a crucial meeting on the pandemic Monday after scientists warned that school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the new Covid-19 variant.The rate at which the virus is increasing, known as the R number, is estimated at 1.1 to 1.3 as of Dec.24, according to the latest government data. A reading above 1.0 indicates the spread of the virus is accelerating. The UK reported 34,693 more cases and 210 deaths on Dec. 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vaccines-could-end-covid-19-lockdowns-from-february-mail/story-DVqjjHqOScvr0GMP5htgaL.html

All travellers must submit to a seven-day quarantine and take another test on the eighth day after their arrival.Countries across the Middle East shuttered borders on December 21 because the new strain is said to be faster-spreading.

27-12-2020||World||Thai hospital asked to stop advertising offer to sell Covid-19 vaccines||A private Thai hospital was ordered on Sunday to stop advertising Covid-19 vaccinations for sale in advance on the grounds that no vaccine is yet approved in Thailand.Vibhavadi Hospital told Reuters its online offer for 1,000 initial reservations for the two-dose Moderna vaccine had been the result of a misunderstanding. With reservations priced at 4,000 baht, the total cost of getting vaccinated would have been 10,000 baht ($330).As the first governments begin vaccine rollouts around the world, questions have been raised over how the limited supplies are prioritised and whether people will be able to pay to jump the queue.The Ministry of Health said in a statement that no Covid-19 vaccine had been approved for use in Thailand yet and that advertising one violated hospital regulations.“The removal of the advertisement was ordered,” it said.Chaisit Kupwiwat, a director at Vibhavadi Hospital, told Reuters: “There was a misunderstanding and so we’ve stopped the programme... We planned to order the vaccines, but now we’ve stopped.”The hospital had sought reservations by January 31 for vaccinations later in 2021.Moderna did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment on any such sale.Thailand has signed an advance deal for AstraZeneca’s potential Covid-19 vaccine, but has not set rollout plans for any vaccine yet.Moderna’s vaccine this month became the second to get emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration after the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.Moderna has said it will deliver approximately 20 million doses to the US government this year and is expected to have between 100 million and 125 million delivered globally in the first quarter of 2021.In August, Moderna said it was pricing its vaccine at $32 to $37 per dose for smaller deals.Thailand is a major hub for medical tourism, drawing patients from Asia, the Middle East and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-hospital-asked-to-stop-advertising-offer-to-sell-covid-19-vaccines/story-2E16oKgDzsCiIi9xzGL0ZI.html
27-12-2020||World||Singapore expert committee backs use of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine||A group of top Singapore health experts backed the government’s move to approve the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus vaccine after it conducted an independent review of clinical data on its safety and efficacy.The vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy rate of 95% and its safety profile is consistent with the high standards set for other registered vaccines used in immunization against other diseases, the committee of experts said in a statement issued by the health ministry on Sunday. It is suitable for use for those aged 16 and above, and is expecting further trial data on other groups, such as pregnant women, the committee said.Singapore should prioritize healthcare workers, the elderly and individuals with chronic health illness given the limited supply, the experts said. The committee, made up of individuals from the city-state’s public universities, government ministries and research centres, was formed in October to give recommendations on Singapore’s vaccination strategy.Those aged 70 and above should be first in line as they are more vulnerable to severe health complications when infected, followed by individuals over 60 years old, according to the statement.The committee also recommended that about 5% of available vaccine stocks at any given point in time be set aside for specific groups of people who work in essential services, such as water and utilities, to ensure that the country can function effectively in case of an outbreak.Recommendations made by the committee marks another step for Singapore’s vaccination strategy. The first batch of Pfizer and BioNTech shots arrived last week. The Southeast Asian nation has set aside more than S$1 billion ($750 million) for vaccines and said there should be enough for its population of about 5.5 million people by the third quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-expert-committee-backs-use-of-pfizer-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine/story-iyrFZ1rVgW0W5jZmBFO7KO.html
27-12-2020||World||EU nations clear Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, begin inoculation||European Union countries began vaccinating against Covid-19 as members of the 27-nation bloc struggle with a rising number of people killed by the virus.The coordinated rollout launched on Sunday is getting underway less than a week after the EU cleared a shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Several European countries, including Germany, have imposed tougher restrictions in an effort to contain a winter surge in infections and deaths.It will take months to inoculate enough people to have an impact on the spread of the disease, but the sense of urgency has grown after neighboring Britain locked down parts of the country, blaming a faster-spreading strain.“Once enough people have been vaccinated, we can start traveling, meeting our friends and family again and have normal holidays, which we all long for,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday in a video message.The head of the EU’s executive arm was marking what she called “Delivery Day,” when doses of the vaccine were distributed around the continent. She emphasized that immunization will be a gradual process and caution is still needed.“We have to continue being careful,” she said. “We have to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Europe is starting the campaign to inoculate its 450 million citizens weeks after the UK and US began their own vaccination programs. More than 600,000 people in Britain and nearly 2 million in the US have received their first shot of the standard two-dose regimen, according to data collected by Bloomberg.Despite the agreed EU rollout date, some nations, including Germany and Hungary, already began administering vaccines on Saturday, local media reported.In the eastern German city of Halberstadt, a 101-year-old woman and around 40 others in a care home for the elderly were inoculated, according to DPA. “Every day we wait is a day too many,” the news agency quoted the head of the home, Tobias Krueger, as saying.Italy and Portugal began their vaccination campaigns Sunday by inoculating health-care workers, while in Denmark and Sweden, residents at elderly care centers received the first shots. Greece’s President Aikaterini Sakellaropoulou and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis are scheduled to be vaccinated later in the day, after the country gave the first vaccine to an intensive-care unit nurse.The start of the EU’s vaccination campaign comes amid an effort to contain the mutant virus strain that the UK government said is spreading more easily.While that’s spurred concern that testing, treatments and shots might not be as effective, officials at BioNTech and the European medicines regulator said they’re optimistic the vaccine will work against the new strain. The variant has appeared in countries including Germany, Japan, Australia, Singapore and Italy.The EU has ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on behalf of member states, with an option to obtain 100 million more, and the goal is to provide access to all countries at the same time on the basis of population size. Supplies will be limited in the early days, although another vaccine may soon help bolster availability.The rollout will unfold gradually. The EU may have enough vaccine for two-thirds of its population in the middle of September, three months behind the US, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-clear-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-begin-inoculation/story-yDb58U1LFh2JsHu8ckWlzO.html
27-12-2020||World||Syrian refugee camp burnt to ground in northern Lebanon||More than 300 Syrian refugees were forced to flee an informal camp in northern Lebanon as a blaze raged through and burnt tents to the ground, UN and Lebanese officials said Sunday.The fire late Saturday raged for four hours as firefighters tried to put it out, the Lebanese civil defense said.The fire ensued following a fight between a Lebanese family in al-Miniyeh in the country’s north and Syrians living in the camp, according to Lebanese media reports.A Lebanese official said the army is investigating the cause of the fire and conducting raids to round up those responsible for the altercation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because an official statement has not yet been released.Khaled Kabbara, a UN Refugee Agency spokesman in northern Lebanon, said some 375 people lived in the informal settlement that was located on a plot of rented land. He said the entire camp was burnt to the ground.Kabbara said four people were injured in the fire and hospitalized with minor injuries. He said some residents of the camp returned Sunday to see if anything could be salvaged from the fire.Most of the refugees have sought refuge in other nearby informal settlements. Some from the local community have also offered shelter, Kabbara said.Kabbara said altercations between residents and Syrian refugees often “catastrophically impact the community as a whole.”Tensions are common in Lebanon between citizens and Syrian refugees who have fled the war in their country. Lebanon is host to more than 1 million refugees, nearly a quarter of the country’s population of 5 million, burdening the country’s already crumbling infrastructure.Tensions between Lebanese and Syrians also dates back to the days when Syria dominated its smaller neighbor for almost three decades with thousands of troops stationed in Lebanon. They withdrew in 2005 following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which sparked massive anti-Syrian protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-refugee-camp-burnt-to-ground-in-northern-lebanon/story-aNcss6ZlMRw8MPLbYtqMHL.html
27-12-2020||World||Israel enters third nationwide lockdown||Israel was set Sunday to begin its third coronavirus lockdown, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced optimism that a “world record” vaccination drive will restore a degree of normality within weeks.After a sharp rebound in detected infections, Netanyahu’s government announced three days ago that it would re-impose the strict measures that had previously helped limit transmission. From 5:00pm (1500 GMT) on Sunday, most people will be forced to stay within 1,000 metres of their home. There are a range of exceptions, including seeking medical care, attending legal proceedings or exercising. A key difference in Israel’s third lockdown compared to previous versions relates to schools, with more students able to attend classes. Instead of near total closures, Israel is keeping schools open for children under six, as well as grades one to four and teenagers finishing secondary school in grades 11 and 12.Israel’s National Council for the Child criticised the decision to close grades five through 10. “The decision to ignore this age bracket means the abandonment of hundreds of thousands of children, only because in theory they can be left at home alone while (their parents) go to work,” NCC head Vered Windman was quoted as saying by the Ma’ariv newspaper. “But this is precisely the age group that is at a higher risk of developing emotional difficulties, fears and isolation.” ‘World record’Speaking late Saturday following Shabbat, Netanyahu said Israel was hoping to vaccinate a quarter of its population, or roughly 2.25 million people, against coronavirus within a month.He said he had spoken with the heads of the companies making vaccines who had voiced confidence that the requisite number of doses could be provided. Israel’s vaccination targets are of “such a magnitude (they amount to) a world record” pace, the prime minister said. Netanyahu was the first Israeli to receive a Covid-19 jab on December 19, ahead of the launch last week of a nationwide innoculation programme.The premier has political incentives to push an accelerated vaccination campaign. The fraught coalition government that he formed in May with his former election rival and current defence minister, Benny Gantz, collapsed last week, triggering elections in March -- Israel’s fourth vote in two years. Netanyahu’s election campaign could be hindered by the start of a more intensified phase of his long-awaited corruption trial and the departure of his staunch ally US President Donald Trump from the White House.Political analysts have said that Netanyahu is hoping a rapid vaccination drive will put Israel’s pandemic-wracked economy on a path to recovery before election day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-enters-third-nationwide-lockdown/story-4Q2Y6E73R3bSKFx2iUsx1H.html

That’s a welcome relief, and gives companies greater scope to focus on containing the damage from the coronavirus pandemic.The divorce will still create significant disruption for a range of industries. Mutual recognition of standards, which would have allowed firms to make products in the UK and market them in the EU without any extra certification process, isn’t part of the deal. Likewise, workers in Britain’s services industry -- which makes up 80% of its economy -- face new costs and bureaucracy as their professional qualifications will no longer be automatically recognized in the EU.The deal also requires extra customs paperwork and checks at the EU border. The queues of trucks that formed around Dover, Britain’s busiest port, after France blocked incoming traffic has given Britons a taste of the disorder that could be in store.With the full text of the agreement being published only days before it comes into force, a chorus of business voices has pleaded for a grace period to comply with the changes.Here is a look at what a Brexit deal means for a variety of industries.AutomotiveUK auto manufacturers generated about 79 billion pounds ($107 billion) in sales last year and employed about 180,000 people. Carmakers now must decide whether to move forward with investment in new models and production capacity that had been put on hold for years.Vauxhall, owned by France’s PSA Group, had been holding out for more clarity on Brexit before deciding whether to approve further investment in its plant in Ellesmere Port. For others, the delays to the deal have already taken a toll -- Nissan Motor Co. has decided against producing an electric model in northern England.The deal is good news because it mostly avoids tariffs and gives electric-car makers sufficient time to phase in the new requirements, raising the chance that PSA will further invest in Vauxhall, said David Bailey, a business economics professor at Birmingham Business School.Here are the key requirements for rules of origin, which determine what percentage of the value of a car’s components need to be sourced locally to qualify for tariff-free trade:The terms for electric and hybrid cars are more lenient because the region is still in the early stages of localizing battery production. However, the 40% local content requirement for EVs and hybrids may be difficult to meet for companies that source parts mainly in Asia, Bailey said.ManufacturingProducers are responsible for about 10% of UK gross domestic product, and have been spared the threat of new tariffs. But they face a raft of paperwork and new standards regulations which could create substantial pressure across the country on its first day outside the single market and customs union.On standards, there is no mutual recognition of conformity assessments in the deal, meaning manufacturers will have to get their products approved separately by regulators in both markets. They may also have to run two separate production processes if UK and EU specifications differ, adding costs.And at the border, the prospect of trucks turning up without the correct post-Brexit forms raises worries about serious traffic snarls. For example, as many as 10,000 trucks per day carrying everything from German car parts to Spanish lettuces, as well as UK exports to Europe, pass through Dover. This key port on the south-east coast has warned of 17-mile (27-kilometer) lines of vehicles on both sides of the English Channel if its average customs clearing is slowed by just two minutes.Disruption is a nightmare for manufacturers because their years of investment into digitizing their operations have left them reliant on just-in-time supply chains. This helps them avoid the expense of stockpiles, but means that any delays in shipments spell trouble for the entire production process and the whole industry.RetailThe thorny issue of tariffs had been British retailers’ biggest concern as higher import costs in a low-margin sector would have had to be passed on to consumers during a recession. This was particularly important for supermarket chains such as Tesco Plc and J Sainsbury Plc as the UK produces only about half the food it consumes, and the vast majority of imported food comes from the EU.British wine merchants will be relieved that wine traveling between the UK and EU will require only simplified paperwork. In a no-deal scenario wines from the EU would have required expensive laboratory tests and other documentation, adding costs.However, retailers still face a raft of new non-tariff barriers stemming from costs and staffing needed to manage extra customs paperwork which, in time, could filter down to the prices paid by shoppers at checkouts. Any upheaval could aggravate the impact the pandemic has had on consumer spending. The timing may mean additional pain -- January is normally a dire month for retailers given that consumers usually pull back spending after their surge of shopping for Christmas.DrugsThe pharmaceutical industry has long called for a mutual recognition agreement to protect the sector from unnecessary duplication and cost. The deal has achieved this at least in part, with inspections of drug manufacturing facilities to be valid in both regions.However, the text doesn’t mention another industry request -- mutual recognition of batch testing. This suggests UK safety tests on medicines may need to be conducted again before they can be sold in the EU, which would add time and cost burdens.The pharmaceutical sector, like others, will also have to get to grips with customs and border checks. Coronavirus has given the issue extra weight and highlighted the need for the smooth passage of drugs and vaccines –- about 45 million packs of medicines move from the UK to the EU every month, with 37 million going the other way.The UK and EU have agreed to a one-year phase-in period for implementing regulation in Northern Ireland to give companies time to prepare to adjust packaging and distribution routes.AerospaceThis heavily regulated industry contributes 20 billion pounds a year to the UK economy, and has long dealt with standards where the slightest change in a design or machine used to make an aircraft component can spark a safety reassessment. The Brexit agreement includes an accord on safety that maps out an approach based on mutual recognition and cooperation. This is essential as some parts criss-cross the English Channel multiple times during the process of building a plane. Companies like Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc know that any major break with the status quo risks substantial disruption.After year-end, the UK will oversee its own aircraft safety regime. That means handing the responsibility to the Civil Aviation Authority for the first time in decades. There’s a question of whether it will be able to take on so much work quickly enough to avoid disruption.AirlinesBoth sides agreed to explore a liberalization of rules that limit the operations of airlines outside of the territory where their ownership is based. Before the split, UK shareholders counted toward EU ownership requirements, but now they don’t. This threatens the rights of airlines like IAG SA and EasyJet Plc to operate within the bloc.IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, is incorporated in Spain but has significant UK, US and Qatari ownership. EasyJet has had difficulty keeping its EU share of ownership above the required 50% threshold. Both have said they’ll address their shareholder structure, but under the current set-up their status as EU-controlled could be tested. Future changes to the rules could help insulate them from challenges. The UK and EU have agreed to consider making changes to the rules within 12 months.TruckingHauliers face new restrictions when moving goods between the UK and the EU. Previously, UK drivers could do unlimited trips between EU countries, and as many as three deliveries within a single country in the bloc. An extra delivery within a country is known as a “cabotage” trip.Now, British operators can only do two extra journeys when they move goods to the EU, and can only make one cabotage trip.The restrictions are a major blow to the UK concert industry, which has relied on being able to move instruments and sound equipment on multiple trips between European countries without having to return to Britain.ChemicalsThis is the UK’s biggest manufacturing export sector, with annual turnover of about 31.5 billion pounds. While the deal document contains signals that cooperation will continue, Britain’s access to a full spectrum of chemicals may still be at risk.Chemical makers have yet to be told how aligned the UK’s new standalone regulatory framework will be with Europe’s Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals regime, considered the gold standard for the safety and control of more than 22,000 substances and fluids that are key in industries from aerospace to electronics. Based on a “one substance, one registration” principle, it’s taken companies years of investment to put together all the dossiers containing data on the properties and hazards of each chemical required by REACH.The Brexit agreement includes a commitment to cooperate on sharing this data. However, the lack of a firm arrangement means companies may yet face having to repeat the time- and money-consuming process of repeating all that paperwork to operate in both markets.If ensuing talks fail to achieve regulatory alignment, the industry could face a 1 billion-pound bill to repeat all the safety documentation, according to Neil Hollis, BASF SE’s regulatory affairs manager.ServicesServices make up 80% of the UK economy and comprise a breadth of activities including IT, law, accountancy, insurance, consulting and architecture.The EU is Britain’s largest export market for services, so the lack of automatic recognition for professional qualifications is a setback. It means firms will have to jump through extra bureaucratic hoops to have the right to provide services in an EU member state.Short-term business travel between the UK and EU will continue unimpeded, but UK business visitors will only be able to travel to the EU for 90 days in any 180-day period.DataMovement of data generates 174 billion pounds of value in the UK, according to the Confederation of British Industry, but the legal framework for this activity was in doubt because Britain is about to exit the EU’s data protection regime. The Brexit deal provides an interim solution that protects current data flows until a separate legal agreement is reached.The temporary accord saves thousands of businesses from having to find alternative certifications before Jan. 1 to continue transfers, and postpones the risk of fines for violating the bloc’s strict privacy laws. This is a relief for any business which transfers data across the frontier from big tech platforms to airlines to banks.EU officials said a so-called data adequacy decision, which would certify that UK data protection standards are comparable to the bloc’s, could be made in early 2021. Until then, the bridge offered by the Brexit deal leaves the existing rules place for as many as six months after Dec. 31.AgricultureBritish farmers welcomed the deal on tariffs, which will help products from barley to lamb remain competitive in the EU, the destination for more than 60% of the nation’s agricultural exports.Still, even with the deal, there will be trade friction and the National Farmers Union called on the government to ensure cargoes of perishable foods aren’t left “languishing in queues at the border” in the new year. The British Meat Processors Association has also lamented that fresh-meat shipments won’t be prioritized in queues at the border, which may require traders to switch to trading lower-value frozen supply instead.FishingA totemic sector for the campaign to leave the EU, despite its tiny contribution to UK GDP, the fishing industry is not happy with the agreement struck with the bloc and accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of selling out coastal communities to get a deal.Under the agreement, 25% of EU rights to catch fish in UK waters will be transferred to British boats over 5 1/2 years, much less than London’s demand for an 80% cut. After the phasing-in period, there will be annual negotiations over allocations, with each side able to use tariffs in retaliation if they disagree. The UK says they should be proportionate and limited to fish.“Throughout the fishing industry there is a profound sense of disillusionment, betrayal, and fury that after all the rhetoric, promises and assurances, the Government caved-in on fish,” the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said in a statement. “Some of the bellwether stocks tell the story most vividly, After a further five years adjustment period, the UK’s share of Channel cod will have increased from 9.3% to 10.2%.”David Henig, UK director of the European Centre for the International Political Economy think tank, said the industry had lost out in the trade-off in the final days of the talks.“In the end for the UK it seems the fear of losing car manufacturing, coupled with fear of border chaos, were a higher priority than fish or the level playing field,” he wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “This meant that the UK settled on other issues such as fish without any reward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-deal-hands-business-a-mix-of-relief-unwanted-change/story-a73kLkXn0lsxyzWUszfAsL.html
27-12-2020||World||Merkel supplanted by Spahn as Germany’s most popular politician||German Health Minister Jens Spahn has taken over from Chancellor Angela Merkel as the nation’s most popular politician, a poll showed Sunday, highlighting his potential as a future leader of Europe’s biggest economy.Spahn, 40, has long been considered a rising star in Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, and is widely perceived to have made a key contribution to Germany’s relatively successful handling of the coronavirus pandemic.According to the Kantar poll in Bild newspaper, 52% of those surveyed said Spahn should play a major role in German politics in 2021, up from 28% at the end of 2019. Merkel’s approval rating was 51%, up 11 percentage points from the previous year.“Spahn is clearly the winner of the year,” Bild quoted Kantar’s Torsten Schneider-Haase as saying. “From the point of view of the people, he is cutting a positive figure on coronavirus policy.”Merkel is stepping down following the next election due in September 2021 after more than a decade and a half in power. The CDU will elect a new leader and probable chancellor candidate at a virtual congress next month.Spahn has backed Armin Laschet, the premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, while Friedrich Merz, a long-time Merkel rival, and Norbert Roettgen, a former environment minister, are also running.The winner will likely be the conservative bloc’s candidate to succeed Merkel next year, though Bavaria Premier Markus Soeder, head of the CDU’s sister party in the southern state, may be asked to step in.Soeder is the third-most popular politician on 50%, the Kantar poll showed. Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrats’ chancellor candidate, was fourth on 47%, Merz scored 37% in sixth place, Laschet 31% in eighth and Roettgen 29% in ninth.While Spahn has thrown his support behind Laschet, there is an outside chance he could be tapped to run as the conservative candidate for chancellor if he is seen as having the best chance of winning the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-supplanted-by-spahn-as-germany-s-most-popular-politician/story-MGoGWo1M0cogUlnvHZRTWJ.html
27-12-2020||World||Daniel Pearl murder: Sindh govt halts release of Omar Saeed Sheikh, 3 others||Pakistan’s Sindh province government has decided not to release British-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides, accused of kidnapping and murdering US journalist Daniel Pearl, in view of a Supreme Court order, according to a media report.In a surprise move, a two-judge bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday directed security agencies not to keep Sheikh and other accused under “any sort of detention” and declared all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention “null and void”. The court observed that the four men’s detention was “illegal”.The court, however, had clarified that the accused should not be released if there is a Supreme Court restraining order regarding their detention.Citing its sources, the Express Tribune newspaper said that the provincial government will not release these men in view of the Supreme Court’s September 28 order.The Pakistan People’s Party-led Sindh government believes that the apex court’s September 28 order in the case is still in the field, the sources told the daily.A three-judge apex court bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam, which is hearing the appeal by the Sindh government and the family of the slain journalist against the acquittal of Sheikh by the Sindh High Court in April, on September 28 noted that till the next date of hearing, the accused shall not be released.A senior government official said the apex court order has not been specifically recalled.“The SHC in its December 24 order also clarified that accused should not be released if there is a Supreme Court restraining order regarding their detention,” he added.The sources said the Sindh government will also challenge the SHC’s December 24 order in the apex court on Monday.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.However, the Sindh government refused to release them and kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order.Their continuous detention was challenged in the Sindh High Court, which ordered their release on Thursday.On Friday, the United States expressed “deep concern” over the order to release Sheikh and his aides and said it will continue to monitor any developments in the case.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time,” the US State Department said in a tweet.It said that the US will continue to monitor any developments in the case and will continue to support the Pearl family “through this extremely difficult process” while honouring the legacy of Pearl as a “courageous journalist”.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - condemned the decision made by the Sindh High court and expressed full confidence in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to provide justice for their son and reinforce the paramount of the freedom of the press, the Express Tribune reported.“We refuse to believe that the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people will let such a travesty of justice tarnish the image and legacy of Pakistan,” they said in a statement.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.Pearl’s murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.

27-12-2020||World||2018 Chinese consulate attack: Pak court asks cops to approach Interpol to track Baloch leader||Pakistan Anti-terrorism Court (ATC) has ordered police to approach Interpol for the arrest of Balochistan leader Hyrbyair Marri in regard to the case pertaining to the 2018 attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi, The News International reported.Three gunmen belonging to Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) allegedly led by Hyrbyair who is living in exile had carried out an attack on the Chinese consulate located in the high-security zone in Clifton Block-4 on November 23, 2018.The attackers, later identified as Abdul Razzaq, Raees Baloch and Azal Baloch, were also killed in a gun-and-grenade fight with police. A large number of weapons, ammunition and explosives were found on the attackers.The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested five suspects, Ahmed Hasnain, Muhammad Aslam, Nadir Khan, Ali Ahmed and Abdul Latif, for allegedly providing tactical, logistics and artillery support to the attackers. They have been charge-sheeted in the case.Besides them, police also booked Hyrbyair, Kareem Marri, Bashir Zaib, Aslam Baloch, Noor Bakhsh Mengal, Rehman Gul, Nisar, Gaindi, Sheikhu Sharif, Hamal, Agha Sher Dil and Munshi, all of whom have been declared proclaimed offenders in the case.Hyrbyair is the Baloch nationalist activist from the Pakistani province of Balochistan. He is the fifth son of the Baloch nationalist leader Khair Bakhsh Marri. As of 2017, he resides in London.The ATC-VII judge also issued perpetual warrants of arrest for the proclaimed offenders and ordered the police to write a letter to the interior ministry to seek international police organisation Interpol’s assistance to arrest them.The judge also ordered the confiscation of all the moveable and immoveable properties belonging to the absconders and directed the investigation officer to issue their sketches to seek public help in tracing their whereabouts.On November 23 2018, an explosion and gunshot were heard near the Chinese consulate in Karachi’s Clifton area in the morning, around 9:25 am.Three men possessing hand grenades and other weapons fired near the Chinese consulate in Clifton Block 4, according to eyewitnesses.Two policemen were killed and a security guard got injured after three gunmen tried to enter the consulate around 9:30 am.Nine hand grenades, Kalashnikov bullets, magazines, and explosives were recovered from the possession of the terrorists, Karachi police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2018-chinese-consulate-attack-pak-court-asks-cops-to-approach-interpol-to-track-baloch-leader/story-idULBZcnXualdgdfNMc9MO.html
27-12-2020||World||Covid-19: December deadliest month in US, January projections more worrisome||While the United States rolled out two vaccines in December to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the month has been the deadliest for the country since the pandemic started. Over 63,000 people living in the United States have lost their lives to the infection in the past 26 days, an extreme surge in Covid-19 related deaths when compared to November, a month that recorded another grim tally of around 37,000 deaths. The projections for the next two months are even more worrisome as another possible surge stemming from Christmas and New Year gatherings could worsen the situation. According to the predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), the daily death toll could peak around mid-January and another 193,000 people could lose their lives over the next two months.The IMHE suggests that daily deaths are the best indicator of the progression of the pandemic, although there is generally a 17-21 day lag between infection and deaths. The United States has, so far, reported nearly 332,000 Covid-19 related deaths, highest in the world, and based on the current projection scenario, the country will witness a total of over 567,000 deaths by April 1, 2021. Also Read | India’s role vital in equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally: Pharma industryDr Leana Wen, an emergency physician, told CNN that the individuals travelling during the holidays will be most probably visiting their family and friends and having dinner without wearing masks. “I just really worry about this surge that we’re going to see and how quickly we’re going to surpass that 400,000 deaths number,” Wen was quoted as saying the US media network.However, the immunisation drive using Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has emerged as a sigh of relief for the health authorities and Americans in general. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced new testing requirements for inbound travellers from the United Kingdom amid concerns over new variants of SARS-CoV-2 causing rapid spread of Covid-19. The US health agency said that the air passengers arriving from the UK would require to show a negative Covid-19 test result obtained within 72 hours before the departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-december-deadliest-month-in-us-january-projections-more-worrisome/story-itc7xDDT3U8an91sKkwfqK.html
27-12-2020||World||Wars, instability pose vaccine challenges in poor nations||Arifullah Khan had just administered another polio vaccine when the gunfire blasted from the nearby hills.“It happened so suddenly. There was so much gunfire it felt like an explosion,” he said, recalling details of the attack five years ago in Pakistan’s Bajaur tribal region near the Afghan border.A bullet shattered his thigh and he fell to the ground. His childhood friend and partner in the vaccination campaign, Ruhollah, lay bleeding on the ground in front of him.“I couldn’t move,” Khan said. “I watched him lying right in front of me as he took his last breath.”In Pakistan, delivering vaccines can be deadly. Militants and radical religious groups spread claims that the polio vaccine is a Western ploy to sterilize Muslim children or turn them away from religion. More than 100 health workers, vaccinators and security officials involved in polio vaccination have been killed since 2012.The violence is an extreme example of the difficulties many poor and developing countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America face as they tackle the monumental task of vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.It’s not just the problem of affording vaccines or being at the back of the line behind wealthy countries in receiving them.Poor infrastructure often means roads are treacherous and electricity is sporadic for the refrigerators vital to preserving vaccines. Wars and insurgencies endanger vaccinators. Corruption can siphon away funds, and vaccination campaign planners must sometimes navigate through multiple armed factions.“The most challenging areas ... are conflict settings, where outbreaks of violence hinder vaccinations, and areas where misinformation is circulating, which discourages community participation, said UNICEF’s deputy chief of global immunization, Benjamin Schreiber.Many nations are relying on COVAX, an international system aimed at ensuring equitable access to vaccines, though it is already short on funding.UNICEF, which runs immunization programs worldwide, is gearing up to help procure and administer Covid-19 vaccines, Schreiber told The Associated Press. It has stockpiled half a billion syringes and aims to provide 70,000 refrigerators, mostly solar powered, he said.The agency aims to transport 850 tons of Covid-19 vaccines a month next year, double its usual annual monthly rate for other vaccines, UNICEF’s executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.The situation can vary widely from country to country.Mexico is expected to start immunizations soon. The military will handle distribution, and the government has promised free vaccines for Mexico’s nearly 130 million inhabitants by the end of 2021.Meanwhile, Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, has yet to announce any vaccination plans. Health experts worry that widespread rumors could set back vaccinations — including claims that hospitals will give fatal injections to inflate Covid-19 death figures and receive more foreign aid.The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading a continent-wide effort to vaccinate Africa’s 1.3 billion people in 54 countries. The agency is coordinating efforts to obtain doses and seeking World Bank help in funding — estimating it will take $10 billion to acquire, distribute and administer the vaccines.The aim is to vaccinate 60% of Africa’s population within two years — some 700 million people — more than the continent has done in the past, said John Nkengasong, director of the African CDC.“The time for action is now,” said Nkengasong. “The West cannot defeat Covid-19 alone. It must be defeated by all over the world, and that includes Africa.”Congo underscores the obstacles the campaign faces.The country has overcome Ebola outbreaks with vaccination campaigns. But it struggled in eastern Congo, where Allied Democratic Forces rebels stage frequent attacks and other armed groups vie for control of mineral riches.Rough terrain and insecurity meant vaccinators had trouble getting to all areas. Some came under attack.Rumors flew about the Ebola vaccines, including the idea they were meant to kill people, said Dr. Maurice Kakule, an Ebola survivor who worked in vaccination campaigns. Education programs overcame much of the resistance, but similar suspicions are spreading about the Covid-19 vaccine, he said.In Beni, the area’s main city, Danny Momoti, a trader, said he would take the vaccine because of his work. “I need this Covid-19 vaccination card to be accepted in Dubai and elsewhere where I go to buy the goods for Beni,” he said.Civil wars present perhaps the greatest obstacles.In Yemen, the health system has collapsed under six years of war between Houthi rebels who control the north and government-allied factions in the south.Yemen saw its first outbreak of polio in 15 years this summer, centered in the northern province of Saada. Vaccinators haven’t been able to work there the past two years, in part because of security fears, UNICEF said. Agencies rushed to give new inoculations in parts of the north and south in November and December.Cholera and diphtheria have been rampant, and once again, Yemen faces a new surge in hunger. UN officials have warned of potential famine in 2021.No plans for Covid-19 vaccinations have been announced yet, whether by the Houthis, southern authorities or WHO and UNICEF.Only half of Yemen’s health facilities remain functional. Roads, power networks and other infrastructure have been devastated. The Houthis have hampered some programs, trying to wrest concessions from UN agencies, including blocking a shipment of cholera vaccines amid a 2017 outbreak.“Even the mildest and normally preventable diseases can prove fatal due to a lack of health care access in a conflict setting,” said Wasim Bahja, the Yemen country director for International Medical Corps.In Pakistan, public distrust was fueled when the CIA in 2011 used a scam vaccination program to identify the hideout of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, leading to the special forces raid that killed him.Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only countries in the world where polio is still endemic. There have been 82 new polio cases this year alone, largely because vaccinations were suspended due to the pandemic, said Dr. Rana Safdar, who coordinates the polio vaccination campaigns.The Bajaur region, where Khan was shot, remains one of the more dangerous areas, Safdar said.Khan tried to explain the deep mistrust in his region. Deeply conservative tribal elders “believe the vaccine is the reason the young people who were given it as children are disrespectful and show little concern for Islamic traditions and values.”“Everyone is scared” of Covid-19, he said. “But they are suspicious of Western things.”Khan said he signed up to administer polio vaccines because he was paid the equivalent of $56 for just a few days’ work. “I needed to feed my family.”He will likely sign up to deliver Covid-19 vaccines as well.“But first I would check if there is any danger there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wars-instability-pose-vaccine-challenges-in-poor-nations/story-ctWdCXVMSZo3sl3sZQiWTJ.html

It has reported 70,909 deaths, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth highest in the world.The vaccine will be free of charge and health workers and elderly people will be the first to be offered the voluntary inoculation.Hungary and Slovakia began their vaccination campaigns on Saturday with other European Union countries joining Italy in rolling out the shots from Sunday, as the pandemic surges across the continent.Around 9,750 doses have already arrived in Italy and another 470,000 are expected to arrive from next week, the health ministry said.“Today is a symbolic day which must give the idea of the beauty of Europe that has bought the vaccines for everybody and distributed them,” Commissioner Arcuri said.To aid the roll out of the vaccine, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will pop up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-kicks-off-vaccinations-against-covid-19-in-rome/story-TPjxg6MmhE7aBdUbn0tJZI.html

27-12-2020||World||At least 7 killed in knife attack in northeastern China||At least seven people were killed and another seven injured in a knife attack in northeastern China, state media reported Sunday.The attack in the city of Kaiyuan in Liaoning province was carried out outside a sauna and bathhouse. The suspect, identified by the media by his surname Yang, was arrested while the motive for the attack remains unknown.Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are generally carried out with knives or homemade explosives.Perpetrators of similar attacks in the past have been described as mentally ill or bearing grudges against society.In earlier attacks, a school security guard wielding a knife injured at least 39 people at a kindergarten in the southern region of Guangxi in June this year. The culprit was sentenced to death.In 2018, a man killed one and injured 12 in a knife attack at a shopping mall in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-7-killed-in-knife-attack-in-northeastern-china/story-9iokGHWZem4v1iwG6HJbAN.html
27-12-2020||World||European Union nations kick off mass Covid-19 vaccinations||European Union nations officially kicked off a coordinated effort Sunday to give Covid-19 vaccinations to some of the most vulnerable among their nearly 450 million people, marking a moment of hope in the continent’s battle against the worst public health crisis in a century.Shots were administered Sunday morning to health care workers, the elderly and some leading politicians to reassure the public that the vaccinations are safe.In Prague, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis received his shot at dawn and asserted: “There’s nothing to worry about.” In Rome, five doctors and nurses wearing white scrubs sat in a semi-circle at Rome’s Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital to receive their doses.“Getting vaccinated is an act of love and responsibility toward the collective whole,” Claudia Alivernini, a 29-year-old Spallanzani nurse, said on the eve of being the first to receive the shot in Italy, which has Europe’s worth virus toll at more than 71,000 dead.Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza, speaking outside the hospital, said the coordinated EU rollout was a sign of hope for the continent, but that people still cannot let down their guard for several months more.“We still have difficult months ahead,” he said. “It’s a beautiful day, but we still need to exercise caution ... this vaccine is the true path to close out this difficult season.”The vaccines, developed by Germany’s BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer, started arriving in super-cold containers at EU hospitals on Friday from a factory in Belgium. The EU has seen some of the world’s earliest and hardest-hit virus hot spots, including Italy and Spain.Others EU countries, like the Czech Republic, were spared the worst early on only to see their health care systems near collapse in the fall.Altogether, the EU’s 27 nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts still agree understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video Saturday celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it “a touching moment of unity.”The campaign should ease frustrations that were building up, especially in Germany, as Britain, Canada and the United States kicked off their inoculation programs with the same vaccine weeks earlier.As it turned out, some EU immunizations began a day early in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The operator of a German nursing home where dozens of people were vaccinated Saturday, including a 101-year-old woman, said “every day that we wait is one day too many.”Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots. Spain, France and Germany, among others, are vowing to put the elderly and residents in nursing homes first.Poland is also prioritizing doctors, nurses and others on the front lines of fighting the virus. The central European nation was largely spared the surge that hit Western Europe in the spring, but has seen high daily infections and deaths this fall.EU leaders are counting on the vaccine rollout to help the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain.“It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” said German Health Minister Jens Spahn. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic ... it is the key to getting our lives back.”Among politicians who plan to get virus shots on Sunday, as a way of promoting a wider acceptance of vaccinations, are Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova and Bulgarian Health Minister Kostadin Angelov.Meanwhile, the first cases of a new virus variant that has been spreading rapidly around London and southern England have now been detected in France and Spain. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused European countries, the United States and China to put new restrictions on travel for people from Britain.The German pharmaceutical company BioNTech is confident that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but said further studies are needed to be completely certain.The European Medicines Agency on Jan. 6 will be considering approving a second coronavirus vaccine, this one by Moderna, which has already been approved for use in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-nations-kick-off-mass-covid-19-vaccinations/story-xkSRbb8pAuIIglE7YEohfK.html

Egypt has seen a sharp increase in the number of officially confirmed coronavirus cases over the past week. The health ministry recorded 1,189 new cases and 43 deaths on Saturday, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 131,315 cases including 7,352 deaths.Health experts and some government officials say the real numbers are likely to be much higher due to the low rate of public PCR testing and the exclusion of private test results from the ministry’s figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-7-killed-in-fire-at-egyptian-hospital-treating-covid-19-patients-reports/story-SkGC2YzUOrCi6LCVj8nZGI.html
27-12-2020||World||New York state probes possibly fradulently obtained coronavirus vaccines||A health care provider in New York may have fraudulently obtained Covid-19 vaccines and diverted them to members of the public in violation of priority guidelines, the state government said on Saturday.New York state police has started a criminal investigation into the matter, which could be the state’s first vaccine distribution-related scandal.The State Department of Health is aware of reports that ParCare Community Health Network, a provider with a clinic in upstate Orange County, “may have fraudulently obtained Covid-19 vaccine, transferred it to facilities in other parts of the state in violation of state guidelines, and diverted it to members of the public,” the state’s health commissioner Howard Zucker said in a statement.ParCare’s website shows it has six locations, including four in Brooklyn, New York, and says its patients are “mainly Orthodox Hasidic Jews, Hispanics, and African Americans.”A hyperlocal Orthodox Jewish news site, BoroPark 24, published a story on Dec. 21, saying ParCare had received a shipment of Moderna Inc.’s vaccines, and showed boxes of the vaccines in what appeared to be a refrigerator. It also had what appeared to be a copy of a ParCare advertisement touting availability of “The Newest Healthcare Revolution!” on a “first come first serve” basis.Gary Schlesinger, chief exeuctive officer of ParCare, was cited saying people who are a “health care worker, are over 60, or have underlying conditions” can register online to get a vaccine.That differs from state guidelines, which allow only frontline health care workers, or staff and residents of nursing homes, to get the first batch of vaccines.“We take this very seriously and DOH will be assisting State Police in a criminal investigation into this matter,” said Zucker in the statement. “Anyone found to have knowingly participated in this scheme will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”Representatives with ParCare didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-state-probes-possibly-fradulently-obtained-coronavirus-vaccines/story-Wmiwqyb5RN2jZacX4B2vaJ.html
27-12-2020||World||China rushes senior official to Nepal amid political uncertainty||After unsuccessful efforts by Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi to effect a patch-up between the warring factions of Nepal’s ruling party, Beijing is rushing a senior Communist party official to Kathmandu in an apparent bid to shore up Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government. Last week, Hou met Oli’s main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, and President Bidya Devi Bhandari to discuss the spilt with the Nepal Communist Party. However, these efforts didn’t have much of an impact on the split within the ruling party and the political crisis affecting Nepal continued to create uncertainty. Beijing has decided to send Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the international department of the central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), to Kathmandu on Sunday in an apparent bid to patch up the differences with the Nepal Communist Party. Guo is leading a four-member team to Nepal for a four-day visit, The Kathmandu Post reported, citing two Nepal Communist Party leaders. Bishnu Rijal, deputy head of the department of foreign affairs of a faction of the Nepal Communist Party led by Prachanda, confirmed the Chinese side had communicated about Gou’s visit to Kathmandu. “I don’t have much detail to share with you at this point of time,” he said. China’s efforts are in marked contrast to the position taken by India on Oli’s decision to dissolve Parliament and call snap elections. New Delhi has said this is an internal matter that should be handled in keeping with Nepal’s democratic processes. The external affairs ministry has said India will continue to support Nepal in moving forward towards peace, prosperity and development.” In response to Oli’s moves, Prachanda has claimed control over the Nepal Communist Party and removed the prime minister from the posts of party parliamentary leader and chair. Oli’s detractors have described his actions as a “constitutional coup”. China has been accused of intervening in Nepal’s politics several times in the past few years. It is believed Beijing played a crucial role in bringing together the parties of Oli and Prachanda to form the Nepal Communist Party in 2018. In May and July this year, Hou held several meetings with the top leaders of the Nepal Communist Party to end infighting between the factions led by Oli and Prachanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rushes-senior-official-to-nepal-amid-political-uncertainty/story-cEpTjeqjBPAgik68Wzv3hM.html
27-12-2020||World||Bangladesh set to move second batch of Rohingya refugees to remote island||Bangladesh is set to move a second batch of Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar to the remote island of Bhasan Char in the Bay of Bengal this month, officials said on Sunday, despite calls by rights groups not to carry out further relocations.Around 1,000 Rohingya refugees, members of a Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar, will be moved to the island in the next few days after Bangladesh relocated more than 1,600 early this month, two officials with the direct knowledge of the matter said.“They will be moved to Chittagong first and then to Bhasan Char, depending on the high tide,” one of the officials said. The officials declined to be named as the issue had not been made public.Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the relocation was voluntary. “They will not be sent against their will.”The United Nations has said it has not been allowed to carry out a technical and safety assessment of Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there.Bangladesh says it is transferring only people who are willing to go and the move will ease chronic overcrowding in camps that are home to more than 1 million Rohingyas.But refugees and humanitarian workers say some of the Rohingya have been coerced into going to the island, which emerged from the sea 20 years ago.Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters earlier this month the United Nations should first assess and verify how conducive the environment in Myanmar’s Rakhine state was for repatriating the refugees, before carrying out an assessment of Bhasan Char.Several attempts to kickstart repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar have failed after refugees said they were too fearful of further violence to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-set-to-move-second-batch-of-rohingya-refugees-to-remote-island/story-Uh4i1EbL8Xn4DUM7jQbm0L.html

At least seven climbers were still unaccounted for on three popular trails, Valipour said earlier.Tehran lies at the foot of the Alborz mountain range which has several ski resorts. Separately, Iranian maritime authorities were searching for the seven crew members of an Iranian transport vessel that capsized in rough Gulf waters on Friday, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.“We are trying to find the missing by mobilising all our facilities and forces, and informing passing vessels and the naval search and rescue centres of Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan,” Esmail Makkizadeh, deputy head of Iran’s regional maritime body, was quoted as saying by ISNA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-climbers-killed-in-iran-ship-crew-missing-after-snowfall-and-storms/story-pY2LS3P6wOOI1ogC1Iim0J.html
27-12-2020||World||Despite smooth election, GOP leaders seek vote restrictions||Changes to the way millions of Americans voted this year contributed to record turnout, but that’s no guarantee the measures making it easier to cast ballots will stick around for future elections.Republicans in key states that voted for President-elect Joe Biden already are pushing for new restrictions, especially to absentee voting. It’s an option many states expanded amid the coronavirus outbreak that proved hugely popular and helped ensure one of the smoothest election days in recent years.President Donald Trump has been unrelenting in his attacks on mail voting as he continues to challenge the legitimacy of an election he lost. Despite a lack of evidence and dozens of losses in the courts, his claims of widespread voter fraud have gained traction with some Republican elected officials.They are vowing to crack down on mail ballots and threatening to roll back other steps that have made it easier for people to vote.“This myth could not justify throwing out the results of the election, nor can it justify imposing additional burdens on voters that will disenfranchise many Americans,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.An estimated 108 million people voted before Election Day, either through early in-person voting or by mailing or dropping off absentee ballots. That represented nearly 70% of all votes cast, after states took steps to make it easier to avoid crowded polling places during the pandemic.A few states sent ballots to every registered voter while others dropped requirements that voters needed a specific excuse to cast an absentee ballot. Many states added drop boxes and expanded early voting options.The changes were popular with voters and did not lead to widespread fraud. A group of election officials including representatives of the federal cybersecurity agency called the 2020 presidential election the “most secure” election in US history, and US Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press there had been no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the election.Nevertheless, Republicans in Georgia have proposed adding a photo ID requirement when voting absentee, a ban on drop boxes and possibly a return to requiring an excuse for mail voting, such as illness or traveling for work on Election Day.Early supporters of the ID requirement include Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Republicans who were criticized relentlessly by Trump for failing to back his fraud claims after losing in Georgia. A top deputy for Raffensperger has said the ID requirement would boost public confidence and refute any future claims of fraud.The state’s two US Senate runoffs next month will take place under current law, which requires local election officials to verify signatures on absentee ballots.In Pennsylvania, Republican lawmakers have been writing legislation to address what they claim are problems with the 2020 election and mail voting in particular, even though courts and elections officials have found no evidence of widespread problems.“We’d like to tighten it up as soon as we can,” said Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward.Republicans hold majorities in both legislative chambers, and their support was instrumental in a year-old state law that expanded mail voting to all registered voters. One bill being discussed would go so far as to repeal that law and force voters to state an excuse to receive a ballot in the mail.Previous elections have shown that voters appreciate mail voting, no matter their party affiliation. Republican candidates down the ballot did very well this year, even as a record 81.2 million voters cast their ballot for the Democrat in the presidential race.In Michigan, Republicans held every congressional seat and kept control of the legislature despite Trump losing the state. Yet Republicans still held a legislative hearing in which Trump’s lawyers argued there were widespread irregularities without explaining how these somehow affected only the presidential race but not other contests.“Just like we have seen a lot of legislators making ill-advised decisions to hold hearings that ended up being more political theater than policy debates, we can similarly expect legislators to further this hyper-partisan agenda to restrict the vote,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat.Benson said lawmakers should instead look to the high turnout for the presidential election as a guide to improving what worked and then make changes sought by elections officials, such as providing more time for clerks to process mail ballots. Michigan does not allow that work to begin until the day before Election Day.Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said her organization also would like to see lawmakers focus on reducing the strain facing local election officials.“The more time that we spend in debating other issues, the less time that we have to do something good with changes to the election code,” Schaefer said.Democrats and voting rights groups have already begun pushing back, saying Republicans should be focused on protecting voter access to the polls and not feeding into conspiracy theories launched by Trump and his allies to undermine the Nov. 3 election.They say ID requirements accomplish little, but have a high cost.“It’s a solution in search of a problem,” said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat who was recently tapped to fill the US Senate seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. “It will undoubtedly have the net effect of disenfranchising a lot of people without necessarily improving election security.”Padilla supports sending registered voters a ballot in the mail.Voter fraud does happen, but studies have shown it’s exceedingly rare. Numerous safeguards are built into voting systems to ensure that only eligible voters cast a ballot. Election officials say when fraud does happen, people are caught and prosecuted.Not all Republicans are seeking to add restrictions.In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said his legislative priorities are to expand early voting locations, increase oversight of election vendors, add an online option for requesting absentee ballots and address confusion over drop boxes.“Ohio’s got a good thing going, but we don’t want to rest on our laurels,” said LaRose, who wants his priorities approved by the Republican-dominated legislature.Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams said the pandemic forced the state to implement early voting, which proved popular among voters of both major parties. The Republican said he thinks it’s likely state lawmakers will create an early voting policy for subsequent elections and has heard of no opposition to that in the GOP-controlled legislature.“It just makes voting easier,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-smooth-election-gop-leaders-seek-vote-restrictions/story-m3wtOlG2pgeE5uW9D7EDTJ.html
27-12-2020||World||FBI at home of possible person of interest in Nashville bomb explosion||Federal agents converged on the home of a possible person of interest in the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville as investigators scoured hundreds of tips and leads in the blast that pulverised city blocks on Christmas morning and damaged dozens of buildings.More than 24 hours after the explosion, a motive remained elusive as investigators worked round-the-clock to resolve unanswered questions about a recreational vehicle that blew up on a mostly deserted street on a sleepy holiday morning and was prefaced by a recorded warning advising those nearby to evacuate. The attack, which damaged an AT&T building, continued to wreak havoc Saturday on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states.Investigators from multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies were on Saturday at a home in Antioch, in suburban Nashville, after receiving information relevant to the investigation, said FBI Special Agent Jason Pack. Another law enforcement official, who was not authorised to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said investigators regard a person associated with the property as a person of interest.Federal agents could be seen looking around the property, searching the home and the backyard. A Google Maps image had shown a similar recreational vehicle parked in the backyard when the photo was captured in May 2019; an AP reporter at the scene did not see the vehicle at the property in the late afternoon Saturday.There were other signs of progress in the investigation, as the FBI revealed that it was looking at a number of individuals who may be connected to it. Officials also said no additional explosive devices have been found — indicating no active threat to the area. Investigators have received around 500 tips and leads.“It’s just going to take us some time,” Douglas Korneski, the special agent in charge in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said at a Saturday afternoon news conference. “Our investigative team is turning over every stone” to understand who did this and why.Separately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a report Saturday that tissue samples found at the scene were determined to be human remains. Officials said they were working vigorously to identify whom the remains belong to.Beyond that, the only known casualties were three injured people. The infrastructure damage, meanwhile, was broadly felt, due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. Police emergency systems in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, as well as Nashville’s Covid-19 community hotline and a handful of hospital systems, remained out of service.The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted.Asked whether the AT&T building could have been a possible target, Korneski said, “We’re looking at every possible motive that could be involved.Investigators shut down the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene — an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops — as they shuffled through broken glass and damaged buildings to learn more about the explosion.Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area until Sunday via executive order to limit public access to the area. More than 40 buildings were affected.AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power.“Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.” Ray Neville, president of technology at T-Mobile, said on Twitter that service disruptions affected Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Birmingham and Atlanta. “We continue to see service interruptions in these areas following yesterday’s explosion. Restoration efforts continue around the clock & we will keep you updated on progress,” he said in a tweet Saturday.The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday. The Federal Aviation Association has since issued a temporary flight restriction around the airport, requiring pilots to follow strict procedures until Dec. 30.According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-at-home-of-possible-person-of-interest-in-nashville-bomb-explosion/story-AgkCvzx7wRnfq7RWngvt7J.html

I will add that over the past 30 years, the Ministry of Emergency Situations has carried out more than 500 humanitarian operations abroad. I consider this one of the most important, significant areas of your work,” Putin said in an address on Emergency Rescuer’s Day, marked on December 27.He added that Russia is proud of its rescuers who will certainly continue to carry out their duties responsibly,“The whole world knows that Russia will help, will send its rescuers and specialists to where the situation is especially difficult, will deliver the most essential items - food, medicine, clothing, provide emergency medical and psychological assistance to people in desperate situations. And Russia will do it without any ulterior motives. Not for the sake of any political benefits. This experience, of course, should be used to further improve the entire system of the Ministry of Emergencies,” Putin said.The Russian President said that a lot is already being done to improve the emergencies system in Russia, including in what concerns technical capabilities, but the system could still benefit from additional improvements.“... it is necessary to further build up the capabilities of the unified state system for the prevention and elimination of emergency situations, to fully use the advantages of modern approaches in predicting risks in order to minimize damage from natural disasters, fires, floods, accidents.

27-12-2020||World||India, UAE relations soar high in 2020||The traditionally harmonious relationship between the UAE and India was further cemented in the year 2020 with their top leadership holding regular parleys to enhance cooperation on bilateral, regional and multilateral fronts in the post-Covid era, including the welfare of the vast Indian community in the Gulf kingdom.The growing strategic relations between the two countries were reflected in two high-level visits from India – External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in November and Chief of Army Staff Gen. M M Naravane in December.Jaishankar met the UAE’s top leadership, focussing on enhancing cooperation on various facets of their comprehensive strategic partnership including trade, investment, infrastructure, energy, food security and defence.Also Read: S Jaishankar meets UAE counterpart; discusses Covid-19, strategic cooperationHe held high-level meetings with Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Ruler of Dubai who is also the Prime Minister and Vice President of UAE Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.The two sides also discussed prospects for economic cooperation between India and the UAE in the post-Covid-19 era and the situation in the neighbourhood of both countries.India’s concern for the welfare of 3.3 million Indians living in the UAE, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, was one of the main points during the deliberations.Jaishankar thanked Sheikh Mohammed for taking care of the Indian community, underlining that India had been a reliable partner to the UAE in all respects during this difficult period.He also assured the diaspora of the Indian government’s responsiveness on issues pertaining to post-Covid normalcy.Naravane’s visit to the UAE was historic as it was the first-ever by the head of the Indian Army to the country.He met Commander of the UAE’s Land Forces and Staff Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri and discussed key issues of mutual interest and defence cooperation. The visit is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere.Indians constitute roughly 30 per cent of the country’s population. Earlier in March, the Crown Prince assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the health and safety of the Indian community during the pandemic as the two leaders exchanged information and views on the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation in their respective countries, as well as the steps being taken by their governments to deal with the situation.Jaishankar, who has taken a special interest in the India-UAE bilateral relationship, said: “It is a relationship where the highest leadership of both countries have invested goodwill and energy. As a result, you can see the transformation during the last five years.” The ties between India and the UAE are on an upswing in the last few years and the leaders of the two countries have been holding regular parleys this year to strengthen them further in the post-Covid era, especially on the economic front.Also Read: Gen. Naravane holds talks with UAE Commander on defence cooperationWith robust flow of bilateral investments and an annual bilateral trade of about USD 60 billion, the UAE is India’s third-largest trade partner. The influential Gulf nation is also a major exporter of crude oil to India.India has also invited further investments from the UAE in key sectors of the Indian economy such as infrastructure including logistics, food parks, highways, ports, airports, renewable energy and defence.In September, the Consulate General of India, Dubai, and Tea Board India co-organised a virtual B2B Meet to promote Indian tea in the UAE.As the pandemic wrecked havoc across the world, it provided an opportunity for the two countries to come closer and extend a helping hand to each other to sail through the crisis.In May, the UAE sent seven metric tonnes of medical supplies to India to bolster its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“UAE assistance to India comes in recognition of the profound and brotherly ties our two countries have shared throughout the years,” the UAE’s Ambassador to India Ahmed Abdul Rahman AlBanna had said.India repatriated its 84,497 citizens from the UAE under the Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s biggest ever repatriation exercise to bring back its citizens stranded abroad amidst the international travel lockdown over the pandemic.The UAE is also one of the countries with which India has formed an air bubble arrangement to operate flights amid the pandemic.India also welcomed the “full normalisation” of ties between the UAE and Israel, its key strategic allies, under a historic peace deal brokered by the US, asserting that it has consistently supported peace, stability and development in West Asia.From an Indian perspective, the normalisation of the UAE-Israel ties has started bearing fruit.On December 14, it was announced that the International Federation of the Indo-Israel Chambers of Commerce (IFIICC) has been launched in the UAE to broaden relationship between the Indian diaspora and Israel.At the event, it was agreed that scientific research, IT, AgriTech and food security, health care and sustainability are areas of natural synergy among India, Israel and the UAE.As India looked for a venue to conduct the Indian Premier League owing to the Covid-19 situation, the strong relations between the two countries were once again highlighted with UAE playing host to the popular cricket season with eight star-studded teams playing 60 matches for nearly two months in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-uae-relations-soar-high-in-2020/story-TdGHYS1cKqctBTgDS0xIRJ.html

This is dangerously short-sighted, and frankly difficult to understand.”The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board’s September 2019 first annual report on world readiness for health emergencies -- published a few months before the novel coronavirus broke out -- said the planet was woefully unprepared for potentially devastating pandemics.“History tells us that this will not be the last pandemic, and epidemics are a fact of life,” said Tedros.“The pandemic has highlighted the intimate links between the health of humans, animals and planet,” he added.“Any efforts to improve human health are doomed unless they address the critical interface between humans and animals, and the existential threat of climate change that’s making our earth less habitable,” he said.World ‘turned upside-down’ The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.75 million people and nearly 80 million cases have been recorded since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.“In the past 12 months, our world has been turned upside-down. The impacts of the pandemic go far beyond the disease itself, with far-reaching consequences for societies and economies,” said Tedros.But the Ethiopian former health minister said the coronavirus crisis should not have come as a surprise, given the repeated warnings.“We must all learn the lessons the pandemic is teaching us,” he said.Tedros said all countries should invest in preparedness capacities to prevent, detect and mitigate emergencies of all kinds, and called for stronger primary health care provision.The UN health agency’s chief said that with investments in public health, “we can ensure that our children and their children inherit a safer, more resilient and more sustainable world”.The International Day of Epidemic Preparedness was called for by the United Nations General Assembly to promote the importance of prevention, preparedness and partnership in tackling epidemics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-will-not-be-the-last-who-chief/story-DZM3dVXmNnOP23vFgJg9kO.html
27-12-2020||World||Canada’s Ontario finds two cases of coronavirus variant first seen in UK||Health officials in Ontario said on Saturday that two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom have appeared in the Canadian province. Scientists say the variant is about 40%-70% more transmissible than the original strain. Several other countries, including Australia, Italy and the Netherlands say they detected cases of the new strain.The Canadian cases, identified in a couple in southern Ontario with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contact, came as the province went into a lockdown on Saturday.“This further reinforces the need for Ontarians to stay home as much as possible and continue to follow all public health advice, including the provincewide shutdown measures beginning today,” Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s associate chief medical officer, said in a statement.Ontario reported 4,301 new cases over the past two days on Saturday, with the province seeing more than 2,000 cases per day for 12 consecutive days.Last week, Canada extended to Jan. 6 a ban on passenger flights arriving from Britain and expanded enhanced screening and monitoring measures to travelers arriving from South Africa, citing the rise of the more infectious variant. Scientists say there is no evidence that vaccines currently being deployed - including one made by Pfizer and BioNtech - or other Covid-19 shots in development will not protect against this variant. Canada began rolling out the Pfizer vaccine earlier this month and started distributing Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine across the country last Thursday.Canada has so far reported 541,616 cases of Covid-19, including 14,800 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-ontario-finds-two-cases-of-coronavirus-variant-first-seen-in-uk/story-9wXcSwocX4JuYaeoS9OCpO.html
27-12-2020||World||Protests keep up against Israeli PM as new election looms||Hundreds of Israelis protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, calling on the long-serving leader to resign just days after the country was plunged into a new national election.The protesters have been gathering outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence for months, slamming him for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and saying he cannot lead the country while under indictment for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate corruption cases. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.Protesters held signs urging Netanyahu to “Go,” and declaring “We won’t stop protesting until you get out of our lives.”While turnout was lower than previous demonstrations amid colder weather, the protesters have a new impetus because Israel appears headed toward its fourth election in two years in March, in which Netanyahu faces new challenges from defectors from his conservative Likud Party.The election will likely be another referendum on Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader and also one of its most polarizing. It will come just after Netanyahu’s trial enters its evidentiary stage, which will likely lodge the corruption charges against him firmly in the public discourse during what is expected to be a bitter, divisive campaign.Saturday’s protest came a day before Israel heads into its third national coronavirus lockdown, with much of the economy again shutting down amid surging infection numbers. Critics say Netanyahu and his so-called “emergency” government — set up in the spring specifically to deal with the virus — bungled their response, bringing the country to another costly lockdown.Netanyahu points to the country’s current vaccination campaign, which has among the world’s highest per capita inoculation numbers, as the country’s way out of the worldwide health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-keep-up-against-israeli-pm-as-new-election-looms/story-laE9K8xFgk0j1zPFP0HHVL.html

It’s a reminder | AnalysisChina is sending a high-level delegation led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou to Kathmandu, The Kathmandu Post reported.“Leading a four-member team, Guo is scheduled to land in Kathmandu on Sunday morning on a regular China Southern Airlines flight,” the paper reported, citing sources in both factions of the NCP.Bishnu Rijal, Deputy Head of Department of Foreign Affairs of the NCP’s Prachanda-led faction, said that the Chinese side has communicated about Gou’s visit to Kathmandu.“I don’t have much detail to share with you at this point of time,” Rijal was quoted as saying by the paper.The Chinese embassy here did not respond to its multiple calls and messages, the paper said.Although no specific details about the agenda of the visit are available, senior NCP leaders confirmed that Guo is scheduled to land in Kathmandu on Sunday morning, leading a four-member delegation, My Republica newspaper reported.Also Read | Chinese ambassador steps up as Nepal’s communist party stares at a splitObservers here believe that the visit could be to assess the ground situation in Nepal following the decision of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives and the rival faction within the NCP taking to the streets, it said.Citing sources in the ruling party, the paper said during his four-day stay in Kathmandu, the Chinese vice minister is scheduled to meet top leaders of both factions of the party.The development comes after Chinese ambassador in Nepal Hou Yanqi held a series of meetings with the president and top leaders of the NCP, including Prachanda and Madhav Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction.During her meeting with Madhav Nepal on Friday, Ambassador Hou, who was concerned about the split in the NCP, inquired about the future political course of the ruling party among other things, the paper quoted Rijal as saying.Hou on Thursday met Prachanda, who claims control over the ruling party after removing Prime Minister Oli from the posts of the party’s parliamentary leader and chair.She had also met the Standing Committee member and former energy minister Barsha Man Pun on Thursday, the paper said.Hou’s meeting with Prachanda came two days after she called on President Bhandari at the latter’s office in Sheetal Niwas on Tuesday.The envoy was said to have discussed the latest political development following the president’s move to dissolve the House of Representatives and announce mid-term elections.This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal’s internal affairs at a time of crisis.In May, Hou held separate meetings with President Bhandari, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down.In July, she again met a number of top leaders, including the president, prime minister, Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam to save Oli.A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy’s series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal’s internal political affairs.Dozens of student activists carrying placards with anti-China slogans had staged a demonstration in front of the Chinese Embassy here to protest against Hou’s interference in Nepal’s internal affairs.China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou has made open efforts to garner support for Oli.The Chinese Communist Party and Nepal Communist Party were regularly engaged in training programmes. In September last year, the NCP had even organised a symposium, inviting some leaders from the Chinese Communist Party to Kathmandu to impart training to Nepali leaders on the Xi Jinping Thought ahead of the visit of the Chinese president, his first to Nepal, the Post reported.In a guarded reaction to the fast-paced political developments in Nepal, India on Thursday said it was an “internal matter” of the neighbouring nation and it was for the country to decide as per its democratic processes.“We have noted the recent political developments in Nepal. These are internal matters for Nepal to decide as per its democratic processes,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi.“As a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rushes-top-ranking-cpc-leader-to-kathmandu-to-prevent-split-in-nepal-communist-party/story-jBGCvXs8rZsWQ78iy4dmYM.html

In Spain, four cases were confirmed in Madrid on Saturday, though the patients were not seriously ill, the Madrid regional government’s deputy health chief Antonio Zapatero said, adding “there is no need for alarm”.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageSweden identified its first case of the mutation after a person from the UK visited the Nordic nation to celebrate Christmas in the Sormland region. There’s a risk more people in Sweden have been infected by the variant, according to Signar Makitalo, the infection prevention doctor for the region. The country’s health agency has asked everyone in Sweden who has travelled from the UK after December 12 be tested for the coronavirus.The new strain, which experts fear is more contagious than the earlier one, has prompted over 50 countries to impose travel restrictions on the UK.Japan will halt new non-resident foreign arrivals coming from overseas from Monday until late January after reporting its first cases of the new strain.As the global number of Covid-19 cases neared 80mn on Saturday, Hungarian doctors and health care workers began getting vaccinated on Saturday with one of the continent’s first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, upsetting the EU’s plans for a coordinated roll-out of the first shots across the 27-nation bloc on Sunday.A doctor in Boston with a shellfish allergy had a severe allergic reaction after receiving Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, The New York Times reported on Friday, citing the doctor.

27-12-2020||World||Millions of Americans risk losing jobless benefits as Trump refuses to sign aid bill||Millions of Americans are about to see their jobless benefits expire on Saturday as US President Donald Trump has so far refused to sign into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, insisting that it did not do enough to help everyday people.Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he said this week he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in badly needed coronavirus relief, including extending special unemployment benefits expiring on Dec. 26, and $1.4 trillion for normal government spending.Without Trump’s signature, about 14 million people could lose those extra benefits, according to Labor Department data. A partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday unless Congress can agree a stop-gap government funding bill before then.Also read | Biden warns of ‘devastating consequences’ of Trump block on pandemic reliefAfter months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump, who hands over power to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, did not object to terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday night.But since then he has complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid, while its one-time $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans were too small. He has demanded that be raised to $2,000.“I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill,” the president tweeted on Saturday.His refusal to sign prompted sharp rebuke from Biden, who called on the outgoing Republican president to act immediately.“This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences...This bill is critical. It needs to be signed into law now,” Biden said in a statement.Americans face an unprecedented holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began.Many economists agree the bill’s aid is too low but say the immediate support is still welcome and necessary.Congress to return next weekA source familiar with the situation said Trump’s objection to the bill caught many White House officials by surprise. While the outgoing president’s strategy for the bill remains unclear, his repeated expression of discontent over it dashed hopes that he would sign.Trump spent much of Thursday and the Christmas Day golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The bill has been sent to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence, where he is spending Saturday.On Friday, Trump said he has held many calls and meetings from his golf club, but neither him nor the White House provided details. He has been sending tweets repeating his baseless claims about election fraud and accusing his fellow Republicans of abandoning him in his bid to overturn the election result, already shot down multiple times by US courts.Also Read | Pelosi sets up showdown on Trump’s $2,000 checks after GOP balksBiden, whose Nov. 3 electoral victory Trump refuses to acknowledge, is spending the holiday in his home state of Delaware.Democratic US Representative Don Beyer told CNN that Trump can still save the day if he signed the bill Saturday. “That means that the people on pandemic unemployment insurance, which runs out today, get to keep it...And the way forward if he signs this, on Monday the House will take up his $2,000 check – direct check stuff – which we’ve been for all along.”The US Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, will be preparing to return to work. The Democratic-controlled House plans to vote on legislation providing one-time, $2,000 checks to individuals.Trump has also repeated his discontent over a $740 billion bill authorizing the nation’s defense programs, a legislation he vetoed last week. On Monday, the House is scheduled to vote on overriding Trump’s veto. If the House vote succeeds, the Senate could hold its vote as early as Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-risk-losing-jobless-benefits-as-trump-refuses-to-sign-aid-bill/story-HdfchQ7gwKBzW6dNjvnSbO.html
27-12-2020||World||Biden warns of ‘devastating consequences’ of Trump block on pandemic relief||US President-elect Joe Biden warned Saturday of “devastating consequences” if President Donald Trump continues to delay signing a Covid-19 economic relief bill passed by Congress.Trump threw a long-awaited pandemic aid package into doubt last week as millions of Americans prepared to lose benefits and face eviction -- demanding lawmakers more than triple the $600 direct payments to US taxpayers.“This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences. Today, about 10 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance benefits,” Biden said in a statement.“In just a few days, government funding will expire, putting vital services and paychecks for military personnel at risk. In less than a week, a moratorium on evictions expires, putting millions at risk of being forced from their homes over the holidays.”In a video late Tuesday, Trump, who is due to leave office in less than a month, called the $900 million bill “a disgrace” -- despite it being passed Monday with a large bipartisan majority after months of negotiation.The legislation was designed to throw a lifeline to businesses and people struggling to keep their heads above water.But in a pre-recorded statement made in the White House and sent out on Twitter, Trump said he would refuse to accept the bill without changes.“I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,” he said.The move puts Trump at odds with Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who have ruled out any larger stimulus measures.Democrats failed Thursday to get a standalone measure through Congress to increase the payments that would go to all taxpayers earning up to $75,000 a year, with smaller amounts for those making up to $99,000.“Delay means more small businesses won’t survive this dark winter because they lack access to the lifeline they need, and Americans face further delays in getting the direct payments they deserve as quickly as possible to help deal with the economic devastation caused by Covid-19,” Biden added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-of-devastating-consequences-of-trump-block-on-pandemic-relief/story-ViqmJziidoG6JY14NDV9MP.html

While the man has been booked for trying to molest a woman in the village, over half a dozen people have been booked for assaulting the man, the officials said.Sarola police station house officer Raghuveer Singh said that the 28-year-old entered the house of a woman, belonging to the Bheel community, and tried to molest her on Saturday. The man’s bid was foiled when the woman’s husband reached the house, Singh said. The man managed to escape, Singh said. Relatives of the woman, however, called the man to a deserted place in the village on Sunday morning where they allegedly assaulted him, the officer said. “The man was paraded naked with a garland of shoes around his neck in the village on Sunday morning,” Singh said. The accused also shot a video of the incident and circulated it on social media, he added.An FIR against the woman’s husband and his relatives has been filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act, Singh said.The woman, meanwhile, has filed a complaint against the man under Section 354 (Assault with intent to outrage modesty) of the IPC and SC/ST Act, Singh said.Deputy superintendent of police Rajeev Parihar said that several relatives of the woman’s husband and the 28-year-old man have been detained and arrests will be made after a thorough investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-paraded-naked-for-attempting-molestation/story-ntVxQDEAbDo8hdLIRZE0bN.html

However, the jail authorities rejected the allegations.According to Saibaba’s lawyer, Aakash Sarode as many as 34 different things that Saibaba wanted, the prison authorities accepted only 13 items when he went there three days back to hand them over. “Of the essentials, you have even refused to accept woollen cap/monkey cap, Napkin, handkerchief, towel, and white T- shirt, while you accepted underwear and loincloth only. Given the bone-chilling cold that whole of Nagpur is facing at the moment, I fail to understand how else do you expect my client to save himself from cold,” asked Sarode through a letter to the jail superintendent. The Gadchiroli district sessions court convicted Saibaba and five others in 2017 for aiding and abetting Maoist activities and waging a war against the nation. Saibaba is wheel-chair bound professor with 90% disability. His lawyer stated that his condition was deteriorating and he is also suffering from multiple ailments. . He said that a month back, Saibaba had consulted the jail authorities about the essential things. Subsequently, he made a list of the things and submitted an application to the jail authorities, Sarode said. “On December 24, I went to the jail with all the material along with the list of items... However, the jail officials refused to accept several things, which neither pose any security threat nor any danger of Covid-19 spread,” alleged the lawyer. However, the jail superintendent, Anup Kumre, dismissed all the allegations and said that most of the items are repetitions, which are already in Saibaba’s possession, like sweater, woollen monkey cap and woollen blanket. “We are very reasonable with the jail inmates and always ready to help them as per the jail norms,” he said. Moreover, the Nagpur central prison is a Covid-19 prone area and hence the authorities are also very careful to allow outside material in the jail, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-says-saibaba-denied-cap-in-jail-authorities-reject-claim/story-flFeoCy5dT70meRdIbBClN.html
27-12-2020||India||Bengal assembly polls: Abhishek and Suvendu trade barbs as poll battle heats up||Kolkata: Youth Trinamool Congress president Abhishek Banerjee, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, on Sunday accused former minister Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on December 19, of being “corrupt and spineless” and faced a counter-attack in less than an hour as the political slugfest in the poll-bound state intensified. Narrowing the political battle between the ruling TMC and the BJP in poll-bound Bengal to a personal clash, Banerjee, who was recently branded by Adhikari as “tolabaaj” (extortionist), hit back from a rally at Diamond Harbour, his Lok Sabha constituency in South 24 Parganas district located adjacent to Kolkata. “You called me a tolabaaj (extortionist) while you are the one whose name figures in the Saradha and Narada cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate. You were seen in the (Narada) video accepting money wrapped in newspaper. My name is not there in the files. The ED and CBI won’t be able to do anything to me,” said Banerjee. “You have no spine and joined the BJP for protection,” he added. Addressing a rally that was preceded by a roadshow at Danton in West Midnapore district shortly after a public meeting by Abhishek Banerjee ended, Adhikari accused his adversary of misappropriating funds meant for victims of cyclone Amphan or beneficiaries of social welfare schemes. During the roadshow, Adhikari even chanted slogans asking people to save Bengal from “tolabaaj bhaipo” (extortionist nephew). None of the leaders mentioned each other’s name but the spirit and content of the vitriolic speeches made things obvious. It is now almost an open secret in Bengal politics that Adhikari left the TMC because he was unhappy with organizational decisions taken by Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On November 10, Adhikari threw his first veiled challenge at the TMC while addressing a public rally at Nandigram, the assembly constituency he represented in East Midnapore before resigning from the assembly. On the year’s last Sunday, however, there was no pulling of punches. Abhishek Banerjee dared the Centre and probe agencies. “f you (Centre) ever get any proof of my involvement in these cases, set up the gallows. I will voluntarily come and hang myself,” he said At Danton, Adhikari said he did not raise his voice against alleged corruption in the government all these years because he was waiting for a time when the TMC could be ousted from power. “The coming elections will not be held in the presence of the state police. We will have Central paramilitary forces. People will give you a befitting reply,” said Adhikari. “Bengal has to be won and presented to Narendra Modi. It is necessary that Bengal and the country is run by the same government,” reiterated Adhikari. On Sunday afternoon, Abhishek Banerjee said, “Bengal is not an object that can be handed over to the Prime Minister.” BJP national president J P Nadda’s convoy was stoned by some protestors at Diamond Harbour on December 10. This was Banerjee’s first rally in the district after that incident. It triggered a cold war between the Union home ministry and the state. The ministry unilaterally transferred three Indian Police Service officers who were in charge of Nadda’s security. The state has opposed this. “People are aggrieved with the Centre’s policies. Some of them may have pelted stones. Nobody should pelt stones. We have to give our reply to the BJP through the ballot,” said Abhishek Banerjee. Abhishek Banerjee also targeted the Prime Minister and the Centre. “The Centre has suspended the area development fund given to members of the Parliament because of the Covid-19 pandemic but nobody raised a question when thousands of crores were spent on a new plane for the Prime Minister,” said Abhishek Banerjee. “Over the past one month ,the Union home minister has come to Bengal, big BJP leaders have come to Bengal and Union ministers have come to Bengal because they cannot stop a simple five-feet-one-inch-tall woman who lives in a tin-roofed house. You are no match for even the nails on her fingers,” said Abhishek Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-assembly-polls-abhishek-and-suvendu-trade-barbs-as-poll-battle-heats-up/story-5UkHp8StTyVWf62XNFJuAM.html
27-12-2020||India||‘Sharad Pawar himself would not want to become UPA chief’: P Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Sunday said that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar would not want to be declared the chief of Opposition’s United Progressive Alliance (UPA), as there is no such thing that exists.The comment comes at a time when Pawar’s name is making rounds for UPA chairperson’s post with the Shiv Sena also batting for the veteran leader and pressing for the need for Opposition parties to come together at the national level. While speaking to news agency ANI, Chidambaram said, “I don’t think even Mr Sharad Pawar wants to be declared as the chairperson of UPA. When these parties meet, the natural person to extend the invitation and the natural person to preside over the meeting will be the leader of the largest party; we are not selecting a prime minister. There is no such thing as the chairperson of UPA.” Chidambaram said among the UPA allies, Congress has the largest bench strength in the Parliament. “The UPA consists of about nine or 10 parties, the biggest in our alliance being the Congress, with roughly about 95 or 100 members in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” he told ANI.Also read: Pejwara seer reveals secret behind PM Modi’s growing beard, hairThe former finance minister said if the Congress calls for a meeting of the alliance, “it is only natural that a Congress leader will preside over the meeting”. “Some of the parties may take the initiative to call the meeting of UPA and Congress will attend it, but if the Congress is calling a meeting, it is only natural that one of its own leaders will preside over the meeting,” Chidambaram said. He also stressed on the importance of UPA and its allies working together to make the alliance stronger nationwide. Speculations are rife that the parties in the Opposition are in favour of Pawar taking a lead to form a formidable combine to take on the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) at the national level. Pawar himself had expressed the need for such a combine and had pressed that Congress should take the lead by keeping differences with parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) at bay. Shiv Sena parliamentarian and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the UPA has weakened and has lost its relevance. He also had stated that apart from interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Pawar also has support from a cross-section of people and leaders from other parties in the Opposition. Pawar is the only leader who is taken seriously even by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he had said. “The time has come to expand the scope of UPA by inducting more allies. All Opposition parties should come together against the dictatorial attitude of the central government. A weak Opposition is bad for democracy,” he had said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress has expressed its dismay over Sena’s criticism on UPA. “Our alliance with Sena is limited to Maharashtra and it is based on the common minimum programme that we had finalised before forming the state government. Sena has no business to comment on UPA and it’s not a part of the [UPA] alliance as yet. All the alliance partners have full faith in the leadership of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who has been leading the alliance efficiently. As far as the leadership of UPA by Sharad Pawar is concerned, he too, has refused any such proposal,” said Maharashtra public works department minister and former state chief minister Ashok Chavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-himself-would-not-want-to-become-upa-chief-p-chidambaram/story-NyoeietKYwwHCzaWDsYMRJ.html
27-12-2020||India||‘Talks need to be conducted from farmers’ perspective’: MoS Kailash Chaudhary||Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Kailash Chaudhary on Sunday expressed hope that the next round of discussions with protesting farmers’ rights leaders will yield results.“Problems can only be resolved by talking. I firmly believe talks scheduled on Dec 29 will resolve issues if they’re conducted from farmers’ perspective, not from the perspective of politicians who’re politicising the issue,” Chaudhary was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Chaudhary’s words were similar to how several ministers and lawmakers have reacted to the ongoing protests by farmers at Delhi’s borders, which have now entered its 32nd day. Choudhary will most likely attend the meeting with Union minister of agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar and Som Prakash, union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare.Other than Chaudhary, defence minister Rajnath Singh while addressing an event to celebrate three years of Jai Ram Thakur’s government in Himachal Pradesh also alleged that several political parties are politicising the issue and misleading farmers. Singh during his address also reiterated his previous appeal to farmers asking them to allow the implementation of the laws for a period of one year and seek changes if the laws do not prove to be beneficial.BJP has also alleged that Congress is trying to mislead farmers because BJP had the willpower to implement the much-needed reforms in the agricultural sector. The ruling party also said that the reforms were promised in Congress’s 2019 Lok Sabha manifesto. The prime minister earlier this month had even told opposition leaders to take the credit of the benefits of farm laws while addressing a virtual event.Farmers on Saturday proposed that the government discuss with their leaders the modalities of repealing the bills and give legal assurance that the system of procurement under MSP continues.Along with farmers, several politicians continued to lash out at the Centre for not empathizing with farmers. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh said BJP should not hurt sentiments of farmers by calling them unpatriotic. He said, “If the BJP cannot distinguish between anguished citizens fighting for their survival and terrorists, militants and hooligans, it should give up all pretence of being a people’s party.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also invited BJP leaders and union ministers to hold a debate highlighting the benefits of these new laws. He also said that these laws are intended to keep industrialists happy and the farmers of the nation in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-need-to-be-conducted-from-farmers-perspective-mos-kailash-chaudhary/story-ybT3Uqx8q4MXz62Y9LK7PO.html
27-12-2020||India||After poll debacle, revamp talk gets stronger in Kerala Congress||All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar, who is in Kerala to examine the recent local body election debacle, is flooded with complaints and many leaders have sought leadership change in the state unit. After the defeat in local body elections, senior leaders have trained their guns on state president Mullapally Ramachandran, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and convenor of the United Democratic Front MM Hassan. Party insiders said a major surgery is unlikely as the state is set to go for the assembly elections in four months, but some of the district presidents may get axed soon. Anwar has asked leaders not to wash dirt in pubic and maintain the party discipline.During his two-day stay, leaders of allies will also meet the AICC general secretary. Some of them have already asked the lead party (Congress) to set its house in order and patch up differences between senior leaders. They have asked the party leadership to bring former chief minister Oommen Chandy to the front but the latter has shown least interest. They feel his popularity and connect with common people will help the party to overcome the latest setbacks. Also read: In veiled message to BJP, AIADMK asserts Palaniswami as CM candidateThe party leadership is quite upset with the poll outcome - in last general election in 2019, the UDF had managed 19 out of 20 Lok Sabha seats. The local body elections took place in the backdrop of mounting challenges to ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whose secretary is in jail and a minister was questioned by law enforcement agencies several times in connection with a gold smuggling racket uncovered in July. Besides this, party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was forced to proceed on leave after his son was arrested in connection with a narcotics haul in Bengaluru. Many central agencies had also pitched their tents in the state, probing a series of alleged kickbacks. Though the Congress and the BJP tried their best to exploit these sensational cases, the LDF pulled off a victory literally shocking the party leadership. “The party will have to do a serious re-thinking on its strategy and bring more young leaders to the fore. Otherwise, local body outcome will be repeated in assembly elections also,” warned a senior leader from Malabar, adding time was ripe for the party to end growing factionalism. Many leaders feel that the distribution of seats based on groups did a major damage and there were no sincere effort to convince rebel candidates at many places. What really worries the leadership is that some of the traditional vote banks, like Christian heartland in central Travancore, ditched the party badly. Though state leaders dismissed it as a temporary setback, the party is in no mood to take it lightly. It has asked the state unit to get ready for assembly elections and start searching for suitable candidates. The AICC general secretary has reportedly warned leaders that the party was supreme, not groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-poll-debacle-revamp-talk-gets-stronger-in-kerala-congress/story-jTLABep4S0ptiI0wEfu9PI.html

Ground frost and dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Gurdaspur in Punjab and Churk in east Uttar Pradesh recorded lows of 2 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius respectively, while cold wave intensified in Kashmir with minimum temperatures dropping across the region to stay several notches below the freezing point.Gulmarg in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 7.2 degrees Celsius, Qazigund minus five degrees Celsius, Kupwara minus 4.8 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, in the south, recorded minus 4.9 degrees Celsius, according to the meteorological (MeT) department in Srinagar.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh; scattered rainfall/snowfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and isolated rain/thundershowers over northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on 27th-28th December,” the IMD said in its all-India weather bulletin.The minimum temperature in Delhi rose slightly under the influence of the Western Disturbance (WD) affecting the upper Himalayas, according to the IMD.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6 degrees Celsius as against 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday.However, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the relief will be short-lived.The WD will lead to “scattered to fairly widespread” snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.Once the wind system withdraws, cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely to occur in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan from December 28-29, it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.Biting cold conditions continued to prevail in Haryana and Punjab, with Gurdaspur recording a minimum temperature of 2 degrees Celsius.While Gurdaspur was the coldest place in Punjab, Narnaul was the coldest at 3.3 degrees Celsius in Haryana, the MeT department in Chandigarh said.In Haryana, Karnal, Rohtak, Ambala and Hisar recorded respective minimums of 3.8 degrees Celsius, 5.4 degrees Celsius, 4.6 degrees Celsius and 5.8 degrees Celsius.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, registered a low of 4.1 degrees Celsius.In Punjab, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded respective minimums of 4.8 degrees Celsius, 4.2 degrees Celsius and 3.9 degrees Celsius.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’, the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake, as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The weather has remained dry and cold across Kashmir since the snowfall on December 12, with the night temperature staying several degrees below the freezing point, the MeT department said.It has forecast light rain or snow in the Kashmir Valley over the next three days.The officials said Srinagar — the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — recorded a low of minus 5.2 degrees Celsius – down from the previous night’s minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.They said the mercury in Pahalgam tourist destination in south Kashmir settled at minus 5.9 degrees Celsius, up more than a notch compared to the previous night’s low of minus 4.5 degrees Celsius.The chances of snowfall are most frequent and maximum during the 40-day period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall, the officials said.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ -- which began on December 21 -- will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).Himachal Pradesh’s Keylong, Kalpa, Manali, Mandi, Solan, Sundernagar and Bhuntar shivered at sub-zero temperatures.Keylong was the coldest place in the state at minus 11.6 degrees Celsius, MeT Centre, Shimla, Director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa in Kinnaur district and Manali in Kullu district recorded lows of minus 3.4 and minus 0.6 degree Celsius, he added.Besides Mandi, Bhuntar, Sundernagar and Solan recorded lows of minus 2, minus 1.6, minus 1.2 and minus 0.5 degrees Celsius respectively. Dalhousie and Kufri recorded lows of 2.9 and 3.6 degrees Celsius respectively.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places, while some places witnessed dense to very dense fog, the MeT department in Lucknow said.The weather in the state was dry, it said.State capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 5.9 degrees Celsius, Allahabad 7.2 degrees Celsius, Kanpur 5.8 degrees Celsius, Bareilly 4.3 degrees Celsius and Fursatganj 3.1 degrees Celsius.Mount Abu, the only hill station of Rajasthan, was recorded the coldest place in the state at 2 degrees Celsius even as several places saw an increase of two-three notches in night temperatures.In the plains, Sriganganagar, Alwar and Sawai Madhopur recorded 6.2, 7.2 and 7.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday night.Madhya Pradesh, especially its western region, is likely to experience cold wave conditions for the second time this month from December 29, an IMD official said.Large parts of the state had witnessed biting cold conditions last week. However, the chill had subsided slightly and minimum temperature had increased to some extent over the last few days.“Cold wave conditions are likely to prevail in Madhya Pradesh, especially its western part, for the second time this month from Tuesday. These conditions may continue for the next three to four days after that,” P K Saha, a senior meteorologist with IMD’s Bhopal office, said.“The westerly disturbance has caused snowfall in northern India. This is going to bring chilly winds to Madhya Pradesh by Tuesday. But the cold wave conditions are not expected to last long in the state,” he said.Extreme cold wave conditions are unlikely next week, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-below-5-degrees-celsius-at-many-places-in-north-india-imd-forecasts-cold-wave-later-this-week/story-9cZEJ3iIA1iGeQspbg3IwK.html
27-12-2020||India||136th foundation day of Congress: Rahul Gandhi absent, farmers’ protest focus of tomorrow’s events||The 136th foundation day of the Indian National Congress will be observed through various campaigns on December 28. The All India Congress Committee earlier asked the state units to come up with innovative campaign ideas to connect with the youth. Tiranga Yatra and Selfie with Tiranga are two campaigns that the party has launched apparently to engage with people on nationalism plank. However, Rahul Gandhi is out of India and will be away for a few days, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala confirmed on Sunday after reports of him leaving the country a day ahead of the party’s foundation day started doing the rounds on social media.The focus of this foundation day will also be on the ongoing farmers’ protest which the party has been supporting from the beginning. Rahul Gandhi has also sharpened his attack on the government and PM Modi regarding the farmers’ protest. Also Read | Mentioned same reforms during 2019 election: Sitharaman reminds Rahul Gandhi of Cong’s manifestoThe Indian National Congress was formed on December 28, 1885, and its first session was held in then Bombay from December 28 to December 31.

The INC fought for and won India’s independence, forged the constitutional idea of India, built up the nation from one of the poorest (when India gained independence) in the world to a global superpower,” AICC said in its press release. The anniversary comes at a time when the Grand Old Party is battling crises both inside and outside. The electoral crisis has been aggravated by a rebellion inside as several veteran Congress leaders, including a few former CMs, wrote a letter demanding organisational reforms in the party. On December 19, Congress president Sonia Gandhi met the dissenters and several other senior leaders at her 10, Janpath residence where it has been indicated that there will be an election for the president post. It was learnt that most leaders in the meeting opined that they want Rahul Gandhi as the president. The last election was held in 1997 under Sitaram Kesri at the Calcutta plenary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-foundation-day-farmers-protest-in-focus-state-units-to-organise-tiranga-yatra-on-december-28/story-0jxaJmg5hxkMbBqaznJh2I.html
27-12-2020||India||Rajinikanth discharged from hospital, advised week’s bed rest||Tamil superstar and aspiring politician Rajinikanth was discharged from a private hospital in Hyderabad on Sunday and has been advised bed rest for a week. He was admitted to the hospital on December 25 with ‘severe hypertension and exhaustion’ and was discharged after his blood pressure stabilised. He has returned to Chennai.In addition to medication and diet, the 70-year-old actor has been advised “minimal physical activity and avoid stress,” Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, said a statement. “In view of his post-transplant status, labile hypertension and age” he has to be in complete bed rest for one week with regular monitoring of his blood pressures and “has also been counselled to avoid any activity that increases the risk of contracting Covid-19”. While leaving the hospital, the veteran actor waved to fans who had gathered outside. It remains to be seen how Rajinikanth would forge ahead with his political plans ahead of the 2021 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. Earlier this month, he had declared that on December 31 he would announce the launch date for his political party which he is expected to float in January 2021. Leaders of several political parties in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have wished Rajinikanth a speedy recovery. “As of now there is no change (on announcing party date on December 31) but after meeting him we will get a clearer idea,” said a person close to Rajinikanth. The person who did not wish to be named, said that a meeting may take place on Monday. When asked if the announcement will be done virtually on social media, he said that it would be Rajinikanth’s decision. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic Rajinikanth’s political foray has remained doubtful as doctors had advised him against a hectic lifestyle at the age of 70 since he had undergone a kidney transplant in 2016. But the actor sprung a surprise earlier this month saying that though there were health concerns, he was ready to sacrifice his life for the people of Tamil Nadu and made two appointments for his yet to be launched party. At that time, Rajinikanth had also said that he had 40% shooting left to be completed for ‘Annathe’ which is being produced by late DMK leader M Karunanidhi’s grand-nephew Kalanidhi Maran’s Sun Pictures. Rajinikanth had been shooting in Hyderabad for almost ten days for his upcoming film ‘Annathe’ but it was suspended on December 23 after four crew members tested positive for Covid-19 during a routine test on the film sets. Rajinikanth also underwent a Covid-19 test on December 22 and although it was negative, he had isolated himself. He was admitted to Apollo Hospitals after ‘severe fluctuations’ in his blood pressure. Since then, a thorough check up did not reveal anything alarming. He was discharged since his blood pressure had stabilized and his medical condition had improved, the medical bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajinikanth-discharged-from-hospital-advised-week-s-bed-rest/story-WGUP1wTV09EB3bddzWNr6H.html

27-12-2020||India||It has been a contented journey, says Aarya Dharmchand Kumar||Actor-cum-fitness coach Aarya Dharmchand Kumar believes that doing too many period shows keeps one back from becoming a household name, “When you are into too many shows where you are playing someone from history and your make-up and costumes transform you into a new being, it becomes difficult to get that instant recognition and become a known face. I did too many such shows as I needed work and they did provide me a base but with little or no identification.So,I waited for that one show to change things for me,” said the ‘Dharmakshetra’ actor. Aarya has a strong Lucknow connect as he did his hotel management course from IIHM, Lucknow before taking to acting. “I hail from Jammu and was in an army school. There was this one cinema hall near my school where I spent most of my time watching films of big stars. That fascination has stayed with me till date. Before starting my career in the show business, I did my hotel management course from IIHM, Lucknow. Those were golden days as I got a lot of stage exposure during college fests. After the course, me and my friends reached Delhi for work. I decided to go for auditions and thankfully got a Punjabi show before landing in Mumbai to pursue acting,” he said. For the suave actor, the turning point was the role of a police officer. “When I was offered ‘Armanon Ka Balidaan-Aarakshan’ I knew it would change my career. It did and since then there was no looking back. Shows happened and good work came my way. So I feel it has been a contented journey. Currently I’m playing Joseph in the ongoing show ‘Yeshu’ and loving every bit of it,” said Aarya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-has-been-a-contented-journey-says-aarya-dharmchand-kumar/story-dn1zfGUV4JHuGl0YvCUWjM.html
27-12-2020||India||PM Narendra Modi gifted Inner Line Permit to Manipur, says Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “gifted Inner Line Permit (ILP)” to Manipur as he felt that it would be injustice to them since other surrounding states have the regime.“The Inner Line Permit (ILP) was the biggest gift to the people of Manipur by the Prime Minister Modi as he felt that it would be injustice (to people of Manipur) as other surrounding states had it,” Shah said during his visit to Imphal as he recalled various initiatives taken up by the Modi government since it came to power.ILP is issued to grant inward travel permission to an Indian citizen for a limited period into a state where it is in force. The ILP regime was formally introduced in Manipur on January 1, 2020Chief minister Biren Singh welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow an ILP regime in Manipur. “The government under the leadership of Narendra Modi, unexpectedly took the decision of enforcing ILP in Manipur giving tremendous joy to the people and home minister Amit Shah took a crucial role in making the historic decision possible,” he said.Manipur is the fourth state in the Northeast to have the ILP regime. Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh are the three other states that have the ILP system.Shah went on to say that development in the Northeast is a priority for Prime Minister Modi.“Manipur was earlier known for insurgency, blockades and bandhs. But in the last 3 years, we have not seen any bandh. I would like to congratulate chief minister Biren Singh as he has given the state a new face of progress.”He also appealed to civil society organisations in the State to include topics of development in their demands as growth in sectors like health, education among others are the key to development of a region.Shah laid foundation stones for seven projects including Churachandpur Medical College and IT-SEZ at Mantripukhuri. He also inaugurated the much awaited Rs 1,998-crore Thoubal multi-purpose project and the Rs 475-crore Bishnupur-Tupul-Thoubal-Kasom Khullen road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-gifted-inner-line-permit-to-manipur-says-amit-shah/story-YzyrF4jCIahKNMwhnj8qNM.html
27-12-2020||India||‘We’re not holidaying at Delhi’s borders, here to seek answers’, says Hannan Mollah||Farmers camping at various Delhi borders are here not for a “holiday” but to seek answers from the Centre to their grievances, farmer leader Hannan Mollah said on Sunday as he criticised the government for a lack of response to their proposal for talks on December 29. Farmer groups protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws have proposed a meeting with the government at 11 am on December 29, but they are yet to receive any response from the government, he claimed. Previously, five rounds of talks between the farmer unions and the government have failed to break the deadlock. “Thousands of farmers who are bearing the winter chill and have gathered at the borders are not here for a holiday. The government till now said that we did not want a meeting, now that we have specifically told them when, where and what of the meeting, there is no response from them. Now, it is for the people to decide who are liars. We acknowledge that there cannot be a resolution without a dialogue with the government,” the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary said. Mollah said the farmer unions have proposed four specific talking points for the December 29 meeting -- the government stating the procedure for repealing three farm laws, procedure to make minimum support price (MSP) for crops a legal right, release of Punjab farmers arrested in pollution-related cases, and repeal of the Electricity Amendment Bill. “While there is no response from the government, they are busy pushing an agenda on the movement which was never ours to start with. Out of the 500 organisations which are part of the farmer struggle, around 10-11 would be Left-leaning. They want the people to believe that crores of people are responding to the call of the Left parties? If this were true, then we would have a revolution,” the 76-year-old leader, who is also a CPI(M) politburo member, told PTI. Mollah was an eight-term MP from West Bengal’s Uluberia constituency. However, despite his political links, he has a reputation of reviving and aiding farmer protests and movements across the country and has been part of the protests against the land acquisition law and the farmers’ stir in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh. He has now emerged as one of the most prominent faces of the farmer agitation against the three controversial agri-marketing legislations. While the government has attacked the Left parties for supporting and misusing the farmer protests for their own agenda, Mollah and the other farmer leaders have strongly refuted the charge. Mollah alleged that these lies were being spread by the government to isolate the movement and said that no political party was ever part of the farmer protests, nor were they ever consulted over it. “The government is talking like the grandson of Goebbels (Joseph Goebbels was a German Nazi politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany).... Quote me on this. We have repeatedly said that we have not allowed any political party to drive our protest. No political party was consulted when we launched the movement.This is just a way to isolate the Kisan movement in front of the people,” he said. Asked if after months of struggle there is a sense of hopelessness and inertia creeping in among the protesting farmers and their leaders, Mollah said that the movement was driven by the common farmers and the leaders were following them, not the other way round. “The farmers have come ready to sit here for the next six months. If any leader even asked them to move, he will probably be lynched. They have decided to go home after achieving what they want. However, at the end of the day, we are fighting a government machinery and the poor can only fight, they can’t do anything else,” he said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and some other states have been protesting at various border points of Delhi against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-re-not-holidaying-at-delhi-s-borders-here-to-seek-answers-says-hannan-mollah/story-CzhAdD3ZrpAWF2gUrRiQbO.html

Hence, he has come up with a new slogan “No Corona, Corona No”, which is for the new variant of the infection detected in the UK first, and then in several other places. The news strain is believed to be more contagious and capable of infecting young people as well.“Earlier I gave the slogan ‘Go Corona, Corona Go’ and now corona is going. For the new coronavirus strain, I give the slogan of ‘No Corona, Corona No’,” the minister told ANI. Earlier I gave the slogan 'Go Corona, Corona Go' and now corona is going. For the new coronavirus strain, I give the slogan of 'No Corona, Corona No': Union Minister Ramdas Athawale pic.twitter.com/ND2RQA7gAYThe earlier slogan was coined by Athawale in February when the infection just started to surface in India. He started the slogan as he took part at a prayer meet at Mumbai’s Gateway of India. He chanted the slogan ion March 5, when several Indians, inspired by PM Modi, switched off the lights and lit candles, diyas etc. Meanwhile, the minister has claimed that his earlier slogan became world famous. “I gave the slogan in February, when the Covid-19 situation was not as bad in India. At that time people were saying, will this make corona go away? Now we are seeing this slogan all across the world,” he had said in April.In October, however, he tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-corona-corona-no-this-is-ramdas-athawale-s-slogan-for-covid-19-uk-variant/story-PNTt8PkPle7m9v7hSrWkGJ.html

The country’s debt burden amount is more than the national revenue. If our prime minister can sleep peacefully in such a situation, he should be praised,” the Rajya Sabha member said.“People lost their lives due to the pandemic, but the Parliament lost its soul. Farmers are protesting against three agriculture laws, but the government ignored their sentiments and instead raised emotional issues like the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” he said.The future of India’s parliamentary democracy came under threat this year, he said. Prominent personalities have informed Modi that instead of building a new Parliament complex at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore, that money should be spent on improving the healthcare facilities, he added.“Funds are being collected from people for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. If a similar crowd-funding activity is carried out for the new Parliament complex, even Rs one lakh would not be collected as such buildings have become useless for people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-pushed-back-chinese-investments-not-china-soldiers-sanjay-raut/story-RutGalh3MKHVve1pFWjd7O.html

I strongly feel that one should be financially independent in today’s world to fulfill one’s dreams, else all the hard work goes in vain,” said the ‘Players’ actor. Talking about her early days, Shweta said, “Ace designer Rohit Bal saw me at the party and asked to walk for his show. And, that show made me a known face! Along with a number of musical videos, I did a Delhi-based film ‘Let’s Enjoy’. Coming to Mumbai was because of my crush of that time (laughs). It was in 2007, I won a mega-model contest and was doing TV commercials. Actor-producer Suniel Shetty saw me on a billboard and I got a three-film deal contract from his production house but those films got delayed due to various reasons. That contract bound me from taking work from other makers and I missed on really good projects including ‘Dev D’.” Shweta made a debut in the film industry with ‘Mission Istanbul’ and did a number of films including Telugu cinema. “For me work is important and so I’m happy doing regional films too. My recently released film ‘Omprakash Zindabad’, that was extensively shot in Lucknow with legendry actors like late Om Puriji and Jagdeepji, finally saw the light of the day. Shooting in Lucknow and nearby districts was a memorable experience for me. I fell ill during that period but shooting in a village was life changing stint for me,” said Shweta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/being-contract-bound-i-missed-on-many-projects/story-QNFXCOC9h06cXnZcPsiY6I.html

On her visit to Varanasi she said, “There are lot of offers coming for web-series but most of them have bold shots with erotic content. And I’m not game for something that I don’t believe in.” Urvashi who has also done episodic for TV shows like ‘Adaalat’ and ‘Saavdhan India’ feels bold content is not her cup of tea, “I have turned down three offers as I am not convinced doing bold shots. I love to act but I need to be convinced before taking up a project. Unnecessarily stripping in front of a camera is not a performance. But, if bold content is part of the script and worth it then I will surely do it,” says the actor. Urvashi accepts to sustain in Mumbai one needs to work. “When I don’t shoot, I take up photo shoots and commercials. I have done lot of fashion and bridal shoots for make-up academies, fashion brands and photographers. Besides, I keep giving auditions. I also do talks on mental health which is very important in today’s world.” She was also played parts in shows like ‘Madhubala’, ‘Shapath’, and ‘Kya Hua Tera Vaada’. The actor is also looking for opportunities to expand her horizon. “Being a Gujarati I am business minded. ‘Kuch-na-kuch to dhanda hona chahiye’ is the common mindset in our community. So, I’m exploring options. My visit to Varanasi was this purpose only.” She had been to the city earlier too. “I came here in 2017 but that was just for travel. This time, I explored Bada Bazaar, picked up some stuff as I plan to venture in clothing line exhibition and gradually come up with my start-up.” Going gaga about city’s rich heritage she said. “I love different shades of the city. Though it’s crowded at some places but the fact is that it’s beautiful and peaceful at the same time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-can-t-do-something-i-don-t-believe-in/story-6a3ED27z5MAgkE3b8cSRDM.html

The Punjab Academy of the Delhi government organised a kirtan durbar on Sunday at Singhu border. Kejriwal and Sisodia paid a visit to the musical event and were seated among the audience during the kirtan.Throwing a challenge to the Centre and its ministers to take part in an open debate with the protesting farmers on the provisions of new laws, Kejriwal said, “The government is saying farmers are being misled. They have little understanding of the farm laws. I have heard all speeches and hence I want the government to send its most knowledgeable minister or representative to take part in an open debate with the farmers. It will be clear who has a better understanding.”Also Read: ‘BJP ministers fail to highlight a single benefit of farm laws’: KejriwalSlamming Centre’s attempt to attribute the protest to “anti-social” elements, Kejriwal said, “This is a weapon of all governments. When we took part in Anna andolan, we were also labelled like this. If farmers are anti-national now, then who will feed you? Farmers have been bluffed by all parties for the last 70 years. I want to tell the Centre with folded hands that these protesters are our people. They are fighting for their cause braving this cold. If they are robbed of their farming, what will they do?”As he said earlier, Kejriwal once again pointed out that the laws have no benefits for farmers. “They are saying MSP will not be done away with. The land will not be grabbed. Are these benefits? These are already there,” he said adding that the provision of selling produce anywhere in the country is also no benefit as getting a better price than the MSP.Assuring of all assistance from the Delhi government, Sisodia said, “The Centre wanted to imprison the protesters inside Delhi stadiums. But Delhi CM opposed and ensured that farmers don’t have to suffer in Delhi. In future too, we will do whatever possible for our farmers.”This was Kejriwal’s second visit to Singhu. The protesters are not allowing any political leader to address from their platform. On Sunday too, Kejriwal’s address was at the musical event organised by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-visits-singhu-border/story-X1ZJzKgzVdSnewcS4MAiMK.html

Congress has roughly about 95 or 100 members in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” he told ANI.Recently, Congress’ ally in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena, in its mouthpiece, Saamna, praised Sharad Pawar for his personality and said ‘Sharad Pawar should become the next chairperson of United Progressive Alliance’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upa-chairperson-not-a-pm-post-don-t-think-sharad-pawar-wants-it-p-chidambaram/story-3TU9qDyhGK0TFYzFIFf5KJ.html

It was during his regime that reforms in agriculture sector were introduced and restrictions on transportation of food grains were removed,” Naidu said while releasing a book “Viplava Tapasvi,” written in Telugu by senior journalist A Krishna Rao. The book highlights the different facets of the former prime minister.Naidu reminded that the reforms process was later carried forward by the Vajpayee government and is now being implemented more vigorously by the present Modi government. “He had removed license raj, took up banking reforms, electricity privatization, telecom modernization and steps for boosting exports and attracting foreign investment. He facilitated the entry of India into the World Trade Organization,” he pointed out.Also read: 1991’s reforms too took time to show results - Rajnath SinghNaidu said Rao had a firm belief that the government should not do business but focus on the welfare and development of the nation. “The objective of the economic reforms was to involve the private sector in the development process.

27-12-2020||India||‘Healing Himalayas’: PM Modi praises Pradeep Sangwan’s campaign||Haryanvi youth Pradeep Sangwan’s campaign of clearing plastic waste from different areas of the Himalayas on Sunday drew praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 35-year-old who hails from Gurgaon is a mountaineer based in Himachal Pradesh and he established ‘Healing Himalayas Foundation’ four years ago. Sangwan, along with a team of volunteers, clears tonnes of plastic and other waste left behind by tourists each year. In his last ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast of the year, Modi, while talking about new resolves for the new year, said there are some people who continuously keep doing something new and keep on realising new resolves. “You must have also felt in your life that when you do something for society then the society itself gives us the energy to do much more. Normal sources of inspiration can accomplish great tasks. One such young man is Pradeep Sangwan,” he said. He said Sangwan is running a campaign called ‘Healing Himalayas’ since 2016, as part of which he along with his team goes to different areas of Himalayas and clears the garbage left behind by tourists. “Till now, Pradeep has cleared tonnes of plastic waste from different locations of Himalayas,” Modi said while praising Sangwan’s initiative. Sangwan later told PTI, “It is very inspiring that prime minister acknowledges small efforts by people like me. I thank him for bringing the work, which we are doing for the sake of protecting our environment, to national attention. It will definitely act as a big motivation.” Sharing details of how he launched his campaign, Sangwan said his father was in the Army and alo wanted him to become an officer in the defence forces. However, the destiny took a different course when he could not clear the interview to join the Army. While doing his graduation from Chandigarh’s DAV college, he came into contact with some friends from Himachal Pradesh with whom he started to explore the Himalayas in 2007-08.“I moved to Himachal in 2009, where for the next five years I undertook extensive travelling, treks etc. I met group of people from ‘gaddi’ (shepherd) community in Lahaul when we were doing on such trek from Chandra Taal lake to Suraj Tal lake,” he said. Sangwan said that he along with a friend spent 3-4 days with the members of this community and he was very impressed how, even in a very remote area, they cared so much for their environment. He said the projects of his foundation, which sustains on voluntary donations, are focused on clean-up drives, waste management and other activities in the rural Himalayan region. Each year in December, Sangwan says that he designs a calendar for the following year where volunteers can align their trips accordingly. “While going up for a trek, we collect all the trash. Mainly we find plastic bottles, multilayer packaging plastic waste, and then we store it at one location on the route. While coming back we bring it back to base village and transport it to nearest facility. In the process, we engage mainly our volunteers,” he said. “I recall that during a trek to Kheer Ganga in Kullu district in two days we got 10,000 plastic PET bottles. “Another sad thing we came across is that many people after drinking dispose beer and other glass bottles in a reckless manner or break them. We also come across cases where cows were unable to move because a piece of glass got stuck in their hoof leaving them in great pain,” he said. Sangwan stressed on working at the community level for better results in waste management in the Himalayan region. “My focus remains on Himalayan rural region. We mainly work in the districts of Kullu, Shimla, Mandi and Kinnaur,” hhe said. His foundation has now set up a first waste collection unit, which will be operational soon, in a village called Rakcham near Chitkul in Kullu district, while the second one will come up near Kheer Ganga base camp. Third and the fourth one will come up in Lahaul where Atal tunnel has come up, which is witnessing lot of tourist activity. He sad that in his campaign social media has acted as a powerful tool and more and even film stars like Randeep Hooda, who is from Haryana, have supported and appreciated his cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healing-himalayas-pm-modi-praises-pradeep-sangwan-s-campaign/story-P5b0JQVmUqByHEPqBcFAdP.html

The move was aimed at curbing the misappropriation of the ITC through fake invoicing, he said.“In order to protect small businesses and genuine taxpayers, there are some exemptions to this rule,” he said. The new rule is not applicable in such cases where registered entities have already deposited more than Rs 1 lakh as income-tax in last two years.It is also not applicable to registered entities which have received a refund of more than Rs 1 lakh in the preceding financial year on account of export, he said, adding that government departments and local authorities are also exempted from the rule.“A legitimate business runs for profit and a minimum value addition is expected from them. It is only where a lot of fake credit is used that no tax payment in cash is made,” he said giving the reason behind implementing the new rule.Also read: 1991’s reforms too took time to show results: Rajnath SinghThis rule will help control fake invoices fraudsters who avail and pass on ITC by dummy, fake and dormant entities which show high turnovers but have no financial credibility and flee after issuing fake invoices and misusing ITC, he added. The new rule is the outcome of a thorough deliberation by the GST Law Committee to check the menace of fake invoices and misappropriation of ITC, he said. The government in November launched a nationwide drive to nab such fraudsters. “So far, 175 people have been arrested under the ongoing drive and more than 1,800 cases have been booked against over 8,000 fake entities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-gst-rule-doesn-t-apply-to-msmes/story-smEKFxBooXxXWgNCCCh9YN.html

Our alliance with the Sena in Maharashtra is based on a Common Minimum Programme (CMP) and limited to Maharashtra,” he said.The comments by the state Pwd minister came just a day after Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut called for expansion of the Congress-led bloc saying that the opposition should unite against the “dictatorial attitude” of the Centre and provide a “formidable alternative” to the Narendra Modi government. Raut had also appreciated Sonia Gandhi and said that she effectively led the UPA all these years with many allies in the fold. Responding to a query on a speculation that NCP chief Sharad Pawar may head the UPA, Raut said there was no dearth of leaders in the country.“What is important is the support of people. Apart from Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar has support from a cross-section of people,” he said.Chavan responded to this comment and said that it was not proper for the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to comment on the UPA leadership.“Sharad Pawar himself has denied the speculation that he will be the next chairperson of the UPA. UPA allies trust the leadership of Sonia Gandhi. So there is no need to discuss the issue,” Chavan said.The Shiv Sena heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, of which the NCP and the Congress are constituents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chavan-responds-to-raut-alliance-with-shiv-sena-limited-to-maharashtra/story-FCk3olbtMkpyn9Z8ctywkK.html

During his speech, Rajnath Singh said that when he was the agriculture minister in 2003 he had faced challenges in lowering input costs in farming. He said at that time banks charged 14-18% interest on farm loans.JP Nadda shares old video, take a dig at Rahul Gandhi over criticism of farm laws“It surprised me that interest charged on motor vehicle loans was close to 8% but for a productive sector like farming banks were levying 14-18% interest rates on agricultural loans,” Singh said.“I requested finance minister Jaswant Singh to reduce interest rates for farmers. He was reluctant initially, but after prime minister Vajpayee’s nudge, he agreed to reduce interest rates. PM Modi’s new laws are aimed at continuing the process of reforms which was introduced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee,” Singh further added.Singh also assured farmers all over the country during his speech that under the new laws they now can sell their produce anywhere in the country. He also reiterated his previous proposal from last week where he asked farmers to allow the implementation of the laws for a year and then seek changes if the laws do not prove to be beneficial.The defence minister also hit out at Congress and other opposing parties during his speech saying that the laws have scared elements who previously took advantage of the shortcomings in the agricultural sector. He also said that the Minimum Support Price system (MSP) of procurement will continue.Inner Line Permit biggest gift to people of Manipur by PM Modi: Amit Shah in ImphalLeaders of farmers’ unions on Saturday informed the government that they are ready to sit for another round of discussions on December 29. They have said that discussions can be held if the government agrees on discussing modalities to repeal the newly introduced laws and legal guarantee of procurement under the MSP system.The month-long protest by farmers’ groups at Delhi’s borders has entered its 32nd day. Farmers still believe that the government’s laws will pave the way for contract farming and affect the procurement process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-farm-laws-aimed-to-continue-reforms-vajpayee-govt-initiated-says-defence-minister-rajnath-singh/story-0E7D9YB1zfm6N9E2INEhmJ.html

27-12-2020||India||Manufacturers should ensure products meet global standards : PM Modi||With the focus on self-reliance and indigenous production, manufacturers should ensure that their products meet global standards, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday . In his monthly radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat, the PM said this is an opportune moment to work with the ethos “zero effect, zero defect”. “I urge manufacturers and industry leaders of the country…people of the country have taken a firm step…moving a bold step forward…vocal for local is reverberating in each and every household….in such a scenario, it is time to ensure that our products meet global standards. Whatever is global best; we should make it in India and prove it. For that, our entrepreneur friends have to come forward. Startups too have to come forth,” he said. To give a fillip to indigenous production in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, the Union government has announced a Rs 20 lakh crore economic package under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. The PM also gave the call of “vocal for local” to reduce dependence on imports. Referring to the demand for local products going up, PM Modi said a growing trend of customers demanding India made toys is a big transformation in the mindset. “A huge change has begun in the minds of our countrymen…that too within a year. It is not easy to gauge this change. Even economists would not be able to assess it on their parameters,” he said. Geographical Indication, or GI, tagging for agri products will also aid in the making of a self-reliant India, the PM said, citing the example of saffron from Kashmir. The PM said, “…After obtaining the GI tag certificate, Kashmiri Saffron was launched in a super market in Dubai. Now its exports will get a boost. This will further strengthen our efforts to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Farmers growing saffron will be especially benefited by this” The PM also referred to the need to preserve India’s culture and heritage and recalled how the sons of Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, sahibzade Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh sacrificed their lives to protect the country’s “millennia old culture, civilization and traditions from the cruel misdemeanours of tyrants and tormentors”. “The tyrants wanted sahibzade to renounce their faith; abandon the teachings of the great Guru tradition. But our sahibzade showed amazing courage and determination even at that tender age. During the immurement, as stones began piling up, gradually raising the height of the wall……. Death staring into the face…..despite that, they did not budge even a bit. It was on this day itself that Guru Gobind Singh ji’s mother -Mata Gujari attained martyrdom,” he said. He also referred to his visit to Gurudwara Rakabganj last week where he paid tribute to Guru Tegh Bahadur. The visit came in the midst of the ongoing protests by a large section of farmers from Haryana and Punjab against the farm laws. These agitating farmers have been demanding a repeal of the farm laws. “During this very month, inspired by Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji, many people sleep on the floor. People reminisce, the supreme sacrifices made by family members of Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji with immense reverence,” he said. In the last radio broadcast for the year, the Prime Minister also said that the number of leopards in India has risen by more than 60% between 2014 and 2018. Dubbing this as an achievement, he said, amongst the states with the maximum population of leopards, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are topmost in the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manufacturers-should-ensure-products-meet-global-standards-pm-modi/story-xe56zSSTfSA9cDJNf5rEJJ.html
27-12-2020||India||Validity of vehicle registration, driving license extended till March 31||The validity of crucial documents like driving licence, vehicle registration, and fitness certificates that have expired since February 1 and could not be extended owing to the coronavirus pandemic has been extended until March 31, 2021, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) said on Sunday.This is the fourth such extension for the validity of these documents. The last such extension was done in August, when the government had extended the validity till December 31, 2020. The latest extension is meant to cover documents that expire either by February 1 or by March 31 of 2021. This has been done to help citizens use their private modes of transportation while maintaining social distancing, said the MoRTH. “This will help out citizens in availing transport-related services while maintaining social distancing,” the circular released by the Press Information Bureau said.Keeping in mind the long queues for licence renewal that would violate social distancing norms, and the lockdowns and curfews that are still in force in different parts of the country, the decision of extending the deadline was taken by the Union ministry. “The government has provided for the availability of the essential goods and production thereof and has allowed the vehicles for the transport of such goods/cargo and further opening up the operation of passenger transport in view of the fact that citizens were finding it difficult to get renewed the validity of various documents due to lock-down in operation at various stages in different parts of the country and other countries world over. Renewal of such documents is still leading to the assembly of people and long queues in front of the transport offices across the country,” the Union government said in an advisory to all states and union territories (UTs).The Union ministry has asked all states and UTs to implement the recent advisory in letter and spirit so that citizens do not face additional challenges during an ongoing pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/validity-of-vehicle-registration-driving-license-extended-till-march-31/story-aaHC00v8MY8M9ODWfv1xsJ.html
27-12-2020||India||Took years to see positive results of 1991 economic reforms too, says Rajnath Singh, urges farmers to wait for 2 years||Reiterating Modi government’s commitment to protecting minimum support price so that farmers’ interests are not hurt at any cost, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said it takes some to see the impact of the agriculture reforms. “I appeal to farmers to see changes in the next one and half years. Otherwise, we can improve them through talks,” Rajnath Singh said as he was addressing the people of Himachal Pradesh via video-conferencing on the completion of three years of Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government.“Be it the 1991 economic reforms brought in by the Narasimha Rao government or other ones enacted during the Vajpayee government, it took four-five years to see their positive results. If we can’t wait for four-five years, we can wait for at least two years to witness positive results of the agriculture reforms carried out by the Narendra Modi government,” Singh said.On an earlier occasion too, Rajnath Singh while addressing farmers in Delhi asked them to let the laws be implemented and the wait and see. “The income of farmers will double with the enactment of farm laws,” Rajnath said.Slamming the opposition for misleading farmers, Singh said, “It’s unfortunate that those who don’t even know about farming, are misleading innocent farmers. This govt never intended to stop MSP, neither it will in future. Mandis will also be maintained. No ‘Mai Ka Lal’ can take away land from farmers.”The protesting farmer unions on Saturday decided to resume their dialogue with the Centre and proposed December 29 for the next round of talks to end the deadlock over the three newly enacted farm laws, but made it clear that the modalities for its repeal and guarantee for MSP should be part of the agenda. The agriculture ministry in its last letter to the unions maintained that as MSP does not come under the purview of the three laws that are being discussed, it was not logical to include this in the agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-years-to-see-positive-results-of-1991-economic-reforms-too-says-rajnath-singh-urges-farmers-to-wait-for-2-years/story-lSWsOPggordsxeTxCjuLIO.html

Highlighting the slew of development projects launched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, Shah stated that Manipur - “once a hotbed of insurgency” - is now experiencing a new thrust in development.“Earlier, Manipur was known for insurgency, bandhs, and blockades, but now most militant organisations have joined the mainstream and those left would also do so following efforts of the BJP government,” he said.Shah heralded the recently granted Inner-Line Permit (ILP) system as the best gift for the people of Manipur, one that fulfilled their long standing demand. “Besides granting statehood to Manipur the gift of ILP is the best gift BJP has given the people of Manipur,” the home minister said.Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the decision to grant ILP to Manipur, Shah said, “Modiji realised that Manipur is not having the Inner Line Permit when other states surrounding it had it which is injustice to the indigenous people and he found a way.”The ILP is an official travel document issued by the concerned state government to allow travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for a limited period. It is obligatory for the citizens from outside those states to obtain a permit for entering into the protected state. The objective behind this is to prevent settlement of other Indian nationals in ILP states so as to protect the indigenous population and their access to land, jobs, and other facilities. Besides Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland also come under the ILP system.Shah also talked about the IT SEZ worth Rs 950 crore that will be soon opened which he estimated would contribute around Rs 4,600 crore towards Manipur’s GDP.The home minister also promised a medical hospital in a designated tribal area and urged chief minister N Biren Singh to look into establishing a college for forensic sciences in Manipur in collaboration with the esteemed Institute of Forensic Science for the benefit of the students here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inner-line-permit-biggest-gift-to-people-of-manipur-by-pm-modi-amit-shah-in-imphal/story-Ud89flKymJPNEBBbOoYQnN.html

The exercise will continue for two days, December 28 and 29, in two districts each. There will be no vaccine involved in the process, which will only check the feasibility of the plan which involves real-time monitoring through Co-WIN app.Though India has not given a nod to any vaccine for emergency use, Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, tested and manufactured in India by Serum Institute, is the front-runner. Once the UK drug regulator gives its approval to the vaccine, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation is likely to hold a meeting where the details will be reviewed and the nod will be given after evaluation.Also Read: Covid-19: Vaccination dry run to be held in 4 states next weekFor Covid-19 vaccination, as many as 2,360 participants were trained during a national-level training of state immunisation officers, cold chain officers, information, education and communication officials and development partners.Here’s how the dry run will take place1. It will be a mock drill. Everything except vaccine administering will be tested. Data will be fed to Co-WIN app, cold storage will be tested, the transport of vaccines from cold storage to the sites, crowd management at sites will be checked. 2.

Nadda was referring to the staunch criticism of farm laws by the Opposition.Rahul Gandhi can be seen narrating a story of a Uttar Pradesh farmer in the video. “A farmer from UP once asked me how it was possible that that while he sold potatoes for Rs 2 per kilogram, his children bought packets of potato chips, with each one having chips worth one potato, for Rs 10 each,” he said. ये क्या जादू हो रहा है राहुल जी?पहले आप जिस चीज़ की वकालत कर रहे थे, अब उसका ही विरोध कर रहे है।देश हित, किसान हित से आपका कुछ लेना-देना नही है।आपको सिर्फ़ राजनीति करनी है।लेकिन आपका दुर्भाग्य है कि अब आपका पाखंड नही चलेगा। देश की जनता और किसान आपका दोहरा चरित्र जान चुके है। pic.twitter.com/Uu2mDfBuIT“On being asked why he thought this was happening, the farmer said it was because they were unable to sell their products directly to the factories making chips. If there was provision for us to sell our produce directly, without middlemen, all profit would reach us,” he added.The video clip, from 2015, shows Rahul Gandhi speaking on what prompted the Congress to undertake the Amethi Food Park project.The BJP government at the Centre has been saying that the new farm laws, passed by Parliament in September, will be liberating for small farmers. According to the government, the laws will shield farmers from middlemen and increase their income. The group of farmers protesting against the laws, however, feel that they will put them at the mercy of big landowners. They have proposed December 29 as the date for the next round of talks with the government. This will be the sixth round of meetings between Union ministers and farmer groups.The three contentious farm laws are: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-shares-old-video-take-a-dig-at-rahul-gandhi-over-criticism-of-farm-laws/story-QFnqO63iQHVwwYWMDvoOqN.html

27-12-2020||India||‘Request CBI to share findings in Sushant Singh Rajput case’: Maharashtra minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Sunday that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should reveal the findings of the investigation in Sushant Singh Rajput case.“It has been more than five months since the investigation began but CBI has not revealed if actor Sushant Singh Rajput was murdered or he died by suicide. I request CBI to reveal findings of the investigation at the earliest,” Deshmukh said.The actor was found dead in his Mumbai residence on June 14. Mumbai Police, which said the actor died by suicide, was carrying out the initial investigation of the case. In August, the Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe into the case.The CBI approached the forensic department of the AIIMS for a second opinion on Rajput’s autopsy. The forensic team submitted its report to the CBI and reportedly asserted that there was no mark to prove that it was not a suicide.Several agencies have launched parallel probe into the case: The CBI is probing the ‘suicide’ case, while Enforcement Directorate is probing a money-laundering angle and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is probing a drugs-related angle.Several Bollywood stars have been questioned by the NCB as part of its investigation. The NCB probe is based on some WhatsApp chats involving drugs.The agency had earlier arrested Rajput’s girlfriend, actress Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, some employees of the late filmstar and a few others under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Rhea, her brother, and some other accused were later granted bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-cbi-to-share-findings-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-maharashtra-minister/story-Z0AZvNTLV9xREvOSnQvryK.html

27-12-2020||India||MP govt’s bill against forced conversions exempts re-conversions||The Madhya Pradesh Cabinet on Saturday approved a proposed law to regulate inter-faith marriages in the state that provides for 10 year jail for ‘forcing’ women, minors, and people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe to undergo religious conversion, while exempting reconversion to parental religion from its purview.The proposed law called the Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Bill 2020 says ‘Paitrik Dharm me Wapsi’ will not be treated as conversion. “Under this legislation, re-conversion to the ancestral religion will not be treated as conversion,” said the draft law, defining ancestral religion as the religion of the father of the person at the time of his birth.Giving the reason for this clause, Madhya Pradesh home minister, Nirottam Mishra, said re-conversion will not be a punishable offence under this law because it is more a realisation of a mistake than a crime. The proposed legislation will replace the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, and is stringent then the similar law enforced by the Uttar Pradesh government through an Ordinance.The UP law does not provide for parental property rights to the children of inter-faith marriage, monthly maintenance and Rs 50,000 fine for inter-faith marriage without the permission of the district magistrate. In UP, the fine amount is Rs 25,000. The jail term in the two laws are the same, shows an analysis of the proposed legislations of the two neighbouring states.Mishra said, “The bill seeks to prohibit religious conversions or an attempt of conversion by means of misrepresentation, allurement, threat, undue influence, coercion, marriage, and any other fraudulent means. The conspiracy and (the act of) abetting a person for conversion has also been prohibited.” Mishra said the bill has a provision of punishment from one to 10 years of imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 1 lakh for conversions. According to draft of the bill approved, “The forced conversion of woman, minor, scheduled castes and scheduled tribe will attract 2-10 years imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 50,000. Mass forced conversion will attract 5-10 years of jail term and fine upto to Rs 1 lakh. Burden of proof will lie on the accused.” “Forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognizable offence and be non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring inter-faith forceful marriages and forced conversions null and void. Before conversion, the person and religious gurus have to inform the district magistrate at least 60 days prior to the scheduled date of marriage. The violation of this rule will attract 3-5 years of jail and a minimum fine of Rs 50,000,” according to the approved draft of the proposed bill. Also Read: In Madhya Pradesh, panchayat and local body polls deferred for 3 monthsMishra said, “MP government has come up with the toughest rule against forced conversion in India. With providing justice to the victim of forced conversion, the proposed legislation will ensure her rights too.” Retired high court judge, AK Gohil, said, “The bill doesn’t have any provision to deal with past cases of forced conversions and there is no time limit for lodging a complaint with the police after the marriage. Like the Dowry Prohibition Act, which has a time limit of lodging an FIR up to seven years of marriage, this proposed act should also mention the time limit of lodging an FIR.” MP Congress Committee spokesperson Narendra Saluja said, “We welcome this bill but the provisions under this bill serve the BJP agenda instead of helping women. The BJP is trying to create a rift in the society to win elections.” Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind state president Hazi Haroon said, “From chief minister to BJP MLAs, all the BJP leaders are using the bill as a step against ‘Love-Jihad’. BJP leaders are targeting Muslim community with this bill. If Love-Jihad is really a big issue and a crime, then they should have mentioned this in the bill. But the state government has not mentioned it as they know that the bill can be easily challenged in the court of law.” Raising concern over reconversions, social activist, Indira Iyengar, said, “Now, the violent incidents against the members of the Christian community will increase in the name of reconversion. In tribal areas, the saffron organisation members are already targeting converted Christians. Now, they will get freehand to threaten people to lodge fake complaints of forced conversion and also force tribals to reconvert into Hindu religion.” MP BJP spokesperson, Rajnesh Agrawal, said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan clearly said this bill is a part of Beti Bachao Abhiyan of the MP government. The bill is against forced conversions and not against conversions. People are free to change their religion by just informing the district magistrate. The Congress leaders are nowadays working to misguide people to win their lost political ground. But citizens of MP are intelligent enough to understand right and wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-s-bill-against-forced-conversions-exempts-re-conversions/story-N8XryMFE6gKM4SzrAjLMsK.html

The decision has been taken to further escalate the protests against the three farm laws. Earlier, the farmer union leaders had said that the toll plazas will remain open for three days from December 25 to 27. But in a late night meeting on Saturday, farmer leaders said that they will not allow the toll companies to charge from commuters until the Union government accepts their demands.“We have met several farmers and representatives of farmer unions and it was decided that the toll plazas to will not be allowed to charge from commuters indefinitely”, Bhartiya Kisan Union state president Gurnam Singh Charuni said.He said that the farmers will continue their protests at all toll plazas in the state until the farmers’ protests at Delhi borders are not ended.On the morning of December 25, the protesting farmers gathered at the toll plazas, forcing employees collecting toll to leave. They removed barricades from the toll gates allowing free movement of motorists.Even women and children joined the protests at Kitlana toll plaza in Dadri, while farmers parked their tractor-trolleys on the roadside and sat on a dharna near Makrauli toll plaza on the Rohtak-Chandigarh highway and at Madina toll plaza on the Rohtak-Hisar highway.Also Read: Farm unions agree to talk to govt on Dec 29The farmers also took over Bastara toll plaza in Karnal on NH- 44, which connects Delhi with several northern states. They also took control of the Gullarpur toll plaza on Assandh-Karnal highway, the Thana toll plaza in Pehowa of Kurukshetra on Hisar-Chandigarh highway, Panipat toll plaza on NH-44 and Dahar toll plaza on Panipat-Rohtak highway.Meanwhile farmers from Haryana and Punjab continued their sit-in at the Shambhu toll plaza near Ambala on the Delhi-Amritsar NH-44 for the second day.Also Read: RLP joins protest, leaves NDA over new farm lawsThe concessionaire of Bastara toll plaza on National Highway 44, near Karnal, is likely to suffer a loss of around Rs 1.20 crore per day due to the toll-free movement of vehicles forced on the toll plaza.The toll plaza officials said that per day collection at Bastara is around Rs 1.20 crore to Rs 1.30 crore as 40,000 to 50,000 vehicles cross the toll plaza every day.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the losses suffered by the toll companies will ultimately be borne by the public since the concessionaires’ contracts will get extended to cover for the days they could not charge toll as is categorically mentioned in their contracts.“Opening toll plazas will not cause any loss to the government or the toll companies and it won’t benefit anybody,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-extend-toll-free-movement-in-haryana-indefinitely/story-Fee9Y93YijMMSX369pzcBO.html

27-12-2020||India||Vehicles with caste stickers to be seized in UP: Report||Caste has always been pivotal to electoral politics in Uttar Pradesh. But in the past few years, it has become a fad to boldly display caste identities on windscreens or number plates of vehicles in the state.Castes like Yadav, Jat, Gurjar, Brahmin, Pandit, Khatriya, Lodhi and Maurya appear to be competing with each other in asserting their dominant social or political status by putting the caste and sub-caste name tags on their SUVs, cars, motorcycles and other vehicles.But now, the Uttar Pradesh transport department has started cracking down on vehicles donning ‘casteism’. According to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan, the transport department has launched the drive after instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).The vehicles displaying caste stickers will now be seized, according to Hindustan which quoted from an order sent by Additional Transport Commissioner Mukesh Chandra to all Regional Transport Offices (RTOs).The PMO took cognizance of the matter after a letter from a teacher in Maharashtra, Harshal Prabhu, Hindustan reported. He wrote the letter on IGRS, an integrated system designed for redressal of grievances. Prabhu said that the display of such stickers is a threat to social fabric of the society.The PMO took note of the letter and sent it to the Uttar Pradesh government after which such drive was launched, according to Hindustan.“Such stickers should not be pasted on the vehicles. Those who are found guilty of the offcemce, their vehicle will be seized. According to our enforcement teams, every 20th vehicle is found carrying such a sticker. Our headquarters has asked us to take action against such vehicle owners,” DK Tripathi, deputy transport commissioner, Kanpur, told Hindustan.The practice of some people displaying their particular caste identities on vehicles is said to have come to the fore with greater visibility during the Samajwadi Party (SP) regime under Mulayam Singh Yadav (2003-07) when it became fashionable to drive SUVs and motorcycles with ‘Yadav’ written in bold letters on them.Similarly, vehicles with ‘Jatav’ stickers became more visible during the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) rule even as such vehicles can be spotted even today in some districts, especially in the western UP.Now, Kshatriya, Thakur or Rajput (different variants of the same caste) as a label on vehicles is the new entrant into the caste rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vehicles-with-caste-stickers-to-be-seized-in-up-report/story-HP4Q9ZnO3EKxnPivx1uqUO.html
27-12-2020||India||Year-ender UK: India, Indians figured more in pandemic, politics, protests||India and Indians are historically entwined with Britain at various levels, but 2020 saw the engagement touch a new high: from the “most desi government” in British history, to their mixed role in the Covid-19 pandemic, to India becoming the second biggest investor in the UK.For the first time in British politics, the year saw four persons of Indian origin appointed to the cabinet – Rishi Sunak, Priti Patel, Alok Sharma and Suella Braverman – after Prime Minister Boris Johnson formed his government after a resounding victory in the December 2019 election.Their elevation reflected success not only for the 1.5 million-strong Indian diaspora but also for the UK’s policies of multiculturalism. The near-mainstreaming of the community’s participation in politics was evident in the way they were lauded or pilloried in the news media – just like any other British politician.As James Cleverly, the chairman of the Conservative party said at the Republic Day event in January, Johnson is leading the “most desi government” in British history. Labour also raised the number, including Lisa Nandy, Preet Kaur Gill, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi and Valerie Vaz in the shadow cabinet.It was not unusual to often see Sunak batting for the Conservative party or the government and Nandy responding on behalf of the Labour party in widely-watched news programmes. There is already speculation that Johnson would induct more from the community in 2021.In fact, leading individuals from the community were among top experts regularly commenting and advising on key issues in the mainstream media, such as Anand Menon on Brexit, and Devi Sridhar, Bharat Pankhania and Sunetra Gupta on Covid-19.Experts helping the government deal with the pandemic included Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan, whose term as president of the Royal Society ended in November, and Lalita Ramakrishnan of the University of Cambridge. Among the first to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were Hari Shukla and his wife Ranjan.The pandemic took a heavy toll on the community: as of December 23, as many as 1,188 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in hospitals and care-homes in England alone had passed away – the highest casualty among the non-whites. The larger UK-wide toll included several doctors, nurses and pharmacists from the community.Among the deceased was Gulshan Ewing, 92, the pioneering editor of women’s magazines. Hailing from a Parsi family in Mumbai, she was one of the first women editors of leading Indian publications since the mid-1960s, setting benchmarks in film journalism and focussing on women audience. India came to the UK’s rescue when it faced a severe shortage of paracetamol in the initial stages of the outbreak, when the Johnson government was grappling with ways to deal with the virus. India sent 3 million packets in April, when pharmacies and supermarkets had run out of the drug.Besides politics and the pandemic, India and Indians also featured prominently in education, culture, extraditions, protests and history, as events and issues in India resonated in the UK, particularly those linked to new laws on citizenship, farmers and Kashmir. Also Read: Queen Elizabeth hails Diwali in Christmas message, doesn’t mention pandemicThe Ealing Council in west London announced the renaming of part of Southall’s Havelock Road – named after Henry Havelock, general in the colonial army involved in suppressing the 1857 Uprising – as Guru Nanak Road from early 2021, following a public consultation.At the University of Cambridge, sociologist Manali Desai became the first head of a department in its 811-year history when she was appointed head of the department of sociology. Also, its department of chemistry was named after its alumnus, Yusuf Hamied of pharma major Cipla.The year saw a change of guard in India House. Ruchi Ghanashyam, who was only the second woman Indian high commissioner to the UK since independence (after Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit) was succeeded by Gaitri Issar Kumar. Four idols stolen from India were recovered in the UK and handed over to the mission for return home: A 9th century statue of Natesh Shiva, stolen from the Ghateshwar temple in Chittorgarh district of Rajasthan, and three ancient idols stolen from Tamil Nadu in 1978.The Johnson government allowed India to continue to use a property in north-west London as a museum in the memory of B R Ambedkar, who lived there while studying at the London School of Economics in the 1920s.Also Read: Khalistan supporter’s nomination to UK House of Lords delayed, says Sikh groupNoor Inayat Khan, the Indian-origin British spy, who worked as an undercover radio operator in Nazi-occupied France in 1943, was captured and killed in the Dachau concentration camp in 1944 at the age of 30, received another honour when a ‘blue plaque’ was installed outside the house in Bloomsbury where she lived.Several Indians and members of the community received royal and other honours, including Vice Admiral Vinay Badhwar, who was presented the Alexander Dalrymple Award in recognition of his “outstanding contribution” to Indian hydrography and across the wider Indian Ocean region.Ravi Solanki, a doctor working on neurodegenerative diseases, was honoured by the Royal Academy of Engineering for exceptional achievement in tackling Covid-19, while Ranjitsinh Disale, an inspirational teacher in Maharashtra, won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize set up in partnership with Unesco by the Varkey Foundation.Besides India emerging as the second biggest investor in the UK, the year also saw entrepreneur Karan Bilimoria elected president of the Confederation of British Industry, the representative body of 1.9 lakh UK companies employing nearly 7 million people.114 AI Innovation LLP, a New Delhi-based artificial intelligence company, was among 10 global winners in a UK-US initiative that aims to find, fund and fast-track innovation and technology that gives advantage to military personnel and operations in the space domain.Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa, sons of an immigrant from Gujarat, acquired retail giant Asda (valued at £6.8 billion), months after a new report co-produced by the high commission highlighted the multi-billion-pound ‘diaspora effect’ in British business: over 65,000 companied are owned by British citizens of Indian origin.As Johnson prepares to visit India in January and seek a free trade agreement, ministers and officials identified five sectors for closer cooperation in the post-Brexit UK: information and communications technology and services, food and drink, life sciences and chemicals.Members of the Indian community also continued to feature in crime and convictions, while proceedings to extradite several individuals continued during the year, including Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Sanjeev Chawla (who was escorted to New Delhi).Crime’s cross-country links were evident when the City of London Police hailed raids conducted by the CBI in six Indian cities from where 10 companies were defrauding UK nationals on the pretext of resolving “technical issues” on their computers, while Britain’s border officials seized 174,400 sildenafil tablets sourced from India.On the cultural front, while the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Vikram Seth’s 1993 tome ‘A Suitable Boy’ received mixed reviews, the London Fashion Week – in a first – showcased the magic of sari as models sashayed wearing saris from various parts of India, and the British Fashion Council appointed actor Priyanka Chopra as its new ambassador.Mahatma Gandhi, who had close interaction with London and the British during his lifetime, continued to make news. His statues in London and Leicester became the focus of protests during the Black Lives Matter campaign. But an unnamed buyer surprised many by picking up Gandhi’s spectacles from his time in South Africa for £260,000 in a Bristol auction.---||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-ender-uk-india-indians-figured-more-in-pandemic-politics-protests/story-5sWcgLKEnnhdSYiZu7TGbI.html
27-12-2020||India||‘No discipline in TMC’: Suvendu Adhikari after joining BJP||Suvendu Adhikari, TMC’s Nandigram face who has joined BJP, on Saturday said that there is no discipline in his previous party.The BJP is on the other hand the world’s largest political party and dedicated to the service of the nation, he said at a felicitation programme for those who quit the ruling TMC to join the saffron party.Continuing his comparison, Adhikari said that even resolutions taken at meetings were not recorded in the TMC.Also Read: Suvendu Adhikari’s show of strength day after Trinamool rally. And a boast “We who have quit TMC will work as disciplined soldiers so that BJP comes to power in the state in the assembly poll in 2021 and West Bengal becomes Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal),” he said.“West Bengal has to be handed over to the hands of the able leader Narendra Modi”, Adhikari said.Referring to PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, Adhikari said many states have taken advantage of it to benefit its farmers. But West Bengal government has deprived the farmers from getting those benefits.“It is a need that the party which is ruling the country also comes to power here (in Bengal)”, he said.Speaking at the programme BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said “Didi (Mamata Banerjee) is saying that BJP is an outsiders’ party. Bengal was going to Pakistan. It was the founder Jana Sangh, Syama Prasad Mukherjee who raised his voice against this and present day West Bengal is here due to him”.Hitting out at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for the “outsider” controversy against BJP, Vijayvargiya said she even considers Prime Minister Narendra Modi an outsider.The world recognises Modi’s leadership but not Banerjee, he said. “Modiji is respected by the people of Balochistan in Pakistan who send rakhis to him. Even Amit Shah is termed as an outsider by her. She is trying to create a wave by crying outsiders against people who come to West Bengal”.Vijayvargyia claimed that the car of TMC MP Sunil Mondal, who too recently joined the saffron party, was attacked by TMC workers while coming to BJP office durng the day.“I have sent a report to the union home minister”, he said.Continuing his criticism of Banerjee, Vijayvargiya said that while she wears a white saree and chappal her nephew (TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee) wears spectacles which cost Rs 25 lakh and stays in a Rs seven crore residence which has an escalator.”This is what the Trinamool Congress leaders are saying.” The BJP leader said “Who is behind cattle smuggling, the syndicates? It is her nephew who is behind all these ....TMC is running a dictatorship in the state. In BJP democracy prevails”.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh claimed that the party’s wings are spreading acoss the state. Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme on radio will be aired in every booth on December 27.National vice-president of BJP Mukul Roy, who too had shifted from the Mamata Banerjee-led party in 2017, said BJP knows how to give respect to its workers unlike TMC.“TMC will taste defeat surely and go into oblivion in the next assembly poll”, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-discipline-in-tmc-suvendu-adhikari-after-joining-bjp/story-fXieZz866dnk6KHz1OblFM.html

The meeting was convened by the Indian Council of Meical Research (ICMR) under co-chairpersonship of Dr Vinod Paul, Member NITI Aayog and Dr Balram Bhargava, Secretary, Director General ICMR.It was emphasised that since the UK variant strain is implicated to cause increased transmissibility of the virus, it is critical to identify individuals infected with this strain and adequately contain them to prevent its transmission in India.The NTF concluded that there is no need to change the existing treatment protocol in view of mutations emerging in the strain.The Union health ministry, which took into consideration the recommendations of the NTF, said that since ICMR has always advocated the use of two or more gene assays for testing Sars-CoV-2, it is unlikely to miss infected cases using the current testing strategy.“It is proposed to continue enhanced genomic surveillance for early detection and containment of the UK variant SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, it is important to understand that like all other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate,” the ministry said.The mutated virus can also be contained by measures like social distancing, hand hygiene, wearing masks and also by an effective vaccine, as and when available, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-change-needed-in-treatment-protocol-says-covid-task-force-after-discussions-on-new-strain/story-NqQS75E6OQObcnuhHzSotN.html

It reduces your body temperature,” an advisory from the IMD said.“Get indoors. Eat vitamin-C-rich fruits and moisturize your skin regularly to counter the effects of severe cold,” the advisory further said.In its latest impact-based advisory, the IMD said “severe” cold wave is expected over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and northern Rajasthan from December 29.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the mercury will increase slightly on Sunday and Monday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance affecting the upper reaches of the Himalayas, but the relief will be short-lived.He further said that after the western disturbance moves away and under the influence of the consequent strengthening of cold and dry north-westerly or northerly lower level winds, “cold wave” to “severe cold wave” conditions are likely to re-establish over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and West Uttar Pradesh from December 29.According to IMD, a ‘cold day’ or ‘severe cold day’ is considered when the minimum temperature is under 10 degrees and the maximum temperature is 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degree C below normal. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below, and is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days.Last Sunday, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for national capital Delhi, recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-drink-alcohol-get-indoors-says-imd-as-north-india-braces-for-severe-cold-wave/story-vPKcIJCHhaMCOuosr6pypK.html

This coincided with Heritage Week which provides the culture enthusiasts an opportunity to look back into the past and discover the important phases of history. Despite the Covid-19 crisis, we saw people celebrating the Heritage Week in innovative ways,” PM Modi said.“India’s culture and scripture have always been a centre of attraction for the entire world. Some people came to India in search of them and stayed here for life. While some returned to their countries as cultural ambassadors of India,” he added.The PM also stressed on the need for a strong vibrant and active alumni network and urged educational institutions to adopt innovative methods and develop creative platforms for engagement with alumni.

Six of those seven JD(U) MLAs joined the saffron party on Friday.In a tweet, Chowdhury said, “Dear @NitishKumar Ji, Beware of #BJP, they are well adept and highly skillful in poaching operation like the notorious wild animal poachers of North Eastern region.” Chowdhury, also the West Bengal Congress president, advised Kumar to keep in touch with the opposition, hinting that he might face the same situation in Bihar too.“Before being torn into pieces and to be withered away by the same machination as you are now experiencing in #Arunachal Pradesh, @NitishKumar Ji, explore new ideas which may include keeping in touch with the opposition in Bihar as an antidote to withstand the #ArunachalSyndrome,” Chowdhury tweeted.Kumar is heading an NDA government in Bihar where the number of JD(U) MLAs is much less than that of the BJP.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the main opposition party in Bihar, has hinted at the possibility of a fresh alignment in the state if Kumar chose to snap ties with the BJP following the “humiliation” in Arunachal Pradesh.Chowdhury alleged that the saffron party believes in “exclusive political Atma Nirvar”, construction of only the BJP and destruction of all non-BJP parties.“Under the sun, the thirst of BJP party’s wholesale aggression cannot be quenched,” he claimed.The JD(U) had won seven of the 15 seats it contested in the 2019 assembly elections and emerged as the second largest party after the BJP, which had bagged 41 seats.Following the switchover, the BJP now has 48 MLAs in the 60-member House, while the JD(U) is left with only one.The Congress and the National People’s Party (NPP) have four members each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-in-touch-with-opposition-in-bihar-congress-adhir-advises-nitish-after-arunachal-developments/story-9oRrqcgjSDUENjntDREJIK.html
27-12-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh conversion law tougher than UP’s||The Madhya Pradesh cabinet on Saturday approved a proposed law to regulate interfaith marriages in the state that provides for up to 10 years in jail for “forcing women, minors, and people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to undergo religious conversion” with a special clause on no punitive action against those returning to their ancestral religion.The proposed law called the Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Bill, 2020 says “Paitrik Dharm me Wapsi” (return to the father’s religion) will not be treated as conversion. “Under this legislation, the re-conversion to the ancestral religion will not be treated as conversion,” said the draft law, defining ancestral religion as the religion of the father of the person at the time of his birth.Madhya Pradesh home minister Nirottam Mishra said re-conversion will not be a punishable offence under this law because it is more a realisation of a mistake than a crime. Also Read | Madhya Pradesh cabinet okays bill against forced conversionsThe proposed legislation will replace the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, said Mishra, and is different from the Uttar Pradesh government’s legislation promulgated through an ordinance on November 25. Unlike the MP law, the UP ordinance does not provide for parental property rights to children of an interfaith marriage, monthly maintenance and a Rs50,000 fine for an inter-religion union without permission of the district magistrate. In UP, the fine amount is Rs25,000. The jail terms in the two laws are equal.“The bill seeks to prohibit religious conversions or an attempt of conversion by means of misrepresentation, allurement, threat, undue influence, coercion, marriage, and any other fraudulent means. Such a conspiracy and abetting a person for conversion has also been prohibited,” Mishra said. According to a draft of the bill approved, “The forced conversion of a woman, minor, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe will attract 2-10 years imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs50,000. Mass forced conversion will attract 5-10 years of jail term and fine of up to Rs1 lakh. Burden of proof will lie on the accused.”  “The forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognisable offence and non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring interfaith forceful marriages and forced conversion null and void. The person and religious gurus have to inform the district magistrate at least 60 days prior to the scheduled date of marriage. The violation of this rule will attract 3-5 years of jail and a minimum fine of Rs50,000,” said the bill. “The MP government has come up with the toughest rule against forced conversion in India. By providing justice to the victim of forced conversion, the proposed legislation will ensure her rights too,” Mishra said. Retired high court judge AK Gohil said, “The bill doesn’t have any provision to deal with past cases of forced conversion and also there is no time limit of lodging a complaint with police after marriage. Like the Dowry Prohibition Act, which has a time limit of lodging an FIR up to seven years of marriage, this proposed act should also mention the time period limit for lodging an FIR.” MP Congress committee spokesperson Narendra Saluja said, “We welcome this bill but the provisions are more the agenda of the BJP than a real concern for women. The BJP is trying to create a rift in society to win elections.” Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind state president Hazi Haroon said, “From the chief minister to BJP MLAs, all the BJP leaders are using the bill as a step against love jihad. BJP leaders are targeting the Muslim community with this bill. If love jihad is really a big issue and crime, they should have mentioned this in the bill. But the state government has not mentioned it as they know that the bill can be easily challenged in a court of law.” Raising concern, social activist Indira Iyengar said, “Now, violent incidents against members of the Christian community will increase in the name of re-conversion. In tribal areas, saffron organisation members are already targeting converted Christians. Now, they will get a free hand to threaten people for lodging fake complaints of forced conversion and also for forcing tribal people to re-convert to the Hindu religion.” MP BJP spokesperson Rajnesh Agrawal said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan clearly said this bill is a part of the Beti Bachao Abhiyan of the MP government. The bill is against forced conversion, not against conversion. People are free to change their religion by just informing the district magistrate. Congress leaders are nowadays working to misguide people to win their lost political ground. But the citizens of MP are intelligent enough to understand what is right or wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-conversion-law-tougher-than-up-s/story-6p45HbHvS3gSfa5IOQPR4I.html
27-12-2020||India||India to begin sequencing of genes of 5% Covid +ve samples||India will soon begin sequencing the genes of at least 5% of all Covid-19 positive samples in an attempt to better track mutations, officials in the Union health ministry have said, detailing a new genomic surveillance exercise to be able to better detect if there are any worrying variants of the virus. The moves comes weeks after the UK found a variant with an unusually high number of changes, including some that are believed to make the virus 56%-70% more transmissible. The new strain is as yet not known to cause more severe disease or make the current class of vaccines ineffective. With India reporting 22,383 case a day on average over the last week, it would mean sequencing 1,120 genomes a day. To do this, the government has set-up a genomic surveillance consortium under the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the union health ministry said. Currently, laboratories under the consortium have 50 samples of people who returned from the UK. Separately, the National Task Force on Covid-19 that met on Saturday recommended that whole genome sequencing be also done in cases where the S gene does not show up in an RT-PCR or other molecular testing. Eight of the 23 mutations that have been identified in the new UK variant are on the S gene, including one on the receptor binding domain that is used by the virus to enter the human cells. All molecular tests – such as RT PCR, CBNAAT, and TrueNat -- amplify the genetic material of the virus present the in the swab samples and match it against two or three genes of Sars-CoV-2 to give a positive result. With the new mutations, some tests might fail to recognise the S gene in a patient sample. The NTF has also recommended that the sequencing be done if there is a proven case of re-infection. “The United Kingdom does whole genome sequencing for about 10% of their positive samples, which is one of the highest in the world. That is how they were able to detect the new variant that was spreading quickly in London and some other regions. Sequencing 5% of the total sample will be a very big exercise, but it will be very helpful in giving us information on which variant is in circulation, where should we implement restrictions to stop the spread of a particular variant, and whether the vaccines in development will continue to work against the variant,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Experts have said that the vaccines and natural immunity is likely to work against the new UK variant. To quickly detect and isolate people who might be carrying the mutant variant that is thought to spread 70% faster, the NCDC had already directed all agencies to send positive samples of UK returnees for whole genome sequencing. Whole genome sequencing was also mandated for anyone who tested positive in the community after returning from UK in the last 28 days. The consortium will comprise of laboratories of the National Institute of Virology-Pune, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology- Delhi, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology-Hyderabad, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences-Bangalore among others. “A genomic surveillance consortium – INSACOG -- has been formed under the leadership of NCDC, New Delhi for laboratory and epidemiological surveillance of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the country,” said a release from the union health ministry. Most of these laboratories were already sequencing genomes of Sars-CoV-2, however, it is likely to increase the scale and coordinate the efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-begin-sequencing-of-genes-of-5-covid-ve-samples/story-WbSbm1dxKduKx6o4cKmswJ.html
27-12-2020||India||Congress to firm up poll plan in January||A Congress panel tasked to hold organisational elections is likely to firm up the schedule for the internal polls in the first week of January, people aware of the matter said.A member of the central election authority (CEA) said the panel was to announce the schedule by December-end but got delayed as efforts to build consensus on the presidential candidate are still on. He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with the party leaders, including some members of the group of 23 letter-writers, was part of that consensus-building.“What we gather is that there is a broad consensus among the party leaders on the name now. We will meet in the first week of January and finalise the schedule,” the CEA member said on condition of anonymity.Also Read | ‘Wake up’: Digvijaya Singh calls upon Congress members to join farmers’ stirOnce that is done, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, will meet to clear that.At Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with dissenters and other senior leaders at her 10, Janpath residence on December 19, there was a renewed call for Rahul Gandhi to return as the party chief. While Rahul Gandhi said it would not be appropriate to interfere in the ongoing internal election process, the dissenters are firm that they will not accept a “proxy” candidate and insisted that polls should be held at all levels, including the CWC.As per the Congress constitution, 12 of the 25 CWC members have to be elected by All India Congress Committee (AICC) delegates and the rest are appointed by the party president.The CWC has not witnessed any election in over two decades now. The last time there was an election to the CWC was in 1997 during the Kolkata plenary. Prior to that, the CWC polls took place in 1992 at the Tirupati session.The CEA member quoted above said the panel is expected to wind up the organisational polls by February-end as per the deadline to inform the Election Commission of the completion of the process.Also Read | Amid rumblings in Congress, dissenters stress on need for hands-on chiefHe said that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CEA has decided to restrict the electoral college to AICC members only. “We will not include the co-opted members this time.

27-12-2020||India||Gratuity can be withheld for recovery of dues: SC||The gratuity money of an employee can be withheld and forfeited for recovery of dues such as overstaying in official accommodation, the Supreme Court has ruled. A bench headed by justice Sanjay K Kaul held that there is no prohibition against recovering dues including penal rent -- the rent with penalty for overstaying in official accommodation -- from an employee’s gratuity. “If an employee occupies a quarter beyond the specified period, the penal rent would be the natural consequence and such penal rent can be adjusted against the dues payable, including gratuity,” said the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. The order, issued last week, settles a disputed point of law since a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court had previously taken a view to the contrary. A division bench in 2017 ruled unfavourably against confiscating the gratuity of an employee on account of overstaying in official quarters after his retirement. It had ordered the immediate release of his gratuity and held only normal rent, not the penal rent, should be charged for the period he overstayed. However, the three-judge bench, led by justice Kaul, has now held that any reliance on the 2017 order is “misplaced” since it is not even a judgment but just an order on the given facts of that case. It clarified that the 2017 order cannot be treated as a precedent. In doing so, the larger bench also cited a 2005 judgment of the top court when it upheld recovery of the penal rent from an employee for unauthorised occupation of the accommodation provided to him by the employer. In this judgment, although the court acknowledged that pensionary benefit such as gratuity is not a “bounty”, it had held that recoveries of dues can be made from gratuity without the consent of the employee concerned.The latest case had arisen out of an order by the Jharkhand high court, which snubbed an attempt by the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) to recover penal rent amounting to Rs 1.95 lakh from an employee, who did not clear his dues and overstayed in the official accommodation in Bokaro after his retirement in 2016. The high court relied upon the 2017 order of the top court, and said that the SAIL must release the employee’s gratuity immediately. However, it allowed the SAIL to raise a demand for normal rent. The Supreme Court has now set aside the part of the high court order that held that the SAIL could not recover the dues from the gratuity amount. However, it did not interfere with the monetary aspect of the order, noting that a small amount is involved and that the SAIL’s residential scheme has also undergone change in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gratuity-can-be-withheld-for-recovery-of-dues-sc/story-JMyixieJczdTyGKRgvfzPM.html
27-12-2020||India||RLP joins protest, leaves NDA over new farm laws||The Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) on Saturday announced its decision to walk out of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the recently enacted farm laws.“We are quitting the NDA. Nothing is above the pride of farmers in the country,” RLP chief and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal said at a farmers’ rally in Alwar’s Shahjahanpur after starting a march to Delhi in support of the farmers who have been protesting against the contentious laws. In September, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had quit the NDA over the three farms laws. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 26, demanding a repeal of these laws. “I request the central government to not play with flames. Any government who has dared to go against the farmers has been dethroned. Because of these laws, agriculture mandis will end, why didn’t the government consult the farmers? Because of this act land mafias raj will increase. I don’t understand why the government is not rolling back the laws,” said Beniwal at the protest site. The Centre has maintained that the laws have been enacted for the benefit of the farmers and has offered to give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) will continue. The farmers, however, have rejected the Centre’s offer and demanded that the laws be scrapped.Beniwal was elected as a BJP MLA in Rajasthan for the first time in 2008 but later left the party. He won the 2013 assembly elections as an Independent and formed the RLP ahead of the 2018 assembly elections. His party allied with the BJP for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He had resigned from three parliamentary committees last week in support of farmers’ agitation. The ties between the BJP and RLP were strained earlier this month after the ruling party at the Centre backed an Independent for the post of a local body head instead of RLP’s candidate. Beniwal at the time said that they were reconsidering their alliance with the BJP. The BJP downplayed Beniwal’s exit from the alliance and questioned the motive behind his move to walk out of the NDA. “Earlier, he had supported the agriculture laws but now just to gain political mileage he had quit the alliance,” BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareekh said. Former MP quits BJPFormer MP Harinder Singh Khalsa on Saturday quit the BJP accusing its leadership of having an indifferent attitude towards the protesting farmers. Khalsa,73, had won the Fatehgarh Sahib Lok Sabha seat in 2014 as an Aam Aadmi Party candidate but had been suspended from the AAP for his alleged anti-party activities. He had joined the BJP in 2019.

27-12-2020||India||Spike in air pollution, cold wave conditions likely from Dec 29: IMD||Air pollution levels are likely to spike and ‘cold wave’ to ‘severe cold wave’ conditions are likely to set in over many parts of northwest India, including Delhi, from December 29, the India Meteorological Department has said. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 337 in the “very poor” category on Saturday.Under the influence of an approaching western disturbance, widespread snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad; scattered snowfall is likely over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand; and light rain or thundershowers is likely over northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on December 27 and 28, the IMD said.After the western disturbance moves away and under the influence of the consequent strengthening of cold and dry north-westerly or northerly lower level winds, “cold wave” to “severe cold wave” conditions are likely to re-establish over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and West Uttar Pradesh from December 29.Also Read | Marginal improvement in Delhi’s air quality; remains in severe zone“The impact of the western disturbance will be mainly in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh where moderate rain or snowfall is expected. In Delhi, we can expect clouding and trace rainfall. After the WD passes, cold wave is likely to be established for three to four days from December 29 onwards. We already have very low minimum temperatures bordering cold wave conditions,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Northern parts of Saurashtra, Kutch and west Madhya Pradesh are also likely to experience cold wave conditions. Ground frost conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh between December 28 and 29. ‘Cold day’ conditions are also likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on December 28 and 29 and over North Rajasthan December 29 and 30. Dense to very dense fog is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi on December 28, 29 and 30.According to IMD, a ‘cold day’ or ‘severe cold day’ is considered when the minimum temperature is under 10 degrees and the maximum temperature is 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degree C below normal. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below, and is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. On December 27, when the wind direction changes temporarily to easterly, wind speed is likely to reduce leading to a spike in pollution levels. “We always see that during the transition of winds, air pollution levels go up but after that wind speed is likely to pick up,” said Shrivastava. According to air quality early warning system under the ministry of earth sciences, ventilation index on Sunday is likely to be 3500 m2/s. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 m2/s is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-air-pollution-cold-wave-conditions-likely-from-dec-29-imd/story-ydyWaPqm1yGnBlJBowfWIK.html

A bench of justices Pankaj Naqvi and Vivek Agarwal decided on December 18 a habeas corpus plea filed by the man, who complained his wife had been sent to her parents against her wishes by the Nari Niketan or Child Welfare Committee (CWC).The division bench, after interacting with the woman, noted that she unequivocally expressed her desire to stay with her husband.It said that she is “free to move as per her own choice without any restriction or hinderance being created by third party”. The court also quashed an FIR registered against the man for allegedly abducting the woman.The bench set aside an order of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of remanding the woman to the Nari Niketan while stating that the act of the trial court and the CWC, Etah, reflected a lack of appreciation of legal provisions.The court said the woman was an adult as her date of birth was October 4, 1999 and the trial court did not appreciate the fact that when a school certificate had been produced, then any other evidence would be secondary and should not be relied on.Also Read | About 35 arrests, dozen FIRs as UP ‘love jihad’ law completes one monthThe court was hearing the plea by the husband, who through his counsel had contended that his wife was sent to the CWC against her choice, which, a day later, handed her custody to the parents.On December 16, the court asked police to produce the woman on December 18. On the said date, the court interacted with the woman who said her date of birth was October 4, 1999 and she had attained the age of majority. She told the court that she had entered into wedlock and wanted to live with her husband.Following this, the court said, “As the corpus (woman) has attained the age of majority and she has a choice to live her life on her own terms and she has expressed that she wants to live with her husband, she is free to move as per her own choice without any restriction or hinderance being created by third party”.While quashing the order of the city court, Etah, the bench said it had been passed “without application of mind”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-have-right-to-live-on-own-terms-hc/story-Uq4ukHgt33MVHmUQmhN25J.html

The government is working with a well-knit strategy to ensure the state’s overall development, emphasizing deprived and neglected areas.”Independent MLA Antas Khan defeated his nearest rival and former minister Md Abdul Nasir by a margin of 3078 votes to win the Lilong assembly constituency under Thoubal district in the November by-polls.When contacted over the phone, Independent MLA Antas Khan said, “I extended support to the government as per the wishes of the people in the constituency.”The BJP-led coalition government in Manipur came to power in March 2017 with the support of four MLAs each from NPP and NPF besides one MLA each from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party, and an Independent. BJP’s total strength in the 60-member Manipur assembly which currently has an effective strength of 54 members is 22 MLAs while opposition Congress has 17 MLAs.Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in the state particularly in and around the state capital, with search operations and frisking carried out from time to time.On Thursday, apart from reviewing the preparation activities, Chief Minister N Biren Singh also inspected the preparation work at Hafta Kangjeibung in Imphal where the visiting minister will address a gathering and lay the foundation stones of various projects including a medical college. The Union home minister is also expected to inaugurate some development projects on December 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-amit-shah-s-visit-manipur-s-independent-mla-extends-support-to-bjp-led-govt/story-eEXkmMJ9mWuk4aeQEth8aM.html
27-12-2020||India||After Bodoland Territorial Council poll, BJP to gain majority in Assam polls, says Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday credited the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for unifying the people of Assam with the rest of the country. Addressing a public rally in Assam’s Kamrup district, Shah said the state has embarked on a journey of peace and development under chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.“Assam was earlier known for agitations and violence, but Sonowal and Sarma have unified the people of the state and the region with the rest of the country by upholding and promoting heritage and traditions,” he said.Shah said that BJP-led central government has given priority to Assam and the northeast in the past six years and ensured that the benefits of every scheme reach people in the state.“In Assam, there was a period of movements. Many agitations were launched over different issues in which hundreds of youths were killed. The peace of Assam was disturbed and development was halted,” he said.“There was a time when separatists used to give arms in the hands of the youth in these states. Almost all armed groups have joined the mainstream and the startups launched by youth are competing with other startups globally. What is the way forward? Development is the only way forward. Development is happening and will happen further but ideological change is also needed and that can’t happen only through development,” he said.Referring to the Bodo agreement signed earlier this year, he said the Modi government has initiated the process of establishing peace in Assam. “The Bodoland Accord was the biggest success,” he said. “Bodo youths who had taken up arms have now joined the mainstream…I am very much proud to say that in the recently conducted Bodoland polls, eighty percent polling took place with no bloodshed,” he said. The senior BJP leader also expressed confidence that the party will form a government in Assam with a full majority in the 2021 assembly polls. “The Bodoland poll, won by NDA, was only a semi-final. The final will be Assam election. In this poll too, BJP will have full majority,” Shah said.The BJP extended support to the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and Gana Suraksha Party (GSP) to stake claim for the Bodoland Territorial Council, after it won nine seats in the local polls. The UPPL won 12 seats in the elections held earlier in December.The Union minister said that the northeast has turned into the country’s growth engine under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Modiji visited the Northeast Region thirty times in six years. Every time, he visited the region, he has come with gifts,” said Shah. He launched an attack on the former government led by Congress for not working for development of Assam. Invoking the 16th-century saint Acharya Sankardev, Shah said, “Congress didn’t do anything for the birthplace of Acharya Sankardev whose contributions gave recognition to Assam’s history, drama writing, arts and poetry.”“But BJP believes in strengthening of language, culture, arts of the states. BJP believes that India cannot achieve greatness until the culture and language of states are strengthened. India’s culture and arts are incomplete without Assamese culture and arts,” he said.During his visit, Shah is expected to meet the newly-elected members of the BJP’s core committee, the ruling coalition of Bodoland Territorial Council, the 23-member delegation of the United Peoples Party Liberal, news agency PTI reported.On Saturday, Shah laid the foundation stones of a Rs 186-crore beautification programme of Vaishnav Saint Srimanta Sankardeva at Batadrava, a medical college and hospital which will be set up in the capital city, estimated to cost Rs 860 crore, and 11 law colleges across the state.Shah’s visit also witnessed political developments in the state with legislators from other parties vying to join the BJP. During his stay he met Congress MLA Rajdeep Goala and Gana Shakti Party MLA Bhubon Pegu. Former cabinet minister and Congress MLA from Golaghat Ajanta Neog, who was expelled from the party on Friday, also met Shah at the PWD guest house in Amingaon where he will spend the night. Neog had tendered her resignation from primary of the Congress and also as legislator of Golaghat on Friday. All three leaders-Neog, Goala and Pegu are expected to join BJP. “BJP has no strength of its own that’s why they need those from other parties. They (the BJP) are taking people from other parties by threatening with action by agencies like Enforcement Directorate, CBI and Income Tax,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora told journalists on Saturday. “Rajdeep Goala and Ajanta Neog are not connected with our party as they have already been expelled from the Congress. Since they are no longer associated with us, there’s nothing to say about what they are doing,” he added. Shah is scheduled to offer prayers at Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati on December 27. From Guwahati, the home minister will visit Manipur to launch various schemes before leaving for New Delhi.

The central investigating agency is likely to probe the money laundering angle in the Bhosri land deal case, in which the land was allegedly bought at an undervalued price.Khadse confirmed to HT that he had received the notice and would be going to the ED office. He joined the Sharad Pawar-led NCP in October this year.The former BJP heavyweight is facing trouble following allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal in Bhosri near Pune in 2016. The plot was bought by his wife Mandakini Khadse and son-in-law, Girish Choudhary for Rs 3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of Rs 30 crore, it is said.“He wants to harass me and thus the same case is being probed again and again by different agencies,” Khadse said without taking any name. He has blamed former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for all his miseries in the past four years.“The land was bought at Rs 3.75 crore and the government has already spent Rs 14 crore to 15 crore on various probes. The case was investigated twice by anti-corruption bureau, once by Pune ACB and another time by Nashik ACB. Pune has submitted its closure report before the court. The state had spent Rs 3 crore to Rs 4 crore on Zoting committee (appointed by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government) to probe the same case. It was also probed by the Income Tax department. In all this will be the fifth probe in the same land deal,” Khadse said stressing that he has been targeted.In Dhule, he told reporters that people from across the state have called and expressed sympathy with him. “They also felt that this is a kind of injustice. It appears that they didn’t like the probes one after the other but decisions have been made and we have to follow them,” he commented.The investigation closure report of the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) Pune has given a clean chit to the former revenue minister. In its report filed before the Pune court in 2018, ACB Pune had said that there was no evidence that Khadse was aware that his wife and son-in-law had purchased the plot.Khadse was a prominent leader of the BJP from north Maharashtra and enjoys a significant hold in the region. He comes from Leva Patil, one of the OBC communities, that has a sizable population in north Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-eknath-khadse-in-bhosri-land-deal-case-asks-him-to-appear-on-dec-30/story-KMgCFglgrdZQCk400CiiaI.html
27-12-2020||India||Farm unions agree to talk to govt on Dec 29||Farm unions protesting three contentious agricultural laws on Saturday agreed to restart negotiations with the government, ending a stalemate in talks to resolve a month-long, politically challenging agitation by tens of thousands of farmers.Farm unions, who have hunkered down at the capital’s borders, on Saturday sent a letter to a senior bureaucrat of the agriculture ministry in which they agreed to hold delegation-level talks with the central government on December 29 at 11am.The farmers maintain that talks must be geared toward a repeal of the three laws they say will hurt their incomes. Talks between the unions and a team comprising three Union ministers — Narendra Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — had run aground on December 8, after the unions’ meeting with home minister Amit Shah.Farmers were to meet on December 9 with the three ministers for the sixth time but they called off the meeting, saying the talks were going nowhere since the government was not agreeing to their core demands.Also Read | Agitating farmers from western UP stay put in Noida at night“We have consistently demanded the repeal of the three central farm acts, whereas the government has distorted our position as if we were asking for amendments to these acts,” said the letter by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the platform of unions, to joint secretary in the farm ministry, Vivek Agrawal.“Be that as it may, since you are willing to hold a meeting on date, time and issues of our choosing, we make the following proposal on behalf of Samyukt Kisan Morcha after due consultation with all organisations,” the unions wrote, framing an agenda that has four main issues.Farm unions spelt out four demands in order of priorities; first, they said, “modalities (are) to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central Farm Acts”.Second, the unions want “mechanisms to be adopted to make remunerative MSP recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission into a legally guaranteed entitlement for all farmers and all agricultural commodities”.These top two demands are the trickiest. Although the government has made attempts to restart negotiations with the unions, it is not prepared to scrap its three laws.On Saturday, Union home minister Amit Shah urged the protesting farmers to resolve their issues through discussions.Commenting on the letter, an official who participated in the previous rounds of talks said on condition of anonymity: “We welcome the farmers’ decision. The government is ready to discuss any issue, whether new or old. We have said this in writing. I am not in a position to comment more on this.”Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates, known as minimum support price (MSP).Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Centre says not ‘logical’ to include MSP in talks, unions likely to reply todayPrime Minister Narendra Modi, in an address to farmers on Friday, said his government was open to talks with farm unions and even opposition parties who have pressed on with a massive pushback against the farm policies so long as discussions were based on “tark” and “tathya” (Hindi for ‘arguments’ and ‘facts’), but staunchly defended his farm-reform agenda needed to “modernise” the farm sector.The government has proposed a set of concessions and amendments; these include greater oversight of proposed free markets and a written assurance on continuing the mechanism of MSP.Saturday’s letter made it clear that the farmers not only want a law mandating MSP, but they want an expansive system of guaranteed prices based on a broader measure of farming costs.The government has promised to continue its mechanism of setting minimum crop prices and procuring food produce, mainly staples, a proposal it is banking on to find a solution.Farm leader Darshan Pal spelt out why the assurance on minimum prices was not enough.The government sets minimum prices for 23 commodities but mainly buys wheat and rice at these floor prices. The so-called minimum support prices or MSP is calculated using a measure of cultivation cost known as A2+FL, which is a narrower measure of costs of cultivation that takes into account all expenses of raising a particular crop plus the value of family labour.Farm unions want the government to adopt a comprehensive measure of cultivation costs that include the imputed cost of capital and the rent on the land, called ‘C2’ in economic parlance.Farmers also made it clear that they want the government to buy all 23 commodities, which would bloat its food subsidy bill. “There is no question that farmers need support. But they need to be supported in less market-distorting ways,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at think tank ICRIER.To be sure, Indian farmers get lower-than-global prices in most items not procured by the government because of oversupply and the government’s efforts to keep food inflation low.The farmers also want amendments in an ordinance to completely exclude farmers from any penalties for crop-residue burning, a major cause of pollution, they stated in their letter.The letter lastly stated that farmers want “changes to be made in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 to protect the interests of farmers”.The bill proposes to provide cash instead of subsidised power for agricultural use. Farmers say the changeover could increase power costs for them.In a related development, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) convener and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal announced a split from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the three farm laws. “I am not stuck with Fevicol with the NDA. Today, I separate myself from the NDA,” Beniwal said while addressing a farmers’ rally in Shahjahanpur in Alwar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-agree-to-talk-to-govt-on-dec-29/story-Ymha1MB9ye7jvMQkjYz3zO.html

27-12-2020||India||Agitating farmers from western UP stay put in Noida at night||Braving biting cold, scores of farmers stayed put at the Delhi-Noida border near Chilla on Saturday night in protest against the three recent farm laws of the Centre even as other agitating farmers returned home for night stay.During the day, farmers’ groups from various Western Uttar Pradesh districts visit the border, join demonstrations and then return by evening, leaving local protestors and those from nearby districts at the site for an overnight stay, said Yogesh Pratap Singh, the UP unit chief of the BKU (Bhanu).Around 50 BKU (Bhanu) members, some of them belonging to Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad, were at Chilla border on Saturday night, while 11 members observed fast during the day.“Eleven protestors observe fast during the day till 5 pm. It has been about a week since this hunger strike was started to protest against the government’s decision,” said Singh.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) members are camping at the Chilla border since December 1 while those belonging to the BKU (Lok Shakti) have been staying put at the nearby Dalit Prerna Sthal.The demonstrations continued even as Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the protesting farmer unions at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, on Saturday decided to resume their dialogue with the Centre and proposed December 29 for the next round of talks.On the next round of talks with the Centre, Singh, the son of BKU (Bhanu) chief Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh, said, “Whenever the talks happen between the farmer unions and the government, it must be ensured that the three new laws are repealed and a new law ensuring MSP is discussed.” Over a dozen protestors belonging to the BKU (Lok Shakti) stayed put at the nearby Dalit Prerna Sthal, the faction’s home since December 2, for the overnight stay.“The protest is continuing and future of the protests would be decided after the next round of talks,” BKU (Lok Shakti) spokesperson Shailesh Kumar Giri said.Meanwhile, traffic remained disrupted at the Chilla border due to the stir where only one carriageway (Delhi to Noida) was open for commuters, a Noida Traffic Police official said.The other routes – Kalindi Kunj and DND – were open and had normal traffic movement throughout the day, the official added. Thousands of farmers are currently camping at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitating-farmers-from-western-up-stay-put-in-noida-at-night/story-NaAww9Ne6sWrw3vYT1Mj4I.html
27-12-2020||India||Oxford Covid-19 vaccine may become the first to get Indian regulator’s nod for emergency use||With preparations underway for a possible vaccine-rollout by January, the Indian drug regulator is looking at the UK, which sources believe may give its nod to the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine next week, before deciding on giving emergency use authorisation to the Serum Institute that is manufacturing the shots here. Once the UK drug regulator gives its approval to the Oxford vaccine, the expert committee on Covid-19 at the CDSCO will hold its meeting and thoroughly review the safety and immunogenicity data from the clinical evaluations conducted abroad and in India before granting any emergency authorisation for the vaccine here, official sources said. The process of granting emergency use approval for Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘Covaxin’ may take time as its phase 3 trials are still underway, while Pfizer is yet to make a presentation. “Going by this, Oxford vaccine ‘Covishield’ is likely to be the first to be rolled out in India,”  a source said. Serum Institute of India (SII) last week also had submitted some additional data required by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the sources said. Amid fears about the mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2 detected in the UK, government officials recently said that it will have no impact on the potential of emerging vaccines that are being developed in India and other countries. Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Pfizer had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India  (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for their Covid-19 vaccines early this month. The subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on December 9 had sought additional safety and efficacy data for Covid-19 vaccines of SII and Bharat Biotech after deliberating upon their applications. The application by the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical firm Pfizer was not taken up for deliberation as the company had sought more time for making a presentation before the committee.The Pfizer vaccine has already been approved by several countries including the UK, the US, and Bahrain. While considering SII’s application, the SEC had recommended that the firm should submit an updated safety data of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in the country, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India, along with the outcome of the assessment of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for grant of EUA. As for Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, “after detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial in the country for further consideration”, the SEC had said. The Pune-based SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has made a collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine. The SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine, under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling licence from the DCGI, officials recently had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-may-become-the-first-to-get-indian-regulator-s-nod-for-emergency-use/story-JgQ4dvda09sJzNYntwkr9O.html
27-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest Updates: Rakesh Tikait, key farmer union leader receives death threat||It has been a month since farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana, began their protest march to the national capital seeking the removal of the three controversial farm laws passed by the central government in September. Till now, five rounds of talks have been held between farmer groups and Union ministers which remained inconclusive. On Friday, the protesters held a meet to discuss the Centre’s latest invitation for talks, with some of them indicating that they might resume dialogue in order to find a solution to the deadlock. Another meet of farmer groups will be held today where a formal decision will be taken on the invite for resumption of talks. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the government was open for talks and blamed opposition parties for misleading farmers against the three new laws for their political agenda. Releasing the next instalment of the PM-KISAN scheme, Modi added, “I bow to farmers. A majority of them have supported the laws. I will never allow farmers’ interests to be compromised at any cost.” The farmer groups however, hit out at the Prime Minister’s address and said he did not even once address those who have been protesting adding that the speech was a mix of fabricated and fake news. The protesting farmers, who have been camping at several border points in Delhi and neighbouring states are seeking the removal of Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The Centre has projected that the new laws will eliminate middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce across India. However, the farmers maintain that the laws would demolish the Minimum Support Price (MSP) policy and do away with the wholesale market system.
