13-12-2020||News||Moscow must come to terms with India’s security imperatives||This year began with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov criticising the idea of the Indo-Pacific at the Raisina Dialogue, calling it a “divisive approach” to disrupt existing regional structures and contain China’s influence in the region. Arguing that India was “smart enough to understand the trap,” he said the United States (US) Indo-Pacific ploy was an attempt to “reconfigure the existing structures” and to move away from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)-centric consensus.The year is ending with Lavrov once again accusing the West of adopting an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games”. He argued that India is currently an object of the West’s persistent, aggressive and devious policy by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called Quad. He also alleged that the West is attempting to undermine Russia’s “close partnership and privileged relations with India”.What is extraordinary in these sentiments is that a close strategic partner of India such as Russia is failing to acknowledge how India’s security environment is deteriorating because of China’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo at the border and the growing anti-China sentiment in India in light of these tensions. But what is more significant is that Moscow seems blind to the agency of India in shaping its own priorities. As long as India joins Russia and China in railing against the West, New Delhi can be hailed for its strategic autonomy but if India builds ties with the US and other Western nations, it is merely because there is a devious game at play to ensnare India into relationships that make it an object of other nations’ priorities.Russian foreign policy is predicated on challenging the West, and every single relationship is assessed through that prism. Moscow’s relationship with Beijing is critical to give Russia a sense of being some kind of a global power even as it is finding that it can’t even manage its own backyard. The recent conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh saw Turkey gaining a foothold in South Caucasus when an Armenian army, trained and armed by Russia, faced defeat by an Azerbaijani army, trained and armed by the Turks. China is gaining a profile in areas such as Central Asia where Russian dominance is eroding.But such is the need for Chinese support that Russian President Vladimir Putin has argued that a military alliance between Moscow and Beijing cannot be ruled out. And what better way to show Russian commitment than to challenge the idea of the Indo-Pacific even more loudly than the Chinese themselves.For India, the Indo-Pacific is a strategic imperative — a political geography which is the centre of gravity of global challenges and opportunities. In 2018, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi dismissed the Indo-Pacific concept as a “headline-grabbing idea” that would “dissipate like sea foam”. As this year draws to a close, from Oceania to western Europe, the idea of the Indo-Pacific is being operationalised in foreign and national security policies of nations, something few had anticipated. This has been one of the biggest diplomatic defeats for Beijing which had tried so hard to discredit the idea and pressured nations into abandoning it. Instead, India’s commitment towards and a robust defence of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific saw nations underscoring the centrality of this emerging political geography in their foreign policy agenda. New Delhi has tried to bring Moscow into the Indo-Pacific ambit much like its support for Russia’s Greater Eurasia, without much success. Russia’s resistance to acknowledging this reality is perhaps understandable given its dependence on China but it does no service to either India-Russia ties or to Russia’s role in the wider region where its approach can lead to its marginalisation despite it having some real stakes in the Indo-Pacific. India’s ties with Russia cannot escape the Indo-Pacific. As India reconfigures its China policy with the Indo-Pacific at its core, India-Russia ties won’t be able to escape this strategic reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/moscow-must-come-to-terms-with-india-s-security-imperatives/story-S4FZAzS2UToBIFiu1FUxUK.html
13-12-2020||News||The emerging contours of tech policy||India has the highest per user data usage in the world. The online space has flourished — innumerable applications compete for user attention. The internet economy in India is quite open and minimally regulated. This is now beginning to change because of three emerging motivations.First, India is beginning to systematically assert its sovereign power to regulate internet-based activities. New regimes for regulation of personal data, e-commerce, content of video streaming services, and related spheres are in the offing.Second, the government is increasingly using technology policy as an instrument of foreign policy and national security. From denying market access to inflict costs upon adversaries (for instance, the ban on certain Chinese apps), to using State power to access personal data for law enforcement, to localisation for data security, a variety of new interventions are emerging.Third, the government is keen to ensure that the digital economy adds more value in India. In a report titled India’s Trillion Dollar Digital Opportunity, the government has outlined an agenda to create $1 trillion in economic value from the digital economy by 2025. The government is increasingly insisting that foreign-based internet firms undertake more activities in India — from storing data to creating jobs — and pay more taxes. It seems that this objective is also getting conflated with the promotion of “national champions” — domestic firms that take market share away from foreign firms.These motivations are leading to a shift away from laissez-faire in India’s internet economy. However, the measures that are flowing from these motivations come with certain risks.First, since both producers and users gain when services are used, denial of market access inflicts costs on users as well. The internet economy runs on imaginative innovation — it is mostly about inspiration, as perspiration can be automated. It was technologically straightforward to create Facebook or TikTok, but it took imagination that is difficult to properly replicate. Access to global innovations can be beneficial for India.Second, it is difficult to understand the costs of government intervention in the internet economy. For products such as automobiles, one can compare the price of comparable products in India and in the world market to estimate the cost of government intervention. In the internet economy, price is usually not a useful metric. What matters is utility of the service, and it is difficult to measure the effect of government intervention on it. Third, the problems that generally plague government efforts to promote specific sectors are accentuated in the internet economy. In the fast-changing internet economy, it is difficult to choose which segments to promote. It is also difficult to select the most efficient policy instruments, because comparing alternatives is hard. Given the relative lack of capacity of the Indian State, such subtle decisions are likely to go wrong. Further, as firms become influential, they can capture the policy process to gain undue benefits.Fourth, the framing in terms of domestic vs foreign firms can take attention away from the binding constraints to the growth of the digital economy in India. There is a tension between helping domestic firms capture more share of India’s market, and helping these firms become global leaders. If Indian firms capture domestic markets due to favourable treatment from the government, they may become less efficient and innovative, and, as a result, the digital economy may grow at a slower pace, albeit with a larger share for domestic firms. The government should, therefore, exercise power over the internet economy with extreme caution. First, precisely-tailored interventions should be chosen over blunt instruments such as bans. We should avoid placing barriers on collaboration and investment. Measures such as barring investments and partnerships from certain countries could backfire, as skilled people may move abroad to access this investment and collaboration. Second, for development of the digital economy, the government should focus on finding efficient ways of addressing basic problems (“market failures” — monopoly abuse, externalities, public goods). For instance, it is reasonable for the government to regulate firms with large collections of non-personal data to bring some of this data to a marketplace. Since such data is excludable but substantially non-rivalrous, this move can be beneficial. However, if the government goes too far — by forcing data-sharing for free or at a low price or too soon — it would destroy the incentive to collect and store such data.Third, it is better to solve known problems than to take a compliance-heavy, preventive approach. Compliance costs impose entry barriers and create a bias for scale. The proposed data protection law takes an excessively compliance-heavy approach.Fourth, when the government is taking measures to promote specific segments or firms, it must use objective metrics of success to discipline the firms. The real tests are market-based. If Indian firms compete and gain market share outside India, it would be a sign of success.Indians have access to a thriving online environment. From the flourishing of start-ups to the bursting forth of artistic talents, the online space is unleashing boundless potential. To the extent possible, we should preserve the openness of the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-emerging-contours-of-tech-policy/story-WSdTy3gBSZsLh84qEkf0FI.html
13-12-2020||News||China wants India to accept the new normal on LAC, move on to restore bilateral ties | Analysis||This month, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has made repeated public statements stating that the only way for restoring frozen India-China ties is to untangle the four friction points in East Ladakh by disengaging and de-escalating the military situation along the 1597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC).The Chinese on their part are indicating that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has established a new normal in East Ladakh by transgression and India should move to restoring bilateral ties by accepting the new LAC. Beijing wants India and China to celebrate 70 years of establishment of bilateral ties and move to restore economic ties. That boundary dispute should be kept separate and resolution parallel to growth in economic ties has been the Chinese narrative since the days of Deng Xiaoping.While the previous Indian regimes believed that being soft to the PLA on border was a sure recipe for a peaceful and tranquil LAC, this was taken a sign of weakness by the Beijing rulers who time and again tried to change the unresolved line from Shaksgam Valley in Karakoram to Kibithu in far east Arunachal Pradesh. Even junior diplomats from China heckled India for referring to Tibet and Xinjiang or on Indian leaders travelling to Arunachal Pradesh. Buddhism teacher and 14th Dalai Lama was called a terrorist by China but Pakistani Masood Azhar, a terrorist who has spilled the blood of hundreds in India, was a religious-political activist as Beijing blocked his designation as global terrorist no less than four times.Also Watch | Senator Mark Warner on India-US ties, China, Pakistan & Kashmir #HTLS2020Maybe PLA expects Indian Army to accept the new normal after looking at the roadmap of New Delhi’s relations with Beijing’s iron brother Pakistan over decades, where India has always come around to the dialogue table after every crisis. Indian resilience is seen as a sign of weakness.Today 19 years ago, five Pakistani terrorists of Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammed group struck at Indian Parliament while it was in winter session killing nine security personnel and civilians. Much as we have tried to gloss over the event, the brutal fact is that had the terrorists managed to gun their way into the Houses in session, the entire Indian political leadership would have been held hostage by radicalised thugs. The national humiliation of such an event would have made look the 1999 hijacking of IC-814 flight to Kandahar and subsequent release of three top Islamist terrorists including Azhar in lieu of over 170 passengers a trifle. Yet, in January 2004, India started the dialogue with Pakistan, who again gave a facile commitment that it would not allow its territory by terrorists to target India.One thought that the 26/11 Mumbai massacre would have been the turning point for India-Pakistan relations with this time Pakistan’s other terror export Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) gunning down innocents in the heart of India’s commercial capital. Despite nearly 200 innocents getting butchered in Mumbai, there was no retaliation from India with so-called strategists buying the Pakistani narrative of an imminent nuclear war. This time again, dialogue with Pakistani was resumed in 2010 with counter-terrorism, Mumbai attack trials and humanitarian issues added to the menu.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a day on Pakistan after January 2016 attack on Pathankot airbase by Azhar’s Islamist troopers again. Had it not been for alert Indian security agencies led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, India would have been humiliated again if the terrorists had managed to blow parked MiG-21 Bison fighters to smithereens. Not only all the fighters were removed from the airbase but even the then Pakistani NSA Naseer Janjua was informed about the impending attack on January 1 night itself. Documents found on the terrorists indicated that the attack had been given a green signal, the day PM Modi impromptu landed in Lahore on December 25,2015 in a genuine effort to promote ties with Islamabad.The June 15 Galwan Valley skirmish in which men of 16 Bihar led by Col Santosh Babu retaliated to the PLA aggression on the LAC is one such tipping point with China. On that day, India lost 20 of its brave soldiers including Col Santosh Babu in Galwan Valley as they were overwhelmed in numbers by the aggressive PLA soldiers armed with barbed wire sticks and spears. The Indian soldiers retaliated in full measure with the adversary PLA losing more men in the hand to hand fight including their own commanding officer. Hopefully, the Indian Army will honour the brave Santosh Babu and four other personnel on 2021 Republic Day.While India wants China to restore status quo ante of April 2020, Beijing apparently feels that the Modi government will come to terms with the new normal on LAC and revive ties in the coming months and willy-nilly accept the rise of the Middle Kingdom. After all, the so-called tiger ASEAN nations have consigned the Chinese aggression in the South China Sea to merely a talking point on bilateral agenda with Beijing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not even entertain such a thought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-wants-india-to-accept-the-new-normal-on-lac-and-move-on-analysis/story-7eET62eKf4ICfwkknL5VJK.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||10,000 Delhiites now dead from Covid-19||With 33 new deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported in Delhi on Sunday, the total number of people who have lost their lives to the viral infection in the Capital crossed the 10,000 mark – becoming only the fourth state in the country to do so.As of Sunday, the infection has killed a total of 10,014 people from the 607,454 people infected so far, according to government health bulletin.The grim landmark, however, comes at the time when the outbreak in the city appears to be under control for the third time. Sunday’s new deaths were the lowest single-day fatalities reported in Delhi in 45 days, or since October 29, when 27 new deaths were reported.Los Angeles mayor sounds alarm on rising Covid-19 deathsThe hospital bed occupancy is lowest in three months, according to state health minister Satyendar Jain. Of the total 18,807 hospital beds earmarked for Covid patients in Delhi, 4,446 are occupied as on Sunday. “Delhi has the least case fatality ratio at 1.6, comparatively, Ahmedabad is at 4.0, Mumbai at 3.8, Kolkata at 2 and Chennai at 1.8. Because of improved health infrastructure and continued monitoring of home isolation, Delhi has been able to achieve 96% recovery rate,” Jain said in a tweet on Sunday.In absolute numbers, however, Delhi remains one of the worst-hit regions in the country. For every million residents, the Capital has seen 505 people die from the viral infection – twice the national average (110 deaths per million population).Indian defence forces to stock weapons, ammo for 15-day intense warDelhi’s case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of confirmed cases that have died due to the disease — is 1.65%, significantly higher than the national CFR of 1.45%. Among the major states, only four — Punjab (CFR of 3.17%), Maharashtra (2.57%), Gujarat (1.84%) and West Bengal (1.74%) — have seen a higher proportion of those infected die from the disease.On average, 53 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 every day in the past week. This is the lowest the seven-day average of deaths has been in 37 days (since November 6). At the peak of the third wave, which is currently ebbing, 116 people were dying every day on average in Delhi for the week ending November 24. This was the highest death rate since mid-June (to be sure, deaths in this period were artificially inflated as Delhi retrospectively added fatalities that had been erroneously not attributed to Covid-19, according to the Delhi government). Since then, however, as cases have declined, deaths have been falling as well.Delhi, which was one of the earlier hot spots for India’s outbreak is the only region in the country that has seen three distinct waves of infections. The first started in mid-June, and peaked when the seven-day average of daily cases touched around 3,400 in the last week of June. This receded by the end of July when it dropped to around 1,000 daily cases. The second wave started at the end of August, rising until mid-September, when average daily cases touched 4,174 for the week ending September 17. This again dropped to 2,574 in the week ending October 9, before the onset of the third wave. The third wave raged through October and November, leading to the largest surge seen so far. The seven-day average of new cases peaked on November 14, when it touched 7,341 – the highest recorded so far. Since then, however, cases have started receding almost steadily.A Delhi government spokesperson said: “The people of Delhi have fought a courageous fight against Corona over the last 9 months. At 1.65%, Delhi’s fatality rate is the lowest among all large cities in India. The credit goes entirely to our Corona warriors — our doctors, nurses, paramedics and all health officials who have worked day and night over the last 9 months to save countless lives.”Experts say that Delhi’s low hospital occupancy means that better care can be provided to patients that are critical, which means that the number of deaths may remain low in the coming weeks.“The number of deaths recorded per day is slowly going down now. And it should be seen with other parameters such as increased tests, lower number of new cases surfacing each day and the low positivity rate. Overall, it shows that the situation has improved. It is likely to witness further improvement in the weeks to come. Low occupancy rate of hospital beds also reflects that number of severe cases which requires the patients to be hospitalised are decreasing,” Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said. Delhi, however, remains one of the most fatal Covid-19 regions in the country as experts attributed the relatively high CFR to factors like poor air quality which can worsen the impact of respiratory disease like Covid.“Compared to other metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, etc. Delhi has a bad air quality problem, which contributes to respiratory diseases. This year, the festive season, which witnessed massive crowds across the city, coincided with the bad air-quality days. That period also witnessed extremely high number of cases, which eventually led to an increase in the death numbers. Secondly, Delhi also witnessed high number of cases arriving from other states. Most such cases were severe and they arrived very late. Such cases contributed to high death toll in the city. But the situation seems much better now,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-000-delhiites-now-dead-from-covid-19/story-3EQBJ5YJhTXyqRMXmJS59L.html
13-12-2020||City||Fadnavis terms Maharashtra government a failure; Opposition boycotts tea party||Alleging that the Uddhav Thackeray- led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is running away from debates on various contentious issues, including the agrarian crisis, reservations to various communities, rising crimes against women and its “failure” in handling the Covid-19 pandemic, the prime Opposition in the state, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), vowed to corner the administration “in public interest”. In protest, the Opposition boycotted the government’s customary tea party on Sunday on the eve of the session. Leader of Opposition in legislative Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday also alleged that Maharashtra has been driven towards an “undeclared emergency-like situation”. He said that owing to the “arrogance of power”, the Thackeray government has been taking action against the people talking against the government. He added that the government wants to send out a message to its critics by doing so. Citing the action taken against Mumbai Cooperative Central Bank, of which leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar is chairman, Fadnavis said the government was not ready to correct its act despite a “tight slap by court” in the Arnab Goswami and Kangana Ranaut cases. “Maharashtra’s farmers are in grave trouble today, either due to the hailstorms or drought, and multiple failed crops. But they have not received any concrete help from the government despite its tall promises. Similarly, Marathas are deprived of their reservation, women and children are subjected to the rising criminal cases, and the development projects in Mumbai have been halted. We want to debate on these issues plaguing the state and want the government to respond to them, but the debate is denied by curtailing the period of the session,” he said. Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Mumbai, Fadnavis also alleged that the government has failed to handle the virus outbreak in the state. “Maharashtra has the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19, and so far, over 48,000 people have died due to the infection, contributing to 30-35% of the country’s Covid-19 deaths. The government is patting its own back when it has failed to check the spread of Covid-19 in the state,” he said. Fadnavis also accused the government of corruption in its Covid-19 preparedness, and said a panchnama needs to be done of how the government performed while checking the outbreak. Accusing that Thackeray was visiting the infrastructure projects rolled out by his government, Fadnavis lashed out at MVA government for shifting the Metro-3 car shed to Kanjurmarg from Aarey. He said the decision has delayed the completion of the project by four years, and subsequently caused many cost escalations, which will also affect the ticket price for commuters. “The decision has been taken without any thought or study,” he said. He also pointed out at the contradiction within MVA over the Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation. “Ministers in the state are conducting protests for OBC reservation, while the government has not clarified its stand on the matter. Ministers should voice their demands in the cabinet to ensure that OBC reservation is not affected. It also appears that the government wants to deprive the Maratha community of its reservation. The government failed to take a pressing stand in the Supreme Court and it resulted in interim stay to the reservation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fadnavis-terms-maharashtra-government-a-failure-opposition-boycotts-tea-party/story-sftb1yeadSMoUoaaL3zYwN.html

13-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 3,717 Covid-19 cases, 70 deaths; tally 1,880,416, toll 48,209||Maharashtra on Sunday reported fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 infections for a ninth straight day, taking the count to 1,880,416. The state clocked 3,717 new cases, while also reporting 70 Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 48,209, at a case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.56%. There are presently 74,104 active cases in the state. On Sunday, 3,083 patients in the state were discharged, taking the number of recoveries to 1,757,005, at a rate of 93.44%. Of the 70 deaths, 48 were in the past 48 hours and 18 were in the past week. The remaining were from before last week.Despite a lower CFR in comparison to March and April, Maharashtra ranks 2nd in the country, behind only Punjab, which has a CFR of 3.17%, according to the Medical Education and Drugs Department’s daily report. Although other key parameters, including positivity, doubling and growth rate are under control, the fatality rate has been hovering around 2.6% for the past few months.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The death rate from the beginning was very high. The current death rate is significantly lower, in terms of sheer numbers, but the old baggage is still there, which is why we are seeing a high CFR. What is hurting our death numbers are the numbers that occurred in March, April and May, pushing our overall CFR higher.”Dr Joshi said one of the main factors is also insufficient testing in the state despite a high testing capacity. Also read: Mumbai civic body to develop app for Covid-19 vaccination“There are many places in Maharashtra that are not testing at full capacity. Moreover, the stigma around Covid-19 is still there, so symptomatic patients are not testing on time. When you test late, you get medical attention late, and the chances of death in comorbid patients increase significantly,” Dr Joshi said.So far, Maharashtra has conducted 11,702,457 tests, of which 64,121 were conducted on Sunday. The positivity rate in the state is 16.07%.Cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur, among many other smaller cities and towns, have a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, according to Dr Joshi, along with a high population density, high chances at mobility and migration, which impact covid case numbers.Mumbai on Sunday reported 606 new Covid-19 cases and 12 deaths, taking the count to 290,636 and toll to 10,977, with a CFR of 3.77%. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “If we see, the weekly CFR in the state is 1.77% for the past few weeks. This is a good sign. The cumulative CFR is 2.5% due to the load of earlier deaths. Mortality is more in urban Maharashtra, such as Mumbai, Pune and Thane, that are taking up to 60% of the load. Moreover, the dynamics of population density also factor into the equation. Once infection rate increases due to high population density, high-risk groups are at a higher chance of contributing to mortality.”However, authorities said the overall picture in Maharashtra is positive. Awate said, “We were expecting an increase in cases post Diwali, but that has not happened, and that is a good sign. Our positivity rate has reduced too.” Regarding not testing to full capacity, Awate said, “Number of tests is an indirect reflection of positivity rate. Contacts of patients are tested, so when cases per day decrease, tests decrease too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-3-717-covid-19-cases-70-deaths-tally-1-880-416-toll-48-209/story-cBBkJ4N2alv1oOsfO5PAlO.html
13-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Will enforce only CAA,’ says Vijayvargiya as BJP takes U-turn on NRC in Bengal||Months after campaigning in Bengal in support of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday took a U-turn, saying it would not be implemented in the state which goes to the polls next year. Till the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP’s national and state leaders had maintained that the NRC will be prepared in all states, including Bengal. During a visit to the headquarters of the Matua Mahasangha at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas on Saturday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya told the Matua community’s young face and local BJP Lok Sabha member Shantanu Thakur and others that the Centre will implement the new citizenship law as per the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) but there will be no NRC exercise in West Bengal like Assam. Vijayvargiya is in charge of the BJP’s organization in the state. He went to Thakurnagar to discuss Union home minister Amit Shah’s possible visit. Shah will arrive in Bengal on December 19 on a two-day trip. The Matua community, which migrated from Bangladesh to escape religious persecution before and after the Independence is the single largest Namashudra or Dalit Hindu community in the state. It can influence the outcome of elections in many assembly segments along the Indo-Bangladesh border. For the Matua community, which hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first election campaign in Bengal before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, permanent citizenship is a longstanding demand. Also read: Date for next round of talks with farmers soon - Union ministerThe BJP will start campaigning from January for the implementation of the new citizenship law, Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Mukul Roy announced at a public meeting in Kolkata on December 6. BJP national president JP Nadda also said during his recent visit that CAA will be enforced once the rules are framed. However, till Saturday, no leader said that there will be no NRC in Bengal. “The BJP is confused. Its leaders are scared of preparing the NRC in Bengal after what happened in Assam where more than 12 lakh Hindus did not find their names in the draft list,” Bengal’s minister of state for parliamentary affairs, Tapas Roy, told HT. “NRC was a political slogan for the BJP. Now it has backtracked because numerous Hindus in the state will face trouble if the exercise is carried out. I have a feeling that the government will not be able to enforce the CAA as well,” said Kolkata-based political science professor and current affairs analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay. TMC tackles rebelsConcerned by rumblings among senior leaders before the crucial assembly polls, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership on Sunday held talks with disgruntled state forest minister Rajib Banerjee in a bid to bridge differences while expelling a close aide of heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari who resigned from the cabinet last month. The expelled leader, Kanishka Panda, was secretary of the TMC unit in East Midnapore district where the Adhikari family represents two Lok Sabha seats, an assembly seat and heads a civic body. TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor held an hour-long meeting with the forest minister at Chatterjee’s residence. While Chatterjee remained tight-lipped, Banerjee claimed that the talks covered “political strategy.” Also read: How much Covid-19 vaccine will be shipped in USLeaders close to the minister, however, said he raised issues such as corruption and nepotism by some leaders in Howrah district, where Banerjee represents the Domjur assembly seat while talking to Chatterjee and Kishor. “I attended the meeting as a party worker. We discussed strategy for the coming days. I cannot share anything more with the media. In a party, there can be disgruntled people and there can be people who are over-satisfied. These things are sorted through discussion. I will be available if I am called for more talks,” the forest minister said. Posters in support of Banerjee and Adhikari are appearing across West Bengal, including Kolkata, since last month, stoking speculations that the two popular and comparatively younger leaders, may leave the TMC. Posters, with images of Banerjee and the words, “symbol of honesty,” written in Bengali, appeared in Howrah on Sunday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/will-enforce-only-caa-says-vijayvargiya-as-bjp-takes-u-turn-on-nrc-in-bengal/story-1pnfZQIqKYN0Pi7ZeBtyDK.html

13-12-2020||Noida||More than 25K debtors owe bad loans of over ₹3,500 crore to GB Nagar banks||Gautam Buddh Nagar district banks have declared outstanding loans worth ₹3,549 crore as non-performing assets (NPA).A bank classifies a loan as an NPA when the beneficiary fails to repay after 90 days. According to official figures, 25,141 loan accounts were declared NPA. A majority of these accounts were of micro, small and medium entrepreneurs. Not only that, due to lack of proper equilibrium between the deposits and advances, the credit-debit ratio (CDR) of the banks in the district, has gone down to 56.15%, which is less than the ‘healthy’ CDR of 60%. GB Nagar district lead bank manager (LBM) Ved Ratna said, “Recovery of NPA is never an easy task for banks as most of these loans come under litigation at later stage.”The LBM said banks have already initiated the recovery process of these ‘bad’ loans. “At first, they will start the recovery of these defaulted loans without recourse to judicial process, under which the banks will issue notices to debtors and ask them to make payments of dues on their heads. If the borrower is cooperative, their assets charged to banks will be sold by private negotiations or by auction. If they do not co-operate, the banks will take legal course and the loans will be recovered through legal process by the orders of the courts,” he said. About the CDR of the banks, the LDM said that while the deposits in different banks of the district have been recorded ₹1,08,474 crore, the advances given to the customers have gone down to ₹60,926 crore. “It is mainly due to heavy push of deposits into government accounts, which has caused imbalance between deposits and finance. The government has deposited heavy funds of over ₹4,000 crore in its bank accounts as many upcoming projects like Jewar airport and Smart City will come up soon. On the other hand, we don’t have as many entrepreneurs here, who seek funds from the banks. As a result, the CDR has gone down,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/more-than-25k-debtors-owe-bad-loans-of-over-3-500-crore-to-gb-nagar-banks/story-UtljyYC3d0X9dy6SaLUmdM.html

According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a weather monitoring agency of the central government, the AQI is likely to improve towards Monday but may deteriorate on Tuesday.“The overall air quality is in the “very poor” category. Surface-level winds are moderate and west-north-westerly and moderate winds and better ventilation conditions are forecasted for the next two days... AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and on the lower end of the “very poor” category on December 15 (Tuesday),” said SAFAR statement on Sunday.The air quality index of Noida on Sunday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 322, against 393 on Saturday, and 324 on Friday.

13-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Focused testing finds 249 positive cases between Dec 1-8||Ghaziabad: More coronavirus (Covid-19) cases have been traced during the district’s health department’s focused testing drive in high case-load areas in December, as compared to focused testing done during the pre-Diwali and post-Diwali period.Officials said that focused testing is different from the regular testing being taken up daily at the various testing centres in the city. The drive was initiated on the directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, which directed officials to map high incidence areas and take up testing drives there to trace infected persons.As per health department data, the results of the drive from December 1 to December 8 have indicated that 13,226 tests were conducted and these resulted in 249 positive cases, with a positivity rate of about 1.88%. These included 9,494 tests through rapid antigen kits (which gave 142 positive cases) while 3,732 were taken up through the use of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (which gave 107 positive cases) method.Meanwhile, pre-Diwali focused testing was conducted by the district health department from October 29 to November 12, during which a total of 20,852 tests were conducted which resulted in overall 139 positive cases, with a positivity rate of about 0.66%.Likewise, about 21,801 overall tests were conducted during the post-Diwali period, from November 19 to November 30, and these yielded a total of 257 positive cases, with a positivity rate of about 1.17%.“The idea of this drive is to filter out cases which have a potential to infect others. The drive will continue in high incidence areas and certain pockets have been identified where additional testing teams have been deployed. Although the positivity rate is comparatively less than the overall positivity, cases being traced are large in numbers and need to be isolated,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to officials, the testing teams are conducting tests in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Karhera, Sahibabad, Kavi Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Vijay Nagar, among others, from where officials have found most Covid-19 positive cases from March to November.“For conducting focused testing, we have deployed additional teams in these high case load areas and these teams are conducting tests after getting in touch with local residents’ welfare associations and councillors. This focused testing is different from the regular testing done at our static testing centres across the city. During the eight days’ period, we found about 249 cases, which is a big number considering the impact if such infected persons were left unattended, and they could have possibly passed on the virus to others,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“We conducted focused testing on ‘super spreader’ groups before and after Diwali festival, and the positivity rate was low. During focused testing in high incidence areas, the positivity is higher. So, the results are encouraging and such testing will continue,” he added.The ‘super spreader’ groups included groups of staff of malls, sweet shops, beauty salons, vehicle workshops and observation homes, inmates of Dasna jail and auto drivers, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-focused-testing-finds-249-positive-cases-between-dec-1-8/story-Qb127tDV1qJw0EgaskeCYL.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Towel left in Ludhiana woman’s womb, inquiry marked||In a shocking incident, doctors who carried out a caesarean operation at the Civil Hospital on December 8 were accused of leaving a towel inside a woman’s womb on Sunday. The matter came to light after the woman’s husband, Ravinder Singh, accompanied by his relatives and other social activists staged a sit-in protest outside the mother and child unit of the civil hospital and demanded stringent action against the operating doctors and the staff for gross negligence. Taking serious note of the incident, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga has marked an inquiry into the matter.“These are serious allegations. We have marked an inquiry and constituted a committee to probe the incident,” said Bagga.The complainant, Ravinder, a resident of Shimlapuri said his wife was rushed to the civil hospital on December 7 after she experienced labour pain. “The doctors suggested a caesarean operation after carrying out a few tests. The surgery took place on December 8, though the baby was healthy, my wife was writing in pain and was unable to urinate. We consulted the doctors and showed them swelling on her stomach but she was only given a sedative.” “When the pain did not subside for two days, I urged the hospital to refer us to a private hospital but they encouraged us to go to Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala. Finally, I took her to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H) on December 11 where the doctors operated on my wife and found a towel in her womb. Their negligence could have led to my wife’s death,” said Ravinder.After staging a protest for nearly an hour, he lodged a formal complaint against the doctors and staff that had carried out the operation.SIMILAR INCIDENT It is not the first time that the civil hospital has been accused of gross negligence. In May 2019 , the staff of Mother Child Hospital had wrongly transfused A+ blood to a patient who was B+. On the basis of the report submitted, action was taken against four Diplomate of National Board (DNB) residents, a blood transfusion officer, one staff nurse and a matron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/towel-left-in-ludhiana-woman-s-womb-inquiry-marked/story-lnQCxudEMe2Vl0725cHVoI.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs Maharashtra government to deposit ₹5 lakh as compensation for custodial death of minor||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently directed the state to deposit a sum of ₹5 lakh which can be withdrawn by the parent of a 16-year-old who was allegedly a victim of custodial violence at Shirdi police station and died on March 31, 2016. The teenager was picked up by Shirdi police from the Saibaba temple premise on the suspicion of pick-pocketing. However, when the minor’s father and brother went to the police station, they were not allowed to see him, and later the police rushed the body to the hospital where the father was informed that his son was dead. The father approached the HC seeking ex-gratia compensation as well as an inquiry against the officers responsible for the death of his son. The court, while granting the compensation, said that the state could recover the amount from the errant police officers. A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing the criminal writ petition filed by Ashok Rokade, was informed by advocate SS Chapalgaonkar that his client was the father of the 15-year-old who had died while he was kept in lock-up at Shirdi police station on March 31, 2016. He informed the court that as the deceased was a minor and had died while in lock-up, his client was seeking ex-gratia compensation and an inquiry against the officers who put the minor in lock-up without inquiring about his age, and also assaulted and tortured him, which resulted in his death. As per the documents submitted by the police through additional public prosecutor OG Wattamwar, Rokade’s son was allegedly caught in the Saibaba temple premises while he was stealing the purse of a woman. He was handed over to two police personnel who were assigned security duty at the temple. The minor was taken to Shirdi police station where he was handed over to the police station officer who put the suspect in lock-up without finding out his age or following due procedure of informing the family of the suspect or taking him for a medical test. Later, when the Rokade reached the police station, he was not allowed to see his son and was asked to leave. While waiting outside, the father saw police personnel taking away a body which was covered in a blanket. When the father followed the police and reached the hospital, he was informed that his son was dead. Chapalgaonkar submitted that when Rokade tried to lodge a complaint against the police personnel on April 1, 2016, he was ignored and only after he approached the higher authorities, a complaint was lodged against assistant police inspector (ASI) Sangita Ramdas Raut, police hawaldar Shaikh Ayyub Babu, ASI Shaikh Rajjaq Abdul Behram, police naik Rajendra Bhagchand Avhad and police naik Harischandra Baburao Mane. Chapalgaonkar further submitted that a post-mortem was conducted after much persuasion and the report stated that the minor had died of an abrasion on the neck. However, Wattamwar refuted the allegations and said that the suspect had died by suicide and hence, the police were not to be blamed. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the police had not followed proper procedure while arresting the minor, and as CCTV footage was not available and the post-mortem report indicated custodial death, it was directing the state to deposit a sum of ₹5 lakh towards ex-gratia compensation in the court, which could be withdrawn by Rokade. The court further directed the state to recover the amount from the errant police personnel and said that the other prayers of the petition could be decided by the trial court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-directs-maharashtra-government-to-deposit-5-lakh-as-compensation-for-custodial-death-of-minor/story-U1bhYW2x6LzdaQlRugw4MK.html
13-12-2020||Noida||About 68% Covid-related fatalities in Ghaziabad suffer co-morbid conditions||Ghaziabad: As the district comes close to the figure of 100 Covid-related fatalities, an analysis by the health department indicated that about 68% patients who died of Covid-19 had co-morbidities. According to the state control room records, Ghaziabad has reported 98 Covid deaths so far. However, the analysis has been done for 97 deaths, officials of district health department said. The officials said that of the 97 fatalities analysed so far, 66 cases were those which had co-morbid conditions. Of the major co-morbid conditions analysed, there were 39 patients suffering diabetes, 34 had hypertension, six were those who suffered chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), five were found with asthma while another four had renal disorders. “These co-morbid conditions were majorly found in cases of fatalities and it is also possible that one case was suffering more than one co-morbid condition. So, the analysis indicates that patients with co-morbid conditions need special care and must take all precautions,” said an officer from the health department. The age group having the highest fatality rate was of people over 60 years with 35 deaths so far. The second highest age group in terms of fatality was of people aged 46-60 years with 33 deaths so far. The age group 31-45 years suffered 18 fatalities while those aged 16-30 years accounted for a total of nine deaths in the district, showed the health department’s analysis. Age group 0-15 years had two fatalities so far. “We are taking all precautions while dealing with Covid-19 patients having co-morbid conditions. They are immediately referred to L2 or L3 category Covid facility. If they stay in home isolation with very mild co-morbid conditions, there is an extra wing at the Covid command and control centre which monitors their health status regularly. Likewise, we are also monitoring elderly people as well as pregnant women whose condition may complicate, in case they are found positive for infection,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Even all hospitals, including the private hospitals, have been directed to take extra care of cases having co-morbid conditions,” he added. According to the official analysis, about 14 of overall fatalities have taken place in areas of Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Vaishali while 13 have taken place in segment of Vijay Nagar/Kaila Bhatta and another 13 in segment of Muradnagar, among others. Overall, 81 of 97 fatalities have taken place in urban segments, while 16 in rural segments in the district. At present, the overall case fatality rate in the district is 0.4% while it was about 4.04% in the month of June when maximum of 50 fatalities took place. Ever since, eight deaths have taken place in July, seven in August, nine in September, three in October, 10 in November and three in December so far. One death took place in the month of April and another six in May. The analysis indicated that of the 97 patients who died of Covid-19, 58 of them were men while 39 were women. Experts said that those suffering co-morbid conditions and also those in old age need to take extra precautions against Covid. “If possible, they should avoid moving out unless absolutely necessary. It is generally seen that the most affected are those who have diabetes and this doubles chances of fatality. In case people have added co-morbidities like hypertension or heart ailments combined with diabetes, the risk increases up to four times. So, extra precaution is needed for such people,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Further, those in old age and also those who suffer compromised immunity should also take extra precaution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/about-68-covid-related-fatalities-in-ghaziabad-suffer-co-morbid-conditions/story-whWtZ14EtKZET5aLlizCUO.html

13-12-2020||City||Greater Noida authority plans to take over stuck projects of bankrupt realty firms||GREATER NOIDA: In a move that can benefit thousands of aggrieved homebuyers, the Greater Noida authority has decided to take over control of some stuck projects of bankrupt realty firms through proper channel, and ensure their timely completion. The authority aims to take over such projects by participating in a process underway at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), officials said. According to the Greater Noida authority’s estimate, there are at least 36 realty firms which are facing trial at NCLT. “We will submit our resolution plan in order to take over defaulted realty project with an aim to deliver the same and benefit homebuyers. We have got information that some companies are being taken over at very low valuation causing loss to homebuyers. To protect their interests, we will step in those cases, where the valuation of a defaulted company is less than the market rates,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Bhooshan further said that if, for example, a defaulted company is getting a rate of ₹100 per square metres when the rate should be ₹500 per square metres, then the authority will come forward to protect the interest of homebuyers and the government.Under section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, financial creditors can drag debt-ridden real estate companies to NCLT. Subsequently, NCLT appoints an interim resolution professional (IRP), who then invites resolution plans from interested companies, including the government agency, in order to revive the defaulted company. All stakeholders, including homebuyers and banks, vote for a new company who have better resolution plan to take over the bankrupt realty firm. “If a realty firm is not valued properly by participating bidders, then it affects our interests as well as homebuyers. Therefore, it is better that we take it over through the process and develop it,” said Bhooshan. Homebuyers have been demanding that the government entities must take over the defaulted realty projects.“We have written to the UP government and the UP Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) to make sure the government bodies come forward to take over defaulted projects through IBC provisions because the private firms are not valuing such projects as per the market rates and the interest of homebuyers is not safe,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association.The Greater Noida authority is also keen to take over the defaulted projects because it is struggling to recover around ₹7,000 crore financial dues from the realtors, who have defaulted on payment of land cost amid the slowdown in the realty market, the officials said.UP-Rera also feels that it will be a landmark decision for the real estate sector if the authority comes forward to take over the stuck projects of defaulted realty firms.“It is a major policy decision, and will certainly benefit the sector as a whole and also of course the homebuyers,” said Balvinder Kumar, member of UP-Rera, a government body formed to safeguard the rights of homebuyers and the real estate sector.Sunil Kumar Mishra, a senior lawyer, said, “In the past cases on trial in NCLT, we have observed that very few companies turn up to take over the defaulted firms. And those which turn up value the defaulted group at a low price thereby affecting the investment of all those, who have stake in the debt-ridden company. But if the government bodies participate in bidding, then it will start a healthy eco-system and help in safeguarding the rights of homebuyers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-authority-plans-to-take-over-stuck-projects-of-bankrupt-realty-firms/story-4vpywBWQCvEJEnNlwmSpBK.html
13-12-2020||Noida||Noida-Delhi side at Chilla border opens for traffic; farmers continue protest||Noida: The Noida-Delhi carriageway at Chilla border, which had been closed by a group of farmers for the past 12 days, was reopened for traffic early Sunday morning. The traffic is now open on both sides at the Chilla border, senior police officers said.The development comes after members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union-Bhanu, who had blocked the traffic since December 1 in protest against the Centre’s new farm bills, met with defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Delhi on Saturday evening. Thakur Bhanu Pratap, president of BKU-Bhanu, said, “A number of commuters faced problems due to traffic diversion. On Saturday, we met defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Narendra Tomar. The two ministers have assured us that the farmers’ issues will be addressed. Besides, the police officials in Noida requested us to clear the road and allow traffic towards Delhi. We do not want to trouble commuters and hence we have cleared the road.” However, Pratap said that this does not mean the protest has ended. “The protest and traffic movement will continue parallelly,” he said.Meanwhile, the farmers led by BKU-Bhanu’s state president Thakur Yogesh Pratap are continuing protest along the central verge on the same route. Yogesh Pratap also started a hunger strike from Sunday. A ‘havan’ was also performed at the Chilla border on Sunday by the protesting farmers. A spot visit on Sunday showed that the protesters were still stationed along the central verge under a tent. The police have placed barricades at some distance which narrowed the traffic to one lane and reserved some space for protesters. The BKU-Bhanu workers have also parked several SUVs and cars on the road for safety of protesters at the spot. “The police personnel convinced my father to clear the Noida-Delhi road. But farmers have planned to intensify the protest till the demands are met. I am observing hunger strike from Sunday,” Yogesh Pratap said. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the Noida-Delhi route has been cleared. “We have placed barriers to guide the commuters to Delhi. The traffic police personnel have been deployed to ensure smooth commuting. The Delhi-Noida traffic is already functional,” he said.Teams of the Delhi Police have also been deployed on the Mayur Vihar side, the Noida police said, adding that the traffic movement on the DND Flyway and the Kalindi Kunj route, both connecting Noida to Delhi, was also normal on Sunday.Meanwhile, the BKU (Lok Shakti) members at the Dalit Prerna Sthal said that they will hold a hunger strike on Monday. Dr SK Giri, general secretary and spokesperson of BKU (Lok Shakti), said, “We will continue our protest against the farm bills. We will sit on a hunger strike on Monday.”The farmers from different organisations have been protesting at various borders with Delhi against the Centre’s three new agri bills -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-delhi-side-at-chilla-border-opens-for-traffic-farmers-continue-protest/story-qSQp7xEczpdNAPFTdsI68H.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||BMC forms teams to take action against Mumbai nightclubs violating Covid-19 rules||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has formed two teams each across all 24 administrative wards of Mumbai to inspect and take action against nightclubs violating Covid-19 guidelines and operating overtime. The move comes after the civic body recently found many clubs violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and operating till 4am on the weekend. The BMC found over 2,000 people gathered in spaces of fewer than 4000 sq m, not wearing masks, and not maintaining social distancing. According to the act, more than 50 people are not allowed to gather at a location at a time. At present, restaurants, eateries, bars and pubs in the city are allowed till 11.30pm, according to BMC’s unlock plan. Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code is still imposed in the city, in effect since the start of the lockdown in March. Now, the civic body has directed all assistant commissioners of the 24 wards to randomly raid nightclubs in the city starting this week. Civic officials said the teams will comprise officials from the health department, fire brigade and clean-up marshals. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “All wards have been directed to ready their teams for inspections at night clubs. Police officers will also be part of the teams. The teams will act on complaints and will also proactively carry out inspections in their respective areas. From social distancing to fire compliance, everything will be checked by the teams. Clean-up marshals will be part of the inspections, which will also fine people not wearing masks.” On Saturday last week, BMC raided three clubs in Bandra and Lower Parel, after a tip-off that they were operating overnight. Subsequently, at least 1,000 people were forced out by BMC officers during the raid. According to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, BMC fined everyone who were not wearing masks at this time and FIRs were lodged against the clubs. Mumbai has seen a drop in daily Covid-19 cases since November. Civic officials said all safety norms should be maintained although cases were low. Kakani added, “We want to avoid any risk that could lead to another surge in cases. Even though fewer cases are being reported daily, citizens should continue to follow all precautionary measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-forms-teams-to-take-action-against-mumbai-nightclubs-violating-covid-19-rules/story-grd4bNvGdreubtsVGYkWqJ.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tankers being used to drain water from Uran wetlands; more security cabins set up at Panje||Following a site visit to Uran in Navi Mumbai on Thursday, environmentalists have revealed that unidentified persons are drying up wetland patches using water tankers to drain large water bodies. The unidentified persons are also creating bunds inside the wetland to restrict water from flowing out and ensuring that it gets evaporated. The techniques were identified by the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed wetland and mangrove grievance redressal committee member Stalin D and environmentalist Nandkumar Pawar. Additionally, 10 new security cabins at the threatened Panje area in Uran have been set up. Both environmentalists took photos of the violations and shared them in a complaint before various bodies of the Maharashtra government on Friday. The alleged destruction of wetlands was highlighted a day after the Raigad district administration informed the HC-panel on Wednesday that there were no wetlands in Uran taluka as per the definition of the new 2017 wetland rules. “Emboldened by the collector’s stand that there are no wetlands in Uran, the land mafia is working overtime to destroy all traces of wetlands in Uran. Despite 13 wetlands being identified by scientific experts and the National Wetland Inventory Atlas, Maharashtra 2011, today only five remain (two sites at Belpada, and one each at Bhendkhal, Sawharkar, and Panje), which are also being squeezed further,” said Stalin, adding, “Time has run out for Uran wetlands only due to inaction of the collector and active support from the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco).” In a separate letter to the Konkan divisional commissioner on Friday, Stalin pointed out that about six years ago, the then chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell) N Vasudevan had submitted a report to the Bombay HC that the Bhendkhal wetland was being reclaimed, and needed to be protected. “Though the reclamation had stopped for a while, the site has been destroyed and only a fraction is in existence today. Illegal truck parking and industrial units have come up on the wetland. We seek removal of all encroachments and debris that from the site,” said Stalin. Nandakumar Pawar, head of environmental group Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan, said he was aghast to see 10 security cabins cropping up at Panje which according to him are either set up by a private company to restrict the entry of birders, environmentalists or local residents. During his visit on Thursday, he found strict security and a board proclaiming the place as private property. “How can a wetland be somebody’s private property,” he asked the security guards preventing bird watchers and local fishing community from entering the wetland. He said the HC-panel had specifically directed Cidco and the Raigad district collector to ensure that Panje is protected and conserved. Environmentalist Aishwarya Sridhar, who has been regularly photographing the condition of Panje, said, “The wetland is purposely dried off-and-on by vested interests with a view to showing that it is not a wetland, and open it up for real estate and commercial development.” Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari said she was not aware about the complaints or methods being alleged by the HC-panel member, but clarified that the district was working to protect Panje. “We are examining how the Panje area needs to be protected, based on directions by the government. If we are sent a list of more such locations, we will verify and examine the need for their protection,” she said. Pramod Patil, nodal officer, Cidco, said he was awaiting directions from the collectors’ office on site visits to study the possibility of declaring wetlands in Uran, but denied that he knew anything about security cabins being set up at Panje or the use of tankers to drain water at other sites in the taluka. “Panje belongs to a private company and we have asked them to ensure the area is protected,” he said. Meanwhile, another environment group, NatConnect Foundation, requested the Maharashtra government on Friday through a letter to take stern action against the Raigad collector and other officials for defying environment minister Aaditya Thackeray’s previous directions to stop construction at Panje. “With more security cabins and recent developments before the HC-panel, there are serious lapses on the part of the collectorate and Cidco that have ensured that the minister’s instructions of no fresh construction at Panje are not followed,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-tankers-being-used-to-drain-water-from-uran-wetlands-more-security-cabins-set-up-at-panje/story-OaWhtZPi7ESypJbOqIZ9zH.html

However, neither the bone-chilling temperature nor the dense fog was able to dampen the spirit of farmers heading towards the Delhi border to join their comrades protesting against the contentious farm reform laws. The farmers were observed taking a break and warming themselves up with tea at the Ladhowal Toll Plaza.As per the meteorology expert, the maximum temperature dropped by eight notches. However, the minimum temperature was 10.5°C, which was 4 degrees lower than the normal temperature. Besides the dip in temperature, the visibility shrunk to 100m in the morning, endangering motorists. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) meteorological expert Dr KK Gill said, “Snowfall in the higher reaches has intensified the cold wave. However, the weather is expected to remain pleasant come Monday.”PAU researchers back farmers In solidarity with the farmers demanding roll back of the farm reforms, PAU research fellows were seen holding encouraging placards outside the varsity.

13-12-2020||Kolkata||Two Bengal BJP workers killed in 24 hrs, three held amid stir||Saikat Bhawal, president of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) polling booth-level committee at Halishahar in North 24 Parganas district, was killed in an attack by motorcycle-borne men on Saturday evening, police said. Bhawal and three others were attacked by about a dozen men when BJP workers were visiting voters to carry out the party’s outreach programme in the Barendragali area. Three men were arrested on Sunday morning in connection with the murder. In a second incident reported on Sunday morning, body of Sukhendu Pramanik, a BJP worker, was fished out of a pond at Chandpara village in the Purbasthali area of East Burdwan district. Pramanik’s family and local BJP workers alleged that he went missing two days ago after taking part in a rally held by the party’s youth wing. The party alleged that Pramanik was murdered and the body was later dumped in the pond. “We have registered a case of unnatural death. A probe is on,” an officer of the Purbasthali police station said on condition of anonymity. Also read: Google’s iconic white-coloured Search page is finally changingAt Halishahar, Bhawal was allegedly beaten up with the wooden handle of a shovel. He and three others were rushed to JN Memorial Hospital at Kalyani in adjoining Nadia district. Bhawal died at the hospital. The FIR was registered at Bijpur police station. “Four people were named in the police complaint. Three of them were arrested in the morning and charged with murder, attempt to murder, assault and criminal conspiracy. They will be produced before the Barrackpore court in the afternoon,” an officer of Bijpur police station said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to brief the media. “The three arrested men faced criminal charges in the past,” the officer added. Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of targeting his party’s leaders and workers and carrying out well-planned attacks. “Both these workers were victims of political violence. We urge the Centre to take necessary action so that Bengalis can live safely like citizens in other states,” said Majumdar who led the funeral procession with Bhawal’s body on Sunday evening. Parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “All deaths are unfortunate. But the BJP has started passing off all deaths as killings by the TMC. They also demand CBI probe at the drop of a hat. The state police will definitely find out the truth.”Partha Bhowmik, TMC legislator from Naihati, said his party was not at all involved in the attack at Halishahar. “The violence was the outcome of an internal feud between two local groups,” said Bhowmik.BJP has claimed that more than 120 of its workers and leaders have been murdered in West Bengal in recent years. The party started an agitation outside Bijpur police station on Sunday, condemning Bhawal’s murder.Although the agitation started peacefully, the BJP workers got into a scuffling with policemen around noon. They broke through barricades and surrounded the Bijpur police station compound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/two-bengal-bjp-workers-killed-in-24-hrs-three-held-amid-stir/story-Fv8qFcuiaq8Wm2UMnCHjmK.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Despite inching deadline, pet registration garners tepid response in Ludhiana||Six months after the Ludhiana municipal corporation made it mandatory for residents to register their pets with the civic body, few residents have followed up on the notification. Only 474 residents have registered their dogs with the civic body while no cats have been enrolled so far. Of those who have registered their pets, only 190 collected the brass tokens that are to be fastened on the pets’ collars.The deadline runs out three in weeks, after which defaulting pet owners will have to shell ₹4,000 as fine. The pet registration drive began in June and despite mayor Balkar Sandhu’s encouragement, most pet owners are yet to register their cats and dogs. Residents must pay ₹400 annually for pet registration or a penalty will be imposed after December 31. Authorities so far do not have a tally of pets in the city. However, a thorough drive will be carried out in January to fine violators.MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “It is mandatory to tie a token around the neck of a pet and ferocious dogs must be muzzled while being taken for a walk.”“In addition to the ₹4,000 penalty, owners of unregistered pets will have to pay ₹100 a day to MC as the civic body will take on the pets’ custody and care till the animal is registered. Should the pet attack anybody, the owner must bear the expenses,” said Dhalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-inching-deadline-pet-registration-garners-tepid-response-in-ludhiana/story-PMcWuIxfRPQJvndQyq5OsI.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to develop app for Covid-19 vaccination||Following the footsteps of the Union health ministry, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to develop a real time monitoring Covid-19 mobile application to regulate the vaccination process for the 2 crore population in Mumbai.When the pandemic started in India, the Union health ministry launched Aarogya Setu app to keep a track on infected patients and area-wise concentration of Covid-19 infection. Now, as the government is expecting to roll out the first Covid-19 vaccine next year, they have launched a new app — CoWin-20 — which will be the go-to app for Covid-19 vaccine distribution.Considering the huge population of Mumbai, BMC, in a meeting held on Friday, decided to develop a similar app which will be the digital arm of its Covid-19 vaccination programme.“We have an experience of providing vaccine to children, but not to adults. So, it will be challenging for us to regulate such a huge adult population for vaccination. For this, we are planning to design a centralised app which will help us to procure the data digitally,” said an official from BMC’s immunisation programme.The vaccine will be given in two doses with the second dose to be administered after 28 days of the first one. According to officials, the main challenge will be arranging the second dose without missing out on anyone.“This app will have all the updated data which will be connected to our systems. The users will have to link their Aadhaar number and mobile number. Alert message will also be sent to them regarding the next vaccine,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. He is currently heading the vaccine task force of the civic body.BMC will sync the data of recovered patients from Aarogya Setu app with their own mobile app.Till Friday, the state has uploaded data of nearly 1.91 lakh healthcare workers, who will be given vaccine on priority in the first slot, on CoWin app. “We want to finish vaccinating healthcare workers within 15 days of the roll out of the vaccine,” Kakani added.For the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai, a total of 1,365 vaccinators have been identified from the civic public health department. Each vaccine centre will be capable of vaccinating 1,200 beneficiaries per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-develop-app-for-covid-19-vaccination/story-lr4DGBt7OdAkDTsIfugiPM.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Coaching classes await clarity from Maharashtra government on reopening||More than six months after the education department allowed schools in various parts of the state to reopen, coaching classes are still awaiting guidelines from the government.While several coaching class associations have repeatedly written to the education department, an announcement regarding their reopening is yet to be made.Recently, the Coaching Classes Teachers’ Federation, a pan Maharashtra body of classes has written to the department urging them to allow classes to reopen. “There are several challenges with online learning and we thus hope that physical classes will begin soon. Even as all the other businesses are allowed to reopen in the state, classes are still not granted permissions,” said Bandopant Bhoyar, president of the federation.Parents said that they would be willing to send their children to classes at least for a few days. “Doubt solving sessions are necessary especially for science students, and that cannot happen effectively over the phone or online. We hope the government allows classes to reopen at least partially,” said Amita Shekhar, a city-based parent.Officials from the education department said that a decision in this regard is awaited from the state government. The coaching classes have been closed for more than nine months now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coaching-classes-await-clarity-from-maharashtra-government-on-reopening/story-P4YjD4L3yJpvydfeKqmTPM.html
13-12-2020||City||Mumbai: Theatre in Kalyan open to full house on Day 1||The Acharya Atre Natya Rangmandir in Kalyan opened for its first show post lockdown on Saturday. At 50% capacity, the theatre was almost full on the first day. “After maintaining the 50% seating capacity, we had a provision for 425 people in the audience; almost 300 turned up on the first day of the play – Tu Mhanshil Tasa. We also had a good response on the second day for the performance of a classic, Sant Tukaram. We followed all Covid norms. The audiences and staff were provided with sanitisers. Temperature checks were also done before the audience entered the auditorium. We have more bookings lined up for the coming weeks,” said Manik Shinde, manager of Acharya Atre Natya Rangmandir. This is the first auditorium within Mumbai Metropolitan Region to open up for a play.Actor Subodh Bhave expressed gratitude towards the audience for a positive response. “Marathi audiences love to watch plays. They have been confined to their homes for the longest period. The response we received in Mumbai and Pune was overwhelming. We are motivated to present more shows,” Bhave said.Santosh Kanekar, president, Maharashtra Theatre Producers Guild, said, “It is not the right time to come up with new plays as it will be a huge investment risk. It would be right to focus on showcasing classics and well-known plays for the timebeing. Our focus currently is to ensure that there is an income generated among those who work backstage or with the auditoriums.”“Currently we are performing in Mumbai, Thane and Pune areas. It will take some time for us to get contracts to perform in other places,” added Kanekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-theatre-in-kalyan-open-to-full-house-on-day-1/story-qGR1KYL5C8an3gvDJUUDbN.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Despite heavy smog, city air quality remains stable||Despite the presence of dense smog on Sunday morning, the city’s air quality for the day remained in the “poor” category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s(CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin, for the third consecutive day. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, nearly four degrees below Saturday’s 14 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature stayed at 21 degrees, same as the previous day. On Monday, the minimum temperature is expected to settle at 9 degrees Celsius, as per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) weekly forecast. A partly cloudy sky is expected to prevail on Monday, with another episode of dense to very dense fog expected in the earlier hours. Delhi-NCR may continue to see foggy mornings till Tuesday, as per the IMD. Sunday’s AQI was 239, down from 296 the previous day. Officials attributed fog in the early hours to a steep dip in the minimum temperature triggered by isolated rainfall over parts of Delhi-NCR.This also led to an uptick in pollution levels. However, with northwest winds blowing at a speed of about 12kpmh through the day, the smog was quickly dispersed and gave way to cleaner air in the afternoon, data from Gurugram’s air quality monitors showed. At Vikas Sadan, for example, PM2.5 levels touched as much as 389ug/m3 around 4am, but had dipped to as little as 79ug/m3 by 4pm. Similar improvements in particulate matter levels were seen across all four air quality monitoring stations operated by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board in Gurugram.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to remain in poor category on 14.12.2020 and poor to lower end of very poor category on 15.12.2020. The air quality is likely to remain in poor to lower end of very poor category till 17.12.2020 and marginal deterioration is likely to start from 18.12.2020.” Winds are expected to blow from the northwest of Delhi at speeds of up to 10kmph,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/despite-heavy-smog-city-air-quality-remains-stable/story-cPgOO7Lgwb0LCDfLtofjsJ.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records fewer Covid-19 deaths; cases fall below 300 for third day in a row||With the slowdown in new Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, the past week has recorded a relative dip in the frequency of Covid-related mortality, shows health department data. Based on the last seven days’ data, the death rate in Gurugram now stands at 0.6 percent — down from 1 percent the week prior. From 25 Covid deaths in the week ending on December 6, the number dipped to 12 in the week ending on December 13. In estimated terms, from about five deaths a day in late November, the district is now seeing between one and two deaths per day, said health department officials. The district also recorded fewer than 300 cases of Covid-19 for the third consecutive day on Sunday, with the day’s tally standing at 275 new reported infections. Gurugram also reported 228 new recoveries and two new deaths, taking the total death toll to 331. A total of 3,739 new samples were tested for Covid-19 in Gurugram on Sunday, of which seven percent came back positive. Both daily and weekly test-positivity rates have remained under 10 percent for well over three weeks, even dipping to five percent on Saturday, when 276 positive cases were detected from 5,794 samples tested.“This is a significant improvement. We were not entirely sure how things would play out because the weather is still unfavourable, but things have stabilised after the initial boom triggered by the onset of winter and due to Diwali. Once again, around the New Year, we will see increased public movement and also colder temperatures. As such, we have to be prepared for a possible fourth wave of cases,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. Sharma added that a slight uptick in the death rate may also be anticipated around mid-January. While the positivity-rate has remained consistently low, the absolute number of tests conducted has been declining over the past three weeks. From 56,007 tests conducted in the week ending November 29, only 37,053 samples were tested in the week ending December 6. This further fell to 29,354 samples. Health department officials said this was a considered move, given the dip in the positivity rate. “We have to use the our resources carefully,” said Sharma.The total number of active patients in the district stands at 2,250 — down from 2,872 a week ago. These comprise just under five percent of Gurugram’s total Covid-19 caseload (52,024) infections so far, indicating a recovery rate of 95 percent. Of the active cases, 2,046 are currently in home isolation, while 196 are in hospitals. Another eight active patients are under observation at district Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-fewer-covid-19-deaths-cases-fall-below-300-for-third-day-in-a-row/story-s5z53TAy7QLoSowDGGMXII.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Low visibility due to fog leads to two accidents on expressway||Low visibility due to fog led to two minor accidents on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on early Sunday morning, said Gurugram traffic police officials.In the first incident, a MUV hit a sedan from behind at the Jharsa Chowk flyover around 5.15 am. No injuries were reported. In the second incident, a hatchback collided with a motorcyclist at Rajiv Chowk around 5.30 am. The motorcyclist, who has been identified as Ajay Kumar, is a resident of Mahipalpur in Delhi and was heading home from Bilaspur when the incident took place. He suffered minor injuries.As per police officials, both accidents occurred due to poor visibility as the areas were covered in a thick blanket of fog. In both incidents, no cases were registered.Heavy early morning fog also added to the woes of commuters. Residents who travelled during the early morning hours said that for the most of their journey they drove with hazard lights on and, even when driving on the national highway, they did not accelerate above a speed of 50 kmph.“There was zero visibility for most part of my journey. At several points, I thought of returning back to my parents’ home or stopping on the side of the road for a brief period until the visibility improved. I realised that stopping on the side of the road may be extremely unsafe due to poor visibility. A driver may not been able to spot a stationary car and could collide with it. Hence, I decided to continue driving at a slow speed and finish my journey,” said Gaurav Bansal, a resident of Sector 31, who was travelling back home from Central Delhi.Coincidentally on Saturday, Gurugram traffic police had updated commuters over social media that they are installing reflector tapes at key points across the city to assist drivers when they are driving during low visibility. On Friday, they had also issued a safety advisory to motorists over social media listing precautions they need to keep in mind when driving during low visibility. These included, keeping lights of the vehicle on low beam for better visibility, driving at low speeds, using roadside reflectors to navigate, keeping a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and avoid overtaking.“Over the last week, we have identified key stretches across the city where there are blind spots that can result in accidents during fog. At all such points, reflector tapes have been installed, medians have been painted to ensure commuters can navigate through these stretches during low visibility. In addition, we have also issued a fog advisory for residents.It is vital that they follow them to keep themselves and others safe while driving,” said DK Bharadwaj, DCP traffic, Gurugram police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/low-visibility-due-to-fog-leads-to-two-accidents-on-expressway/story-eSxmwoqp9nqH9towWasi9J.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Manish Tewari questions ‘delusional grandeur’ of Modi govt||Congress national spokesperson and Sri Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari on Sunday took a jab at what he said was the “extravagant and delusional grandeur” of the Modi government while imposing exorbitant taxes on the people. Questioning the rationale behind building the Central Vista when the country was facing a serious economic crisis, Tewari said: “On the one hand the government has stopped the MPs local area development funds and on the other hand it is going to spend hundreds of crores of rupees for a new parliament building,” which was nothing but “delusional grandeur.” Reacting to the steep increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, Tewari said the National Democratic Alliance government was imposing heavy taxes on petrol and diesel, both currently the most expensive in the entire south Asian region. This, he said, was being done to fill the government’s coffers which were running empty, thanks to its ill advised economic policies. “A litre of crude oil costs ₹21.61. Even if you add three odd rupees as processing cost, it would come to 25 rupees a litre, while the sale price of petrol is ₹83.71 in Delhi and diesel is ₹73.61 in Chandigarh,” Tewari tweeted, while asking why the government of India was fleecing the people of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manish-tewari-questions-delusional-grandeur-of-modi-govt/story-E14sAKmp6hIOhBFdIp6BTM.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Water parity for new sectors from Jan 1 as Mohali MC takes over GMADA areas||Come January 1,in a major relief for around 35,000 families in sectors 66 to 69 and 76 to 81, 88 and Aerocity, water tariff will be reduced as municipal corporation (MC) will take over supply from the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) . People in the new sectors under GMADA are currently paying five times the regular charges of Rs 5.25 per kilolitre compared to other sectors under MC with rates of Rs 1.8 per kilolitre. “We have already sent a proposal to the local bodies department of Punjab and it will be approved in a week’s time. We will implement it from January 1,” an MC official said on condition of anonymity as he’s not authorised to speak to the media. Calling it a “big relief” for the affected families, former Congress councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi thanked Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for “getting it done.” A senior GMADA official said the authority was ready to hand over supply to MC and it would involve “only a day’s work.”Locals and political groups have been campaigning for water parity for long with former Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillors even moving the Lok Adalat. “We have been fighting for parity for the past two years and paying excessive charges. The delay was due to the Congress and now they will take credit for it before the upcoming MC elections,” said former SAD councillor Surinder Singh. The MC house had approved the agenda in June last year to take over the water supply system of new sectors from GMADA, following which on July 16, the local bodies department of Punjab approved municipal corporation agenda of taking over the water supply system. Later, GMADA asked MC to also take over maintenance of the sewer and storm sewer systems in the new sectors. Shinderpal Singh (Bobby Kamboj), former BJP councillor, said despite the MC passing a resolution to take over the water supply the government failed to take a decision on time and the residents had to pay exorbitant rates for water than those in other sectors.

13-12-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Ambitious parking policy could have its drawbacks||So there was good news last week, that the Chandigarh administration, after endless debates, finally notified the parking policy with the aim to decongest a city with the highest density of privately owned vehicles in India. How and when the proposals are cleared could be debatable because some of these are very controversial: Such as levying a charge for congestion and linking availability of parking space with vehicle registration. Who will decide how much is to be charged and when? Also can a person be denied his or her right to own a vehicle? Community parking is also recommended in each sector by using neighbourhood commercial and institutional parking lots on rental basis. Interestingly, these lots are to be run by the registered Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs). Using parking lots of educational institutions post their operational hours has also been proposed in the policy that aims at maximising utilisation of existing parking spaces through community parking. Other suggestions include creation of new parking avenues by allowing multi-level, even underground, parking lots. Also, though green belts will not be converted to parking areas, construction beneath the parks will be allowed. Other important points include two main gates in the front boundary and stilt parking on the ground floor of the house. In group housing societies, commercial and institutional buildings three-level basement parking can be built. Formulated by the urban planning department, the policy doesn’t have any mandatory clauses, and the onus of its implementation will be on various government agencies, particularly, the municipal corporation and the UT transport department. While some of the points are achievable, some key issues include convincing people to cough up congestion tax or deciding how RWAs, some of which cannot even handle collection of maintenance charges from residents, will handle community parking spaces.The failure of the parking agreement between and the municipal corporation and a private contractor is a case in point. How well will the tie-ups be managed?Space raceWill UT’s new parking policy work?What are the pros and cons of the parking policy notified by the Chandigarh administration? Which ones will work?

Lucknow had tested over 12 lakh samples so far and the positivity rate was around 6.7%. The health department conducted a signature campaign for Covid awareness at a mall in Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar area. People were made aware about the Covid infection while samples of visitors having symptoms were collected. “People came to the help desk and asked questions about safety, prevention and treatment. Many asked about correct use of mask too,” said Yogesh Raghuvanshi, spokesperson, office of CMO, Lucknow. During the campaign, head of respiratory medicine department at KGMU Prof Surya Kant gave a public lecture. “It will take months before the vaccine arrives and all are vaccinated. Till then, wear mask and wash your hands.

13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Outdoor air purifiers for Chandigarh to control pollution||Finally, a man-made remedy is being tested to check the city’s worsening air quality due to increasing traffic and cooler temperatures. Yes, 10-foot outdoor air purifier towers will be set up at key points in the city to enable people to breathe freely again.The UT administration will be setting up around 10 towers in different locations with very poor air quality. These will “reduce pollutants at specific spots and help improve air quality,” said a senior UT official privy to the development. This is part of a solution UT adviser Manoj Parida sought from the Central Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) sometime back. Chandigarh is one of the non-attainment cities in the country according to National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) norms, which means it has over a five-year period not consistently met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for harmful PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter), PM 2.5 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide).After remaining “satisfactory” and “moderate” during the lockdown period and a few months after, the air quality index (AQI) again turned “poor” for the first time this year in November. CPCC has floated tenders inviting firms to install the purifiers. “It is being done on a pilot basis. After examining its effectiveness we will be deciding on expanding the project to other parts of the city,” the official said. The company that is selected will install, operate and maintain the purifiers. PATHOGENS, VIRUSES WILL ALSO BE FILTERED “The effectiveness of the Delhi experience with the outdoor purifiers hasn’t been very positive. So, we have decided to avail better and latest technology for the purifiers to be installed in the city,” the official said. The purifiers will have gas neutralisation systems and filters for different categories of pollutants such as PM 10 and PM2.5. A UVC system will nullify the micro-organisms, pathogens and viruses present in the air. LOCATIONS BEING IDENTIFIED The administration is yet to finalise the locations for the purifiers. “We are in the process of identifying them, and might choose areas with heavy traffic density all day long, such as rotaries or traffic light junctions,” the official said. Any places with traffic congestion such as schools with cars and buses picking up and dropping children through the day can also be selected, he added.Towers are also likely to be set up in parking lots of markets and tourist spots (Sukhna Lake or Rock Garden).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/outdoor-air-purifiers-for-chandigarh-to-control-pollution/story-quHQXSK5hPsE4t20I0IfEM.html

13-12-2020||Jaipur||Congress ahead of BJP in Rajasthan civic body polls||The Congress in Rajasthan is ahead of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the elections to 50 urban local bodies in 12 districts of the state whose results were declared on Sunday. The results come a few days after the BJP performed better than Congress in rural local body elections in 21 of the state’s 33 districts. Results for urban local bodies show that independents will be kingmakers in the formation of boards in most districts. Of 1,775 municipal wards, results were declared for 1,774 on Sunday; the Congress has bagged 619, independents 597, BJP 547 and the rest others. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot congratulated all Congress candidates. He said in a tweet, “I thank all the citizens who showed their trust on Congress and because of which the party won. I thank all the Congress workers. Because of their hard work party has won.”Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra claimed that out of 50, their party is going to form board on at least 41 councils. “As a part of strategy, the Congress has planted independents in many seats to defeat the BJP which had the misconception that they are the party of the urban areas. Last time, out of 50, they had formed board on 34. But this time they cannot form board in more than nine councils,” he said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareekh said that it is too early to claim who will form how many boards. “In local elections, anti-defection law is not applicable and on 35 per cent seats, independents have won. Time will tell who will form how many boards,” he said. Also read: Some just oppose - Tomar slams opposition again over farmers’ stirAnalysis of the results shows that in Jaipur, out of 10 municipal councils, the Congress will be successful in forming board in six municipalities, including Chomu, Bagru, Shahpura, and Virat Nagar. In Bharatpur, independents have dominated the polls. Out of 255 wards, independent councillors bagged 187 seats; BJP got 45, Congress 22, and BSP 1. Independents in Dholpur city council also spoiled the mathematics for the Congress and BJP. Both the parties won 22 seats each, while the independents bagged 15 seats.

Recently, elections were held for Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad seats in 21 of the state’s 33 districts. Of 4,371 panchayat Samiti seats, the BJP won 1,989 and Congress 1,852. New members will elect heads of panchayat samitis. Of the 636 Zila Parishad (district council) seats, the BJP won 353 and Congress 252. Political experts believe, a day after the ruling Congress suffered a major jolt in Panchayati Raj and Zila Parishad elections, the results of urban local bodies have come as face-saving for the party, which has won on the majority of seats, pushing the BJP on third position with independents coming on the second position. The results surprise many as the urban voters have reposed faith in Congress party, which is contrary to the general trend where the urban voters are considered to be inclined towards BJP and the rural towards the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/cong-ahead-of-bjp-in-rajasthan-civic-body-polls/story-jgLZPJvxEOPPAbekYZubzH.html

The study is being conducted by the district administrations of Rudraprayag and Chamoli, where flood protection measures will be taken in respective areas by finding areas with maximum frequency of flooding. The study would cover Mandakini river’s stretch from Kedarnath to Rudraprayag and Alaknanda river’s stretch from Badrinath to Rishikesh. Manuj Goyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag, said that the study is being undertaken following the guidelines of Uttarakhand Flood Plain Zoning Act. “Under the Act, demarcations are made based on flood level data ranging from 25-100 years. Officials from the irrigation department are studying the flood data from all past years and after the study, new demarcations will be made in flood-prone areas,” said Goyal. Also read: Delhi-Jaipur highway partially opened amid farmers’ protestHe added that after the study is completed and the areas are notified as flood plains, zones will be identified where protective work can be done and areas where limited level of development work should be done. Due to periodic flooding in the rivers originating from the Himalayas, the population living on their banks have suffered a heavy loss of life and property. “Many times, locals build houses in sensitive areas which later get affected due to natural calamities. Such kind of a study with demarcations will help us avoid disasters in the future and prevent losses incurred by locals,” added the district magistrate. In Chamoli district, the district magistrate said that the work has almost been completed in Tharali and Chamoli blocks. Swati Bhadouriya, district magistrate Chamoli said, “Identification of flood plain zones have been done in Tharali and Chamoli blocks. It is being done for the whole of the Alaknanda valley, with the aim of sustainable development for the future. After completing the study, the details will be sent to the state government for the next course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-studies-past-100-year-flood-data-to-mark-flood-prone-areas/story-jEdbY5PPviqGKTfiScHsrM.html

A work in progress for the last one year, the market will operate out of a building made of poly bricks filled with plastic waste and have water harvesting and solar power plants.To be run by 25 women, She Haat has been set up by the district administration in collaboration with the tourism department to economically strengthen rural women. It is located on the busy Nahan Kumarhatti road.The market, which will be virtually inaugurated by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on December 17, will have a restaurant serving Himachali cuisine. “The objective is also to popularise the state’s food, particularly askali, which is similar to the south Indian idli and pattande, made from flour. The two dishes are very popular,” says Usha Kumari, 44, the secretary of She Haat.The locals were sceptical initially about women running She Haat, “but we have been trained and are confident that we will achieve our objective,” says Kumari. The women workers are from different age groups and come from different backgrounds and sections of the society. “ All the food and pahari cuisines will be prepared in a traditional chulha,” she adds.“The whole project will be run by 25 self-help group (SHG) women to empower them for self employment. As ‘her wings will grow, she will reach the sky with district administration Sirmaur,’ says RK Pruthi, the district’s deputy commissioner. Natural organic produce will be showcased and sold here, with the atta freshly ground at the flour mill on the site. A machine will mould biodegradable pattal (leaf) plates.Crops grown locally such as wheat, rice , coriander, buckwheat, citrus fruits and vegetables will be sold here.She Haat also has a two bedroom guest house. The solar power plant and rainwater harvesting system will ensure that environment friendly practises are promoted. Battery operated rickshaws will also run here. Meenakshi Sharma, 27, who drives one of the rickshaws, is excited. “I think I will be the first woman to drive auto in Himachal, it’s a great venture,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/restaurant-organic-food-at-eco-friendly-women-s-haat-in-sirmaur/story-wLy9uc2fGX2r7esPgIkL0I.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Sanitation crisis amid Covid? Civic body leaders seek funds from Delhi govt||On the seventh day of their protest, Mayors of the three municipal corporations on Sunday said that the delay in release of funds by the Delhi government will result in a sanitation and medical crisis, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, in the city.Mayors said that due to lack of funds, the corporations have not been able to release salaries and pension to its employees on time. The employees have been threatening to go on a strike.The mayors and office-bearers of the three municipal corporations have been sitting on protest outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence since December 7, demanding immediate release of Rs 13,000 crore to the corporations.North Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said, “The three corporation have 70,000 sanitation staff and we lift close to 10,000 metric tonnes of waste and 100 metric tonnes of biomedical waste. But we have not been able to pay them salaries on time. Does the AAP government want a sanitation crisis in the midst of a pandemic? How will these people run their homes without money? We are unable to pay salaries due to shortage of funds.”Hitting out at the CM, Jai Prakash said, “We have been sitting here for the past seven days and the CM is just not concerned. He has not even called us for a meeting. They are just playing politics at a time when we all need to work together.”The AAP government has ordered an inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds of more than Rs 2,400 crore in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. AAP leaders also demanded a CBI inquiry into it.Naveen Kumar, media head of Delhi BJP, said, “They are levelling baseless allegations. The government has ordered an inquiry. We want them to complete the inquiry in the next seven days and if any misappropriation of funds is found, then our mayors will resign. But if they don’t find any misappropriation of funds, then the Kejriwal government should resign.”Meanwhile, all the three mayors said that they will run their offices from outside Delhi CM’s residence from Monday onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sanitation-crisis-amid-covid-civic-body-leaders-seek-funds-from-delhi-govt/story-X6RSO91UJLt9NiITWhmvOI.html
13-12-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal’s famed ‘Poush Mela’ to be called off due to Covid restrictions||The annual ‘Poush Mela’, a heritage cultural event attracting lakhs of travellers to West Bengal’s Santiniketan, will not be held this year due to Covid-19 restrictions, an official said.The over-a-century-old handicraft, handloom, art and music festival, is usually held in December-end.“We are not sure about getting the nod from the local administration in view of the Covid-19 situation. Most students, an integral part of Poush Mela, are not coming to the campus.“Keeping all these factors in mind, we had to take this unpleasant decision for public health safety,” a member of Visva-Bharati’s executive council said.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting of the executive council.Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore’s father Maharshi Debendranath Tagore had first organised the fair in 1894 and Visva-Bharati, the university founded by the bard, started organising it from 1951.The ‘Poush Utsav’, including prayers and singing of devotional songs in the varsity campus, will, however, take place (on December 23 this year), he said.The fate of the Poush Mela has been a subject of conjecture in the last few months, with an official of the council claiming in July that Visva-Bharati authorities had decided to scrap the event, citing recent “bitter experiences” in organising the winter carnival amid a tussle with traders to comply with National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines.But in late August, the varsity had said that the central university is ready to organise the fair if it gets financial help from the Union government.The Visva-Bharati will observe its foundation day on December 24, which will be attended by the Union education minister and the West Bengal governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-s-famed-poush-mela-to-be-called-off-due-to-covid-restrictions/story-OKseopKGL8KiPqBNWWjc6I.html
13-12-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Pune residents unite to protect Vetal tekdi||While the MIT educational institute states that the road built on the Vetal tekdi green belt is their land and it will be used by its students and public in general to walk up the hill, PMC took action only after public outcry. The civic administration’s late response exposes its accountability. With greenery count losing to rapid urbanisation, residents list out steps that the authorities should take to sustain ecological balance in the city...Residents have emotional attachment with hillsWe are grateful to PMC for stopping work on the illegal road built by MIT on Vetal tekdi and trust they will not give any permissions in future for construction activity here or on other parts of the tekdi. Twenty five thousand people signed an online petition opposing the road in just a few days, and a weekend signature campaign on the tekdi by some youngsters garnered 5,400 signatures. This stands testimony to the emotional attachment people in Pune have for Vetal tekdi. This part of the hill may officially belong to MIT, but the tekdi itself, the grasslands and forests on it and the precious aquifers it contains benefits all Punekars – and we all have a stake in preserving this tekdi as a natural heritage site for future generations. The vital role of urban forests and grasslands in mitigating climate change risks is well recognised now. Several studies have shown the benefits of urban green space in fostering physical and psychological well-being of citizens. We may have won this battle, but the war continues. We plan to petition the CM to start the process for identifying “Deemed Forests” in Maharashtra and to notify tekdis in Pune as natural heritage sites in the Development Plan. This, we feel, will keep the tekdis safe to some extent from the relentless threats of construction activity in the name of development. Sushma DateThe tekdi is the heart and lung of the cityThe main issue is not the purpose of the road or the action of PMC. It is that Vetal tekdi is a cohesive area stretching from Chatuhshrungi up to Chandani chowk. It is the heart and lung of the city which needs to be protected at any cost. Thousands of people are regular visitors there and people don’t wish that Pune, the city of tekdis (hillocks), should lose one. It is the responsibility of each and every stakeholder to respect this wish and follow the laws and guidelines of city and state governments. Every stakeholder should have a broad view of environment and not just a narrow vision of land rights. The civic authorities have full support of the citizenry. The government should follow the constitutional principle of equality before law, public trust doctrine. The hill top rules and other regulations should be applied and executed.Anay PetheApathy in destruction of hillsAttempt by anyone to deviate from protecting the environment, causing irreversible ecological imbalance to the few remaining natural green spaces in the heart of the city, damage natural aquifers, and home to rare flora and fauna must be alerted and opposed. And the area groups and citizens who reported this serious breach must be applauded. Any such human intrusion on bio-diverse zones and hill tops/hill slopes will eventually lead to encroachments, hawkers, food stalls, hutments, amusement areas, after which the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) will put up their hands for not being able to control the illegal explosion. What is most disheartening is that an educational institute, to drive home its point is behaving as if no violation has taken place. However, it cannot be denied that senior PMC officers of the said area and said department have been alert enough to take immediate cognizable action. It is a result of non-accountability. The Bombay High Court in the matter of PIL no. 156 of 2006 for another road on the same tekdi (hill), emphasised the doctrine of public trust under which the government has the responsibility to protect natural resources for the general public. As such, it remains the irrevocable duty of the state to protect and improve the environment under Article 48A of the Constitution of India.Even if privately owned, all tekdis are the lungs of Pune and belong to all Punekars. So, no permission must be granted, even in retrospect to MIT for any construction activity of laying a 20 feet wide road from Paud going to the top of Vetal tekdi through the hill slope of survey no. 123, that too in hill top/hill slope zone. Blatant violation has been ignored since this tekdi figures on the draft list of 46 natural heritage sites identified as per state government notification dated 27/09/2000 was sent along with PMC commissioner’s covering letter dated 25/04/2002Development Control Rules 2017 for hill top hill slope zone (HTHS) lists categories that are not allowed for roads, gazebos, meditation centres, restaurants. It defines the importance of maintaining biodiversity to restore and protect hills in and around Pune Qaneez SukhraniThere are deep-rooted issues regarding saving hills As a regular tekdi-goer for the past 22 years, I know the number of times since 2005 up until now that I have begged people to support me for protecting the Vetal tekdi against destruction. As a citizen, I can say a few things. Ecological balance is something very, very deep. The reasons why there is such a rapid growth of builders and politicians grabbing the tekdi are not only just about greed, profitability and utter shamelessness. There are other deep-rooted problems associated with it, like daily transport, population control, modernisation in villages, and accountability of a higher power/a governing body, for so far, we have battled with political parties, officials, builders and the likes for the tekdi. An interesting aspect is that every single political party becomes one when it comes to destroying the tekdi. Of course everyone has a stake in that profit when it is so neatly rigged by builders. Despite the High Court orders, encroachments, destruction and illegal digging has systematically been taking place on the hills of Pune. Where is the accountability in all this!? How many times must ordinary citizens rise to protect the tekdi that they love, because these politicians multiply like cockroaches in taking bribes for profitability, and rely on public fatigue? Despite laws, politicians are clearly above them and there is absolutely no accountability here, when several crores are dangled in front of their filthy noses. In a very recent example, around 70 of us had fixed a meeting with a local corporator. It resulted in a screaming match with her, with the 70 of us yelling about protecting the tekdi, shoving forest laws down her throat which she and her husband clearly refused to even consider. We’d come to respect her over several years. Now, all that trust we had has vanished. Another example is the Bavdhan hills, where a builder built a 10+ storeyed apartment, which now can no longer be occupied because he got a stay order, since that building is illegal. But the forest land had already been destroyed for building it. Asira LeleResidents have to always fight to save hillsI am a regular tekdi-goer since I was in kindergarten. Vetal tekdi has always been a place close to my heart. Pune city has many hills, may it be Taljai, Waghjai, Parvati or Vetal hill, almost all of them have fallen prey of our unending greed for development. Vetal tekdi is not only the largest hill in the city, but it is the only hill having a natural water body, a grassland and forest. It is the most popular hill among youth and it is also famous among bird watchers and wildlife enthusiasts. It is really disheartening that, every time something happens to tekdi, all tekdi goers have to stand there carrying awareness drives and signature campaigns to protect the hill, while those having power and resources simply fail to understand the environmental importance of our hills. The incidence of a gaur sighting at foothills of Mahatma hill is really an eye-opener. We are not just disturbing the hills, we might be destroying the movement corridors used by wildlife, every time we build a road across some hill. Of Nobody is against development, but we all tekdi lovers fail to understand, “Why our path of development always passes through one of the very few green spaces left in the city?”Niteesh SaneAuthorities must take responsibility Vetal tekdi does not belong to MIT. They have no ownership rights on so called their side hence stop accepting their wrong claim. The forest department in Pune is completely silent despite their duty to stop any unlawful and destructive activity despite claims to the contrary by a third party. They are responsible to ensure that hills and forests are protected from harmful activity. Why are they silent and not taking any action against MIT? PMC corporators have revived plan to fleece us of our forests, forestlands, grasslands, hills, streams, aquifers held by them in their trust, which will be slow death of all fauna and flora.Nandinidevi Pant PratinidhiGive bird sanctuary status to hills The population and species diversity is great in hills as the area is ideal for vegetation. Avian frequency is great. Many bird sanctuaries in India have a small area. Likewise, Vetal hill complex has nearly 10 sqkm area, extending from Bavdhan to Vetal tekdi. Many ornithologists and naturalists have the actual species records along with proofs. Private land owners having plots on hills should be made aware about conserving greens and the forest department should appoint guards to ensure there is no encroachment on hill slopes.Arnav GandheCompiled by Prachi Bari||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-pune-residents-unite-to-protect-vetal-tekdi/story-5nzog1bIopVbhe16WerNhO.html
13-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC talks to disgruntled minister Rajib Banerjee, expels rebel Suvendu Adhikari’s aide||Concerned by rumblings among senior leaders prior to the crucial assembly polls, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership on Sunday held talks with disgruntled state forest minister Rajib Banerjee in a bid to bridge differences while expelling a close aide of heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari who resigned from the cabinet last month. The expelled leader, Kanishka Panda, was secretary of the TMC unit in East Midnapore district where the Adhikari family represents two Lok Sabha seats, an assembly seat and heads a civic body. TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor held an hour-long meeting with the forest minister at Chatterjee’s residence at Naktala in south Kolkata on Sunday afternoon. While Chatterjee remained tight-lipped, Banerjee claimed that the talks covered “political strategy.” Leaders close to the minister, however, said he raised issues such as corruption and nepotism by some leaders in Howrah district, where Banerjee represents the Domjur assembly seat while talking to Chatterjee and Kishor. “I attended the meeting as a party worker. We discussed strategy for the coming days. I cannot share anything more with the media. In a party, there can be disgruntled people and there can be people who are over-satisfied. These things are sorted through discussion. I will be available if I am called for more talks,” the forest minister said.Also read: Arvind Kejriwal says will fast in support of farmers tomorrowPosters in support of Banerjee and Adhikari are appearing across West Bengal, including Kolkata, since last month, stoking speculations that the two popular and comparatively younger leaders, may leave the TMC. Posters, with images of Banerjee and the words, “symbol of honesty,” written in Bengali, appeared in Howrah on Sunday as well. Tussle between Banerjee and senior leaders in Howrah over alleged nepotism and corruption first surfaced in public in July this year. “The rectification drive initiated by Mamata Banerjee will not succeed if action is taken against small fish and the big ones are allowed to go scot-free,” the minister said in July. Making things tough for the party, Mihir Goswami, the legislator from the Cooch Behar South constituency in north Bengal, recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while Shilbhadra Dutta, the lawmaker from Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, voiced his dissent and declared that he will not contest in 2021. “I do not know who are putting up these posters. I have nothing to do with it,” Rajib Banerjee said on Sunday and refused to be put in the same bracket with Adhikari. “Please do not link me with Adhikari. His contention is his personal issue and the same applies to me. Differences can be democratically discussed in the party,” said Banerjee. He insisted that contrary to common perception, he has not distanced himself from activities of the TMC or the government. Significantly, Adhikari’s father, Sisir Adhikari, is the eldest among the TMC’s Lok Sabha members. He is also president of the party’s East Midnapore district unit. Mamata Banerjee, while virtually addressing party leaders last week, asked him to expel all rebels immediately. After his expulsion was announced, Kanishka Panda spoke out against the TMC and said he felt relieved. “Mamata Banerjee will understand in the coming elections what price a party has to pay for ignoring a popular leader like Suvendu and listening to Kishor’s advice. I am facing the wrath for protesting against comments made against Suvendu,” said Panda. Akhil Giri, the legislator from Egra in East Midnapore and a known detractor of Suvendu Adhikari, said, “Panda should have been expelled long ago for anti-party activities.” Goswami and Dutta have already spoken in public against deploying I-Pac, Kishor’s company, and organizational decisions taken on its advice. Senior TMC leaders told HT last month that Adhikari was specifically unhappy with organizational decisions taken by Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor, who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Also, Adhikari, who was earlier appointed election observer for several districts, including Murshidabad, demanded that leaders of his choice be fielded next year from around 65 assembly seats. This was unacceptable to the leadership. Adhikari and Abhisek Banerjee even took potshots at each other without taking names at recent public meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-talks-to-disgruntled-minister-rajib-banerjee-expels-rebel-suvendu-adhikari-s-aide/story-b6yp7QSNIcvpodn8lTkjFJ.html

Rubal Agrawal, additional commissioner with PMC, said that till December 10, 955 bills were scrutinised in the past four months and amounts in 632 bills were reduced after scrutiny. “We have started bill audit to check if private hospitals are overcharging. There are many patients who approach us with complaints. We have also identified many hospitals who have overcharged patients during the Covid pandemic,” said Agrawal. She said that many hospitals have stopped overcharging once a complaint is filed against them. “We have observed that flouting hospitals start issuing inflated bills after a while. In such cases, we don’t take any concrete action. In such difficult times, we urge private hospitals to refrain from such practices. However, many big names in the city are repeatedly seen overcharging patients,” said Agarwal. PMC has started auditing inflated bills above Rs 1.5 lakh since August following complaints of overcharging from patients by private hospitals. The senior official said that private hospitals adhere to the price capping done by the state government through general resolution and notifications. “We have time and again reminded private hospitals to adhere to the price capping by the state government, but we do come across overcharging cases,” said Agrawal. Asked if PMC will take any concrete action, Agrawal said that the decision will be taken next week. “We have a few big hospitals in the city that are frequently named by patients for overcharging. We will soon take a decision on what action can be taken against them,” said Agrawal. PMC started auditing bills of Covid patients from August 14 to check overpricing. The civic body has formed a committee of auditors to verify bills from across private hospitals in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-audit-finds-66-bills-inflated-corrects-amount-of-632-covid-patients/story-oxy4EKuXe7cRyVk7VTv78J.html

We have carried out work at four spots and work at reaming spots will be taken up after we receive the remaining fund amount.”“We got Rs 3 crore from the forest department for the project. The twelve spots require rockfall protection works and laying iron net, which is being done to enhance road safety and protect the lives of the visitors,” he said.Located 30 kilometres from Pune, Sinhgad fort attracts thousands of tourists regularly and is a big draw during the monsoon and weekends.

As the ban has been lifted, I decided to hit the trail and it is an enjoyable experience. However, I request the tourists to follow social distancing norms and wear a face mask as it is in their interest.Aniruddha Pandit, a tourist who had come with his family, said, “The forest department is taking good steps and allowing a limited number of four-wheelers so that there is chaos at the peak of the fort.”“I have come here to enjoy the scenic beauty of the fort after a long time,” he said. Kailas Kulkarni, an avid trekker who works with a private firm said, “It was a refreshing and rejuvenating experience for us.”The forest department officials, meanwhile, said they will start taking action against violators soon.Deepak Pawar, range forest officer, said, “We will initiate action soon. The first three to four days are being utilised to spread awareness among masses. We will start taking action against those violating norms soon.”The revellers had arrived in two and four-wheelers early in the morning (on Saturday). The heavy traffic of four-wheelers forced the forest department to spot traffic some four kilometres before Sinhagad fort and upon clearance of congestion on the hilltop allowed the cars to proceed.However, the policemen meant to enforce discipline were completely missing from the site with the forest department and local villagers committee enforcing rules on its depleted strength of six persons and a few forest guards. The forest guards, however, provided necessary directions and assistance to the visitors with dedication and zeal.Balasaheb Jiwade, forest guard, said, “We are taking all necessary steps at the fort. The village volunteers are assisting the forest department in smooth conduct of release of tourist cars so that there is no overcrowding. We have received a good response from the citizens and they are co-operating with the norms of the state government.”Jiwade and four volunteers are manning the traffic at the entrance of Sinhagad fort.Pawar said that policemen are summoned only when there is a very heavy rush of tourists and if there is traffic jam in the ghat section.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tourists-defy-safety-norms-throng-sinhagad-fort-in-pune-on-weekend/story-cHeHCtsdEe1ZoFN9qGONIO.html

The tribunal was hearing pleas filed by Mundka village resident Satish Kumar and Tikri-Kalan native Mahavir Singh alleging pollution caused by burning of plastic, leather, rubber, motor engine oil and other waste materials and continuous operation of illegal industrial units dealing with such articles on agricultural lands in Mundka and Neelwal villages.The green panel noted that the matter relating to air pollution has been pending for more than seven years and it does not find it necessary to keep it so for an indefinite period.“ It is for the statutory authorities to continue further steps for enforcement of environmental norms as per law.“Accordingly, we close the proceedings with hope and expectation that the concerned authorities will take the necessary steps for maintaining environmental norms. There has to be continuous vigil against causing of pollution, particularly burning of plastic and other waste for the protection of environment and public health,” the tribunal said.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said the amount of compensation recovered from violators must be properly utilised for the legitimate purpose with the approval of the CPCB.“If there is any violation of environmental norms, the aggrieved party will be free to take remedies as per law, as and when necessary,” the bench said.The tribunal had earlier directed the Delhi chief secretary to co-ordinate with the municipal and police authorities and other officers to ensure compliance of its previous orders at the ground-level.  It had asked the chief secretary to hold a joint meeting with the persons considered responsible for compliance and till the orders remain un-complied, continue to hold such meetings at least once a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngt-directs-delhi-government-to-keep-vigil-against-burning-of-plastic/story-OwBXaQItCkkTmLUB71xoqK.html
13-12-2020||Bhopal||Gang selling ‘substandard’ plasma busted in MP, could be tip of the iceberg||Madhya Pradesh police on Saturday late night arrested four people for illegally supplying substandard plasma which claimed the life of a Covid-19 infected patient in Gwalior, said police. The arrested include Ajay Shankar Tyagi, an employee of a private pathology lab along with Jagdish Bhadkariya, Mahesh Maurya and Hemant, all three employed with different private hospitals in Gwalior. The accused were arrested under section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “A Covid-19 infected patient Manoj Gupta, resident of Datia died three days ago. He was administered plasma in a private hospital before his death. The family blamed the plasma for Manoj’s death since the short post-mortem report said Gupta’s blood was infected due to administration of substandard plasma, which was not packed as per standard norms, affecting its quality,” Gwalior superintendent of police, Amit Sanghi said. The police officer added that an organised gang was involved in supplying plasma for Covid patients. “In the investigation, police found that an organised gang was involved in fraudulently supplying plasma in the name of Jaya Arogya Government Hospital (JAH),” said the SP. Explaining their modus operandi, the police officer said employees of a couple of private hospitals in Gwalior had formed a network with a private pathology lab employee and targeted stressed family members of patients requiring plasma for a hefty price.“The gang also targeted Gupta’s family in an orchestrated manner. When doctors asked Gupta’s kin to arrange plasma, one of the hospital employees, Jagdish Bhadkariy, offered to help and shared the mobile number of a middle man named Mahesh Maurya, who was also employed with another private hospital. Maurya then introduced them to one Ajay Shankar Tyagi. Tyagi claimed to be employed with the pathology lab at JAH.

13-12-2020||Kolkata||3 held in Bengal for BJP worker’s murder; internal feud, claims TMC||Three men were arrested in the Halishahar area of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district on Sunday morning in connection with the murder of a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker on Saturday, police said. The deceased, Saikat Bhawal, was president of the BJP’s local polling booth-level committee. He and three other BJP workers were attacked by about a dozen motorcycle-borne men around 5 pm on Saturday. The BJP workers were visiting voters for party’s outreach programme when the attack took place in the Barendragali area of Halishahar. Bhawal was allegedly beaten up with the wooden handle of a shovel. He and three others were rushed to the J N Memorial Hospital at Kalyani in adjoining Nadia district. Bhawal died at the hospital. The FIR was registered at Bijpur police station. “Four people were named in the police complaint. Three of them were arrested in the morning and charged with murder, attempt to murder, assault and criminal conspiracy. They will be produced before the Barrackpore court in the afternoon,” an officer of the Bijpur police station said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to brief the media. Also Read: There will be ‘Hindu raj’ in Bengal, says BJP MP Pragya Thakur, calls Mamata Banerjee ‘frustrated’“The three arrested men faced criminal charges in the past,” the officer added. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of targeting his party’s leaders and workers and carrying out well-planned attacks. “This has become the TMC’s policy in the run-up to the Assembly polls,” Ghosh said. Partha Bhowmik, TMC legislator from Naihati, said his party was not at all involved in the attack. “The violence was the outcome of an internal feud between two local groups. This has no link with politics. The police are taking action,” said Bhowmik. Although the agitation started peacefully, the BJP workers got into a scuffling with policemen around noon. They broke through barricades and surrounded the Bijpur police station compound. “This agitation is to demand for a neutral investigation. What you are witnessing is the anger of BJP workers,” said Subhrangshu Roy, the local BJP legislator and son of national vice-president Mukul Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/3-held-in-bengal-for-bjp-worker-s-murder-internal-feud-claims-tmc/story-1xFcjDdmGi9F3mmapWi7ZI.html

13-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC workers attack BSF jawan in Bengal, call him ‘insane’||Workers of the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district allegedly beat up a BSF jawan on Friday evening and branded him insane. The victim’s family lodged a police complaint; however, no one has been arrested till the reports came in last. The victim has been identified as Biswajit Sahani, 32. He was posted with the 169 battalion at Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir and had returned home before the lockdown for treatment. Sahani was returning home riding his motorcycle on Friday, when he tried to overtake a TMC rally which was in the way, leading to an altercation between him and some TMC workers. The situation soon took a violent turn and he was beaten up with wooden clubs and his two-wheeler was damaged. Later, some locals rescued him and rushed him to the hospital. “My brother had returned home this February for some treatment from Jammu and Kashmir. On Friday afternoon, my brother went to Kandi for some work. When he was returning home TMC-men thrashed him,” said Rajesh Sahani, the victim’s elder brother. Locals said that the TMC rally was being led by Apurba Sarkar, the TMC’s president of Kandi block. Sarkar accused the victim of being ‘insane’ and claimed that the party had arranged for his treatment.“The BSF jawan is insane. He entered our rally intentionally and triggered the trouble. It was an unfortunate incident. The jawan’s family is our supporter. We are arranging for his treatment,” said Apurba Sarkar, TMC spokesperson of Murshidabad district.

They have no respect for the soldiers who are protecting our country,” said Murshidabad (North) BJP president Gourishankar Ghosh.The jawan’s family, too, has hit out at the TMC for calling him insane. “My brother and I are both serving the nation as BSF jawans. But after the brutal attack, no one from the police came to record his statement even though we have lodged a written complaint with Kandi police station,” Sahani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-workers-attack-bsf-jawan-in-bengal-call-him-insane/story-4LTwSgxiZaXMGEiABomnwO.html

13-12-2020||Delhi||At 361, AQI in Delhi remains in very poor category||With Saturday’s rainfall increasing moisture in Delhi’s air, pollution levels were pushed deeper into the “very poor” zone on Sunday morning. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 361 at 7am on Sunday, which is categorised as “very poor”. On Saturday, the AQI was recorded 356, also in the “very poor” zone. This was a deterioration from Friday’s 295, which is categorised as “poor” in the AQI scale. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that as an aftermath of Saturday’s western disturbance, high moisture availability with higher air holding capacity and dense fog formation are expected over Delhi, mainly during early morning hours. “This can trigger heterogeneous aqueous reactions to form secondary aerosols (pollution particles converting into secondary aerosols with the help of water content in the air), which can lead to deterioration of AQI. AQI is likely to deteriorate to the higher end of very poor by Sunday evening. It is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ zone on December 14 and December 15,” the Safar forecast read. India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said that dense fog was also likely early Sunday, which could reduce visibility levels drastically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-361-aqi-in-delhi-remains-in-very-poor-category/story-0ZbEq5GNkVN19bIcZBctmN.html

In a letter to VP Singh Badnore, Jain has sought a concrete decision on amending the MC Act on various issues including electing the mayor directly by all electors of Chandigarh, as in Haryana and other parts of the country. Jain has recommended giving powers of writing annual confidential reports (ACRs) of MC employees to the mayor; making provision of anti-defection law applicable to the members of the MC; election of the mayor by secret ballot or open voting etc.Jain said that the term of the mayor needs to be increased to either two and a half years or five years. “Various states including Haryana have adopted the pattern of direct election of the mayor for five years, which needs to be considered in Chandigarh, also. Similarly, there is a need to divide the duties and powers between the administration and the MC.”Jain said that it will be better if the administrator constituted a committee of 10-15 people, including officials and public representatives, who may objectively consider all suggestions for amending various provisions of the MC Act, which can then be forwarded to the central government.Jain said that a few years ago, the UT administration had prepared a draft suggesting various amendments in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Act, which had got lost somewhere in files later on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/review-25-years-of-chandigarh-mc-former-mp-writes-to-badnore/story-5vHGtkugWQVciFtrAogMfK.html

Chlorhexidine gluconate is widely used in germicidal mouthwash. Besides, the study has also found povidone-iodine to be effective in inactivating the virus.The chlorhexidine gluconate mouth rinse in 0.2% concentration has been found to be most effective, inactivating more than 99% of the virus.The research, conducted by professors Ashish Jain and Vishakha Grover of PU’s dental institute in collaboration with Krishan Gopal Thakur of IMTECH and others, has been submitted to a major scientific journal for publishing.‘Results need to be verified with clinical studies’Professor Ashish Jain said, “Our work suggests that chlorhexidine 0.2% which amounts to the most widely-used mouthwash can be an effective regiment in the war against Covid-19. However, these are initial results from lab studies and need to be verified via clinical studies; commercial samples available in the market that contain other additives need to be tested against this claim.”The study has found that 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, at merely 30 seconds of contact time, achieves immediate inactivation of the virus. At 0.12% concentration, the component was also found to be effective, but its effectiveness was marginally lesser. Povidone-iodine has been found more than 99.9% effective at 60 seconds contact time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/component-in-mouthwash-effective-against-covid-panjab-university-imtech-study/story-tlHL5NC60pzUH1g673cgrN.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ ongoing agitation hits BJP’s prospects of spreading its tentacles in Punjab||The prospects of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to spread its base in Punjab have taken a hit in the wake of the farmers’ ongoing agitation as many of its leaders, including Sikh faces, have resigned against the Centre’s agriculture laws. Thousands of farmers from the state are camped at the entry points to the national capital for over a fortnight, taking the anti-BJP sentiment to a new high. The passage of bills by the Narendra Modi-led government led to widespread protests by Punjab farmers, which now are spreading to other parts of the country. It triggered a sharp reaction among the Sikhs in the saffron party, particularly at a time when the political stocks of the panthic party—Shiromani Akali Dal—were dwindling. Earlier, the BJP was being dubbed by some as a viable political alternative in Punjab’s political landscape. It was flexing its muscles in the state to win the 2022 assembly polls on its own. The things, however, seem to have changed as the party is receiving a stiff opposition in the rural belt. To make the matters worse, the activists of farmer organisations are gheraoing the BJP leaders, restricting their movement. Nearly two dozen Sikhs holding key positions in the party’s state and district bodies have resigned. Not only Sikhs, others leaders have also quit, with some shifting their loyalties to other parties. “The new laws are against the agrarian community. I had been opposing since the ordinances were passed in June month, but no one listened. So I was left with no choice but to quit,” said Malwinder Singh Kang who resigned as general secretary of the BJP’s state body. Party’s kisan morcha in-charge in Moga Tarlochan Singh, Yuva Morcha state general secretary Barinder Singh Sandhu, former district president (Amritsar) RP Singh Maini, former Gau Sewa commission chairman Kimati Bhagat, who also was former general secretary of party’s SC Morcha and Ajay Kumar, president of the party’s youth wing of in Fatehgarh Sahib, also resigned after the protests began. “No one listened to our concerns, so I resigned,” said Bhagat, who joined SAD. A number of councillors from civic bodies in Gurdaspur, Abohar and Bathinda have also quit the party in the recent days, severely impacting the BJP’s plans to strengthen its base. Many leaders from the district units in Sangrur, Bathinda, Moga, Fatehgarh Sahib and Ferozepur have also put in their papers. Harjeet Singh Grewal, who is associated with the BJP for many years, differed, saying there was no adverse impact on the party’s popularity. “A large number of Sikhs are still associated with the party,” he claimed. BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said more people are joining the party in Punjab. “Our party has acceded to the demands of farmers and is ready to listen to their concerns.

He said the party had decided to contest the polls to serve residents. “For the last five-six years, the citizens of Ambala have been devoid of jobs, cleanliness and better roads. I can assure my voters that we will do more work than we did earlier,” Sharma said.Sharma’s wife Shakti Rani Sharma is expected to be the mayoral candidate for the party. However, Sharma has deferred the announcement for now. Sharma was in touch with another stalwart of the region, Nirmal Singh, for an alliance with the Haryana Democratic Front (HDF). This was confirmed by HDF’s general secretary Chitra Sarwara who had said that “his conditions didn’t suit us and we’ve to move on”. However, Sharma denied any talks and called the meeting(s) personal.Sharma’s son Siddharth Vashishth, alias Manu Sharma, a convict in the infamous Jessica Lal murder case of 1999 who was serving a life sentence, walked out of Delhi’s Tihar Jail in June after he was granted an early release.HDF’s mayor candidate files papersAmisha Chawla, the mayoral candidate for HDF, filed her nomination papers to the CEO of zila parishad, Anurag Dhaliya, at the ADC office on the second day of the process.

SGPC honorary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said, “The Pakistani authorities and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) have issued statements in the media that their government had offered 10,000 visas to the Indian devotees for participation in the centenary event. Though we have not received any letter in this regard from them yet, we will seek permission for sending 5,000 pilgrims.” “Planning and preparations for marking the centenary on a large scale are underway. We will make arrangements for the centenary like we did while celebrating the 550th Parkash Gurpurb of Guru Nanak,” PSGPC president Satwant Singh said on phone. Even as the SGPC has not started the process for the same yet, it has already invited the applications from the devotees for the annual jatha to be sent to the neighbouring country to attend the celebrations of the foundation of the order of Khalsa, also called Baisakhi festival, in April next year. This festival is celebrated at Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal in Pakistan. The massacre of 260 Sikhs took place on February 20, 1921, at Gurdwara Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib which at the time was in British India by a mahant and his mercenaries. As per the Nehru-Liaquat Pact, a bilateral agreement signed on April 8, 1950 to guarantee the rights of minorities in both countries after the Partition of India, nearly 3000 Sikh pilgrims are allowed to visit the Sikh shrines in Pakistan on four religious occasions in a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centenary-of-saka-nankana-sahib-sgpc-to-seek-centre-s-nod-for-sending-5-000-member-sikh-jatha-to-pakistan/story-h1kyIpifOxM44ABwv4HfSL.html
13-12-2020||Kolkata||TMC, BJP lock horns as MHA calls 3 IPS officers back on deputation||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre of waging political vendetta, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal on Saturday hit out at a move by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to call three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers back on central deputation.The allegation is part of a new verbal war between the Centre and the state government sparked by an attack on BJP president JP Nadda’s convoy by stone-throwing TMC activists when he was on a visit on Thursday to Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. “The Centre is indirectly trying to impose emergency and is keeping IAS {Indian Administrative Service} and IPS officers under coercion. The three IPS officers were on duty that day, and yesterday (December 11) they received letters from the MHA. The vindictive attitude is clear,” said Kalyan Banerjee, senior advocate and chief whip of the TMC in the Lok Sabha. The home ministry on Saturday called the three IPS officers responsible for Nadda’s security back on central deputation from West Bengal. “The convoy of a person enjoying Z-category security has a pilot car and a tail car. If any other vehicle wants to enter that convoy, the local police needs to be informed and permission needs to be taken. Here no permission was taken,” said Kalyan Banerjee. Leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit hit back at Kalyan Banerjee. “Who is Banerjee? Is he someone from the state government? No. Is he someone from the Centre? No. He is a MP of the state’s ruling party. What is he trying to prove? Is it so that the chief minister has no answer and that why she is asking her MP, who is not related to the matter, to respond,” BJP leader Jay Prakash Majumdar said. The Centre had on Friday asked chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and director general of police Virendra to appear before it on December 14. This drew a strong reaction from the TMC, which argued that law and order was a state subject and outside the Centre’s remit.“Under no law can the Centre summon the officers. The executive powers of the Union government can only be exercised only in cases under the Union list and concurrent list. Law and order is in the state list of the seventh schedule. The executive power can’t be exercised here,” Kalyan Banerjee added. The TMC MP has sent a letter to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla protesting the MHA’s letter, which asked the state chief secretary to release three IPS officers for central deputation. He alleged that it was an instance of political vendetta, saying that the Union home secretary wanted to meet the state’s chief secretary and director general of police on the instructions of Union home minister Amit Shah. “It is shameful and dangerous that all laws have been thrown out in the river by your action at the instance of Amit Shah, BJP leader and home minister of India. Your every path suffers from mala fide exercise of power,” Kalyan Banerjee wrote in the letter sent to Ajay Bhalla, the Union home secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-bjp-lock-horns-as-mha-calls-3-ips-officers-back-on-deputation/story-4Rl6IMoQ72mXCR0c6eVzhJ.html

Failing these steps, the landlords or agents can be booked for ‘hiding tenants’ information’, said Date.“Criminal activities are rampant in the twin cities of Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayander, and so MBVV has applied Section 144 (which prohibits the gathering of four or more people in an area) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc), 1973, and made tenement verification process compulsory. Earlier, a minor online process was conducted for the verification when the cities were under the Thane rural police. But now the process has been tightened. We will also the landlords, property owners and estate agents under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) if they breach the law,” said senior police inspector Sanjay Hazare from Kashimira police station. He said the police have directed landlords and estate agents to provide all the details of the tenants in the prescribed format via emails and registered post to the respective police station within three days after the contracts are signed. “This method will also help MBVV to track suspects and control crime, as well as to identify their hideouts in case of lack of photographs, documents and other evidences,” said Hazare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fir-against-landlords-if-they-fail-to-ensure-verification-of-tenants-mira-bhayander-vasai-virar-commissionerate/story-onyNOsNZF5e4AEvGqISYhL.html
13-12-2020||Lucknow||UP, Centre move top court against Kafeel’s release||The Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government have appealed in the Supreme Court against quashing of Dr Kafeel Khan’s detention order under the National Security Act (NSA). Khan, a paediatrician whose brush with controversy began with the 2017 Gorakhpur hospital tragedy in which more than a hundred children died reportedly due to shortage of oxygen and he was suspended, was booked under the NSA last year over an allegedly inflammatory speech against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). After severely indicting the state government for booking Khan under the NSA, the Allahabad high court had in September quashed the detention order and allowed the habeas corpus petition filed by his mother, Nuzhat Parween. Khan was released after spending seven months in jail. Challenging this order by the high court, the central government and the Uttar Pradesh government have jointly filed an appeal, maintaining that Khan flouted prohibitory orders and delivered a provocative speech to AMU students with an attempt to disturb law and order in Aligarh by inciting Muslim students against other communities. The petition added that Khan’s speech, on December 13, 2019, incited about 10,000 AMU students to march towards Aligarh city. “Had the violent students not been talked to stopped, this crowd would have disturbed the public order and the communal harmony of the district by entering Aligarh city,” it said. The plea further stated that Khan has a history of committing various offences, which had led to disciplinary action, his suspension from service, registration of FIRs against him and the invocation of the NSA. The petition said it was not open to the high court to examine the detention order on merits since it was based on subjective satisfaction of the district magistrate, Aligarh, who had sufficient reasons to pass the detention order. The appeal is likely to be heard on December 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-centre-move-top-court-against-kafeel-s-release/story-64NOGd3ew75q4BupaHzC5H.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps TISS for irregularities in admission to masters course||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday came down on Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) for irregularities in admissions to Master in Arts (MA) in Applied Psychology course. “You (TISS) have committed fraud against the entire society,” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni. “You have admitted somebody against seats for OBC category, but the candidate does not belong to OBC category,” the bench added. The judges were irked to note that admissions were given to some open category candidates on vacant OBC category seats for the course and then admission of some of those candidates were cancelled while some were asked to join the course at the institute’s Chennai campus.“There is something very fishy about this,” the bench commented after additional solicitor general Anil Singh pointed out some errors in the first round of admissions to the course. He also pointed out that the number of seats was increased by 13 in order to fulfil the commitment to the students already admitted.“Whose commitment is this,” the judges asked Singh and questioned as to why the admissions were not cancelled after the so-called errors were detected. “We don’t know... Perhaps that was done deliberately,” the bench added.The court was hearing a petition filed by Pune resident Anshruta Deepkumar who wants to pursue the course and had therefore appeared for TISS common entrance test. She has moved HC through advocate Akash Menon questioning the admission process.Deepkumar has filed an application seeking direction to TISS to carry out admission process afresh and forthwith admit her for the course. In the application, she claimed that she had secured a rank that was above the cut-off marks set by the institute for admission to the course at both Mumbai and Chennai campuses, and therefore, she was entitled to be admitted, especially after the seats were increased by 13.She added that she was denied admission as the institute limited intake of open category candidates without giving rhyme or reason.TISS has, however, maintained that the petitioner was 12th on the waiting list and that all open category seats at both the campuses were completely filled. The institute also claimed that the studies for the said course started way back in August 19, and the first semester course is almost over.“It is difficult to make up the lost time for anyone who joins at this stage,” TISS said in an affidavit filed in response to the petition. “Further, anyone joining now would also fall short on the attendance norms,” it added.The HC has now posted the petition for further hearing on Monday with a direction to TISS to inform the court how the Institute proposes to fill some vacant seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-tiss-for-irregularities-in-admission-to-masters-course/story-s5Y2Zvpjzzsechp7g3r9JP.html

13-12-2020||City||Leaders must be firm on ideology: NCP chief Sharad Pawar during 80th birthday celebrations in Mumbai||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar turned 80 on Saturday. The party celebrated the birthday of the veteran leader by holding several virtual rallies and a slew of events, including blood donation camps and job fairs.A celebration was organised at YB Chavan Centre in Nariman Point with a limited number of guests. The event was attended by Pawar, along with his family and friends. Speaking on the occasion, the veteran leader said political workers should never compromise on ideology. He also spoke about creating a next generation of political workers who will help in strengthening the country’s future. “It is important for political workers to be firm on their ideology. The progressive ideology of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar needs to be passed on to the next generation of political workers for them to follow the paths of these leaders,” he said while expressing his gratitude for the support he has got during his public life.The former chief minister (CM) also remembered his mother Shardabai Pawar on the occasion. “She taught us not to neglect the responsibilities of family while doing social and political work,” said Pawar. “When you start working for the last person in the society, you get to learn a lot. It also gives clarity about the path you want to follow,” he advised the gathering. Many senior NCP leaders such as Chhagan Bhujbal, Dhananjay Munde and Eknath Khadse attended the gathering live virtually. Bollywood actor and Shiv Sena leader Urmila Matondkar also reached YB Chavan Centre to wish the NCP chief. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Uddhav Thackeray also extended their wishes to the veteran leader. State NCP chief and water resources minister Jayant Patil said around 2 lakh people attended 400 to 500 virtual rallies across 36 districts. “Some people had said that Pawar’s political era is over. Let me ask them to leave their car and bodyguards provided by the government and visit any district. They will come to know the truth,” Patil dared former CM Devendra Fadnavis, without taking his name. To commemorate Pawar’s birthday, the state launched a digital platform — www.mahasharad.in — where people with disabilities can register for hearing aids, battery-operated wheelchairs, prosthesis, Braille kits etc. Earlier this week, a rural development scheme named Sharad Pawar Gram Samruddhi Yojana was launched to commemorate the most senior political leader of the state. The scheme will be implemented under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNRES). Pawar is seen as the force holding together the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, comprising his own party, the Shiv Sena and Congress. Forming the three-party coalition government in the state to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) away from power was his brainchild. Both, the NCP and the Congress, were facing mass exodus last year and the coalition was seen as a survival strategy. Pawar has been a big factor in Maharashtra’s politics and a key leader in national politics for five decades now. He has been a three-term CM of Maharashtra and has also handled the defence and agriculture ministries at the Centre. Currently, he is a Rajya Sabha parliamentarian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leaders-must-be-firm-on-ideology-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-during-80th-birthday-celebrations-in-mumbai/story-IBFyte9GRkInsesS895kPL.html

After remaining closed for nearly five months amid the lockdown, hotels and restaurants were allowed to open in September albeit with certain restrictions. The restrictions were further relaxed in October but reimposed in December after a resurgence in cases. Association president Amarvir Singh said, “The night curfew and orders capping the number of guests should be scrapped immediately.” The state government had recently fixed the ceiling for guests at 100 for indoor guests and 250 for outdoor gatherings: “Extremely harsh measures are being taken against the hospitality industry in Punjab as compared to Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh. The hotel industry has suffered a major losses. At present, we are only getting 30% business as compared to last year,” said Amarvir.‘Guest limit should be increased to 500’ He suggested upping the guest limit to 500. “With the Punjab government restricting timings, residents are already planning New Year celebrations in other states. Advance bookings have already been made in hotels and restaurants of Chandigarh, Delhi and Haryana,” said Amarvir.“The government is taking selective measures to control the Covid pandemic. If 500 people can work in a factory unit, why are there restrictions on an assembly of over 100 people in a hotel?” he asked.Hotel and Restaurant Association of Punjab general secretary Davinder Singh Nanda asked why different rules pertaining to Covid were being applied in different states. “Covid is at its peak in Delhi and Haryana. However, the respective governments have not taken such stringent measures,” he contended. “Does the virus only spread after 10 o’ clock and not during political parties’ public rallies?” asked Nanda The association’s chief advisor Amarjeet Singh said such incidents have a detrimental effect on the state’s economy and will lead to unemployment and loss of revenue. Virus claims 4 patients, 57 more test positiveFour people, including a 38-year-old man, succumbed to the coronavirus disease and 57 more people tested positive, taking the district’s tally to 23,853 and death toll to 932. The number of active cases in the district stand at 700.

13-12-2020||Mumbai||Petition in Bombay HC questions earmarking of open category seats by meritorious reserved category students||The process of earmarking seats in the open quota for meritorious students from reserved categories has been questioned time and again and this year, a Nanded-based lawyer has once again filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court (HC) against it.The public interest litigation (PIL) was filed at the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC on Friday. Filed for ‘Save Merit, Save Nation’, an organisation working against reservation, the petition explains the need to rethink the earmarking process in professional admissions at government as well as private aided and unaided institutes. According to this rule, a student from the reserved category can opt for a seat in the open category on the basis of merit. However, his seat in reserved category still remains under the same category, leaving fewer seats for students in the open category. “The earmarking process breaches the constitutional ceiling of 50% reservation in seats as per the reservation policy of India, by occasioning undue benefits to the candidates belonging to reserved categories while entailing unwarranted loss to the candidates belonging to open category,” states the petition. Several parents and students from the open category across the state are in support of this petition. “This happens every year and until recently, students from the open category didn’t question the rule. But for the past two years, the government has introduced new reservation quotas in the form of economically weaker sections (EWS) as well as socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) which has eaten into open category seats. And the earmarking system still persists, leaving open category students with very few seats,” said Pankaj Sharma, father of an MBBS aspirant. He added that seats in the open category pool has been shrinking for past few years, forcing more and more open category students to opt for seats in neighbouring states as well as deemed institutes due to lack of choice.At present, admissions to undergraduate medical and dental seats are ongoing with the second seat allotment list scheduled to be released on Sunday. Registration for admissions to engineering, law and architecture courses are currently underway on Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/petition-in-bombay-hc-questions-earmarking-of-open-category-seats-by-meritorious-reserved-category-students/story-99t4mA695VaE5fo46ENiPO.html

However, it is still unclear whether it will be free or not.The vaccination drive is going to be conducted in a systematic manner with people having to register online and they will be asked to be present at a vaccination camp on a specific date and time, the officials revealed.In the first phase, the state will be administering shots to health workers, second phase will be for frontline workers and in the third phase, citizens above the age of 50 and having comorbidities will be given vaccine shots. The state has already started registration of health workers, said a senior state health official.“Following directives of the Central government, we have started preparations to start a vaccination drive, assuming it will be available from January. The drive will be conducted at district hospitals, rural hospitals and primary health centres. A team of four to five people will conduct the drive and their training programme has also started,” he said.“Each person will have to register to get a vaccine shot at a designated website. He or she will get a text message and be asked to come at a specific date and time, along with their identity card. The people available at the camp will check their registration and identity; the vaccinator will give the shot and the person will be kept under observation for at least half an hour. If there is no complication, then the person will be allowed to go if not then further treatment will be given,” the senior official said.“We still have no idea whether the vaccination will be free for all or people will have to pay against each shot. The decision has to be taken by the Centre,” he added.He further said that the state health staff has already completed a vaccination drive for measles-rubella only two years ago in 2018, hence they are hoping that there won’t be any hassle as the staff has experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-prepares-to-vaccinate-3-25-crore-people-in-six-months/story-eyZEFgbH9i8F8dj6nyTbOO.html

13-12-2020||Mumbai||Appoint Class IV employees on contractual basis: Maharashtra Edu dept to schools||The Maharashtra education department has asked schools in the state to make all the upcoming appointments of Class IV employees on contractual basis. In a circular issued on Friday, the department stated that once the current staffers on these posts retire, new appointments should be made by the school on contractual basis. Employees under Class IV include peons, cleaning staff, security guards, laboratory attendants etc. While appointments to these posts were conducted by the government so far, henceforth schools will have to complete them at their level. The appointed staff will only be contractual employees of the school instead of being permanent staff of the government. The government shall give a fixed allowance to schools for every vacant post depending on the school’s location and the cost structure drawn out by the government. For cities such as Mumbai and Pune, the allowance will be ₹10,000 per month for each post whereas for schools in other corporations, it would be ₹7,500 per month. For schools in the rural areas, a monthly allowance of ₹5,000 has been set. Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals Association, said the government’s decision was shocking and unacceptable. “The allowance given by the government will be really less (than required) and we are worried that schools will not get good people to work with no job security and such little money. We urge the government to rethink its decision,” he added. Schools said that the government’s recent guideline allowing only two peons per 500 students was also unjust. “Schools are already short-staffed as teachers and non-teaching staff are not recruited despite vacancies. And to add to this, the government has now curtailed appointments in Class IV jobs,” said the principal of a school in the western suburbs. Officials from the education department did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/appoint-class-iv-employees-on-contractual-basis-maharashtra-edu-dept-to-schools/story-fONmXj1JBMsFifUMidiDEJ.html

He has worked with a lot of people and is widely experienced. I would be happy if he gets the position of UPA chief,” Shinde told news channel TV9 Marathi.Shinde also said that the NCP chief’s memory is “incredible”. “He can remember people by their names after meeting them once. He is easily accessible and the only leader after Yashwantrao Chavan (former Maharashtra chief minister) who has cordial relations with everyone across parties,” Shinde said. Meanwhile, senior NCP leader Praful Patel said his party wishes to see Pawar lead the country as the Prime Minister. “Though he [Pawar] is not in the position where he wants to see himself now, it can happen. The entire state needs to support him. If (West Bengal CM) Mamata Bannerjee can get 36 MPs (Members of Parliament) and (Andhra Pradesh CM) Jagan Reddy has 25 MPs, then Pawar can also get 44 MPs from the state, and the day is not far away when he [Pawar] will be in the position where we want to see him. I am sure he would be leading the country when we will be celebrating his 85th birthday,” Patel said at the veteran leader’s 80th birthday celebrations at YB Chavan Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-be-happy-to-see-pawar-as-upa-chief-says-former-union-home-minister-sushil-kumar-shinde/story-IT24OOBqK9jrgbtCrjI3YK.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Mandale depot works for Mumbai Metro-2B awarded at 14% higher cost||After ousting two contractors over delayed works, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has awarded the Mandale depot works for Metro-2B to a new contractor at ₹530.32 crore, which is 14% higher than the estimated cost of ₹464.75 crores.The Mandale depot work for Metro-2B (DN Nagar-Mandale) was earlier awarded to a firm at ₹390.43 crore in January 2018. However, according to MMRDA, even 24 months of after awarding the work, only 7% of the overall work was completed. According to the minutes of the meeting of the recently-held executive committee meeting of MMRDA, “The duration of completing the works was around 42 months from the date of awarding the contract.”Earlier in January this year, MMRDA terminated the contract, following which new bids were invited. MMRDA had also terminated the contract of another firm for delaying the works along Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E). HT had earlier reported that MMRDA had awarded the pending works along Metro-7 at a higher cost than estimated. While the authority received bids from six contractors for Mandale depot, three were finalised, of which the lowest was quoted by Ahluwalia Contracts Pvt Ltd. Among the various reasons for quoting higher than the estimated costs, the bidder had also stated that owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, there is an increase in cost of labour too.While Metro-7 is expected to be made operational by May 2021, MMRDA is looking at operationalising Metro-2B by 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mandale-depot-works-for-mumbai-metro-2b-awarded-at-14-higher-cost/story-V7UNz7jXWh6LnpVB75DebK.html
13-12-2020||Mumbai||Detractors in Congress denied Sharad Pawar PM post twice: Praful Patel||On two occasions, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had the opportunity to become prime minister, but was denied by his detractors in Congress, said NCP leader Praful Patel in an article written on the occasion of Pawar’s 80th birthday. The article was published by Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, on Saturday.“After Rajiv Gandhi’s unfortunate death during the Lok Sabha elections of 1991, the Congress party was in a state of shock. There was a demand to make Pawar party president to handle the situation, but some drawing room politicians conspired to block this. They did not want a strong leadership for the party and made PV Narasimha Rao the Congress president,” Patel wrote in the article.“After the results of Lok Sabha elections, Congress was close to forming a majority [in Parliament] and again there was a demand to choose Pawar as prime minister. However, the same people [as before] misused Sonia Gandhi’s name to make Rao the Prime Minister,” he further wrote.“There has been a conspiracy against Pawar since 1989 when he was chief minister of Maharashtra. I have witnessed how conspiracies were hatched against him in Delhi. I have seen how he lost the prime ministership when he was within striking distance of it,” Patel wrote in the article, adding that Rao was prejudiced against Pawar. Patel also wrote about the 1996 Lok Sabha elections in the article. “Congress won 145 seats. HD Deve Gowda, Mulayam Singh Yadav and leaders of the Left had shown willingness to be part of the government if Pawar replaced Rao as Congress nominee for prime minister. Rao was not willing and so Congress had to extend outside support to Deve Gowda,” Patel has claimed.Later in 1997, after Congress president Sitaram Kesari withdrew support of Deve Gowda government, Patel says 125 Congress MPs had gathered at Pawar’s residence in a show of support. However, Pawar chose to prevent a split in Congress. “It was the second time that he lost an opportunity to get the prime ministership,” Patel has written. In the article, Patel has also written that Pawar was continuously targeted by his detractors in Congress, which led to Pawar floating NCP. At the time of going to press, Congress had not issued any official response to Patel’s allegations.On condition of anonymity, a senior Congress leader and former Union minister said, “In 1991, the party’s top brass wanted a nominee who had experience of handling Central government portfolios. Rao and Arjun Singh were the frontrunners. As such Rao was chosen. Pawar had returned to the Congress just a few years ago so the top brass was not comfortable with him. They also considered the fact that the majority of newly-elected MPs of the party were from the south.” On the decisions taken after the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leader said, “Congress had lost the election and the third front parties had more MPs than us. So the party decided to respect the mandate and support Deve Gowda.”Significantly, in an article published in Marathi daily Loksatta on Saturday, veteran Congress leader Ulhas Pawar said that Pawar could have reached the highest positions in Congress and at the Centre had he remained with the party. He has also appealed Pawar to return to Congress’s fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/detractors-in-congress-denied-sharad-pawar-pm-post-twice-praful-patel/story-IV1p9Njp1Z7Gp2iynA1yvM.html
13-12-2020||Noida||Noida: 24-year-old arrested for hiring scribe for CAPF exam||Greater Noida: The Ecotech 3 police have arrested a man for allegedly hiring an impersonator to give the entrance exam for the sub-inspector post of the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) in his stead. The suspect was identified as Ajay Kumar, 24, a resident of Rohtak in Haryana. Police said that a solver (hired scribe) had allegedly appeared in the written examination on his behalf in November 2019 in Delhi. However, Ajay had appeared in the physical examination on December 7, 2020 in Greater Noida, when he was arrested. Raj Kamal, assistant commandant, CISF Battalion Sutiyana, had filed a complaint in the matter at the Ecotech III police station on December 7. He had alleged that the government had organised a physical exam for the recruitment for candidates who had cleared written exams. “On December 7, a candidate had appeared in the physical test whose photo and biometric fingerprint did not match with the person who had appeared in the written test with the same roll number,” he alleged in the FIR. Bhuvnesh Kumar, SHO, Ecotech III police station, said that a team reached the spot after getting information and detained Ajay. “During interrogation the suspect admitted that a solver had appeared in the written examination in Delhi on his behalf. When his name was cleared in the written exam, he came to Greater Noida to appear in the physical test,” the SHO said. Police said that the suspect had allegedly met a gang which runs a recruitment racket in Delhi, which had promised him recruitment by sending a solver. The SHO said that the gang had used a mobile app to allegedly merge the photo of the candidate and the solver to generate a doctored photo, which resembled both. “Interestingly, the gang had also prepared a thin fingerprint membrane of the solver, used in the written exam, and gave it to the candidate to put in on his finger for the physical test. However, this membrane was not read by the fingerprint scanner in Greater Noida and the suspect was arrested,” he said. Police said that based on the complaint a case has been registered against the suspect under sections 417 (cheating), 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. We are investigating the matter to arrest more people involved in the recruitment racket,” the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-24-year-old-arrested-for-hiring-scribe-for-capf-exam/story-4vNMOIXAkuI7AfkawUboCP.html
13-12-2020||Noida||Noida receives light rain; mercury set to drop from Sunday||The city and its adjoining regions saw a light rain on Saturday morning, leading to drop in temperature with the meteorological department expecting the mercury to fall further from Sunday onwards. The weather forecast also warns of very dense to dense fog during the morning hours for the next three days. On Saturday, Noida saw one mm rainfall, leading to spike in humidity and a drop in the temperature. However weather experts said that the rainfall was not strong enough to wash away pollutants in the air. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the mercury will sharply fall on Sunday by four degrees and will keep falling for the rest of the week. As per the automatic weather station, the minimum temperature for Noida on Saturday was 15.5 degrees Celsius against 13.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature was recorded at 20.1 degrees Celsius as against 26.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature for entire NCR on Saturday was 14.4 degrees Celsius as against 11.3 degrees a day earlier. According to the meteorological department, the minimum temperature is likely to drop to 10 degrees Celsius on Sunday and 8 degrees by Monday. “Temperatures fell due to the rain, although Saturday saw a slight rise in the minimum temperature. But the maximum temperatures fell due to rains and because of the cold winds and clouds that blocked the sunlight during the day. From Sunday onwards, the maximum temperatures will start falling,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (IMD). Due to the occurrence of a western disturbance – a weather phenomenon that leads to snowfall in the mountains and rains in the NCR – the northern Himalayan states have received snowfall. From Sunday onwards, the wind directions will turn north-westerly, which means that it will start blowing from the mountainous regions. “Currently, the region is seeing variable south-westerly and westerly winds at the speed of 8 to 10 kmph. By Sunday, north-westerly winds will start blowing, which will lead to a drop in the mercury in NCR,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-receives-light-rain-mercury-set-to-drop-from-sunday/story-4H6l7e6UxEu6rP7MYCdVDK.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Mercury to dip, dense fog to prevail, say weather experts||Dense fog is likely to prevail in the city on Sunday along with a dip in the minimum temperature, as per weather experts. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 14 degrees Celsius on Saturday while the maximum temperature stayed at 21 degrees. On Sunday, the minimum temperature is expected to settle at 11 degrees, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the temperature would start dipping from Sunday onwards. “The temperature will fall marginally on Sunday and dip further next week. It can come down to eight degrees Celsius by next week. The air quality will also deteriorate with the dip in temperature,” said Srivastava. He added that dense fog was likely to prevail on Sunday during the morning hours. “A western disturbance has just passed due to which there is the availability of moisture and there are chances of dense fog. Visibility can go below 200 metres,” said Srivastava.Air quality in the city remained in the “poor” category on Saturday, with 296 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was up from Friday’s reading of 256. Experts attributed the poor air quality to the accumulation of airborne pollutants. Gurugram was the least polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR) as the AQI in the neighbouring Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad stayed in the “very poor” and “severe” categories. The level of ultra-fine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant was 210.35 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve but remain in the lower end of “very poor” to “poor” category on Sunday. The air quality is likely to remain in the “very poor” category next week as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mercury-to-dip-dense-fog-to-prevail-say-weather-experts/story-CydddrqxafCCGLTHC0LqoN.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records low footfall at sample collection booths on extensive testing day||The district health department on Saturday administered nearly 6,100 Covid-19 tests — a number that fell slightly below the expected target of 7,000 tests. Complying with the state government’s directive to conduct extensive Covid-19 testing on every Saturday, the health department held camps across the city. Senior officials, however, cited that footfall at the sample collection booths has been gradually declining. Data shows that the daily testing count has come down to 4,775 over the last six days as compared to 6,000 tests done on an average in the last week of November, leading to a steady downfall in the weekly test positivity rate – number of positives out of the total samples collected.On Saturday, at least 20 camps were held across the city, including the Kapashera border, which connects Gurugram with the adjoining national Capital. At least 6,144 tests were administered, out of which 5,794 were through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and only 350 through Rapid Antigen Tests. “Camps are held for people to walk in voluntarily and get tested. Our health workers do not force people to get tested. The gradual decline in overall cases has impacted the footfall of people at the sample collection booths,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to him, the target was to administer almost 7,000 tests on the extensive testing day. “Following the directive of the state health department, maximum Covid-19 tests are to be administered on every Saturday of the month. It is for this reason, on December 5, at least 10,000 tests were done,” he said. Data shows that even after increased testing, less than 400 new cases were confirmed. According to Yadav, special Covid-19 testing drive will continue to keep a control on the number of active cases, which has seen constant upward trajectory for the last two months, followed by a relative decline in the past few days.As per the district health bulletin, at least 276 new infections were confirmed on Saturday out of the 4,519 tests administered on Friday. The weekly test positivity rate remains at seven percent. With new infections, the total Covid-19 tally has reached 54,330, out of which 2,205 are active cases. Last time, the district recorded such a low count of active cases was on September 13 (2,232). On an average, 356 new cases were recorded this week, while 580 recoveries were reported. Currently, the recovery rate is almost 95 percent.Out of the current active cases, only 6.8 percent (150 people) of the seriously ill patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals. Eight of the patients are in Covid care centres, while 2,047 are home-isolated. The Covid-19 death toll stands at 329, with one death being recorded on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-low-footfall-at-sample-collection-booths-on-extensive-testing-day/story-MXT6GZLaW0i6Od1r55I5LM.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Farmers from Haryana and Rajasthan to march towards Capital||Farmer groups from Rajasthan and Haryana are likely to march towards Delhi via the Delhi-Jaipur Highway (NH-48) on Sunday. Earlier this week, on Thursday, farmers had said they would block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway by December 12 and hold a nationwide protest on December 14 if the government did not roll back the farm laws. Azad Khan, Haryana vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Union, said that state farmers will be joining their counterparts from Rajasthan and proceeding towards Delhi on Sunday. “Farmer groups from Rajasthan are coming towards Haryana. We will join them and gather at Shahjahanpur in Alwar near the Haryana-Rajasthan border by Saturday night and proceed towards Delhi on Sunday,” said Khan. He added that there was a lot of pressure from the administration and the government with heavy police deployment in the region. However, the farmers would strive to march peacefully. “We will continue to protest peacefully despite the pressure. More and more farmer groups have started joining the movement since the government refuses to listen to our demands,” said Khan. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav also tweeted that farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana would gather at Kotputli in Rajasthan on Saturday and proceed for Delhi on Sunday through Delhi-Jaipur Highway (NH-48) as part of the “Dilli Chalo” initiative. Farmer groups from Nuh and other districts such as Bawal are also expected to join the march.“Thousands of farmers will travel in the direction of Delhi along with hundreds of vehicles from Rajasthan-Haryana border of Shahjahanpur (Behror) on NH-8 at 11 am on December 13. The farmers of Rajasthan and Haryana will be joined by national-level farmer leaders,” said a spokesperson from Samyukta Kisan Morcha (a union of farmers). In view of the farmers’ movement, preventive measures are being taken in Gurugram. Around 100 farmers heading towards Gurugram were stopped by Haryana police at Bilaspur on Saturday. A few farmers were also detained by the police as a precautionary measure while most turned back on their own, said police officials. Across Gurugram, more than 2,000 police officials have been deployed and more than 120 checkpoints have been set up. Around 68 duty magistrates appointed by the district administration on Friday for the blockage of the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway also surveyed areas along KMP, NH-48, and routes connecting to Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Jhajjar, Badli, Mewat, Faridabad and Delhi to check preparedness measures and spot possible farmer gatherings. On Saturday, Gurugram traffic police also prepared route diversion plans for multiple points on NH-48 such as Sirhaul toll, IFFCO Chowk, Bilaspur Chowk, and the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway to re-route traffic if the farmers’ block the highway. DCP traffic DK Bhardwaj said that traffic police officials have already been stationed at all the diverted routes from Saturday onwards to direct commuters to the nearest and correct routes if there is any congestion or blockade on the national highway. In Nuh, the district administration on Saturday imposed Section 144, restricting the gathering of more than five people at public places. As per the prohibitory order issued by Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata, no individual is allowed to travel with lathis, sticks, spears or weapons of any kind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-from-haryana-and-rajasthan-to-march-towards-capital/story-Y1LA6DryBWpk84wk2GQSrJ.html
13-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police prepares diversion plans in view of farmers’ protests||The Gurugram traffic police on Saturday said that they have prepared route diversion plans for multiple points on the national highway(NH)-48, including Sirhaul toll plaza, Iffcco Chowk, Bilaspur Chowk, and the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway. These diversion plans will be put into effect if the farmers block the highway as part of the ongoing agitation against three farm laws passed by the Centre.DK Bhardwaj, DCP traffic, said, “We have identified several points along the highway where route diversions can be made to ensure that traffic movement is not hampered and people can reach their destinations. At all the diverted routes, traffic police personnel have already been positioned to guide the commuters towards alternative routes and ensure that there is no congestion.”Earlier this week, the farmers have announced that they would block the Delhi-Jaipur highway after their talks with the Centre failed to yield any solution.Bhardwaj said that Gurugram traffic police will update commuters over social media about the congested and blocked points. It will also list alternative routes so that people can travel accordingly.Bhardwaj said that if the Sirhaul toll is congested or blocked, then the traffic police will divert vehicles heading towards Delhi from Shankar Chowk via Cyber City towards Aya Nagar along the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road on one direction, and through Udyog Vihar and Kapashera border on the other side.In case of congestion at Iffcco Chowk, he said that the vehicles will be diverted via MG Road, Aya Nagar, on one end, and through Sukhrali, Old Delhi Gurgaon Road towards the Kapashera border. If the Bilaspur Chowk is heavily congested, than traffic will be diverted through KMP, Farrukhnagar, Pataudi Road, Himgiri Chowk, towards Hero Honda Chowk.Bhardwaj further said that if the same situation occurs on KMP expressway, then the traffic police will divert traffic through Farrukhnagar, Dhankot, Basai Chowk, Himgiri Chowk towards Hero Honda Chowk.Overall, more than 2,000 police officials have been deployed across different parts of the city for managing law and order as well as traffic at key points.On Saturday, 68 duty magistrates, who were appointed by the district administration for a possible blockade of the Delhi-Jaipur expressway, also accompanied traffic police officials in civilian clothes and travelled along KMP, NH-48, and all roads connecting to Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Jhajjar, Badli, Mewat, Faridabad and Delhi to assess the preparations made by the police as well to look out for possible farmer gatherings, said traffic police officials.Gurugram Police said at least 128 vehicles were randomly stopped at the Sirhaul toll and checked.“The checking of vehicles was done on a random basis as a precautionary measure.

13-12-2020||Mumbai||No decision yet on making Covid-19 vaccination free: Mumbai civic body||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), India’s richest civic body, on Saturday maintained that no decision has been taken on making Covid-19 vaccination free for citizens. Mumbai mayor and Shiv Sena corporator Kishori Pednekar said the BMC will wait for state government guidelines, but as a mayor, she feels that citizens should not be charged for Covid-19 vaccination.According to BMC officials, it is almost clear that there will have to be two doses of vaccine for every individual, but clarity on whether vaccination will be free or not will be decided after guidelines from the Central and state governments. On Friday, the BMC’s task force for vaccination in the city held its first meeting to prepare a strategy for vaccination of over 1.24 crore citizens in Mumbai.In the meeting, it was decided that the first dose will be administered to 1.25 lakh frontline workers in 15 days after the vaccine arrives, and the second dose will be administered in 15 days after a buffer of 28 days. According to BMC officials, the first target will be to vaccinate 1.25 lakh frontline workers, followed by the police force and conservancy workers in the second phase, and in the third phase, all citizens above the age of 50 will be vaccinated.Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “Whether the Covid-19 vaccine will be administered for free or not is something I cannot comment at this stage. Central and state governments will come out with their guidelines in the same context, and we will take a decision after considering it.”Kakani added, “For now, the focus is on vaccinating frontline workers, and the logistics required for it, including trained manpower. We are going to take help from non-governmental organisations (NGO) when it comes to manpower.”BMC had on Friday decided to form 5,000 teams, wherein each team will have five members for vaccinating the whole city. The BMC has also decided to have two to three vaccination centres in each ward. For now, BMC is in the process of procuring deep freezers and has set up a central vaccine storage facility in Kanjurmarg.Commenting on the same, Pednekar said, “We are bound by the guidelines of the state government, and we will follow it when it comes to giving free vaccination or charging citizens. However, as a mayor, if you ask me, I feel Covid-19 vaccination must be given to all citizens free of charge to ensure every citizen has access to the vaccine.”Meanwhile, India is banking on four to five vaccines, for which trials are being conducted or will be started in the coming days. These include the US pharmaceutical giant’s Pfizer vaccine, one by Oxford University, Russia’s Sputnik V, and India’s Covaxin by Bharat-Biotech.On the pricing end, Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine is expected to be priced at ₹500-₹600, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India, had told Hindustan Times on November 19. Pfizer has maintained it will have different rates for its Covid-19 vaccine for different countries, as the company aims to make the vaccine available across the world. The price bracket for other vaccines is not known yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-decision-yet-on-making-covid-19-vaccination-free-mumbai-civic-body/story-9tRMTNTODoE1hnN3bhJ1FL.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers feel the chill at borders||With the sun playing hide-and-seek on Saturday, and a spell of light rain in the morning, farmers camping at Delhi’s four border points for the past 17 days, to protest against the new farm laws, have started feeling the chill as they dug in for a long winter standoff. Although the temperature did not actually fall in Delhi, protesters said the light rain left them shivering. At the Safdarjung observatory, the minimum temperature was recorded 14.4 degrees Celsius, up from 11.3 degrees Celsius on Friday and six degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 21.8 degrees Celsius.Srinagar receives season’s first snowfall, people share breathtaking picsAnticipating that their protests may continue for long at four borders points of Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla, farmers said they have stocked up on wood for bonfires, as well as blankets and woollens.“Many tractor trolleys and truck that have arrived from parts of Punjab and Haryana over the last two days have brought with them wooden planks, gur (jaggery), peanuts, dates, gajjaks (peanut/walnut bars), and roasted grams, apart from ration and warm clothes. We will not step back until the government accepts our demands,” said Nishan Singh, a farmer from Mansa in Punjab.At Singhu border, where the maximum number of farmers have gathered, many vendors from Delhi and Haryana were seen selling woollen coats, jackets, and trousers to protesters, who have turned their parked tractor trolleys and trucks into makeshift homes.Dense fog, spike in pollution likely todaySitting next to police barriers, Mohammad Sahid from Delhi’s Jama Masjid sold warm clothes priced between ₹200 and Rs 400. Several farmers were seen standing around, checking the quality of the clothes and bargaining with Sahid.“I usually sold these items near Jama Masjid. But considering the change in weather and the presence of thousands at Singhu border, I decided to shift my business here. This is my first day and business is good. I have sold 40-50 jackets since morning,” said Sahid.The light rain also had Good Samaritans rushing to these borders with boxes of woollen clothes, blankets and food items. One such group from Haryana’s Kaithal brought 500 blankets in a tractor trolley and gave them all to farmers. Ajay Kumar from the group said people of his village contributed money .On Friday, Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava visited Delhi’s border with Bahadurgarh to interact with security personnel deployed there. “They are doing a commendable join this harsh winter,” Shrivastava tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-after-saturday-shower-farmers-at-borders-feel-the-chill/story-89t7vM1VkrVJrwBO5Q0KmI.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Dense fog, spike in pollution likely today||Parts of the national capital received light rainfall on Saturday morning but it did not do much to bring down the temperature or clean the city’s air. Data from India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed that the minimum temperature on Saturday was 14.4°C, highest for the month of December since 2015. At the Safdarjung observatory, whose readings are taken as representative of the city, the minimum temperature rose to 14.4°C from 11.3 on Friday, six degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 21.8°C. IMD records showed that on December 9, 2015, Delhi had recorded a minimum temperature of 15°C.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “The minimum temperature is recorded early in the morning and today (Saturday) morning, we received rain. Since the temperature tends to rise during rainfall, we recorded a high minimum temperature.” IMD also warned that because of high moisture content in the air, there is a possibility of dense fog on Sunday morning. With the light rainfall, the pollution levels also took a nosedive on Saturday.

13-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi reports 47 Covid-19 deaths, lowest since November 2||Delhi recorded 47 deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday, taking the total toll of the infection to 9,981. The death toll reported in Saturday’s government health bulletin is the lowest since November 2, when 42 deaths were reported. Delhi saw its third and worst surge in the number of cases and deaths in November. “Number of deaths in Delhi are on a decline. Lowest 47 deaths since 2nd Nov. I Request you all to observe all precautions for this trend to decline further,” tweeted Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. According to the bulletin, of the 73,413 tests conducted, 32,578 (44.3%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.A total of 1,935 fresh cases were reported on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the city to 605,470. Jain said the average number of cases reported daily is also declining.“7 days average per day cases now are 2275 one month ago this was 7196. Cases are continually on a decline for a month in Delhi,” the minister tweeted. The dip in cases has also led to a decline in the number of hospitalisations. On Friday, there were 4,631 patients admitted to hospitals, 24% of the total beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 were occupied, as were 44.3% of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds, according to the Delhi Corona app. “Bed occupancy for Covid-19 patients in Delhi hospitals is continuously reducing. Today, over 75% of beds reserved for treatment of Covid-19 are vacant. The number of vacant ICU beds has also increased,” said Jain in a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-reports-47-covid-19-deaths-lowest-since-november-2/story-wPz0rT9TqWLhMWj6zDLg6K.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Teen, abducted by man who lied about his name, faith, found after nearly 2 months||Nearly two months after a 15-year-old girl was reported missing from her west Delhi home, police on Saturday said they found her in Badarpur, southeast Delhi. They said she had been abducted in October by a man who had lied about his name and faith on social media. Police have arrested Shoyab Khan, 18, who allegedly abducted her after meeting her on Facebook. They said Khan had posed as SK Sinha on the social media website, adding that he had abandoned the girl in an auto-rickshaw in Badarpur on October 26, three days after he took her away by promising to marry her. Minor accuses man of forcing her to convert in UP, FIR filedDeputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said police filed a case of abduction on October 23 after the girl’s father informed them she was missing. During the investigation, police checked the call details of the girl’s cellphone and her social media accounts.“We found that she had been frequently receiving messages from one SK Sinha. We collected details of the account holder from the service provider, and discovered that it was created by one Shoyab Khan of Alwar, Rajasthan,” said DCP Purohit.Police said the man took her to different places in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and abandoned her three days later after learning that police were looking for him. Delhi Police officers said they found the girl in a house in Badarpur, where she had been working since October 26. She told police that she was afraid of returning home. Plea filed against UP’s ‘love jihad’ law in HCPolice said that to find the teenager, the investigating team camped in several parts of Mewat region in Haryana and Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi for 46 days, suspecting that she may have been abducted by human traffickers.The investigating team raided Khan’s home, but he was missing, along with his family and relatives. The police said that one of the investigators was stationed in Mewat region to look for information on the whereabouts of the suspect. The rest of them carried out raids and scanned CCTV camera footage.The team also visited Bihar’s Muzaffarpur and Uttar Pradesh’s Azamgarh after technical surveillance of the suspect’s cellphone indicated his presence there. Two of his Facebook friends in both cities confirmed that the suspect had stayed at their homes with the girl.“The suspect told his friends that he had married her. But when they found out that the girl was a minor and they were not married, they refused to shelter them anymore,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named.The first breakthrough in the case, the officer said, came on December 8, when they located Khan and arrested him from Delhi’s Badarpur border. He then told the police that he had abandoned her in Badarpur.Police then launched a search operation to find the auto-rickshaw in which Khan had abandoned her. On December 9, the police found the auto-rickshaw and spoke to its driver, who claimed that he had dropped the girl near Badarpur Extension. After six hours of a door-to-door search operation, the police found her, the officer said. “Khan, who is a college student in Rajasthan, has been booked for abduction and criminal conspiracy. He has been sent to jail. If the girl levels other allegations, he will be booked under those sections too,” the officer added.Investigating officers said Khan is not part of any organised gang that endorses interfaith marriage or forces minors into changing their religions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-teen-abducted-by-man-who-lied-about-his-name-and-faith-found-after-nearly-2-months/story-mACCrmIm7emyHmjlFaIGbJ.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Farmer protests: Traffic smoother, Chilla border reopens||Delhi police on Saturday said that the Delhi-Noida border at Chilla would be opened before midnight even as farmers continued protesting against the new farm laws.One carriage of the border between Delhi and Noida had been closed for the last two weeks after a group of farmers sat on protest. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that the farmers protesting at the Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) have agreed to clear the carriageways and restore the movement of vehicles between Delhi and Noida. Meanwhile, the Delhi-Jaipur highway blockade on Saturday, as announced by famers on Friday, did not impact traffic flow on the road as only a few farmers turned up for the blockade. A senior Delhi traffic police officer said the department was prepared to handle the situation even if more farmers had turned up. Also on Saturday, the vehicular movement was lower than usual.“We had a contingency plan in place, but because we are constantly putting out traffic advisories on our social media pages and warning commuters to avoid the borders and adjacent roads, people are wary of these areas,” the officer said.But Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, who has been actively involved in the farmer protests, said on Saturday that farmers have started from their respective states to reach Delhi via the Delhi-Jaipur highway. “The presence of these farmers will be seen by Sunday,” he said.At present, with the ongoing protests, seven borders are completely closed. These are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mungeshpur in outer and south-western parts of the city and Chilla border, connecting Delhi and Noida, in east Delhi. Apart from the seven, the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) is also closed to vehicles coming to Delhi, while the opposite carriageway is open. The service road of NH-24 at the UP Gate border are also closed.Addressing protesters at the Ghazipur protest site on Saturday, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said questions over the “funding” of langars at protest sites were misleading. “We were eating at home as well. Our family members sent us here with food and told us to eat there and fight for our rights. When these gurdwaras fed people during the lockdown, they were praised. Now suddenly, they and their funding are being questioned.” Tikait also stressed that attempts to divide farmers group would be unsuccessful.The BKU spokesperson said if anyone at the protest sites was found resorting to “anti-national activities”, the police and intelligence agencies should catch them. “We haven’t come across any such person and if we do, we would send them away,” he said, while responding to statements made by two Union ministers, who had said the farmers’ protest has been hijacked by “leftist, Maoist elements” and “anti-social elements.” But social activist Medha Patkar, who joined farmers at Ghazipur on Saturday, said, “The government always tries to malign mass agitations like these. But that will not affect anything. This is a satyagraha and any citizen of the country can join in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-traffic-smoother-delhi-s-chilla-border-may-open-by-midnight/story-6wtqhm4VhJLGFtaa7LUQTK.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Mayors camped outside CM’s residence bang thaalis to register protest||The mayors of the city’s three municipal corporations — north, south and east — along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors continued their protest outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Saturday by beating thaalis (plates). A statement issued by the three mayors read that this was done to “wake the Delhi CM up from his slumber” and to make him listen to their grievances. AAP wants CBI to probe ‘fraud’ in civic bodyNorth Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said that the three mayors of Delhi municipalities had been sitting on a protest outside the CM’s residence for six consecutive days now with a demand that the government releases Rs 13,000 crore funds that it allegedly owes to the corporations. “The CM has not tried to meet us once. Because of this, we decided to bang plates today to make him listen to our grievances,” Prakash said. Security up as farmers’ stir likely to intensifyHe added that the mayors will continue their protest till the money is released by the Delhi government. Reacting to the protests Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and legislator Atishi on Saturday said that AAP leaders will protest outside L-G Anil Baijal and Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence demanding a CBI inquiry on North civic body for misappropriating funds to the tune of over Rs 2,000 crore.The state government has also ordered an inquiry into the alleged fraud. The North civic body denies all the allegations. On Friday, the mayors had said that they will continue to run their offices from outside Kejriwal’s residence from Monday onwards. The AAP in a statement on Friday had said the mayors’ protest outside the chief minister’s residence was done to harass the CM, and distract attention from the farmers’ protest. The party said the mayors were aware that the government had given all the funds, but it was because of corruption that they were facing financial problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-camped-outside-delhi-cm-s-residence-bang-thaalis-to-register-protest/story-E7yn34baznvL6bwBBMq1eO.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||AAP wants CBI to probe ‘fraud’ in civic body||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said they would stage a sit-in protest demanding from the Centre a CBI probe into alleged misappropriation of funds of more than Rs 2,400 crore in the north Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). The sit-in will be staged from 11am on Sunday in front of the homes of Union home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant governor of Delhi Anil Baijal until the Centre permits an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the alleged MCD scam, AAP MLA and senior leader Atishi said during a press conference. “The way the Delhi Police has allowed BJP councillors to sit outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, I am sure they will allow us to sit outside the L-G’s and home minister’s residence, that too along with full protection.” The party said that on one hand, the BJP-run North MCD claims they do not have money and are incapable of paying salaries, but on the other, they can waive off Rs 2,500 crore payable by South Delhi MCD. “If you check the accounts of South MCD of the last many years, they clearly state that Rs 2,500 crore was the payable rent for the SDMC office at Civic Center which is owned by the North MCD. But in this year’s budget, the rent payable is shown as 0. The question is, where is this Rs 2,500 crore?” Atishi said.On Friday, senior AAP leader and Delhi minister Satyendar Jain said the state government has ordered a probe against North MCD on charges of misappropriation of the money. The BJP denied the allegations. Its Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “There has been no misappropriation of funds. The south MCD owes the rent since 2012 when the trifurcation of the MCDs happened. In the current budget of the MCDs, there is a provision for waiver on the rent payment that is due, but it is awaiting approval of the House.”The north civic body’s mayor, Jai Prakash had on Friday denied the allegations and said that the inquiry was a diversionary tactic. “This is nothing but a diversionary tactic by government to not release our dues,” he said.By night, the party released two letters written by Atishi and AAP leader Raghav Chadha to Delhi Police seeking permission to stage the protest “on similar lines as it allowed to BJP leaders to protest in front of the CM’s house.”The party said Chadha and AAP MLAs Sanjeev Jha, Kuldeep and Rituraj Govind will protest outside Shah’s home. Atishi and three leaders of opposition in the MCDs— Vikas goel, Manoj Tyagi and Prem chauhan — will protest outside the L-G House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aap-wants-cbi-to-probe-alleged-fraud-in-north-corporation/story-4pwfySbBsteVrB9FjlgOdP.html
13-12-2020||Delhi||Security up as farmers’ stir likely to intensify||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday met a large delegation of farmers from Haryana who said they favoured farm reforms even as thousands of cultivators already protesting three laws to liberalise the sector drew up plans to scale up their demonstrations, beginning with a blockade of the Jaipur-Delhi national highway on Sunday.Thousands of policemen were, meanwhile, deployed at the Delhi borders to thwart plans by anti-farm law agricultural unions to turn up the heat on the government by ramping up the scale of protests. The police also stopped protestors from blocking the main highway from Delhi to Agra. Protestors, backed by the Bharatiya Kisan Union, occupied toll plazas and allowed commuters to drive past without paying toll fees. Agitating farmers allow reopening of Chilla road at Noida borderPro-reform farmer organisations said they would lose out on opportunities if the laws, which the protestors say would promote corporate interests over those of the agricultural community, were scrapped and they too must be heard. Protesting farmers are concerned that they would be at the mercy of big corporations and that the system of minimum support prices (MSPs), which assures them guaranteed prices for staples, would be dismantled..Leaders of large farm unions opposed to the laws, on the other hand, prepared to intensify their agitation by blocking all highways into Delhi, beginning with the Delhi-Jaipur expressway, and occupying toll plazas, but said their demonstrations would be peaceful.Those who believe in status quo can’t make history: Narendra Singh TomarThe union leaders will sit on a hunger strike on December 14, said Jagmohan Singh of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the platform of farmers spearheading the protests.“Thousands of farmers will begin a tractor march tomorrow at 11 am from Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan and will block the Jaipur-Delhi main road. After our nationwide call, all toll plazas of Haryana are free today,” Kamal Preet Singh Pannu, another farm leader, said.In their meeting with the farm minister, farmers supporting the laws said they would pressure the government to uphold the Acts“We are progressive farmers representing farmer producer organisations. The reforms will bring big opportunities for us. Our voice should matter too,” said Jagat Ram of Prakritik Kheti Samaj of Karnal in Haryana.Delhi Police stepped up deployment of its personnel and placed concrete barriers at various border points as farmers prepared to block the Delhi-Jaipur highway and the Yumuna Expressway.“Farmers’ ‘Delhi march’ on Jaipur-Delhi highway will not start today and it will begin from Shahjahanpur border tomorrow. Today, farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana will congregate in Kotputli and Behror,” Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, a prominent face of the agitation, tweeted in Hindi.Meanwhile, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has planned a campaign across the country to publicise the three laws, planning over 100 press conferences and 700 farmers’ meetings.Farm minister Tomar on Saturday yet again appealed to protesting farmers to restart talks, which the protestors abandoned on December 9, to find a solution. .In Uttar Pradesh, several farmers’ leaders were confined to their houses by the police after an alert over the farmers’ unions’ call to disrupt toll plazas across the state on Saturday in protest against the new farm reform laws, the police said.They said the heavy contingents of police were deployed at around 130 toll plazas on highways and expressways across the state to ensure that no road was blockaded. Uttar Pradesh director general of police Hitesh Chandra Awasthy said no violence had been reported anywhere and peace prevailed.In Meerut, a farmer leader, Chaudhary Diwakar Singh, said he was placed under house arrest in Faridpur village of Amroha on Saturday after he called the district magistrate of Moradabad over the phone to seek an appointment with chief minister Yogi Adityanath during his visit to the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-security-up-as-farmers-stir-likely-to-intensify/story-CUjdtUj5R5JFTSFRA0mRmI.html
13-12-2020||Chandigarh||Friday night was Chandigarh’s warmest in December since 2011||After recording the warmest December day in six years on Friday, few hours later the city also experienced the warmest night in nine years with a minimum temperature of 15.2°C.This was the highest since December 2011, when the night temperature had gone up to 15.6°C on December 9. Friday’s minimum temperature was also nine notches above normal and the highest in the region, despite 5.4mm rain overnight. In fact, the last time that the night temperature went this high this year was on October 25 (15.6°C).Speaking about this, Chandigarh IMD director Surender Paul said, “The day was sunny on Friday, following which clouds appeared at night. Clouds act as a blanket, trapping heat from escaping at night. Rain supplements this, especially during winter nights.”Paul said the sky will be clear from Sunday onwards and a fall in temperature was on the cards. “There was snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, so northwards winds will bring in cold winds, which will cause the night temperature to fall dramatically below 10 degrees in the next few days. Due to higher humidity, chances of fog in the morning and evening will also be there till Tuesday. This will bring down the day temperature by a couple of degrees,” he added.IMD has also issued a yellow warning for dense fog in the city on Sunday and Monday. Yellow is second of the four-level warning system used by IMD, which goes up to red. At yellow, people are advised to stay updated about the situation. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature reduced from Friday’s 28.1°C to 23°C on Saturday due to the rain and partly cloudy weather. In the next three days, highs and lows of around 22°C and 11°C are expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/friday-night-was-chandigarh-s-warmest-in-december-since-2011/story-snggLYhg9usajabQYqJSAO.html
13-12-2020||City||Kharar flyover’s Ludhiana link finally opened for public||After missing several deadlines over five years, the Ludhiana link of the Chandigarh-Kharar flyover project was finally thrown open to traffic on Saturday, while the Rupnagar link is expected to get completed by January 15 next year. Anandpur Sahib member of Parliament Manish Tewari inaugurated the link in presence of Kharar sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain.“We opened the Ludhiana link over the Kharar bus stand at 11.30.am. But, due to some confusion among commuters, we closed it for nearly two hours and reopened it later. The Rupnagar link will also be opened by January 15,” said SDM Jain. The 1-km Balongi stretch (called the Balongi flyover) was the first to be opened in October. With two links of the flyover now open, the project is 91% complete. It entails widening of the road between Balongi and Kharar T-point and construction of two flyovers and three minor bridges. The total length of the flyovers (divided into three parts) is around 10km. The national highway where the flyover is located connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab, besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck, as about 50,000 vehicles cross the stretch on an average daily. The Rs 368-crore project, being executed by Larsen & Toubro, was initiated in November 2015 and has missed six deadlines, after initially slated to be completed in three years by December 2018. From delay in land acquisition to other administrative hurdles and mostly recently workforce issues amid the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for the delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-kharar-flyover-finally-ludhiana-link-opened-for-public/story-2MutectczXBRKsv76cmHHJ.html
13-12-2020||Pune||Meet Pune’s people whisperer who is on a mission to relieve your lockdown loneliness||Working to make the world a much better place which listens, 22-year-old Raj Dagwar is a young engineer on a mission. Standing in front of the eateries on Fergusson College road, the student from PICT, holds a placard with the message, tell me your story and I will give you Rs 10. Dagwar spends at least five hours on the footpath listening to people tell their stories. He remembers the names of all the people who have spoken to him and also their stories. “I am a good listener and some of them really enjoyed my company when they were feeling low,” said Raj.“Everyone has problems, big or small, and it’s not easy to speak about them. The lockdown forced several people to live alone and also feeling lonely, which led to many keeping their emotions locked within themselves, thus leading them towards depression,” says Raj, who finished listening to a young girl, who thanked him profusely.Raj has heard over 50 stories a day, sometimes spending more than an hour listening to a person. He spends his evenings on FC road between 6pm and 11pm. “It feels good when a complete stranger comes up to me and starts telling me what he or she is going through. I know the feeling, I have experienced it first hand, when I was going through depression and was feeling all alone,” said Raj. I have had moments in my life in 2019, where I felt I was not up to the mark and that I was failing in my efforts to be like my father who is also an electrical engineer and living in Dubai. There were times when I simply could not open up to my parents, or interact with issues that I had with my younger brother. It was then that I sought professional help and overcame my problems,” says this shy young man.It has not been easy, standing out on the pavement as some people stare, some criticize, and some are often curious. “All, I do is smile from behind the mask and slowly ask the question, tell me your story. If I can help them relax or ease their thoughts, I feel as if I have achieved one good thing,” he adds.“Being a good listener means giving your entire attention to the person, making him/her comfortable and possibly relieve them of their stress. I recently met a grandmother who was visiting her grandchildren and felt the need to talk to me about not being able to understand them or how distant it has become. By the end of the talk, the granny had tears in her eyes and she felt good and blessed me,” said Raj.Mental health and counselling is usually looked upon as a stigma or like having a disease, but Raj wants to help remove this label by urging everyone to speak up about their problems. Swaroopa Barve, a psychologist in Karvenagar, said, “The young man has taken up a good initiative. He is offering those who cannot talk freely, a chance to express themselves, however, as a mental illness professional, if he gets better guidance or sensitized to help identify those who really need professional help, it will alert him better or raise a red flag to refer that person to professionals for help. There is a tremendous need for people to talk openly especially after the lockdown for people to get used to the new normal. We, as a professional community, are trying to reach out to people and destigmatize therapy and the term psychology, although the new generation is much more open to seeking therapy. Ravindra Shelar, a coordinator for an educational institute recalls his meeting with Raj. “I had a bad day at work and was walking aimlessly on FC road when I saw this young boy standing with a board. I approached him and started talking to him. I am a diabetic and during the lockdown, I was afraid of stepping out and hence, was very upset when I resumed work. I live with my wife and son, but you cannot talk to them about everything, so when I met Raj, I spoke to him about all my concerns, fears and felt relieved at the end of the conversation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/meet-a-young-man-on-a-mission-to-listen-to-your-thoughts-and-relieve-some-of-the-lockdown-loneliness/story-M7j5IUgqKCEePBMcZ2Pz1J.html
13-12-2020||Pune||Schools in Pune will not reopen till January 3||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Saturday issued order that private and public schools in the city will remain shut till January 3 in view of the Covid pandemic. The order was released by Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. “As per the earlier decision, schools were closed till December 13. Now, all private and government-run schools will remain closed in Pune city till January 3,” said Kumar in his order.The latest decision has come as most schools had not submitted their report of preparedness, as reported by Hindustan Times on December 12. The school department of Pune civic body had carried out basic preparation of sanitising premises considering that schools may reopen from December 14. However, PMC received negative response from various private schools’ administration and parents on reopening the premises. According to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, civic body will review the situation next month and take a call on restarting schools. “It was decided to reopen schools in Pune from December 14. We were taking undertaking from parents about sending their children to schools. However, we received a poor response. Considering this, we have decided to keep school closed till January 3. On January 3, PMC will review the Covid-19 situation and take a call to reopen schools or not,” Mohol said. Parents have welcomed the move to deferring the decision to restart schools. Pravin Gaikwad, a parent from Pune said, “The decision to reopen schools in January is a welcome decision. We hope Covid cases may lessen by that time and it will be safe for children to attend schools.” According to Mohol, the pandemic situation in the city is in control. As on December 11, Pune city reported a total of 183,893 positive cases with 4,344 deaths. Since the past one week, the city is reporting around 300 cases daily. “Even as situation is under control, we cannot claim that all is well. Even parents are not ready to send their kids to school,” he said. Meanwhile, schools from rural parts of Pune district, which had already reopened last month, has seen a steady rise in student attendance over the past two weeks, according to zilla parishad authorities. Class 12 exam forms to be submitted online The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education in its circular issued on Friday has stated that regular students appearing for Class 12 examination can fill up forms for exam to be conducted in summer 2021 between December 15 and January 4. For repeaters, the dates are January 5 to January 18. The forms are to be submitted online, according to the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-in-pune-will-not-reopen-till-january-3/story-hPXFOmNsbHox4ePsxoJJiO.html
13-12-2020||Pune||‘Second wave not severe in Pune as first wave developed antibodies among many people’||Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, spoke to Hindustan Times on the city’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Salunkhe, who was the former director general of health services, Maharashtra and WHO chief of Indonesia, added during interview that Pune was not hit hard by the second wave of the pandemic, as the first wave had already affected a lot of the population of the city as revealed in the sero surveys. Q: The first case of Covid-19 in Pune was reported on March 9. What is your observation of how Pune handled the pandemic? A: It is true that no one anticipated that the situation would get so bad. However, I do believe that in February when we had the state committee meeting on communicable diseases, which I had chaired in the presence of secretary health, Maharashtra, I had predicted that we will have serious problems and we should be prepared. No one anticipated even in the US or India that we would be hit so hard by the pandemic. Compared to March 2020, a lot of water has flown under the bridge. Pune could have saved lives and reduced the number of positive cases too. The picture today is a combination of the natural factors and the intervention carried out by the administration. Q: Pune fortunately has not been hit hard by the second wave as much as Delhi or even Mumbai post Diwali season. What could be the reason for the same? A: The credit cannot be attributed to the interventions by the administration alone or the citizens responsible behaviour, as we did see large crowds rushing towards the market during the festive season. The truth is that the Sero survey, both in Pune and in PCMC, showed more than half the population in congested areas were already hit and there was high prevalence of antibodies, however, small the scale of the study was. In simple words, we can say that the first wave of the virus already did the damage that it could, which is the main reason why the second wave did not hit us so hard. Now, we need to maintain this plateau and without much fluctuation in the numbers, if we can maintain this till December end, then by June we will be in a much better situation, unless there is some change in the virus strain. Also the district administration did consider our interventions, Pune was the first in the state to form the technical task force. Also, a task force by the divisional commissioner involved communities and so Pune did undertake such measures to curb the virus spread. Q: What does Pune’s health infrastructure need right now? A: I have been in touch with the PMC commissioner and am now working on a universal public health plan when we found that we have three or four sectors which need to be addressed like water supply management, waste management, pollution and other departments. These need to be attached to health planning. If we can provide better water to citizens, we can avoid many diseases like jaundice. Secondly, we need to strengthen the primary health centres which will play a major role in avoiding epidemics and pandemics. We do not necessarily need a 500-bed tertiary care to meet our health requirements, but a vast network of PMC clinics with manpower and infrastructure. We also need private hospitals, but we need a law in place to ensure that they do not exploit the poor or the middle class. Q: Do you think that we will be in a better position if a new virus would hit us again next time? A: If we do not learn from the mistakes that we made during this pandemic, then we will be equally hit by the next disease. The government of India will now have to totally restructure the health infrastructure of the country.

Reason: His family is facing financial crisis because of the Covid situation. Bandal is a second year Commerce student of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and was staying at a private hostel in the city. Now, he cannot afford to pay the hostel fees. Bandal’s plight is similar to thousands of students who were staying at SPPU and other college hostels, but now have to opt for private rooms or flats. They have been demanding reopening of SPPU and other prominent college hostels once offline college lectures resume. “My parents are farmers living at a remote village in Solapur district. Before the lockdown, I returned to my village and am stuck here. Few of my friends have returned to Pune, rented a flat, but are unable to survive after two months of stay. If the university hostels are reopened, we will get the rooms at less rent and can resume studies without thinking about the financial aspects of hostel charges,” said Bandal. Another student Satish Gore said, “I returned to Pune when the lockdown was relaxed. As SPPU hostels were closed, we four friends rented a flat at Sinhgad road. Now, we are finding it difficult to pay room rent. We request varsity administration to reopen hostels with Covid guidelines, at least for some needy students.” SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar said, “We are yet to get any instructions regarding reopening of hostels from the state government. Once colleges resume offline classes, we will restart hostel facilities. As of now, we are maintaining the hostel rooms and telling final year passout students to collect their belongings so that rooms are made vacant.” Fergusson College principal Dr Ravindra Pardeshi said, “The threat of Covid is not over yet and we cannot risk students when they return to campus. In principle, we do agree that hostels should be reopened, but at the same time safety of students is also of utmost importance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-seek-reopening-of-hostels-in-pune/story-X3jerisa0Odvosq6hugudI.html
13-12-2020||World||Canada expects first Pfizer/BioNTEch Covid-19 vaccines to arrive Sunday||The first doses of Covid-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada later on Sunday, with more of the initial batch of 30,000 coming on Monday, the official in charge of Canada’s vaccine rollout told the CBC.As early as Monday, Canada and the United States are set to become the first Western nations after the UK to begin inoculations with the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE.The doses will go to 14 sites around Canada, with the most vulnerable, including the elderly in long-term care facilities and healthcare workers, first in line for shots.“Some flights will arrive tonight. Some flights will arrive tomorrow,” Major-General Dany Fortin told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The vaccines left Belgium, where they were produced, on Friday. The distribution timetable is going according to plans, and administration points for the vaccine will slowly be increased to some 200, starting this week, Fortin said on the Rosemary Barton Live morning show.“The intent here is to ensure that we continue to have regular drip feed of vaccines in the coming weeks,” with 249,000 doses expected to be in Canada by the end of the year, he said.Canada is expected to approve a second vaccine from Moderna Inc “reasonably soon” and the country will be ready to accept shipments of it by the end of the week, Fortin said.On the same show Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said review of the Moderna vaccine was ongoing and a regulatory decision could come before the end of the year.Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses, given about three weeks apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-expects-first-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-to-arrive-sunday/story-t7KB6vsoKWvoyhk2gFGigN.html
13-12-2020||World||US expects to have immunized 100 million against Covid-19 by March end: Official||The United States expects to have immunized 100 million people with the coronavirus vaccine by the end of March, the chief adviser for the US Covid-19 vaccine program said on Sunday.The first vaccine was authorized for emergency use by US regulators on Friday night and began shipping on Sunday.“We would have immunized 100 million people by the first quarter of 2021,” US Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said in an interview with Fox News Sunday.He said the United States hopes to have about 40 million doses of vaccine distributed by the end of December, which would include the just authorized vaccine from Pfizer Inc and one from Moderna Inc expected to get a similar emergency use nod later this week.Another 50 million to 80 million doses will be distributed in January, and the same number in February, Slaoui said. The vaccine requires two shots per person.“We are working with Pfizer to continue helping them and supporting them achieve the objective of providing us with another 100 million doses in the second quarter of 2021,” Slaoui said. The first to be vaccinated would be front line healthcare workers, as well as residents of long-term care facilities, he added.For the United States to get “herd immunity,” which would halt transmission of the deadly virus, the country would need to have immunized about 75% or 80% of the population, he said, adding that he hoped to reach that point between May and June.“It is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept to take the vaccine,” Slaoui said. “We are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see.”He said he hoped people will keep an open mind, “listen to the data and openly agree that this is a very effective and safe vaccine and therefore take it.”In a large clinical trial, the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness with few serious side effects.Slaoui downplayed suggestions that there might not be enough vaccine to go around. He noted that a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson is likely to be ready for authorization late in January or early in February, and that he expected AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be “potentially approvable somewhere late in February.”Political pressure for vaccines to be approved was “not helpful, because it’s not needed,” Slaoui said in response to questions about reports that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Food and Drug Administration head Stephen Hahn on Friday to urge him to authorize the vaccine that day or possibly lose his job.A tweet on Friday by President Donald Trump, who has been critical of both the FDA and Pfizer, said to “Get out the damn vaccine NOW, Dr. Hahn.”“If that phone call happened, I think it was useless and unfortunate, and so are some of the tweets,” Slaoui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-to-have-immunized-100-million-against-covid-19-by-march-end-official/story-aaEPpC5nuZsWUoAAQoVDvI.html
13-12-2020||World||Explainer: How much Covid-19 vaccine will be shipped in US||Covid-19 vaccines have begun shipping in the US after getting emergency authorization, setting off the nation’s biggest ever vaccination push. But supplies are expected to be limited for some time.The first wave of shipments is going to health care workers and nursing home residents. Officials say vaccines should be available to everyone by the middle of next year.Trucks with Pfizer’s vaccine rolled out Sunday. They will deliver to 145 distribution centers around the country by Monday, said Army Gen. Gustave Perna of Operation Warp Speed, the government effort to develop and distribute Covid-19 vaccines. An additional 425 sites will get shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday.For now, only Pfizer’s vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration greenlit Friday, is being shipped. Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel this week and could get the go-ahead soon afterward.Other vaccines also could follow.HOW MANY SHOTS WILL BE SHIPPED OUT INITIALLY?Around 3 million.When states were told their first-round allocations earlier this month, the figures were based on the 6.4 million Pfizer doses that were ready for distribution at the time, Perna said. Since the Pfizer vaccine requires two doses, the government is holding back the second shots to ensure people can get them.An additional 500,000 doses are being held in reserve for any emergencies, Perna said.HOW MUCH VACCINE IS EACH STATE GETTING?US officials say it’s based on a state’s population of people 18 and older. Federal officials haven’t released a breakdown, but some states have shared their initial allocations.Colorado, for example, says it’s supposed to get 46,800 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the first round, with more expected in the weeks that follow. If the Moderna vaccine gets the green light, the initial shipment for that shot would be 95,600 doses, said Kevin Klein, director of the state’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.HOW MUCH MORE IS ON THE WAY?By the end of December, US officials say they expect to have enough vaccine to give 20 million people their first doses — meaning they’d have around 40 million shots available. That’s factoring in Moderna’s vaccine, which also requires two doses and still has to clear regulatory hurdles.Officials say they expect to be able to vaccinate an additional 30 million people in January and 50 million more in February.WHY NOT DISTRIBUTE ALL THE DOSES RIGHT AWAY?Even though Pfizer study data indicates people get some level of protection after the first shot, officials say full protection means two doses. And they need to be sure they’ll have that second dose for people at the right time — three weeks after the first shot.For Moderna’s vaccine, the second shot comes four weeks after the first.Yet officials say exactly how many additional shots will become available from week to week might vary based on how much can be produced, especially in the beginning, so they don’t want to risk anyone not being able to get their second shot.COULD THE STRATEGY CHANGE?Officials say they might adjust once they become more confident about the flow of future supplies.“As we get more experience on quality control on the production, we’ll get greater confidence, of course, at the level of supply reserve we hold back for the second dose administration,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a briefing with reporters. “But we will not distribute the vaccine knowing that a booster will not be available, either from reserve supplied by us, or from ongoing, expected, predicted production.”HOW ARE DOSES ALREADY AVAILABLE?Even though the Pfizer shots just got the green light from regulators, shipments can start right away because manufacturing and stockpiling of the doses was underway. It was a chance officials took to speed up delivery if the vaccines were shown to be safe and effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-much-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-shipped-in-us/story-BvPlKIBkIDwX4133AR6d9H.html
13-12-2020||World||Status report of Joe Biden’s all-inclusive cabinet||US president-elect Joe Biden is facing some severe challenges and criticism on his mission to create an all-inclusive cabinet that ‘looks like America’. The Democrat leader had pledged to nominate an unprecedented diverse cabinet and bring in representation from all the sections of the society. He is trying hard to fulfil the promise and return rewards to his loyalists who stuck by him through the long race leading him to the White House as the leader of the country.Till now Biden has nominated General Lloyd J Austin making him the first Black secretary of defence, he chose Cuban immigrant Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the department of homeland security, Janet Yellen as the first female treasury secretary, and Xavier Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, as the secretary of health and human services. His nomination of Taiwanese Katherine Tai for US trade representative was particularly lauded by progressive groups. Besides them, there is his star woman of colour vice president-elect Kamala Harris, who recorded many firsts in the history of American politics.However, there have been undertones of disappointments as many communities still feel left behind in the run for cabinet roles. LGBTQ advocates are upset as there has been no representation from the community until now in the cabinet and until Tai’s nomination, Asian groups too were looking for themselves in the senior-level jobs.Also Read | US President-elect Joe Biden vows to rejoin Paris Climate Accord on day one of presidencyRecently, Biden nominated Marcia Fudge, a renowned Black congresswoman for housing and urban development, for which he received a lot of flak. Biden also received criticism as he nominated Obama’s administration alum Tom Vilsack for the agriculture department instead of Fudge who has been a long-time member of the House Agriculture Committee advocating to protect the food-stamp program. Fudge was lobbied by many for not only her experience but also to fight food insecurity and racial inequality.Audio of a private meeting leaked to The Intercept had NAACP president Derrick Johnson telling Biden, “Vilsack could have a disastrous effect on voters in the state of Georgia,” reported AP.The challenge to decide on an attorney general with Black leaders wanting someone from a background in civil rights has also heated the atmosphere. Activists also feel that there are likely fewer chances of leaders like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders landing the major roles as the transition team fears poaching from Democrats’ ranks in the Senate.AP reported Norman Solomon, national director of the progressive activist group RootsAction saying, “I think there are some red flags or, in this case, some discouraging blue flags.” He also said that there could be attempts to block the nomination of Indian American Neera Tanden for the office of management and budget due to her past antagonism towards Sanders, as reported by AP.His earliest choices of four white men for the critical roles of chief of staff, secretary of state, national security adviser and his top political adviser also raised some questions as it gave an impression that the president-elect still wants to go for same old aides and not bring in some fresh perspective.His nominees need to win confirmation in the divided Senate that could be driven by Republicans depending on who wins in the runoff races in Georgia next month.Moreover, experts say Biden also needs a team not only diverse but also highly efficient as they have to bring the country up from economic turmoil, fight a pandemic, stop racial injustices and create many jobs in a country that saw a historic level of unemployment this year while being energy efficient as the country intends to go back to the Paris climate treaty.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/status-report-of-joe-biden-s-all-inclusive-cabinet/story-oJc3U43C7QPwbONAQPQLVP.html
13-12-2020||World||‘Business as usual with Iran’ will be mistake, says Netanyahu||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said it would be a mistake “to go back to business as usual with Iran,” signaling Israeli resistance to an expected push by President-elect Joe Biden to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.Netanyahu spoke at a press conference with Robert O’Brien, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser.But his comments appeared to be aimed at Biden, who has said the US will rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran agrees to strict adherence. The deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, has unraveled since Trump withdrew from it in 2018.Netanyahu led an unsuccessful fight against the deal when it was negotiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2015 and welcomed Trump’s withdrawal three years later. Netanyahu says the deal will not prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and fails to address other belligerent Iranian behavior, such as its support for proxies across the region and its development of a long-range missile program.“As long as Iran continues to subjugate and threaten its neighbors, as long as Iran continues calling for Israel’s destruction, as long as Iran continues to bankroll, equip and train terrorist organizations throughout the region and the world, and as long as Iran persists in its dangerous quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, we shouldn’t go back to business as usual with Iran,” Netanyahu said Sunday. “We should all unite to prevent this major threat to world peace.”O’Brien arrived days after the U.S. announced that Israel and Morocco were establishing full diplomatic relations — making it the fourth such deal between Israel and an Arab state brokered by the outgoing Trump administration.O’Brien said the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Iran has been successful and said the string of agreements between Israel and Arab countries would cement what he called “the legacies of peacemakers” Trump and Netanyahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/business-as-usual-with-iran-will-be-mistake-says-netanyahu/story-XGVrvn5J4zCiHCU3QZ36BN.html
13-12-2020||World||Spain could develop coronavirus herd immunity by end of summer 2021, minister says||Spain should achieve herd immunity from Covid-19 by the end of summer 2021 if enough people are vaccinated by then, the health minister said in an interview published on Sunday. Salvador Illa said a vaccination programme will start in January and by the end of the summer more than two thirds of the population of 47 million should be vaccinated.“In Europe, even if it is not the final end, we will be in a very different stage. That is why I think we are at the beginning of the end with this time horizon that I say, from five to six months,” he told Publico newspaper.Asked if this meant that Spain would achieve herd immunity, Illa replied: “Yes. It is what the technicians call that, that people have immunity either because they are vaccinated or because they have had the disease.”However, Illa cautioned Spaniards against dropping their guard during the Christmas period. Spain has been one of the worst hit countries in Europe by coronavirus.New cases rose by 10,519 to 1,730,575 on Friday, according to health ministry data, while the number of deaths increased by 280, bringing the total to 47,624.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-could-develop-coronavirus-herd-immunity-by-end-of-summer-2021-minister-says/story-tDevtVfvVre6xN2gca5PgL.html
13-12-2020||World||Trucks with first Covid-19 vaccine in US roll out||The first trucks carrying a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use in the United States pulled out of a Michigan manufacturing facility Sunday, with the shots that are critical to stopping the nation’s coronavirus outbreak destined to reach states a day later.Shipments of the Pfizer vaccine will set in motion the biggest vaccination effort in American history at a critical juncture of the pandemic that has killed 1.6 million and sickened 71 million worldwide.Initially, about 3 million doses were expected to be sent out, and the priority is health care workers and nursing home residents as infections, hospitalizations and deaths soar in the US With numbers likely to get worse over the holidays, the vaccine is offering a bright spot in the fight against the pandemic that’s killed nearly 300,000 Americans.Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with an additional 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. The vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, is being doled out based on each state’s adult population.Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC has chosen staff who are critical to operating its facilities as among those getting the first round of vaccinations, said Dr. Graham Snyder, who led the center’s vaccine task force.“It’s very exciting. I will be thrilled, that moment when we administer our first dose,” Snyder said Saturday. “That will clearly be a watershed moment for us.”Snyder said the UPMC system estimates that half its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered to them.The vaccine is heading to hospitals and other sites that can store it at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Pfizer is using containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors to ensure each shipment stays colder than the weather in Antarctica.Doses should be delivered to all vaccination sites identified by states, such as local pharmacies, within three weeks, federal officials said.The 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi expects to receive more than 9,000 doses in the coming days, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality.Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said.“I would say there’s enthusiasm,” Kemmerly said Saturday. “There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune.”The rollout will ensure there is enough vaccine to give people the two doses needed for full protection against Covid-19. That means the government is holding back 3 million doses to give those vaccinated in the first round a second shot a few weeks later.The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the vaccine Friday, saying it is highly protective and presents no major safety issues. While US regulators worked for months to emphasize the rigor and independence of their review, they faced political pressure until the final stages.Concerns that a shot was rushed out could undermine vaccination efforts in a country with deeply ingrained skepticism about vaccines. The head of the FDA said the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the U.K. are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel next week and soon afterward could be allowed for public use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trucks-with-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-us-roll-out/story-64izKUpEaiRjeuiZNljLyH.html

Turkish Airlines, in which Turkey’s government holds a 49% stake, plans to resume service on the route within days, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified due to its sensitivity.Turkish Airlines and Emirates withheld flights between their two hubs even as both carriers revived their pandemic-depleted schedules. While neither airline said why the services remain suspended, the prolonged halt coincided with a worsening of relations between the two nations.The UAE’s aviation regulator didn’t respond to requests for comment.Mending FencesThe UAE and Turkey are on opposing sides of a proxy war in Libya and disagree on issues ranging from Syria and Iraq to the eastern Mediterranean. Like its close ally Saudi Arabia, the UAE views Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s version of political Islam as a destabilizing influence in the region.The planned restoration of flights suggests that tensions between Turkey and the UAE are receding. Saudi and Turkish leaders agreed last month to keep their channels of dialogue open.The Dubai-Istanbul journey, which takes between 4 and 5 hours, ranked among Emirates’ busier routes. For Turkish Airlines, the corridor provided a welcome way to attract budget-minded passengers headed for western Europe or North America through the country’s new Istanbul airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-turkey-to-resume-flights-for-first-time-since-coronavirus/story-SgvW5JfCk2YG31QLq9QKlL.html
13-12-2020||World||Trump appoints flurry of allies as presidency nears end||His time in the White House rapidly ending, President Donald Trump is rewarding some supporters and like-minded allies with the perks and prestige that come with serving on federal advisory boards and commissions.On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate two authors who wrote books that flattered him to a board that makes recommendations on education research. Another author who helped write a favorable book about the president was chosen for the same board a few days earlier.On Wednesday, the Department of Defense announced that China hawk Michael Pillsbury would become the chair of a board that gives Pentagon leadership advice on how to enhance national security. Pillsbury has served as an outside adviser to the president on China.And on Tuesday, Trump said he would appoint his former counselor and 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, to serve on the board of visitors to the US Air Force Academy. Going to the same board will be Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller. She served as a White House liaison at the Justice Department and was told to vacate the building when top department officials learned of her efforts to collect inside information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was among the appointees to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She’s also married to Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a perpetuator of Trump’s false claims of election fraud, will become a member of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board.It’s not unusual for outgoing presidents to make a flurry of appointments to boards and commissions before leaving office. With three days to go in his tenure, President Barack Obama named senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and national security advisor Susan Rice to the Kennedy Center board.Paul Light, an expert on the federal bureaucracy and a professor at New York University, describes the practice as “unseemly” and said that every administration does it.“But nobody does these things with more politicization than Trump,” Light said.The positions that Trump has filled in recent weeks are generally on advisory boards in which members go without a salary, though they get reimbursed for travel expenses. The positions have what Light describes as “gorgeous resume value.”The number of advisory board positions has ballooned over the years. Light said that he believes past administrations have put in sincere work to match up people with the kind of credentials and experience Congress envisioned when it created those boards. He doesn’t see that same effort now.“This is all favors repaid and favors earned,” Light said of Trump’s picks.The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what the president is seeking to accomplish with the appointments and how he thinks they would enhance the work of the federal government.Among the most consequential of the wave of appointments has been with advisory boards at the Pentagon.There was Pillsbury’s appointment to the Defense Policy Board. In addition, the Pentagon announced the previous week that Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie would serve on a separate entity, the Defense Business Board. That board provides the Pentagon’s leadership with outside private sector perspectives. Lewandowski was the first of Trump’s three campaign managers in 2016. Bossie was tasked with helping the campaign’s legal challenges contesting this year’s presidential election.They serve at the pleasure of the administration, so President-elect Joe Biden could move to replace them quickly.In another recent move, Trump picked global warming skeptic David Legates to serve on the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science. Legates co-wrote an article in April that stated: “Actual hurricane, tornado, sea level, flood, drought, and other historic records show no unprecedented trends or changes, no looming crisis, no evidence that humans have replaced the powerful natural forces that have always driven climate and weather in the real world outside the modelers’ labs.”He’ll be among 12 scientists and engineers appointed to award the medal given to those who make outstanding contributions in the physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences.In September, Trump told California leaders struggling with the worsening wildfires associated with global warming that the climate would “start getting cooler” again. “You just watch,” he added.Light said some of the picks struck him as Trump declaring: “I’m on my way out and I’m going to slap you one more time. ... You laughed at me on the way out, but I got the last decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appoints-flurry-of-allies-as-presidency-nears-end/story-1VBJhKIri6qKKoPyuHjljP.html

Presiding over an emergency meeting at the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters for the first time since February, Moon urged vigilance and called for an all-out efforts to contain the virus. “Unless the outbreak can be contained now, it has come to the critical point of considering escalating social-distancing measures to the third level,” he said, referring to the tightest curbs under the country’s five-tier system.Greater Seoul, home to about half of South Korea’s 52 million people, is under level 2.5 restrictions. Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned and restaurants are prohibited from serving customers after 9 p.m.A country that had initial success controlling Covid-19, South Korea reported 1,030 new coronavirus infections on Sunday after 950 the previous day, bringing total infections to 42,766 with 580 deaths.Of the new cases, 1,002 were locally transmitted, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said. “Our back is against the wall,” Moon said. “This is a crucial moment to devote all our virus control capabilities and administrative power to stopping the coronavirus spread.”Level 3 curbs would essentially mean a lockdown for the first time in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. Schools would switch to remote learning, companies could allow only essential workers in offices and gatherings of more than 10 people would be banned.The government will add about 10,000 hospital beds within the next few weeks and temporarily pay some nurses involved in the care of Covid-19 patients an extra 3 million won ($2,748) a month to help overstressed hospitals across the country. “Assuming about 1,000 of new daily infections for the next 20 days, we will secure over 10,000 beds in the next three weeks,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a televised briefing after the emergency meeting. South Korea was praised for its early success in containing the coronavirus without a lockdown by relying heavily on contact-tracing and testing after the country’s first case was confirmed in January.On Saturday, Moon ordered the mobilisation of police, military personnel and public medical doctors to block the spread, which he called an “emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-president-moon-warns-of-toughest-covid-19-curbs-after-two-days-of-record-cases/story-GcbUuRh1QHmJME6PlA3EOM.html
13-12-2020||World||Brexit: Food, medicine shortages and other concerns amid trade talks deadlock||Britain and the European Union have held several rounds of negotiations to arrive at a post-Brexit trade agreement but the two sides on Saturday indicated that the UK’s ‘no deal’ exit from the bloc seems more likely than not. The United Kingdom exited the EU on January 31 but it has been following the bloc’s rules during the ongoing transition period of 11 months.On January 1, the United Kingdom will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and the application of EU law to and in the UK will cease. The two sides haven’t been able to resolve the differences over a few sticking points, but they have agreed to continue the talks on a free trade agreement, extending the self-imposed deadline that was set to end on Sunday. However, the UK and the 27-member bloc have been preparing for a ‘no deal’ exit since both sides have to adjust quickly to the changed rules.Here are the major concerns and the ways the two sides preparing:Concerns over possible food shortagesThe European Commission had warned that there are not enough European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) permits available, which are required by UK lorry drivers to enter EU countries. In such a situation, the UK lorries won’t able to transport enough goods from EU countries, leading to a serious disruption in the supply chain. The EU has proposed allowing road freight, and road passenger transport for six months as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK.Basic air connectivityThe UK is currently a member of European Common Aviation Area which allows British airlines to fly to and from destinations in the EU countries. In case of a ‘no deal’ exit, the UK’s membership to the ECCA will cease. The European Commission has proposed a six-month regulation to allow certain air services between the UK and the EU, provided the UK ensures the same.Also Read | Deadline comes knocking: Is there hope left for Brexit deal?Medicine shortagesThe UK pharmaceutical companies had reportedly warned the government against a possible shortage of some medicines in the middle of the pandemic. According to a BBC report, the head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry warned that no trade deal before the end of the transition period would cause “increased complexity, duplication and cost.” The UK government has insisted that there are contingency plans to ensure the shipping of Pfizer’s vaccines from Belgium if border problems arise.FishingThe 27-member bloc has been demanding access to UK fishing waters but the British government has called it incompatible with the UK’s future status as an independent coastal state. The European Commission has proposed regulation to create an appropriate legal framework for continued access by EU and UK vessels to each other’s waters after December 31, 2020. According to the proposal, the legal framework will exist until December 31, 2021, or until a fisheries agreement has been concluded, whichever date is earlier.“In order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries and in light of the importance of fisheries for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the procedures of authorisation of fishing vessels,” the commission said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-food-medicine-shortages-and-other-concerns-amid-trade-talks-deadlock/story-L6a75R77kOA327aCgidQTJ.html
13-12-2020||World||UK, EU say talks will continue on post-Brexit trade deal||Britain and the European Union say talks will continue on a free trade agreement — a deal that if sealed would avert New Year’s chaos for cross-border traders and bring a measure of certainty for businesses after years of Brexit turmoil.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had set Sunday as the deadline for a breakthrough or breakdown in negotiations.But they stepped back from the brink, saying it was “responsible at this point in time to go the extra mile” and had told their negotiators to continue talking.With less than three weeks until the UK’s final split from the EU, key aspects of the future relationship between the 27-nation bloc and its former member remain unresolved.Progress came after months of tense and often testy negotiations that gradually whittled differences down to three key issues: fair-competition rules, mechanisms for resolving future disputes and fishing rights.It has been four and a half years since Britons voted by 52%-48% to leave the EU and — in the words of the Brexiteers’ slogan — “take back control” of the UK’s borders and laws.It took more than three years of wrangling before Britain left the bloc’s political structures on Jan. 31. Disentangling economies that have become closely entwined as part of the EU’s single market for goods and services took even longer.The UK has remained part of the single market and customs union during an 11-month post-Brexit transition period. That means so far, many people will have noticed little impact from Brexit.On Jan. 1, it will feel real. New Year’s Day will bring huge changes, even with a deal. No longer will goods and people be able to move between the UK and its continental neighbors.Exporters and importers face customs declarations, goods checks and other obstacles. EU nationals will no longer be able to live and work in Britain without a visa — though that doesn’t apply to the more than 3 million already there -- and Britons can no longer automatically work or retire in the EU.There are still unanswered questions about huge areas, including security cooperation between the UK and the bloc and access to the EU market for Britain’s huge financial services sector.Without a deal U.K. will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms, with all the tariffs and barriers that would bring.The UK government has acknowledged a chaotic exit is likely to bring gridlock at Britain’s ports, temporary shortages of some goods and price increases for staple foodstuff. Tariffs will be applied to many UK goods, including 10% on cars and more than 40% on lamb.Still, Johnson says the UK will “prosper mightily” on those terms.To jumpstart the flagging talks, negotiators have imposed several deadlines, but none have brought the sides closer together on the issues of fair trading standards, legal oversight of any deal and the rights of EU fishermen to go into U.K. waters.While both sides want a deal on the terms of a new relationship, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into U.K. industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep, so is demanding strict “level playing field” guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.The UK government claims the EU is trying to bind Britain to the bloc’s rules and regulations indefinitely, rather than treating it as an independent nation.Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said a no-deal Brexit would be a “double whammy” for economies already battered by the coronavirus pandemic.“It is clear when you do a trade deal that you are a sovereign nation; they are made to manage interdependence,” she told Sky News. “The UK and the European Union are interdependent so let’s do a deal which reflects the need to manage this interdependence.”Britain’s belligerent tabloid press urged Johnson to stand firm, and floated the prospect of Royal Navy vessels patrolling UK waters against intruding European vessels.But others, in Britain and across the EU, urged the two sides to keep talking.Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, whose economy is more entwined with Britain’s than any other EU state, said he “fervently” hoped the talks wouldn’t end Sunday.“It is absolutely imperative that both sides continue to engage and both sides continue to negotiate to avoid a no-deal,” Martin told the BBC. “A no-deal would be very bad for all of us.“Even at the 11th hour, the capacity in my view exists for the United Kingdom and the European Union to conclude a deal that is in all our interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-say-talks-will-continue-on-post-brexit-trade-deal/story-LkztVJ0Wo80jd1QFvxKQOP.html
13-12-2020||World||Hundreds of Nigerian students missing after attack on school||Hundreds of Nigerian students are missing after gunmen attacked a secondary school in the country’s northwestern Katsina state, police have confirmed.The Government Science Secondary School in Kankara was attacked Friday night by a large group of bandits who shot “with AK 47 rifles,” Katsina State police spokesman Gambo Isah said in a statement.Police engaged the attackers “in a gun duel which gave (some of) the students the opportunity to scale the fence of the school and run for safety,” Isah said.About 400 students are missing, while 200 are accounted for, Isah said. The school is believed to have more than 600 students.“The police, Nigerian Army, and Nigerian Air Force are working closely with the school authorities to ascertain the actual number of the missing and/or kidnapped students,” said Isah.“Search parties are working with a view to find or rescue the missing students,” he said.A resident of the town, Mansur Bello, told The Associated Press that the attackers took some of the students away.It is the latest attack on a school by gunmen in Nigeria.The most serious incident occurred in April 2014, when members of the Jihadist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in Chibok, in northeastern Borno State. About 100 of the girls are still missing.The latest attack is believed to have been carried out by one of several groups of bandits active in northwestern Nigeria. The groups are notorious for kidnapping people for ransom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-nigerian-students-missing-after-attack-on-school/story-ZR4oEgNmCmfoGnMijKUt8I.html
13-12-2020||World||How Covid-19 hijacks and damages lung cells? Scientists decode||Scientists in the US have decoded the chain of molecular responses of human lung cells to the coronavirus infection, a feet which may help in identifying the clinically approved medications that can be re-purposed for the treatment of Covid-19, according to a report.Published in the journal Molecular Cell, the study, conducted by the scientists from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), evaluated engineered cells of the human lungs’ air sacks using exact mass spectrometry technology that can identify the molecules present in samples. Based on the analysis of the study, the researchers identified proteins and pathways of molecules in lung cells whose levels change upon infection by the coronavirus. The scientists believe the findings of the study provides an insight into disease pathology and new therapeutic targets to block Covid-19.The researchers found a crucial type of protein modification called “phosphorylation” becomes aberrant in these infected lung cells. According to the study, phosphorylation of proteins plays a major role in regulating protein function inside the cells of an organism. It noted that both protein abundance and protein phosphorylation are typically highly controlled processes in the case of healthy cells. However, the scientists discovered that SARS-CoV-2 throws the lung cells into disarray, causing abnormal changes in protein amounts and frequency of protein phosphorylation inside these cells. These abnormal changes, the scientists said, help the virus to multiply -- eventually destroying the cells and resulting in widespread lung injury. Upon infection, the researchers said the coronavirus rapidly begins to exploit the cell’s core resources, which are otherwise required for the cell’s normal growth and function. “The virus uses these resources to proliferate while evading attack by the body’s immune system. In this way new viruses form which subsequently exit the exhausted and brutally damaged lung cell, leaving them to self-destruct,” said Andrew Emili, study co-author from BUSM. “These new viruses then infect other cells, where the same cycle is repeated,” Emili explained. In the study, the scientists examined lung alveolar cells from one to 24 hours after infection with SARS-CoV-2 to understand what changes occur in these cells immediately -- at one, three and six hours after infection by SARS-CoV-2 -- and what changes occur later -- at 24 hours after infection. “Our results showed that in comparison to normal/uninfected lung cells, SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells showed dramatic changes in the abundance of thousands of proteins and phosphorylation events,” said Darrell Kotton, study co-author and professor of pathology & laboratory medicine at BUSM. “Moreover, our data also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus induces a significant number of these changes as early as one hour post infection and lays the foundation for a complete hijack of the host lung cells,” added Elke Muhlberger, another co-author of the study. The researchers also identified at least 18 pre-existing clinically approved drugs which were developed originally for other medical conditions that could be re-purposed for use towards Covid-19 therapy. They believe further studies can shed light on the potential of these drugs to block the proliferation of the novel coronavirus in human lung cells.

France also strongly criticised the execution on Saturday of dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam, who had been based in Paris before he was captured and taken to Iran.Zam was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017. His Amadnews feed had more than 1 million followers.The EU said in a statement after his execution: “The European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances.”The French Foreign Ministry called the execution a “barbaric and unacceptable act”, saying in a statement: “France condemns in the strongest possible terms this serious breach of free expression and press freedom in Iran.”Amnesty International and press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the execution.Iranian officials have accused the United States, as well as Tehran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile, of stoking the unrest that began in late 2017 as regional protests over economic hardship spread nationwide.Officials said 21 people were killed during the unrest and thousands were arrested. The unrest was among the worst Iran has seen in decades, and was followed by even deadlier protests last year against fuel price rises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-summons-german-ambassador-over-eu-criticism-of-journalist-s-execution-report/story-Z9OupDautlCPxVlWy1mzwJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Emmanuel Macron thrusts Muslims onto the front line of French politics||Nagib Azergui used to be hopeful that the racism he experienced growing up in a Paris suburb was on its way out. In Emmanuel Macron, the country was getting a president who would heal divisions, an “anti-Trump leader.”The head of France’s only Muslim political party now he says he was wrong. Macron has called Islam a religion in crisis and has moved to shut down mosques accused of spreading hatred. Last week, his government introduced a draft law to fight “separatism,” a term he’s coined for groups that don’t integrate and are susceptible to extremism.“Muslims are tired of being used by politicians as scapegoats to deflect attention away from real problems,” said Azergui, 41, an engineer of Moroccan descent from Nanterre.Azergui can’t claim to represent the country’s Muslims—his group still only has about 1,000 members and in last year’s European elections it gained just 0.13% of the vote. But Macron’s policies have reinvigorated his goal of fighting Islamophobia and encouraging citizens of his religion to stop being “invisible.”France’s president has cultivated an image abroad as a defender of liberalism since coming to power in 2017 in contrast to leaderships in the US, Britain, and eastern Europe. Yet at home he’s been courting conservatives after a series of horrific attacks by Islamic radicals and that risks alienating a Muslim population that may be heterogeneous but also represents France’s second biggest religious group after Catholicism.As campaigning for the 2022 presidential election unofficially gets underway, there’s a growing sense of betrayal within France’s 5.6 million-strong Muslim community, the overwhelming majority of whom are integrated and reject terrorism.Macron hasn’t said whether he’ll run again, but he’s clearly positioning himself as the law-and-order candidate in an election that’s likely to pit him against far-right leader Marine le Pen.Attacks by extremists have left about 250 people dead since 2015, including a teacher beheaded in October for opening a classroom debate on freedom of speech and cartoons of Prophet Muhammed.Part of the French president’s plan entails creating an “Islam of Enlightenment” and while he has repeatedly insisted that Muslims shouldn’t be stigmatized, his assertion that the religion is in crisis upset many Muslims in France.As did his appointment of Gerald Darmanin, a hardliner, as interior minister in a recent cabinet shuffle. His prime minister, Jean Castex, meanwhile has dismissed the idea of making amends for France’s colonization of regions including in North Africa and the Sahel, from where many of its Muslims can trace their roots.France’s Muslim community is broad and opinions are hard to pin down because of restrictions on collecting ethnic and religious statistics.The country’s aspiration for universalism and integration makes it harder for those who identify with any religion from entering public life, said Hakim El Karoui, a fellow at Paris-based think tank Institut Montaigne. Polls commissioned by Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, and Charlie Hebdo,  the satirical magazine targeted in a 2015 terrorist attack, last year showed that 60% of French deem Islam incompatible with the values of the Republic, with almost half of French Muslims under 25 sharing that view.“Society puts Muslims in a double bind,” said El Karoui. “Speak up, but also, don’t show your religion in public.”El Karoui is himself a poster child of success in France, and said Islam represents a link to his family’s roots. His mother is Protestant, his father a Muslim of Tunisian origin. He’s an ex-banker whose time at Rothschild coincided with Macron’s. Two of his uncles were ministers in Tunisia before the uprising that sparked the Arab Spring. El Karoui served as an adviser to former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.In his elegant office in Paris’s business district, El Karoui thinks France’s integration system ultimately works well, citing as an example a high rate of mixed marriages. He advocates the creation of a body that would raise funds to encourage Muslims to fund research and train imams. “After every terrorist attack, discrimination against Muslims jumps,” he said. “What I’m telling them is: It’s not your fault, but now it’s in your interest to get organized.” The trouble is that when they try to do that, they can run into problems. Fatima Bent is the president of the feminist, anti-racist group Lallab. It describes itself as “pro-choice” on issues from abortion to the veil, but has been accused of being close to the Muslim Brotherhood. When it was set up in 2016, a bank even rejected its application to open an account.Bent said she worries most about police violence, which quietly affected Muslims in the suburbs, or “banlieues,” for a long time before entering the public eye more recently. She’s critical of a law provision once pushed by Macron that would have made it harder to share videos of police abuse.Muslim voters are disappointed by the parties on the political left, which they have tended to support, Bent said. That’s when they don’t abstain.While Azergui tries to get people behind his Union of French Muslim Democrats, which he founded eight years ago after former President Nicolas Sarkozy began a debate on national identity and immigration, Bent is betting on local initiatives. She’s organizing to help Muslim women share their stories.“I can’t believe we’re still asked whether Islam is compatible with secularism when we have millions of French Muslims at peace with these two identities, and living peacefully,” Bent said. “The government’s rhetoric is dangerous, it’s widening the rift of ‘them’ against us.”According to the draft law on “separatism” published on December 9, there will be stricter punishments for those who promote hatred online and threaten civil servants, including teachers. It neither explicitly mentioned Islam nor Muslims.Doctors who provide “virginity certificates” will also be targeted and scrutiny of the funding of religious associations increased. Home-schooling for kids older than three, meanwhile, will be restricted in a bid to prevent clandestine religious schools. Macron also wants to end the ghettoization of city suburbs and support their residents, though he has yet to unveil firm proposals to do so.Azergui is concerned the crackdown will backfire and drive more youngsters to extremism. He defends an interpretation of France’s secularism, known as “laicite,” whereby all faiths are respected but kept private, though he’d like women to be allowed to wear veils wherever they want.Since 2004, the wearing of religious signs has been prohibited in French schools, a ban backed by 44% of Muslims, according to a recent Ifop poll. While the veil may be worn elsewhere, women who do so and take on public responsibilities are often criticized as promoting a sexist symbol, including by government members.“When Macron speaks about separatism, he deliberately focuses on Islamism rather than on Corsican separatists, or wealthy people building a life on the margins,” said Azergui. “We’re an easy target.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emmanuel-macron-thrusts-muslims-onto-the-front-line-of-french-politics/story-dNZg13rvfF2hshsC6pL7vI.html

The year’s best meteor shower - the Geminid meteor shower - will settle on Monday morning after which the earth will soon be at a position that will give the skywatchers glimpse of the last solar eclipse of the year.However, the last solar eclipse of 2020 will not be visible in India due to its time and the earth’s rotations and revolutions around its axis and orbit respectively. It will be a total solar eclipse as the moon will completely cover the sun, blocking the light coming from the star of our solar system thereby casting a dark shadow or umbra on the planet.As per timeanddate.com, the eclipse is estimated to last for five hours beginning at 7:03pm IST with its peak at 9:43pm and ending at 12:23am on December 15. The total eclipse can be tracked in parts of Southern America. Chile and Argentina are expected to see up to two minutes and ten seconds of darkness due to the eclipse. Partial phases of the eclipse can be seen at some places in southern South America, south-west Africa and Antarctica.The US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), will also provide the live link for the space nerds across the globe to witness the last total solar eclipse of the year. ☀️🌗🌎 On Mon., Dec. 14, a solar eclipse will pass over South America with parts of Chile & Argentina in the path of totality.

The moon in between restricts the path of sun rays reaching the earth and casts its shadow on the planet instead. Parts of the earth that darken due to the moon’s shadow are able to see the eclipse.India is projected to see the next solar eclipse on June 10 in 2021, which will be an annular solar eclipse. An annular eclipse happens when the moon fails to completely block the sun and its outer edges are still visible giving an image of a fire ring in the sky. The country will have to wait 4,844 days to see a total solar eclipse. Solareclipse.info, a site that has all the information relating to the cycle of solar eclipses, has projected the next total solar eclipse for India on March 20 in 2034.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2020-after-a-dazzling-meteor-shower-skygazers-to-see-another-astronomical-event/story-WQG2t1u4KAqGoSM758YcZL.html
13-12-2020||World||China looks forward on anniversary of 1937 Nanjing massacre||A confident-sounding Communist Party of China spoke of a brighter future as it remembered the victims at a ceremony Sunday on the 83rd anniversary of the Nanjing massacre.Over six weeks, Japanese troops raped and killed tens of thousands — and by some estimates hundreds of thousands — of people after conquering Nanjing, then the capital of China, on Dec. 13, 1937.Chen Xi, a senior party official called the massacre “an inhuman act in human history.” Addressing a large and precisely lined-up crowd in the eastern city, he said they had gathered “to remember the day of atrocity, honor peace and open a new chapter of our future.”His forward-looking remarks reflected how much the world has changed since the days when then-imperial Japan occupied the eastern half of the country, ending only with Japan’s defeat at the end of World War II.Chen said that China, which has displaced Japan as the world’s second largest economy, is closer than ever to achieving the dream of national rejuvenation, a Communist Party catchphrase.He used the anniversary to counter those who see China’s rise as a threat, saying that the party is committed to international cooperation and peaceful development.Chen also noted that China is the first country to bring Covid-19 under control and restore economic growth, which he said demonstrates the strength of Communist Party leadership. China is a one-party, authoritarian state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-looks-forward-on-anniversary-of-1937-nanjing-massacre/story-ph2PHtow4df8g5qe1Xdi8I.html
13-12-2020||World||Pakistan increases funds for Covid-19 vaccine to USD 250 million||Pakistan has increased the funds allocated for purchasing Covid-19 vaccine to USD 250 million from the earlier approved amount of USD 150 million.It has also signed non-disclosure agreements with various multinational companies under which the recipient country will not make details of the vaccine public, the Dawn News reported.Parliamentary Secretary on National Health Services (NHS) Nausheen Hamid told the daily that the allocation for vaccine purchase had been enhanced to USD 250 million. “We will sign a purchase agreement with more than one company to ensure that we get a vaccine. Russia had also offered us its vaccine recently. However, we are looking into its safety and efficacy as public health is our top priority,” she was quoted as saying. When asked when the vaccine will be available, Hamid said it was hoped that the delivery of the vaccine would start by the end of the first quarter of next year. She said that in the initial phase of vaccinations, frontline health workers attending to Covid-19 patients and people over 65 years will be vaccinated. In the second phase, the remaining healthcare workers and people over 60 years of age will get preference, she said, adding that the vaccine alliance GAVI has also pledged to provide vaccines for the 20 per cent population. By the end of 2021, it would be available to the masses, Hamid added. Replying to another question, the parliamentary secretary said Pfizer had offered special containers to maintain the cold chain, adding that the vaccine could be kept in normal freezers for five days. A senior official of the ministry of National Health Services (NHS) told the paper that there were six potential companies and the ministry was not only engaged with them but had signed non-disclosure agreements with some of them due to which they were sharing data and progress of vaccine trials. “The Chinese vaccine is also under trial in Pakistan so we will get the vaccine on a priority basis. As per assurances given by the companies we may get between 100,000 and 500,000 doses by the end of February or in March. The vaccine will be administered to the most vulnerable people such as healthcare professionals working with Covid-19 patients,” he was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases jumped to 438,425 on Sunday after 3,369 new cases were reported. Another 72 patients died in the last one day, taking the Covid-19 death toll to 8,796, while at least 2,471 patients were in critical condition, according to the NHS ministry, which added that 3,83,000 people have recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-increases-funds-for-covid-19-vaccine-to-usd-250-million/story-kP4lt8hUa7QPD69bDBguhK.html
13-12-2020||World||Deadline comes knocking: Is there hope left for Brexit deal?||Facing yet another self-imposed Brexit deadline on Sunday, the chief negotiators from the European Union and United Kingdom were making last-ditch efforts to bridge differences on a trade deal that have proved insurmountable for the best part of the year.The EU’s Michel Barnier and Britain’s David Frost were already meeting just after dawn Sunday to try to reach a middle ground. But so far, the U.K. hasn’t backed down from its insistence on trading with the 27-nation bloc with as few restraints as possible, and the EU isn’t yielding on its demand to accept trade only if Britain respects the rules of the bloc.“There is still I think a long way to go,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said early Sunday.Britain left the EU on Jan. 31, but remains in its economic structures until a transition period ends on Dec. 31.Expectations are that the deadline day will be capped with a contact between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen late Sunday.Whether it’s a negotiating ploy or not, Johnson has publicly said the U.K. would still thrive mightily if there is no deal and it was “very, very likely” that negotiations on a new relationship that will take effect on Jan. 1 will fail.If the talks break down Sunday, both sides will have less than three weeks to prepare for the chaotic and costly no-deal exit at the end of the year.Without a deal U.K. will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms — with all the tariffs and barriers that would bring.To jumpstart the flagging talks, negotiators have imposed several deadlines, but none have brought the sides closer together on the issues of fair trading standards, legal oversight of any deal and the rights of EU fishermen to go into U.K. waters.While both sides want a deal on the terms of a new relationship, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into U.K. industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep, so is demanding strict “level playing field” guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.The U.K. government claims the EU is trying to bind Britain to the bloc’s rules and regulations indefinitely, rather than treating it as an independent nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadline-comes-knocking-is-there-hope-left-for-brexit-deal/story-XGvuel73oVtwVKRddVCGGJ.html
13-12-2020||World||‘Truly exhausted’: Texas doctor has been working for over 260 days without a single off day||Through multiple masks, a face shield and a protective suit he likens to those worn by astronauts, Dr Joseph Varon bends over his Covid-19 patient and waves into the phone she is holding up.At the other end of the video call, several loved ones express their delight at seeing the man who helped save Gloria Garcia from the disease that has killed more than 278,000 people in the US and counting.Varon, the chief of staff at United Memorial, a small hospital that primarily treats minority patients in a low-income north Houston neighborhood, made headlines when a photo of him hugging an elderly Covid patient on Thanksgiving went viral. The hug was a candid moment of empathy. And Varon’s wave to Garcia’s family is enthusiastic.But make no mistake: the doctor is exhausted.When AFP accompanied Varon on his rounds on Friday, it was his 260th straight day of work. Even the few hours he steals at home each day are interrupted by endless phone calls. He sleeps, he says, no more than one or two hours a night. “Don’t ask me how I can do this,” he adds. Donuts play a role. He displays a box, adding: “Whatever they bring is what I will eat because you don’t know when you’re going to eat again.” He says he has gained 35 pounds (15 kilograms).Outspoken and frustrated, Varon complained to the media as far back as July that he and his staff were running “on fumes.”“My staff is very tired. My nurses, they will start crying in the middle of the day. They will break down because they are so overwhelmed with the number of cases we’re getting that they are truly exhausted,” he tells AFP.- Reinforcements -Inside the critical care Covid ward, the beds are full. Staff take vitals and check on patients. Varon does his daily rounds.Garcia, ahead of her video call, sits up in bed and carefully arranges her hair and makeup. Other patients lie back on their pillows, with get well cards taped to walls.The health workers’ faces can barely be seen through the layers of protective gear. Some, including Varon, wear large photographs of themselves around their necks. It was the loneliness and lack of human contact on the ward that drove his pity for the man he hugged in the viral photo, he said.During the summer, as cases across Texas surged, they were backed up by a specialist army team providing medical support. But the military soon moved on. Varon and his staff kept working. They have some reinforcements still: since the pandemic began, travelling nurses across America have rushed towards the danger even as others have hunkered down.Demetra Ransom is one of them. She left her home in Florida to head first to New York, epicenter of the US outbreak in the spring, and then to other hotspots before landing in Houston. At United Memorial she is tactile with the patients, touching their arms and shoulders to comfort them. She talks even to those who are non-responsive, she says, updating them on their condition in case they can hear. - ‘Covid hunters’ -It did not have to be this way, Varon believes.He has expressed his frustration with the American failure to control the pandemic many times.Texas Governor George Abbott, a Republican and ally of President Donald Trump, ordered a one-month lockdown in the state in April -- but did not renew it.The wearing of masks did not become compulsory in Texas until July, as cases surged and the state become one of the new US epicenters. Abbot says there will be no more lockdowns.“People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls,” Varon told CNN when he was interviewed about the viral photo. “It is crazy. People don’t listen and then they end up in my ICU.”If Americans would follow basic health and social distancing guidelines, “health care workers like me could hopefully rest,” he said. He does not appear to dwell on sleep, however. He knows there are miles to go.The next six to 12 weeks, over the Christmas period and into the new year, will likely be the “darkest weeks in modern American medical history,” he said in a recent interview with ABC. Already cases in Texas are so high that Abbott has requested a military medical center be converted for intake of non-Covid patients to free up space in hospitals. County officials, meanwhile, have requested additional mobile morgues.United Memorial recently added another Covid wing in anticipation. For now, in the main staging area which is separated from the ward’s rooms by barriers, United Memorial staffers shed some of their protective gear beneath a sign reading “COVID HUNTERS.”Their gazes fixed, they pause and catch their breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-exhausted-texas-doctor-has-been-working-for-over-260-days-without-a-single-off-day/story-mixVx6zMPuJ1sHi9ghWkoN.html

She has favoured stricter pan-German measures but was previously unable to get agreement from the nation’s 16 states. However, some states have since clamped down on their own, and momentum supporting stricter harmonized measures has been building.The draft proposal would allow only essential shops such as supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as banks, to remain open.Schools will also be basically closed during the period, and employers will be asked to close operations or have employees work from home, according to the draft. The sale of fireworks will be banned.Germany has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed, while stores and schools have remained open. Some regions have already imposed tougher measures as infections grew.More social contact in the run-up to the Christmas holiday means “the number of cases is now again increasing”. “Therefore, it is necessary to take further measures to restrict contacts,” said the draft.New daily infections and deaths have reached records in recent days, and more politicians have been sounding the alarm. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 20,200 to 1,320,716, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 321 to 21,787, the tally showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-close-most-shops-from-dec-16-to-jan-10-as-per-draft-government-proposal/story-2amQq5adiNJ3X4GbSlQ6UP.html
13-12-2020||World||Health professionals raise serious concern over rising Covid re-infections in Pak||Health professionals in Pakistan have raised serious concerns over the growing incidents of Covid-19 re-infections at various health facilities in the country, where several patients have been reported having coronavirus for a second time with severe illness.Earlier perceived as a rare phenomenon, a rising number of coronavirus re-infection cases have started ringing alarm bells among health professionals in major cities of the country, reported The News on Sunday.However, policymakers and planners are not worried about the situation, claiming that the Covid-19 re-infection was still something that was not fully established and cannot be considered as a threat as of now.Officials at renowned hospitals including the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) and the Indus Hospital Karachi are fully convinced that people are getting re-infected with coronavirus and reporting to the hospitals with the severity of the disease for the second time.“This is true [re-infection with SARS-CoV-2]. We are seeing a number of re-infections. Putting it together in a paper, trying to finish it but keep finding new cases,” Dr Faisal Mahmood, senior infectious diseases expert and physician at the AKUH, told The News on Saturday.Meanwhile, another senior physician Professor Sohail Akhtar said that several cases of re-infection had come to his knowledge in Karachi.“One of our senior cardiologist friends is having re-infection and he is undergoing treatment due to severe symptoms. It is still not a widespread phenomenon but the cause of concern is that it is happening and people should keep it in mind that they can get re-infected if they stop taking precautionary measures,” said Akhtar.When asked about prevention and treatment of Covid-19, DUHS senior physician Dr Tahir Hussain regretted that the centres treating the virus in Karachi and other cities of Pakistan were not giving due importance to vitamin D and its preventive and therapeutic role in dealing with the coronavirus.“Studies all around the world have proven that if your vitamin D level is less than 20, you are four times more likely to have a very serious disease and die from Covid-19,” he said.According to the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, Pakistan currently has a total of 438,425 infections, along with 8,796 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-professionals-raise-serious-concern-over-rising-covid-re-infections-in-pak/story-qCnv9W7tnxOoCA7vMawtcM.html

Bahrain had previously authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, which was provided to frontline workers in contact with coronavirus patients.The UAE registered the Sinopharm vaccine after finding it had a 86% efficacy rate, paving the way for a full public use and allowing for a re-opening of the Gulf nation’s economy.Egypt plans to start the process of inoculation against the coronavirus after receiving the first shipments of Sinopharm vaccine. Peru has temporarily suspended trials of the vaccine after an unspecified “adverse event” was reported during a clinical trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-approves-china-s-sinopharm-coronavirus-vaccine/story-CWIxSituW34RUB7YYcaH0I.html
13-12-2020||World||First Covid-19 vaccines’ triumph raises hope for cancer fight||The first vaccines against Covid-19 aren’t just a landmark in the fight against the pandemic. They’re also the stepping stone for an unconventional technology that could one day defeat other ailments that have eluded doctors, from cancer to heart disease.The shots from Moderna Inc. and a partnership of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE use genetic material called messenger RNA to effectively transform the body’s own cells into vaccine factories. The approach had never been used outside of clinical experiments, and just how well it worked against the coronavirus stunned even some of its most enthusiastic backers.Now, with one vaccine vaccine having gained US clearance and the other close behind, the pandemic validation could wrench open a whole new field of medicine.“We are now entering the age of mRNA therapeutics,” said Derrick Rossi, a former Harvard University stem-cell biologist who helped found Moderna in 2010. “The whole world has seen this. There is going to be increased investment and increased resources.”In some ways, the global pandemic was the perfect proving ground for the new technology as deep-pocketed backers -- including Pfizer -- became more willing to take a risk. But the effort was only possible because BioNTech and Moderna Inc. had worked on messenger RNA for years.The technology instructs cells to make any type of protein, transforming them into tiny production lines for drugs or vaccines. One major drawback is that messenger RNA is fragile, and must reach cells before the body breaks it down. In the coronavirus vaccine, that’s done by using a modified form of mRNA and coating it with fatty nanoparticles.BioNTech’s chief executive officer, Ugur Sahin, began studying the technology in cancer some two decades ago with his wife, Ozlem Tureci, an immunologist who co-founded the company. Sahin says what his teams were able to move quickly on the Covid project by harnessing what they had learned from cancer-vaccine development.The resulting ability to assess multiple candidates in parallel was “really beautiful,” Sahin said in an interview.The cancer field might see its first messenger RNA drug approvals in two or three years, according to Sahin. Rossi meanwhile predicts that virtually all infectious-disease vaccines will use the technology in a decade or two, in part because it’s much faster and cheaper. The scientist still owns Moderna shares, but he is no longer affiliated with the company.All or NothingThere’s no guarantee they’re right. The risk of failure hangs over every scientific pursuit.But besides cancer, mRNA companies like Moderna, BioNTech, Translate Bio Inc. and others are working to harness the technology for flu vaccines, a heart failure treatment, cystic fibrosis, a common pathogen called cytomegalovirus, and perhaps the biggest challenge of all: HIV, which has eluded vaccine researchers for four decades.Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, recalls warning his wife when he left an established diagnostics company almost a decade ago that his new employer had less than a 5% chance of success. But if they did, he told her, the upside would be massive.“It is not going to be a one-drug company,” he recalled saying in a telephone interview. “Either we fail and it is zero, or we succeed and it is an industry.”One relatively quick win for messenger RNA could be better vaccines for seasonal flu. Influenza kills as many as 650,000 people each year, and existing vaccines are often only partly effective because production needs to start about six months early, based on health officials’ educated guesses about which strains are most likely to circulate at that point.The production could start later and involve less guesswork with mRNA. “If you got close to what the coronavirus vaccine is showing, that would be a major improvement,” said Matthias Kromayer, a partner at MIG AG, an early venture capital backer of BioNTech.And if people need periodic booster shots against Covid, the flu vaccines could be combined with a coronavirus booster to wipe out all winter respiratory viral worries in one shot, according to Moderna’s Bancel.More importantly, messenger RNA may help produce vaccines against viruses that have evaded conventional approaches. After Covid, Moderna’s most advanced program is a vaccine against cytomegalovirus, which can cause birth defects when passed from pregnant mother to unborn child. Scientists have been trying to develop a shot against this virus for 50 years, but Moderna believes mRNA technology gives it an edge. Early results from mid-stage trials are promising, and final-stage trials could begin next year.Big Pharma’s InterestThe company is also working on cancer vaccines with drugmaker Merck & Co. In a study with presented in November, a Moderna vaccine combined with Merck’s blockbuster immune drug Keytruda helped shrink tumors in 5 of 10 patients with of advanced head and neck cancer.Besides Merck, other big drugmakers from AstraZeneca Plc to Roche Holding AG are getting involved. There is no doubt that mRNA will be an important method going forward, according to Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive. Roche, one of the world’s biggest maker of oncology drugs, is working with BioNTech on developing personalized cancer vaccines.“The door is opened up here,” Schwan said in an interview. “It’s reconfirmed now via Covid-19, because this is real clinical data. That’s a good reason to further invest.”Besides Covid-19, though, almost all of the mRNA drugs and vaccines remain at early stages of human testing. And while the recent success may bode well for other infectious-disease vaccines, the implications in oncology are less clear because cancer has developed numerous defenses to evade the immune system.“We can’t just simply say that because we have seen the validation in the mRNA vaccine field, any other mRNA vaccine will also work,” says BioNTech’s Sahin. “Every approach has to address different biological and medical challenges.”Treating CancerMost of BioNTech’s research outside of Covid is focused on cancer. There, the idea is not to prevent disease but to treat it. The company is trying several different approaches, with a view to finding telltale sequences on a person’s tumor and coding mRNA to tell immune cells how to attack those tumor cells.The cash flow from the coronavirus vaccine success will enable the German biotech to push forward its patient trials in cancer as well. One of BioNTech’s cancer vaccines spurred strong responses and in some cases shrank tumors in patients with advanced melanoma in an 89-person trial published this summer. The first efficacy data from patient studies in cancer could come as soon as the end of next year or early in 2022, according to the CEO.BioNTech is also working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on an mRNA approach against HIV, which has eluded vaccine researchers so far because the virus is able to hide within cells. Human tests haven’t started yet on the project.Science FictionSome potential future uses sound a little like science fiction for now. BioNTech is doing early research into whether mRNA can be used to reprogram cells for regenerative medicine. In the future, scientists may also be able to designed targeted nanoparticles that accumulate in particular types of tissue such as bone marrow, said Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who helped develop mRNA technology used in both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. That could allow doctors to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia with a simple intravenous injection of targeted mRNA therapy.“It has enormous potential,” Weissman said. “I can’t even make a list of how many different things it could potentially be used for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-vaccines-triumph-raises-hope-for-cancer-fight/story-DKMRwqczGQmZT4aVQGwkpO.html
13-12-2020||World||Los Angeles mayor sounds alarm on rising Covid-19 deaths||In a metropolitan area where one in 20 people have been infected with Covid-19, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti presented another warning: they’re dying too.“This week, every 20 minutes someone in LA County is dying from Covid-19,” he said in a tweet, adding in a separate post that “our hospitals are running dangerously low on intensive care unit beds. It’s time for urgent action.”Los Angeles County, the most populous in the US with 10 million people, said Friday the number of infections surpassed 500,000. They increased by 11,476 to 512,872 on Saturday after rising by a record the day before.The county, also home to the highest number of infections and fatalities in the US, reported 70 new deaths, bringing the total to 8,269. Garcetti said a week ago that the total number of deaths could exceed 11,000 by the end of the year.The jump in cases came two weeks after millions traveled across the country for the Thanksgiving break, prompting county health officials to call the latest wave a “Thanksgiving surge.” The health department said it’s a “dangerous time” for its residents and warned that deaths are reaching an all-time high.Still, deaths as a percentage of cases at 1.6% is lower than the 1.9% national average, or 2.2% globally.Los Angeles is in week two of its second lockdown and is part of a region in California that has imposed more restrictions through the holiday season. Hospitalizations in the Golden State are at their highest since the start of outbreak, reducing the availability of intensive-care unit beds to a new low.While the city and county were among the first in the US to shut down non-essential businesses during the initial outbreak in March, along with other restrictions, enforcement remains a key obstacle in containing the spread.“Some people aren’t doing what we’re asking them to do, and I think the biggest problem we have right now is there’s so much transmission that when even just a small percentage of people are not taking sensible steps to protect themselves and protect others, it has a tremendous cascading impact” Barbara Ferrer, the county’s of public health, said on a call with reporters on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-mayor-sounds-alarm-on-rising-covid-19-deaths/story-kFuF702r84Ycru4w9s23cJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Sri Lanka records highest elephant deaths in world||Sri Lanka has recorded the highest number of elephant deaths in the world due to the human-elephant conflict, according to a media report. The island-nation’s Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) had ordered a special audit into the human-elephant conflict by renowned elephant expert Dr Prithviraj Fernando, the head of the Centre for Conservation and Research. In a meeting of the COPA held recently, it was also disclosed that Sri Lanka ranked number two globally after India where highest number of human deaths were reported due to the human-elephant conflict, according to Daily News. COPE Committee Chairman Tissa Vitarana said that in the past 12 months, the number of elephants killed in conflict with humans in Sri Lanka was 407 as against the previous annual average of 272. The number of people killed also increased from an average of 85 humans to 122 per year in the country. COPE Committee Chairman Vitarana and other members emphasised the need for the Wildlife Department and other relevant agencies to work together on a more efficient programme to resolve the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka, which has become a serious problem. He also said that despite 60 years of efforts to resolve the human-elephant conflict, no significant progress had been made and that a new approach was needed to find a solution. The COPA directed the Department of Wildlife Conservation to set up a National Coordinating Committee with all relevant institutions as soon as possible to reduce the human-elephant conflict. The Committee pointed out that although 4,211 km of elephant fences had been constructed by 2016 to control the human-elephant conflict, they had become inactive in a short period of time due to improper maintenance. Although Rs 86 million rupees is spent annually for the maintenance of the electric fences, the committee pointed out the need for the Wildlife Conservation Department to monitor whether this maintenance is being carried out on a daily basis, the daily said. The committee also pointed out that this maintenance should be done with the support of the people. The Committee also discussed that many constructions had to be halted due to protests by the people in some areas who thought that the construction of the fence was a boundary of their land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-records-highest-elephant-deaths-in-world/story-60fMgPggIBFNl5lKVVsVdL.html
13-12-2020||World||First trucks with Covid-19 vaccine in US get ready to roll out||The first trucks carrying a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use in the United States were set to pull out of a Michigan manufacturing plant Sunday, with the shots that are critical to stopping the nation’s coronavirus outbreak destined to reach states a day later.Shipments of the Pfizer vaccine will set in motion the biggest vaccination effort in American history at a critical juncture of the pandemic that has killed 1.6 million and sickened 71 million worldwide.Initially, about 3 million doses were expected to be sent out, and the priority is health care workers and nursing home residents as infections, hospitalizations and deaths soar in the US. With numbers likely to get worse over the holidays, the vaccine is offering a bright spot in the fight against the pandemic that’s killed nearly 300,000 Americans.Federal officials say the first shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine will be staggered, arriving in 145 distribution centers Monday, with an additional 425 sites getting shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday. The vaccine, co-developed by German partner BioNTech, is being doled out based on each state’s adult population.Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC has chosen staff who are critical to operating its facilities as among those getting the first round of vaccinations, said Dr. Graham Snyder, who led the center’s vaccine task force.“It’s very exciting. I will be thrilled, that moment when we administer our first dose,” Snyder said Saturday. “That will clearly be a watershed moment for us.”Snyder said the UPMC system estimates that half its employees are willing to get the vaccine as soon as it’s offered to them.The vaccine is heading to hospitals and other sites that can store it at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Pfizer is using containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled sensors to ensure each shipment stays colder than the weather in Antarctica.Doses should be delivered to all vaccination sites identified by states, such as local pharmacies, within three weeks, federal officials said.The 40-hospital Oschner Health System in Louisiana and Mississippi expects to receive more than 9,000 doses in the coming days, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, medical director of hospital quality.Employees approved for the first round are getting texts and emails directing them to schedule their initial injection, she said.“I would say there’s enthusiasm,” Kemmerly said Saturday. “There’s that thought that maybe they don’t have to be so afraid to come to work if they can be vaccinated and be immune.”The rollout will ensure there is enough vaccine to give people the two doses needed for full protection against Covid-19. That means the government is holding back 3 million doses to give those vaccinated in the first round a second shot a few weeks later.The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the vaccine Friday, saying it is highly protective and presents no major safety issues. While US regulators worked for months to emphasize the rigor and independence of their review, they faced political pressure until the final stages.Concerns that a shot was rushed out could undermine vaccination efforts in a country with deeply ingrained skepticism about vaccines. The head of the FDA said the agency’s decision was based on science, not politics, despite a White House threat to fire him if the vaccine wasn’t approved before Saturday.While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the UK are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA’s instructions tell providers not give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.Another vaccine by Moderna will be reviewed by an expert panel this week and soon afterward could be allowed for public use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-trucks-with-covid-19-vaccine-in-us-get-ready-to-roll-out/story-jOi3mLiXNnbz0EhdLC9I9K.html

No further details were immediately available.Faramarz also said that an Afghan government prosecutor was shot dead in eastern Kabul. The prosecutor was on his way to his office when he was attacked in Kart-e Now neighborhood, the police spokesman said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabul. The Islamic Sate group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on the capital in recent months, including horrific attacks on educational institutions that killed as many as 50 people, most of them students.The Sunday attacks happened as a day earlier the IS militants hit the capital with a barrage of mortar shells, killing at least one civilian and wounding a second, amid a countrywide spike in violence.The extremist group claimed responsibility on its affiliated Amaq News site, saying it fired 10 Katyusha rockets toward the capital’s Hamid Karzai International Airport.Three shells hit the airport, while the other rounds landed in residential areas of the city, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months even as the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators meet in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.The Taliban have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in IS strongholds in eastern Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-2-killed-in-magnetic-ied-blast-in-kabul/story-QxwIKoI2pEcwVBk6jvfYDN.html
13-12-2020||World||Pakistan opposition gears up for its sixth anti-government power show in Lahore||Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the country’s 11-party opposition alliance, is all geared up for holding its much-hyped power show at Minar-e-Pakistan, Lahore on Sunday, the last demonstration in the first phase of its anti-government rallies.The PDM is expected to announce the ‘decisive phase’ of its struggle against Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in the public gathering, reported Dawn.Ahead of the alliance’s Lahore rally, Pakistan’s federal government had adopted desperate measures to block the rally proceedings.Last week, PM Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of the government granting permission to the PDM for holding the anti-government rallies, warning that legal cases will be lodged against organisers.“We will file FIRs against everyone -- from the kursi wala to the sound system handlers but won’t stop them [Opposition leaders] from going there,” he said in an interview, Geo News reported.The Prime Minister also blamed the opposition of spreading Covid-19 in the country.Several political workers were booked and arrested ahead of the rally, while the PTI government flooded the Minar-e-Pakistan lawns in a ‘failed effort’ to stop the upcoming rally.The arrests were condemned by Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Latif Afridi and former president Syed Qalbe Hassan on Saturday and called for the immediate release of all PDM workers.Speaking on the release of water at the venue, Dawn quoted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz as saying in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”This is the first time in the recent history of the country that the PML-N is going to hold a public meeting at Minar-e-Pakistan, the first rally at this venue for the de-facto president of PML-N, Maryam Nawaz, Dawn reported.It will also be the first appearance of PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari at a political gathering in Lahore, who claimed that his party was fighting for democracy in Pakistan.“We will restore real democracy in Pakistan. We want the people to decide about the economic policy and other policies of the country. We want people to decide their future themselves. We will install a people’s government after dislodging this puppet and selected government. We will form a government which will fulfill the promises of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” Dawn quoted the PPP chairman.“No matter what the imposed regime of selected PM Khan does, Sunday’s public meeting will take place come what may,” said PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb.On Saturday, PML-N workers had reached Minar-e-Pakistan, broke the locks of its main gate and placed chairs and installed lights at its ground. Some PML-N leaders also visited the venue and oversaw the preparations.Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar asked the PDM to delay the Lahore rally in light of “terror threat alerts” and the persisting Covid-19 situation.The alliance has also reportedly planned a long march in February if the PTI government does not pay heed to the pressure exerted by the Opposition. However, there seems to be no consensus regarding the resignations from national and provincial assemblies, as Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) is reluctant to leave the Sindh government, according to Dawn.A senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said that the next phase of PDM’s struggle would begin in January where the PDM has planned 16 more rallies.The PDM has held five rallies in Multan, Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi and Quetta since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-gears-up-for-its-sixth-anti-government-power-show-in-lahore/story-i68UdagK40KWjScRjv24dJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping announces more commitments to back global climate actions||Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced further commitments by China for 2030 to contribute more to tackle the global climate challenge and called to pursue a new approach by the international community to climate governance highlighting green recovery, as the world marked the 5th anniversary of the historic Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing global warming. Addressing the Climate Ambition Summit via a video link on Saturday, Xi said that China has made important contributions to adopting the landmark Paris agreement and active efforts in its implementation. The summit was co-hosted by the United Nations, the United Kingdom and France in partnership with Chile and Italy, and brought together global climate leaders -- across governments, business and civil society -- to ramp up climate ambition and help deliver on the Paris Agreement. Referring to his announcement in September that China would scale up its nationally determined contributions and adopt more vigorous policies and measures, Xi announced China’s further commitments for 2030 to tackle the global climate challenge. According to the 2030 Climate Target Plan, the European Commission has proposed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, increasing the European Union’s ambition on reducing greenhouse gases and setting Europe on a responsible path to becoming climate neutral by 2050. Xi, in his address, said that China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 per cent from the 2005 level, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 per cent, increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The US and China are the top two polluters of the world. Chances for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change has brightened after US President-elect Joe Biden promised to implementing the Paris deal on the first day of his presidency, reversing President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of it. The US on November 4 this year formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced by Donald Trump in 2017. Xi said: “We will take solid steps to implement the targets just announced, and contribute even more to tackling the global climate challenge. China always honours its commitments”. The Chinese President also called on all the parties to close ranks and make new advances in climate governance that features win-win cooperation. “Only by upholding multilateralism, unity and cooperation can we deliver shared benefits and win-win results for all nations. China welcomes all countries’ support for the Paris Agreement and their greater contribution to tackling climate change,” he said. He said that following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, all countries need to maximise actions in light of their respective national circumstances and capabilities. Xi also stressed that developed countries need to scale up support for developing countries in financing, technology and capacity building adding that all parties to boost confidence and pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. He urged the international community to pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. Hailing the extensive international support to and participation in the implementation of the Paris Agreement since its adoption five years ago, Xi said the international landscape is evolving more rapidly, and Covid-19 is triggering deep reflections on the relationship between man and nature. The historic accord seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, the value that climate scientists have determined will have disastrous consequences if exceeded. The decision by the US -- which is the second leading producer of all carbon dioxide emissions globally after China -- to quit the agreement has led to condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-announces-more-commitments-to-back-global-climate-actions/story-w3VViq0yAoWQf7mh3NX7gK.html

13-12-2020||World||Lofty climate goals get reality check at global summit||Five years after the world signed the landmark Paris Agreement to avoid dangerous global warming, political momentum is building. But the lack of near-term detail means the planet is still on track for climate catastrophe.The six-hour Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday threw the problem into sharp relief: activists were eager for China to put some meat on the bones of its bold 2060 carbon neutrality pledge. They were disappointed. One country after another failed to raise the bar, as leaders offered only incremental steps.“As encouraging as all this ambition is, it is not enough,” said Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary who is also president of the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow next year, known as COP26.The underwhelming summit puts more pressure on President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to assert US leadership on climate change when he takes office -- starting with rejoining the Paris deal. As political and corporate leaders jostle to prove how progressive they are on the issue, the challenge is getting them to make specific, short-term commitments that back up their impressive sounding long-term goals.Countries’ level of ambition should increase between three- and five-fold to deliver on the Paris pledge to try and limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, according to the United Nations Emissions Gap Report.“We know we’re in a race -- be that a sprint or a marathon -- and what’s critical is momentum,” said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, and a former UN climate envoy. “We are not moving fast enough, but we are moving.”While greenhouse gas emissions will fall a record 7% this year as the pandemic hit economic activity, the dip will only result in a 0.01 degree Celsius reduction of global warming by 2050, the UN said.Biden wants to convene a summit within his first 100 days in office to convince some of the world’s biggest emitters to step up, and set a net-zero target for the U.S. for 2050. His plans mean that 70% of the world economy will have made commitments to be carbon neutral by 2050 or 2060. In the private sector, companies from asset managers to oil majors have set long-term targets to eliminate carbon emissions.The European Union and UK went into the summit with new emissions pledges in hand -- in the EU’s case after a diplomatic tussle. Some of the more ambitious pledges by 75 the nations and companies on Saturday included:The biggest challenge for Biden and the COP26 hosts ahead of the Glasgow summit will be convincing world leaders who champion fossil fuels to make a u-turn. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, and Australia were not invited to speak on Saturday after the UK and their co-hosts France decided they hadn’t come forward with bold enough pledges.Until Friday, Brazil’s government had been preparing for President Jair Bolsonaro to speak and did not expect his name to be left off the agenda, two people familiar with the matter said. Their surprise underscores how wide an expectation gap still remains between climate-aligned countries and laggards who have so far been able to avoid too much scrutiny on the international stage.Brazil’s environment ministry said this week it set a new goal to zero out carbon dioxide emissions by 2060 or sooner -- if it can raise $10 billion a year from other countries.Even after new pledges, rich countries risk failing to meet a target set five years ago to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor nations deal with the worst impacts of climate change. And at home, funds aren’t being deployed as well as they could be, according to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.“So far, the members of the G-20 are spending 50% in their stimulus and rescue packages on sectors linked to fossil fuel production and consumption, than on low-carbon energy,” he said. “This is unacceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lofty-climate-goals-get-reality-check-at-global-summit/story-g5DaRVOIcd0NDaro0txgzH.html

We’ve been planning for months with daily calls, drilling down to really quite minute details,” said Wes Wheeler, president of the company’s health care division, in an interview on Saturday.“You have two fierce rivals here, and competitors, in FedEx and UPS, who literally are teaming up to get this delivered,” said Richard Smith, a FedEx executive, to the Senate’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety on Thursday.Both companies said the shipments would be closely tracked and monitored, and would be given priority over other packages. To ship its vaccine, Pfizer designed specialized containers packed with enough dry ice to keep a minimum of 975 doses cool for up to 10 days. Each comes with a tracking device, according to The New York Times.This comes after the FDA authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday for the prevention of coronavirus disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.“The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, MD.The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was first approved in the United Kingdom, then in countries Canada, United States, and Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ups-fedex-collaborate-to-ship-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-in-us/story-dPkJr3w9UhOYqbuMF764SK.html
13-12-2020||World||Tempers flare as Trump supporters rally in Washington||Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump returned to Washington for weekend rallies to back his desperate efforts to subvert the election that he lost to Joe Biden.Sporadic fights broke out between pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrators after sundown Saturday. WRC-TV reported that four people were taken to a hospital with stab wounds, and the Metropolitan Police Department told the station that 23 people were arrested.The gatherings of mostly unmasked Trump loyalists were intended as a show of force just two days before the Electoral College meets to formally elect Biden as the 46th president. Trump, whose term will end January 20, refuses to concede, while clinging to baseless claims of fraud that have been rejected by state and federal courts, and Friday by the Supreme Court.Trump tweeted his apparent surprise Saturday morning at the rallies, publicly known for weeks: “Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn’t know about this, but I’ll be seeing them! #MAGA”Trump left the White House around midday for the trip to the Army-Navy football game at the US Military Academy in West Point, New York. As the Marine One helicopter passed over a rally on the National Mall, cheers went up.Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser recently pardoned by Trump, was speaking from the stage at the time.“That’s pretty cool. Imagine just being able to jump in a helicopter and just go for a joy ride around Washington,” said Flynn, whose pardon wiped away his conviction for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation.At a pro-Trump demonstration in Washington a month ago, Trump thrilled supporters when he passed by in his motorcade en route to his Virginia golf club.That demonstration, which drew 10,000 to 15,000 people to the capital, ended late in the evening with scattered clashes between Trump’s loyalists and local activists near Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House.On Saturday, police took more steps to keep the two sides apart, closing a wide swath of downtown to traffic and sealing off Black Lives Matter Plaza.But while Saturday’s rallies, including one on Freedom Plaza downtown, were smaller than on Nov. 14, they drew a larger contingent of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group known to incite street violence. Some wore bulletproof vests as they marched through town.The group saw its profile raised after Trump in September famously told them to “stand back and stand by.”After the rallies ended, downtown Washington quickly devolved into crowds of hundreds of Proud Boys and combined forces of Antifa and local Black activists — both sides seeking a confrontation in an area flooded with police officers. As dusk fell, they faced off on opposite sides of a street, with multiple lines of city police and federal Park Police, some in riot gear, keeping them separated.One Proud Boy yelled out, “You cops can’t be everywhere!” The Proud Boys later dispersed.Antifa activists also were more organized this time, with their own bicycle corps to form bike walls to match those of the police.Earlier in the day, a group of about 50 men in the Proud Boys’ black and yellow circled the perimeter of Black Lives Matter Plaza, where about 200 anti-Trump demonstrators were rallying.They chanted vulgar slogans and at one point started singing “Jingle Bells.” They were apparently under orders not to engage with hecklers. One man who was talking back to people was yelled at and told “Don’t interact!”The assembly on the National Mall, called the “Jericho March,” was described on its website as a “prayer rally” with speakers “praying for the walls of corruption and election fraud to fall down.”The rally on Freedom Plaza also featured a series of speakers pushing debunked claims of election fraud to a receptive audience.Sylvia Huff, a demonstrator who came from Gloucester, Virginia, to show her support for Trump, said the legal defeats hadn’t shaken her belief that he won the election.“I believe the courts were on the take, too,” she said. The Supreme Court, where three of the nine justices were appointed by Trump, “was just afraid of a political backlash,” she said.Among the speakers was Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump adviser, who urged demonstrators not to give up even after Friday’s Supreme Court decision. He said he wanted to send Trump a video and held up his phone, cueing the flag-waving crowd to chant “Stop the Steal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tempers-flare-as-trump-supporters-rally-in-washington/story-47kdnwiE2xxlomkqKBgaqI.html

A message seeking comment was left at a number listed for Casillo. Online records did not list a lawyer who could speak on her behalf.Bystander video showed a black BMW sedan suddenly accelerating as protesters gathered around the vehicle around 4 p.m. Friday near 39th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan. One person appeared to be leaning over the front of the car.Tom Ella, who shot the video, said he heard the engine roar and saw the car accelerating.“Just watching them actually hit people, it’s traumatizing, it’s horrifying,” Ella said.Protester Sofia Vickerman, of Denver, Colorado, said people and a bicycle were tossed in the air.Six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals with injuries that officials said did not appear to be life-threatening.Casillo, of Rockaway Park, Queens, remained at the scene. She was taken into custody and questioned, police said.Another woman, whom police described as a protester, was arrested for interfering with ambulance workers at the scene, police said.Nicolle Besuden, 32, of Manhattan, was charged with disorderly conduct and obstruction of governmental administration.Besuden was also released with a notice to appear in court at a later date.She called the allegations “false and incredibly damaging” and referred to an account of the incident from the injured protester she was helping, who said Besuden was providing care and comfort before EMTs arrived and that her arrest was uncalled for.The protest march started in Times Square and was aimed at drawing attention to an ongoing hunger strike by immigration detainees at a jail in New Jersey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plows-into-manhattan-protesters-driver-arrested/story-VBbRgFRdJDJN7Eb3ChaXBJ.html
13-12-2020||World||Huawei’s role in developing surveillance products including ‘Uyghur alarm’, sparks international outcry||The revelation this week of Huawei’s role in testing artificial intelligence surveillance technology, which includes a face-scanning camera system that can send an “Uyghur alarm” to police after detecting a member of the group, has sparked an international outcry against one of China’s most valuable tech companies.Washington Post reported that despite the company’s claims that it is committed to human rights at the highest level, Huawei has worked with dozens of security contractors to develop surveillance products, some of which are said to be able to identify a person’s ethnicity and help suppress potential protests, according to company marketing documents.The international backlash included a French soccer star, Antoine Griezmann, who publicly ended his work as a Huawei brand ambassador and urged the company to ‘condemn this mass repression’.Meanwhile, Huawei representatives refuted the allegations, saying that the document outlining the “Uyghur alarm”, used language that is “completely unacceptable”.“It is not compatible with the values of Huawei... Our technologies are not designed to identify ethnic groups,” said a representative.However, products made by Huawei with four other partner companies were also advertised to have ethnicity-tracking capabilities, according to Chinese language marketing materials posted on a public Huawei website where the material could be downloaded by anyone who registered an account. After Washington Post approached Huawei for comment, the site briefly became inaccessible, and the number of product collaborations detailed on the site had dropped from over 2,000 to 38, after returning.“We take the allegations in the Washington Post’s article very seriously and are investigating the issues raised within,” a Huawei spokesperson said in a statement to The Post.Huawei and its partners have provided some of the surveillance products to authorities in China’s Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have detained thousands of Uyghur Muslims, in an attempt to control and assimilate the ethnic minority group through a mass ‘re-education’ campaign.Among the surveillance products was a facial recognition system used by police in the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi, and a highway surveillance camera system for the region, according to documents from Huawei’s website.The company’s partnerships reflect the ongoing expansion of surveillance in China, where top officials have called for police to use big data to fight crime, under the slogan, “One Person, One File,” a phrase signifying the use of disparate information streams, from surveillance footage to Internet chat history, to better track individuals, reported Washington Post.Jerome Cohen, a veteran China human rights legal expert, said racial profiling and discrimination are prevalent in China. The country’s government is “engaging in racial profiling on a massive scale,” he said.Marketing materials for products co-developed by Huawei with DeepGlint, Bresee and Maiyuesoft also mention ethnicity identification or search features. The three companies did not respond to requests for comment.Classified documents known as the China Cables, accessed last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, threw light on how the Chinese government uses technology to control Uyghur Muslims worldwide.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training, while people in the internment camps have described being subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and denial of food and medicine, and say they have been prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-s-role-in-developing-surveillance-products-including-uyghur-alarm-sparks-international-outcry/story-ED2947LjmwUXsZgkmzXKPL.html
13-12-2020||World||Donald Trump loses Wisconsin case while arguing another one||President Donald Trump lost a federal lawsuit Saturday while his attorney was arguing his case before a skeptical Wisconsin Supreme Court in another lawsuit that liberal justices said “smacks of racism” and would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters only in the state’s most diverse counties.US District Judge Brett Ludwig dismissed Trump’s federal lawsuit asking the court to order the Republican-controlled Legislature to name Trump the winner over Democrat Joe Biden.The judge said Trump’s arguments “fail as a matter of law and fact.”The ruling came as Trump’s attorney in a state case faced a barrage of questions about his claims from both liberal and conservative justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.Trump is trying to overturn his loss to Biden in the state by disqualifying more than 221,000 votes in Wisconsin’s two most heavily Democratic counties. Trump is not challenging any votes in counties he won.“This lawsuit, Mr. Troupis, smacks of racism,” Justice Jill Karofsky said to Trump’s attorney Jim Troupis early in his arguments. “I do not know how you can come before this court and possibly ask for a remedy that is unheard of in U.S. history. ... It is not normal.”Justice Rebecca Dallet, like Karofsky another liberal justice, questioned why Trump didn’t raise his same concerns about the absentee ballot process in the 2016 election that he won in Wisconsin. Troupis said Trump was not an aggrieved party that year.Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley questioned how the court could reject more than 28,000 ballots of people who said they were indefinitely confined given that it would include people who properly claimed that status.Wisconsin’s highest court agreed to take the case at Trump’s urgent request Friday, soon after a state judge ruled against him and with Monday’s Electoral College vote bearing down and the state’s 10 electoral votes about to go to Biden.The court is controlled 4-3 by conservatives, but its willingness to take the case isn’t necessarily an indicator of how it will rule. The court previously refused to hear the case before it went through lower courts, and a majority of justices have openly questioned whether the remedy Trump seeks is appropriate.Trump sought to have more than 221,000 ballots disqualified in Dane and Milwaukee counties. He wanted to disqualify absentee ballots cast early and in-person, saying there wasn’t a proper written request made for the ballots; absentee ballots cast by people who claimed “indefinitely confined” status; absentee ballots collected by poll workers at Madison parks; and absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on ballot envelopes.The circuit judge on Friday ruled that none of Trump’s arguments had merit and that state law was followed during the election and subsequent recount.Biden won Wisconsin by about 20,600 votes, a margin of 0.6% that withstood a Trump-requested recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties.Trump and his allies have suffered dozens of defeats in Wisconsin and across the country in lawsuits that rely on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud and election abuse. On Friday evening, the US Supreme Court rejected a Texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate Biden’s win by throwing out millions of votes in four battleground states, including Wisconsin.Also Saturday, former Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell asked the US Supreme Court to hear a federal case she lost in Wisconsin seeking to order the GOP-controlled Legislature to declare Trump the winner. Powell has also lost similar cases in Georgia and Arizona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-loses-wisconsin-case-while-arguing-another-one/story-Ntv1nz1WK6Q4ozeh6Z34UK.html

Pannun was designated a terrorist by India in July.There have been reports that Khalistanis have tried to inject their separatist agenda into the farmers’ protests to further their own cause, and not to help the protesters. Earlier this month, Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu raised alarm over “Khalistani elements (who) have penetrated the ongoing protests”.Farmers are protesting new laws that seek to reform the farm sector and allow large corporation to bypass government-regulated procurement markets. They fear these reforms could take away the minimum support price (MSP) guaranteed to them by the government on their yields.The Indian embassy issued a statement in this regard. “Strongly condemns this mischievous act by hooligans masquerading as protesters against the universally respected icon of peace and justice,” the statement read.The statement added that the embassy had also lodged a “strong protest” with US law enforcement agencies and taken it up with the State Department and has sought an “early investigation and action against the culprits under the applicable law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalistanis-target-gandhi-statue-in-washington-dc/story-zmuDrN3HQfZqNvCveHZ7kL.html
13-12-2020||World||Brazil govt releases Covid-19 pandemic vaccination plan with holes||Brazil’s government has presented a Supreme Court justice with a coronavirus immunization plan that provides initially for only enough shots for about a quarter of the population and does not indicate a start date.The document, which was made public Saturday, was submitted by President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration the previous night to judge Ricardo Lewandoswki, who had ordered the report after an opposition political party filed a lawsuit seeking information on the government’s immunization plans for the pandemic.The plan calls for the government to provide immunization shots for priority groups that amount to about 51 million people, just under 25% of Brazil’s 212 million people. The first of four phases for vaccinating those groups include health workers, people older than 80 and Indigenous peoples.Signed by the health minister Eduardo Pazuello, the document says, however, that “the interruption of the circulation of Covid-19 in the national territory depends on a highly effective vaccine” being administered to more than 70% of the population.No date is given for starting to give out immunization shots. Brazil’s health regulator, Anvisa, has not yet approved the use of any coronavirus vaccine in the country.In addition, the plan says that to avoid the collapse of Brazil’s health services, it may be necessary to “maintain social distancing measures for 1 to 2 years” — the type of pandemic restriction that often criticized by Bolsonaro, who argues that economic damage from lockdowns and other pandemic strictures will cause more harm to the country than the illnesses and deaths from the virus.Bolsonaro, who recovered from Covid-19 earlier this year and has said he will not make immunization mandatory, has been the target of criticism from several Brazilian state governors and health experts over what they consider delay by the federal government in organizing an immunization plan.Brazil has registered more than 180,000 deaths from Covid-19, the second highest number in the world. In recent weeks it has seen an acceleration in the rate of coronavirus infections and several states report occupancy of hospitals’ intensive care beds above 80%.Bolsonaro, meanwhile, said Thursday at an official ceremony that Brazil is experiencing “the end of the pandemic.”Accusing the government of foot-dragging, Sao Paulo Gov. Joao Doria already unveiled an immunization plan of his own for his state that has a goal of beginning vaccinations on Jan. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-govt-releases-covid-19-pandemic-vaccination-plan-with-holes/story-76USrxxrpvMLDB6YppNqDP.html
13-12-2020||World||Israelis maintain anti-Netanyahu protests in wintry weather||A few thousand Israelis protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding that he resign in the face of corruption charges and the pandemic. Some 2,000 people demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. The size of the crowds has shrunk in recent weeks with the arrival of wintry weather. Protesters held signs reading “Go” and “Everyone is equal under the law.” They also carried an inflatable submarine, alluding to a USD 2 billion purchase of German submarines that critics allege Netanyahu was implicated in. The protesters say Netanyahu must resign because of the corruption charges against him, saying he has lost the public’s trust and can’t properly manage the country under charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing on all charges, which revolve around a series of scandals involving media moguls and billionaire associates. His trial is set to begin evidentiary hearings early next year. The protests have been a nuisance for Netanyahu, who has seen his popularity plummet during the coronavirus outbreak, with Israel on the verge of what may be a third national lockdown with cases again trending upward. With Israel appearing to be headed toward its fourth national election in two years, the long-serving Netanyahu may be banking on recently arrived vaccines to give him a boost in the polls. Opinion polls show that if the election were held today his Likud Party would emerge as the largest in parliament. But it would be weaker than today and challenged by a new party set to enter the fray that is led by a former Likud lawmaker calling for Netanyahu’s rule to end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-maintain-anti-netanyahu-protests-in-wintry-weather/story-XsGutPq18M787HE6d6MyzL.html

But following the latest development, they would set aside the application and reformulate it for another occasion by the end of the year.The 17-page filing, obtained by the Post, was submitted to West Kowloon Court where Lai was charged with one count of colluding with foreign powers, an offence under the national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June.According to prosecutors, Lai called for overseas countries to “voice out and take action” over Beijing’s suppression in a tweet tagging United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, even after the national security law came into force. In another tweet, he urged the US to “be lenient” towards young Hongkongers seeking asylum in the country.US Defence Secretary Michael Pompeo slammed China for charging Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai under the draconian National Security Law and demanded that charges must be dropped.Pompeo further went on to accuse the Chinese Communist Party of its authoritarian rule and making a mockery of the justice in the region.“Hong Kong’s National Security Law makes a mockery of justice. @JimmyLaiApple’s only “crime” is speaking the truth about the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarianism and fear of freedom. Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately,’ Pompeo tweeted.In August 2020, the tycoon was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-denied-bail-after-being-charged-with-national-security-law/story-ZDnFTJWREmGYeR6SJzxadI.html

One man who was talking back to people was yelled at and told “Don’t interact!” The assembly on the National Mall, called the “Jericho March,” was described on its website as a “prayer rally” with speakers “praying for the walls of corruption and election fraud to fall down.” The rally on Freedom Plaza also featured a series of speakers pushing debunked claims of election fraud to a receptive audience. Sylvia Huff, a demonstrator who came from Gloucester, Virginia, to show her support for Trump, said the legal defeats hadn’t shaken her belief that he won the election. “I believe the courts were on the take, too,” she said. The Supreme Court, where three of the nine justices were appointed by Trump, “was just afraid of a political backlash,” she said. Among the speakers was Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump adviser, who urged demonstrators not to give up even after Friday’s Supreme Court decision. He said he wanted to send Trump a video and held up his phone, cueing the flag-waving crowd to chant “Stop the Steal.” The organizers of this rally seemed intent on avoiding confrontations, telling demonstrators ahead of time to avoid certain hotels and marking off large chunks of downtown Washington as a “no-go zone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-helicopter-buzzes-supporters-rallying-in-washington/story-rMj7Z0cZ1c60OQ6T43TjPK.html

Post the desecration, an expert was called in to refurbish the Gandhi statue.The statue was vandalised with graffiti and spray painting, prompting the Indian mission to register a complaint with the local law enforcement agencies. The desecrated statue of Gandhi, the design of which was created by Gautam Pal, was later covered and the site has been cleaned up.The Indian Embassy in the US had then registered cases with the Metropolitan Police and the National Park police. The matter was reported immediately to the State Department and Deputy Secretary of State had called the Indian ambassador to address the issue. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun had apologised for the incident. Biegun had a month later inaugurated the refurbished Mahatma Gandhi statue along with the Indian envoy to the United States Taranjit Singh Sandhu.Those who believe in status quo can’t make history: Narendra Singh TomarThe statue was dedicated by former Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on September 16, 2000, during his state visit to the US, in the presence of the then US president Bill Clinton.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for the last 17 days at the borders of Delhi against three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-farm-law-activists-deface-mahatma-gandhi-statue-in-washington-khalistani-flags-sighted/story-CArC9T277wjsGX0sm6aDiL.html

German Malaga, chief researcher at the local Cayetano Heredia University, which is involved with the study, said one volunteer had experienced decreased strength in his legs among other symptoms.Meanwhile, China has put one northern city in lockdown and launched citywide coronavirus testing in another, after two local infections involving workers at a port and trade zone respectively, authorities have said. There was one new case each in Dongning and Suifenhe, which both sit on the country’s border with Russia. Officials there said on Saturday it would enter “wartime mode” - temporarily suspending public bus services and road transport, while requiring anyone leaving the city to produce a negative Covid-19 test from the preceding 24 hours.Japan saw more than 3,000 new infections of the novel coronavirus for the first time in one day on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported, while South Korea has reported another 950 cases, its largest daily increase since the emergence of the pandemic, as fears grow about overwhelmed hospitals in the greater capital area.President Moon Jae-in in a Facebook message apologised for his government’s failure to contain the outbreak despite months of measures that hurt the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-vaccine-test-halted-due-to-serious-event/story-ElHVYdlZtywuEfzOYoOxkK.html

Long lines of riot officers and police vehicles with blue lights flashing escorted Saturday’s march through rain-slickened streets in Paris. They hemmed in protesters, seeking to prevent the flare-up of violence that marked many previous demonstrations.A police water cannon doused demonstrators at the end of the march, as night fell.Marchers were protesting against a proposed security law that has sparked successive weekends of demonstrations and against a draft law aimed at combating Islamist radicalism.The security bill’s most contested measure could make it more difficult to film police officers. It aims to outlaw the publication of images with intent to cause harm to police. Critics fear it could erode media freedom and make it more difficult to expose police brutality. The provision caused such an uproar that the government has decided to rewrite it.Slogans on placards carried by marchers in Paris said “I will never stop filming” and “Camera equals mutilation?”There were also protests in other cities. In Lyon, in the southeast, authorities reported five arrests among people they said attacked police and sought to loot shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-arrested-at-paris-protest-over-security-bill/story-OaXXbzbeJa0JCnPdJStKSM.html
13-12-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine D-Day arrives with 2.9 million doses set for delivery in US||The first Covid-19 vaccine arrived in record time, an essential initial step toward ending the pandemic. Now comes the hard part: producing enough shots to immunize the majority of the US population and then getting them into everyone’s arms by next summer.If successful, the plan could help end a pandemic that’s killed almost 300,000 Americans in the 47 weeks since the first case was recorded. On Saturday, Gustave Perna, the army general who serves as chief operating officer for Operation Warp Speed, said the first doses of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine will be delivered on Monday, and that all of the initial delivery is expected to be completed in all 50 states by Wednesday.It’s an enormous undertaking that’s already been marked by confusion and uncertainty. As late as Friday, some states were saying they weren’t sure how many doses they’ll get. There have also been questions about whether the U.S. has ordered enough shots to meet its ambitious distribution schedule moving into 2021.“We are not taking a victory lap,” Perna said in a news briefing Saturday. “We know that the road ahead of us will be tough. We know that situations will occur, but we will figure it out together, collectively, a whole-of-America approach to solve the problems.”Perna, dressed in battle fatigues and speaking alone without any preamble from political appointees, compared the moment to D-Day, the Allied invasion of France that marked the turning point in Europe in World War II. “D-Day was the beginning of the end,” he said. “And that’s where we are today.”The Pfizer shot -- and a similar vaccine from Moderna Inc. that’s just a week away from a decision on emergency authorization -- will be in short supply initially.Only 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be delivered in the first shipment, a fraction of what’s needed to vaccinate health-care workers and nursing home residents, who are atop the priority list. Another 2.9 million are being held back to ensure that the second dose will be available for people who get the first round. Additionally, half a million are being held as an emergency reserve.The government is holding up the second dose “just until we have ultimate confidence, and we’ve built up stocks to ensure that we can get the American people a second dose,” Perna said, adding that he expects that both doses could start to be sent out together in mid-January or February.“Make no mistake,” Perna added, “distribution has begun,” with 40 million doses available by the end of the month if Moderna’s vaccine is authorized alongside Pfizer’s. “Right now, boxes are being packed and loaded with vaccine,” he said, with the shots set to start rolling out from manufacturing to distribution hubs on Sunday.Pfizer’s vaccines will be delivered directly to individual facilities identified by the states, Perna said, with 145 sites set to receive the Pfizer vaccine on Monday, 425 on Tuesday and the final 66 sites on Wednesday. He said all states now know how much vaccine they will get.The vaccines weren’t prepositioned, he added, because the operation did not want to begin moving the shots before the US Food and Drug Administration approved emergency authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech shot late Friday.‘Only Goal’Each week that follows, “we will have more doses ready for allocation and distribution,” Perna said. “We know that we are not done. We are not done until every American has access to the vaccine, until every American that wants it receives it. This is our only goal.”Many states plan to simultaneously deliver shots to front-line health-care workers and long-term health care facilities, he added.In Virginia, Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer at Riverside Health System, woke around 3 a.m. Saturday to check whether the FDA had issued Pfizer’s emergency use authorization. She went to sleep before Friday night’s announcement and started working once she saw the news.Williams read the order and the informational materials that accompanied it so she could finalize the documents Riverside plans to print Monday ahead of its test run. “It’s almost that final, final preparation,” she said.Shots on WednesdayRiverside plans to use Monday’s test to ensure it’s ready. As of now, Riverside expects to start vaccinating workers on Wednesday.The health system ordered one container filled with three trays each holding 975 doses, meaning the system of about 10,000 employees should be able to give 2,925 workers the first shot of the two-dose regimen in the coming week. The shipment will arrive at one hospital and two trays will stay there. The third will be split up into smaller quantities and shared among Riverside’s other facilities.Kits filled with supplies needed to administer the vaccine, including needles and syringes, arrived from McKesson Corp. on Thursday, Williams said.Operation Warp Speed aims to have enough doses to inoculate 20 million Americans by the end of December, 50 million by the end of January, and 100 million total by the end of March. Alex Azar, the US Health and Human Services Department chief, has said there will be enough supply for any American who wants a vaccine by the end of the third quarter of 2021.As other vaccines encountered problems, however, it has placed more pressure on the US to vaccinate larger swaths of their population with the two messenger RNA vaccines that have shown the best results -- the Pfizer vaccine and a similar one from Moderna Inc. that is likely to be cleared next week.Because mRNA has never been used in an approved product, mass scale production is just gearing up now, and it is uncertain how quickly mRNA vaccine makers can meet the demands of the world.Ongoing TrialsLarge scale US trials of two other vaccines, from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc are ongoing. But those vaccines aren’t likely to hit the US market until around February. Meanwhile, late stage trials of vaccines using more standard technology -- from both Novavax Inc. and another from Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline PLC -- have been delayed.The US already has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough for 50 million people, but the two sides have been wrangling over how quickly when the US can get more. Pfizer has indicated that it will honor commitments to many other countries.On Friday, the US government exercised an option to order 100 million additional doses of the Moderna vaccine, in addition to the 100 million doses it had previously contracted for. The additional doses will start arriving in April.Adult PopulationOperation Warp Speed has said the doses will be allocated to states according to their share of the adult population. Officials haven’t publicly detailed how many doses each state will get. Many states have published estimates of how many they expect. In most that have, the number expected in initial shipments amounts to about 1% of their adult populations.Pennsylvania’s allotment “is still fluid,” Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said in an email late Friday afternoon. The Oregon Health Authority described a “rapidly changing situation” with several different estimates of vaccine allocations provided by the federal government in the last week.“We know we will continue to adjust our numbers as new information about shipments becomes available,” spokesman Jonathan Modie said in an email Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-d-day-arrives-with-2-9-million-doses-set-for-delivery-in-us/story-YDRBehxui0pe9jSr1ZqmoM.html

Naravane holds talks with Royal Saudi Land Forces Commander on defence cooperation||Indian Army chief General M M Naravane on Sunday discussed issues of bilateral defence cooperation with Commander of the Royal Saudi Land Forces General Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir during his historic visit to the Gulf Kingdom.Gen Naravane, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on the second leg of his two-nation visit that included the United Arab Emirates, is the first-ever head of the Indian Army to travel to the two strategically important Gulf countries.“COAS discussed issues of bilateral defence cooperation with General Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir, Commander Royal Saudi Land Forces,” the Indian Army’s Additional Directorate General of Public Information said in a tweet on Sunday.He also received a Guard of Honour at headquarters of the Royal Saudi Land Forces.Earlier, Gen Naravane visited the UAE where he discussed bilateral defence cooperation and issues of mutual interest with the UAE’s Commander of the Land Forces Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri.His visit is seen as a reflection of India’s growing strategic ties with the two countries and is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere.Gen Naravane’s visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel’s relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran’s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.Ahead of his visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Army said in a statement in New Delhi that “During the visit, he will be meeting his counterparts and senior military leadership of these countries.

Tharoor joined the protest held by the party MPs from Punjab at Jantar Mantar here on Sunday.Speaking to ANI, Tharoor said, “The Government has failed the nation and the farmers. Why did they pass the laws in such haste without consulting the stakeholders?”“The winter session should have taken place normally by the 3rd week of November,” added Tharoor. When asked what is the way forward, the Congress MP said, “I think that the government now should give some assurances to the farmers. The farmers are insisting that the laws be withdrawn. If technically they (government) feel they can suspend its application for now pending discussions, let them suspend it, convene Parliament winter session. The Parliament has the authority to withdraw the laws, they can also talk to the unions.”“The government should realise that in democracy, you cannot bulldoze your way through. We stand here for democracy and rights for the people,” he added.

The month of March had Mullakal’s photo, displaying his date of birth and other details. When contacted, a spokesman of the diocese refused to comment. The trial against the former bishop, who is accused of raping a nun, is in final stages. “It shows the attitude of church authorities. Last year also his photo appeared on the calendar. When protests took place, authorities said his photo will be taken out next year. But it was again repeated this year. It was deliberate,” said convener of the State Our Sisters (SOS) K Riju. SOS was formed in the wake of a protest against Mullakal two years ago. Copies of the calendar were burnt in Kollam, Pala and Kottayam, said church reformers. They asked church authorities not to glorify the rape accused any more. They alleged that a prominent section of the clergy still supported the deposed bishop. The case against Mullkal surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun, also a mother superior, had complained to the police in Kottayam that Mullakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. But Mullakkal denied her allegations, saying he was framed after he took action against her for financial irregularities at the convent. Later the special investigation team of Kerala police arrested him after several rounds of questioning. He was removed from the post of bishop later. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year and he reportedly made several attempts to delay the trial. His petition seeking to quash charges against him was dismissed by the Supreme Court in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-accused-ex-bishop-franco-mullakal-on-church-calendar-protests-follow/story-76MKnEd6kn0lG8yq45e2QN.html

UPPL chief Pramod Boro will become the new BTC chief, said Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Sunday, after a crucial meeting held among representatives of the three political parties. After the declaration of the results, he said the coalition - the UPPL, the GSP and the BJP - will stake claim to run the Council.Soon after the announcement, BJP minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted, “A New dawn in BTR. “ Earlier in the day, BJP national president JP Nadda tweeted, “Congratulations to UPPL, NDA partner and Sarbanda Sonowal (Assam chief minister), to getting majority in Assam BTC election.

The agency said Rouf Shareef, national secretary of Campus Front, received more than Rs 2 crore in his three bank accounts from west Asian countries and was using the same to fund unrest in the country. The ED was allowed two-week custody of Shareef by a court in Kochi. Shareef was arrested from Thiruvananthapuram airport on Saturday following a tipoff from intelligence agencies. The Uttar Pradesh police had also issued a lookout notice against him on November 18 for allegedly funding unrest in Hathras. The ED said he was planning to flee the country and evaded summons a couple of times on the pretext of coronavirus pandemic. The UP police said he was in frequent touch Atiq-ur-Rehman and AP Masood and funded their trip to Hathras, where a 19-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped and cremated in the dead of the night bythe state police. Hailing from Kerala, both were arrested when they were planning to visit Hathras along with journalist Siddiq Kappan. A police team from UP is expected to question him in a couple of days. When Rouf Shareef was taken to his home in Anchal in Kollam district (south Kerala), Campus Front workers staged a protest and tried to block the ED vehicle carrying him. Later more police personnel reached the spot to remove protesters. Campus Front leaders said he was arrested for supporting the ongoing farmers’ strike and intelligence agencies were being used to silence dissenters. Two weeks ago, the ED had carried out a nationwide raid on offices and residences of top leaders of the Popular Front of India (PFI). The PFI, a radical outfit, is often considered as an offshoot of the banned Students’ Islamic Front of India (SIMI). When Muslim cleric Abdul Nasser Madani, an accused in Bangalore and Coimbatore blast cases, founded the Islamic Seva Sangh on the lines of RSS after Babri mosque demolition, many joined it. Later when Madani was in jail in connection with Coimbatore blasts, these leaders formed the National Development Front. Later it merged with Manitha Neethi Passarai of Tamil Nadu and Forum for Dignity, a Karnataka-based outfit, to form the Popular Front of India (PFI). Now the PFI claims that it has units in 22 states. Most of its frontline leaders are from Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-youth-party-leader-of-popular-front-of-india-funding-unrest-ed/story-5BKnPORTW0c4vEBNPwihiI.html
13-12-2020||India||‘Opposition trying to destabilize nation through farmers’ stir’: Yogi Adityanath||Coming down heavily on opposition parties, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday blamed them for hatching a conspiracy to destabilise the country through farmers’ movement and cautioned the farmers to be alert against such elements. Addressing a gathering in Meerut on the premises of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture, after inaugurating its library and laying down foundation stones of different projects, CM Yogi targeted the opposition parties extending support to farmers’ movement and said, “They (opposition parties) are those who don’t want development of the country, the poor and the farmers. They are attempting to destabilise the country by training their guns on farmers’ movement.“ The CM’s programme was scheduled to start at 11 am at the agriculture university but his helicopter could not land due to rough weather and returned to Ghaziabad. He then arrived at the university by road which delayed the programme by more than two hours. He said that the opposition parties were upset because PM Narendra Modi was taking the country forward. “They were conspiring because the government ensured payment of sugarcane to farmers. They were receiving money in their bank accounts and getting benefits of many welfare schemes, including crop insurance.” He said that the state government had announced to construct additional lane on Hanga canal and allocated a budget of Rs 600 crore for the project. He further said that Meerut was being connected to Delhi through regional railway project of Rs 32,000 crore. Also read: Delhi-Jaipur highway partially opened amid farmers’ protestThe CM reiterated that the poor and the farmers were on the priority of the Prime Minister but a few people were conspiring because Section 370 was abolished in Kashmir, issue of Ram Temple was resolved in Ayodhya and income of middlemen who used to exploit farmers, had been stopped. The chief minister accused the opposition parties of demanding the release of those who were involved in anti-national activities using farmers’ movement. He said the farmers had always contributed to the development and growth of the country and they would continue doing it. He reiterated that the “problems could be resolved through conversation not struggle.” The chief minister planted a sapling before attending the programme. He then reached the regional office of the BJP and planted a banyan sapling. The chief minister will participate in discussions on the party’s policies and strategies over different issues, including the upcoming panchayat elections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-trying-to-destabilize-nation-through-farmers-stir-yogi-adityanath/story-7Ezrj2r9wMBMbEZVbL2jFN.html
13-12-2020||India||Modi govt to deal sternly with ‘Tukde Tukde gang’ trying to take advantage of farmers stir, says Union minister Ravi Shankar||Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday stated that stern action will be taken against nation breakers “Tukde Tukde Gang” trying to take advantage of farmers movement against the new farm laws.Prasad, who is a Union Minister for Law and Justice, made the assertion while launching Bihar BJPs state-wide “Kisan Chaupal Sammelan” (farmers conference) in support of the three agricultural Acts at Tekbigha village in Bakhtiarpur assembly constituency of Patna district. “They (those protesting farm laws) are saying that they will not withdraw their movement unless and until these laws are withdrawn.We would like to say that Narendra Modi government respects farmers but would like to make it clear that stern action will be taken against ‘tukde tukde gang’ taking advantage of farmers movement,” Prasad said. “I want to ask who are these people who are talking the language of breaking the country...Now demands are being raised to free those so-called intellectuals who are in jails for indulging in rioting in Delhi and Maharashtra. “Police have filed chargesheets, they are not able to obtain bail from the court as trials are underway. Now these people have taken refuge under farmers movement for their interest but we will not allow them to succeed in their goal,” Prasad said while addressing the ‘Kisan chaupal sammelan’. Union Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also earlier asked protesting farmers to be vigilant against misuse of their platform by the “anti-social” as well as the “Leftist and Maoist” elements conspiring to spoil the atmosphere. He had said this on Friday after photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral. Food, Railway and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal has been more direct in his charge, alleging that certain Leftist and Maoist elements seem to have taken “control” of the agitation and rather than discussing on farmer issues, they seem to be having some other agenda. As per the Bihar BJP’s programme, similar conferences will be held at the district level and chaupals (meetings) in every assembly constituency till December 25, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The pro-agri Acts meetings across Bihar will be attended by various union and state ministers.The conference was also attended by Bihar BJP president and MP Sanjay Jaiswal, MLAs Gyanendra Singh Gyanu, Sanjeev Chaurasia and a host of other leaders. Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of the big corporates. The Centre has maintained that MSP and Mandi mechanisms will stay. Prasad asserted that the three agri laws have been enacted to benefit farmers especially small and marginal ones across the country and wondered as why the opposition parties and farmers of Punjab are agitating against the laws which will free the farmers from shackles of Mandi system as they can sell their produce anywhere in the country. “The laws give the farmers opportunity to sell their produce either in Mandi or in PACS or outside the realm of mandi, PACS or Vyapar Mandal...I just want to ask whether or not farmers be given such freedom or opportunity. It is beyond ones fathom as they are opposing the laws,” he said. The minister cited examples of farmers of Kishanganj and Aurangabad in Bihar making good money by selling one lakh MT of pine-apple and 200 MT of strawberry to the traders from Kolkata, respectively. “Why makhana (gorgon nut) of north Bihar be sold locally and why not it be given the access to global market?” he asked.As per the farm law, those entering into agreements with farmers can neither sell nor lease out or mortgage the land of farmers, Prasad asserted while adding that companies (entering into agreement) will provide quality seeds, technique to farmers, buy their produce and finally farmers getting money sitting at home. If any company was found indulge in irregularities with farmers or harassing them, then both the Narendra Modi government at Centre and Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, which are firmly standing behind farmers, will send such erring person to jail, the minister said. Speaking on the occasion, Jaiswal said that there is a “conspiracy” behind the farmers movement which is hugely participated by cultivators of Punjab alone. “This conspiracy needs to be exposed”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-to-deal-sternly-with-tukde-tukde-gang-trying-to-take-advantage-of-farmers-stir-says-union-minister-ravi-shankar/story-4F2bycEKA4SLVD8eXO3QNO.html

13-12-2020||India||UK PM praises India’s ‘incredible’ solar power strides at climate summit||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the “incredible things” being done by India in the solar energy sector as he warned that the emergency facing the world from climate change was far more destructive than even the coronavirus pandemic.Johnson said this in his address to the Climate Ambition Summit this weekend, co-hosted by the UK to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement.In his speech to the virtual summit, which was earlier addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi among around 70 heads of state and government, the British prime minister reiterated the UK’s pledge to radically cut dependence on fossil fuels.“We’re going ahead with a massive solar programme, even though we can’t hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, Australia or Morocco for instance,” he said.“Today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon friendly way of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity… Hydro of course – we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of uses,” he said.The summit, held as a precursor to the UK’s hosting of the United Nations’ COP26 summit in November 2021, included addresses urging the world’s economies to “stop the assault” on the planet and increase their ambition on cutting the greenhouse gases that drive climate change. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned leaders that the world was heading for a “catastrophic” 3 degrees Celsius of warming, as he urged them to declare a state of climate emergency in their countries until they become carbon neutral.“Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,” said Alok Sharma, the UK’s Business Secretary and President of COP26.“But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would “save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs” as the UK announced an end to support for the fossil fuel sector overseas. Described as a significant move as in the last four years, the UK government supported 21 billion pounds of UK oil and gas exports through trade promotion and export finance.The new policy will be implemented after a short period of consultation and is intended to come into force as soon as possible before COP26 next year.“Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere – against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming,” said Johnson.The UK had recently also announced a new commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The UK claims this means its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement is now among the highest in the world and commits the country to cutting emissions at one of the fastest rates of any major economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-pm-praises-india-s-incredible-solar-power-strides-at-climate-summit/story-P0mvPTUAu57AtE4AEaKzgK.html

The Haryana police did not allow march to the national capital resulting in the highway blockade. The announcement by farmers’ unions to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway came amid protests by thousands for the last 17 days at the various other border points of the national capital, including Singhu and Tikri, against the laws. Farmers are demanding the Centre withdraw the legislations.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.Farmers of several organisations reached the Haryana border near Jaisinghpur-Khera area through Behror, Kotputli and Shahjahanpur of Rajasthan.Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan, social activists Aruna Roy and Medha Paatkar, and CPM leader Amra Ram also joined farmers at Shahjahanpur, where the highway was blocked.“We are sitting on the national highway in support of the farmers agitating at Singhu border in Delhi,” Yogendra Yadav said.“Police and administration are telling us that blocking the national highway will create trouble for people, so we have told them that we are ready to leave the highway if we are allowed to march towards Delhi. We have also apologised to the people for the inconvenience caused by the blockade,” he said.Kisan Panchayat national president Rampal Chaudhary continued his sit-in on the highway after farmers were stopped at Haryana border on Saturday.“Farmers of different organisations are reaching Shahjahanpur border. We just want to march towards Delhi to press for repeal of the farm laws,” Chaudhary said.Farmer leader Amra Ram of CPM asked the union government to withdraw the farm laws. “We do not intend to block Jaipur-Delhi national highway. It’s police who are blocking it by stopping our march,” he said.The vehicular movement on the highway was diverted through Bansur and other routes in Alwar. Vehicles are plying on the one-way lane from Delhi to Jaipur.Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) chief and MP Hanuman Beniwal also has plans to march towards Delhi. He organised a ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ in Kotputli on Saturday, where he accused the Congress and BJP of being two sides of the same coin and urged the Narendra Modi government to repeal the farm laws. The RLP is an ally of the BJP and part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).“PM Narendra Modi has a big heart, so he should withdraw farm laws in the interest of farmers. It is a do-or- die situation for farmers who are united,” Beniwal said.He urged the union government to implement Swaminathan Commission’s report for farmers’ benefit.The Rajasthan police have scaled up security in view of the farmer agitation.

13-12-2020||India||There has been absolutely no compromise in clinical testing of Covid-19 vaccines, says clinical scientist Gagandeep Kang||Seeking to allay apprehension of people over safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, noted clinical scientist Gagandeep Kang said that though vaccines for the coronavirus are being developed in a short period of time, there has been absolutely no compromise in their clinical testing.Click here fro complete coverage of Covid-19 Kang, who is associated with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, a global consortium involved in facilitating vaccine candidates for the novel coronavirus, also said that there should be equitable Covid-19 vaccine access globally and domestically. Known for her inter-disciplinary research on transmission, development and prevention of infections and their sequelae in children in India, Kang is also the first Indian woman to be inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society in London. Though vaccines for the coronavirus are being developed in a “very short period of time”, all clinical phases of testing are being done, she told PTI in an interview. “What has changed is the approach to the testing where all steps that used to happen between phases of clinical trials have been cut out, which means regulators are working much longer and harder than they ever have before,” Kang said. Everybody is talking about things being done very fast but “I think it is very important to know what steps we are cutting out and quite frankly, in all of the testing of vaccines that is being done, there is no aspect of testing that is being removed from the development pathway”, she said. “I think it is very important to understand that there has been absolutely no compromise in clinical testing of Covid-19 vaccines. The only thing that we do not have from these trials, that we might have had otherwise, is the duration of safety follow-up. Generally, we follow up on trials for six months or one year, and generally, we do not find anything extra in the six months or one year,” Kang said. Kang, who was the executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) but resigned in July, said that another thing that is different in the development of Covid-19 vaccines is that clinical trials have been made very large to get results faster. To a question on availability of cold chain capacity to store vaccines, she said that equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines should be ensured. The case should not be that those who live in big cities, where there is better cold chain capacity, get vaccinated while those in rural areas or small towns do not get it because of lack of storage facilities, Kang said. “My worry with all of it is the question of equity, will we end up with a system where we have freezers in big cities and some classes of people can get vaccines, whereas in rural areas or small towns there is no access to these vaccines as cold chain capacity does not exist,” she said. “Even in the work that we are planning to do with the Lancet Commission, equity is a big part of looking at what services are provided to whom and where, and making sure that where you live and what your socio-economic status is does not determine what kind of services you get,” Kang said. The Lancet, a global health journal, on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens’ Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System, which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage (UHC) in India. The journal and the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University, together formulated the commission. Speaking about the Lancet commission, Kang said that its purpose is to aim for universal health coverage to examine all health concerns, to look at mental and physical health problems and their solutions, to ensure that catastrophic health expenditure does not happen and make sure coverage is accessible and affordable. The commission is being led by four distinguished health and business leaders, including Kang and CMD Biocon Ltd Kiran Mazumdar Shaw. “If we think about Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have a target of 2030, there is no way we can achieve these goals with the trajectory that we have at the moment. So what we are seeking to do over the next few years is to try and layout a road-map to make sure we are on a better path to achieving the SDGs,” Kang said. She said in India, out of pocket payments for healthcare continue to be highest in the world and it is one of many reasons why many families are driven into poverty. This kind of “catastrophic health expenditure” actually winds up promoting further health inequities in the system, Kang said. “We have a situation where the most vulnerable in our population don’t get services that they want and there is a problem in terms of accountability where the poor are treated as beneficiaries rather than as clients of the system, and there seems to be a lack of trust in the quality of the care that is provided by the healthcare system,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-has-been-absolutely-no-compromise-in-clinical-testing-of-covid-19-vaccines-says-clinical-scientist-gagandeep-kang/story-8N34vXuQBiuzlQzDnnBQWI.html

13-12-2020||India||Activists, women’s groups oppose Maharashtra Shakti bill, ask CM Thackeray to not table it||Several activists, lawyers and women’s organisations have urged Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to not table the Shakti bill, calling it draconian legislation that is fundamentally anti-women with the potential to negate the very offence of rape.A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said last Wednesday that two bills will be tabled in the legislature - the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and the Special Court & Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, 2020 - to give shape to the law against perpetrators of crime against women and children. Also Read | ‘Shakti act’: Maharashtra’s new bill on sexual crimes to have death penalty, hefty finesThe draft bill will be tabled in the state legislature during the upcoming two-day winter session in Mumbai on December 14-15. The bills are meant to bring down the rate of crime against women and propose the death penalty, stern punishment, life sentence, hefty fines as retributions for the offences.The consensus of a large group of feminist activists, lawyers, women’s organisation leaders and academicians working on the issue is that the bills go against their fundamental beliefs and principles.They have said in a letter, dated December 11, that the proposed amendment to Section 375 that says where parties are adults and the conduct of such parties from all circumstances surrounding the same appears that there was consent or implied consent, presumes consent, negates the entire definition of consent under the section and of rape itself. It said that this is a step back for women’s right after the 2013 amendments wherein as per Verma Committee’s report the definition of consent was added to the section.“While the Act is said to be made for justice to women it feeds into the patriarchal construction of consent and conduct of women. It goes against the statement and object of this Bill. In a lot of cases of rape, the accused take the plea of consent with such an explanation added it will become impossible for the prosecution to establish rape. Such an explanation negates and nullifies the very offence of rape,” the letter with 92 signatories said.They said the bill came to them on December 10 hence giving them less time for a detailed review and critique. It also questioned the potency of the death penalty as an effective deterrent for crimes against women and stated the proposed amendments can lead to endangering the lives of survivors and less reportage in case of sexual assaults on children as reports suggest that most of the offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) act are committed by people known to children.Organisations like the Akhil Bharatiya Janwadi Mahila Sanghatana, MumbaiBebaakCollective, MumbaiBhartiya Mahila Federation (NFIW), TISSStree Mukti Sanghatana; advocates Indira Jaising, Veena Gowda and Rouble Sarkar; professors Asha Bajpai and Anjali Monteiro; activists Manisha Gupte and Snehal Velkar and others have signed the letter opposing the draft bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-women-s-groups-oppose-maharashtra-shakti-bill-ask-cm-thackeray-to-not-table-it/story-0h3ipgmq4n1bx4e43Mdl8H.html

Congratulations to the teams from RBI, IFTAS and the service partners who made this possible,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a tweet.India will become one of the few countries in the world to operate its RTGS system round-the-clock throughout the year.RTGS on 24X7X365 facility comes within a year of RBI operationalising NEFT 24x7. NEFT is a popular mode for small-value transactions.RTGS, which began its operations on March 26, 2004 with a soft launch involving four banks, presently handles 6.35 lakh transactions daily for a value of Rs 4.17 lakh crore across 237 participant banks.The average ticket size for RTGS in November 2020 was Rs 57.96 lakh, making it a truly large value payment system.RTGS uses ISO 20022 format which is the best-in-class messaging standard for financial transactions. The feature of positive confirmation for credit to beneficiary accounts is also available in RTGS.“Round the clock availability of RTGS will provide extended flexibility to businesses for effecting payments and will enable introduction of additional settlement cycles in ancillary payment systems. This can also be leveraged to enhance operations of Indian financial markets and cross-border payments,” RBI had said last week.Earlier, RBI had decided not to levy charges on transactions through NEFT and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system in order to promote digital transactions in the country, and asked banks to pass on the benefits to the customers.The RBI used to levy minimum charges on banks for transactions routed through RTGS and NEFT. Banks, in turn, levied charges on their customers.RTGS is meant for large-value instantaneous fund transfers, while NEFT is used for fund transfers of up to Rs 2 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtgs-facility-to-be-available-round-the-clock-from-mid-night-tonight/story-QNXzOYVopWfOBtHEkVrWlN.html
13-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand to get its first crocodile safari in Kumaon’s Khatima||Uttarakhand is planning to set up the state’s first crocodile safari in Surai forest range in Kumaon, said forest officials. Sandeep Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), Terai-east forest division, said, “We are chalking out a plan for a crocodile safari in Khakra nullah of Surai range in Khatima area in US Nagar district. Our aim is not only to conserve crocodiles but also earn revenue from this for the department by attracting tourists and boosting ecotourism.” Surai range falls in Terai-East forest division in Kumaon and Khakra nullah passes through the range. Since crocodiles are in good numbers in this forest range, a proposal for crocodile safari has been prepared, said Kumar. The spot where the safari is being planned is 12 km from Khatima town of US Nagar and 20 km from Pilibhit tiger reserve in Pilibhit district of Uttar Pradesh. Khakra had 170 crocodiles in the last count held in 2018. Now their numbers have increased, according to forest officials Kumar said, “A 750-metre stretch of the nullah has been identified for safari and ample fencing and walls will be erected on both sides so that crocodiles don’t harm the tourists and tourists too don’t venture too close to the animal. A track will be constructed on both sides for tourists. Later electric vehicles will be provided if the safari gets good footfall.” Babu Lal, sub divisional officer (SDO) of Khatima forest, said, “Surai range is spread on 22,000 hectares of land and has a very rich flora and fauna. We have sent a proposal for a crocodile safari in Khakra nullah on the instruction of higher authorities.” Praveen Kabir, a social activist of Khatima, said, “It is a nice idea to have crocodile safari in a remote area like Khatima. It would give Khatima a chance to shine on the tourism map of India.” In Uttarakhand, crocodiles are found in the Corbett landscape, Terai area, some areas of Haridwar forest division and Rajaji National Park landscape. According to the latest wildlife census released by the state forest department in June this year, crocodile numbers have increased in the state from 123 in 2008 to 451 in 2020. Of 23 crocodilian species found in the world, India has three species. Uttarakhand has two of the three crocodilian species - Mugger Crocodile and Gharial (in Corbett landscape). Mugger Crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), the most widespread freshwater croc species is found throughout India, except the extreme north.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-get-its-first-crocodile-safari-in-kumaon-s-khatima/story-9z0mId7lFB6OLvd0m8IKAO.html

The ministers were accompanied by leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Punjab, according to news agency PTI. Tomar and Parkash, along with their ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal, have been leading the government’s negotiations with the protesting farmers.Tomar and Parkash met the Union home minister at his house and it was not immediately known what transpired in the meeting, even as the farmers’ agitation in and around Delhi entered its 18th day with the protesters threatening to block the Delhi-Jaipur highway.Also read | ‘Always listened to my conscience’: Senior Punjab cop resigns to support protesting farmers“Thousands of farmers will begin a tractor march at 11am on December 13 from Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan and block the Jaipur-Delhi main road,” Sanyukta Kisan Andolan leader Kamal Preet Singh Pannu had said on Saturday.The farmers’ union leader added they will sit on fast from 8am to 5pm on December 14 at Singhu border. “On December 14, all farmer leaders will sit on fast sharing the stage at Singhu border. We want the government to take back the three farm laws; we’re not in the favour of the proposed amendments. The Centre wants to thwart our movement but we’ll continue it peacefully,” he said, according to news agency ANI.Also read | New laws meant to make farmers prosperous: ModiPannu alleged that the Centre is trying to “fail” the farmers’ movement, making attempts to divide the farmers. “We will foil any attempt by the Centre to fail our movement. The government made a few small attempts to divide us and instigate people. But, we will peacefully take this movement towards victory,” he said, according to news agency ANI.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders demanding the repeal of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The three farm laws, which were enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Farmers have, however, demanded the repeal of these laws, saying the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and weaken the government’s MSP system. These laws together allow agribusinesses to trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.On Saturday, a delegation of farmers from Haryana, including those connected with Farmer Producer Organisation, had expressed their support, in a letter, for the three farm laws with the modifications proposed by the central government.The government has held five rounds of formal talks with the representatives of farmers, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand of repeal of the three contentious laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders was cancelled.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-ministers-in-huddle-as-farmers-threaten-to-block-delhi-jaipur-highway/story-aKFEwvWcMNcCd297leZZkK.html

Kejriwal also asked the central government to roll back the three contentious farm laws which were implemented by the Centre in September, and demanded a new bill to ensure minimum support prices (MSP) for farmers – currently a policy issue – be drafted and tabled.“I request all party (AAP) supporters and people across the country to observe fast for a day tomorrow (Monday) in solidarity with protesting farmers. I shall be observing a day’s fast too… Let’s support our farmers from our homes. I understand that it is not possible for many of us to be physically present in the (state) border points where the protesting farmer groups have gathered,” the chief minister said in a video press briefing on Monday.Watch | Kejriwal to fast with farmers in support, urges centre ‘shun arrogance’ On the people being called “anti-national” for supporting the protesting farmers, Kejriwal reminded of 2011 Anna Hazare-led movement against corruption, saying that Congress then had done a similar thing to disregard the movement. “In the last few days, I have seen several ministers and BJP leaders calling the protesting farmers anti-national. I have a question for them: So many ex-servicemen, sportspersons, artistes, doctors, lawyers, businessmen have been supporting the protests in some way or other – are they all anti-national? During the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011, the Congress had done similar things to bring disrepute to the movement. The BJP is doing the same thing now,” Kejriwal said.Thousands of farmers from Haryana and Punjab have been protesting in and around several borders of Delhi against the three farm laws. The government pushed for the agriculture laws saying that it will bring major reforms in the farming sector that will help eliminate the middlemen from the equation, allowing the farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the farmers are apprehensive of the new laws and say that it will takeaway the safety cushion of MSP and mandi system, due to which they will have to be at the mercy of corporate leaders. “Some people claim that only a few farmers from Punjab and Haryana are participants in the protest. It is their misconception. Farmers across the country are troubled... The new bills make hoarding legal. It will lead to inflation… I urge the central government to leave behind their ego, roll back the three laws and prepare a new bill to ensure minimum support price for farmers,” Kejriwal added.Earlier in the day, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and minister of state for commerce and industry Som Parkash met Union home minster Amit Shah as the deadlock between protesting farmers and the Centre over the new farm laws continued for the 18th day, according to reports. The agitating farmers have threatened to block the Delhi-Jaipur highway. The farmers’ union leader also said that they will sit on fast from 8am to 5pm on December 14 at Singhu border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-says-will-fast-in-support-of-farmers-tomorrow-urges-aap-workers-to-do-the-same/story-y2Q5H9kN4ZLpgJb0XzPh1K.html

We have not broken the alliance yet and so I request the BJP to continue with the alliance and extend support to the BPF in the formation of the new Council”, Mohilary said at a press conference here.He appealed to BJP President JP Nadda and state unit President Ranjit Dass to continue with the alliance and extend their support to the BPF.He expressed confidence that the BJP will continue with the alliance and support the BPF in BTC as in “politics there are no permanent friends or enemies”.The election to the Council was held after a fresh Bodo Accord was signed in New Delhi on January 27 by the leaders of all four factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)- then All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) Chief Pramod Boro, then BTC Chief Hagrama Mohilary and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.Asked about the bitter war of words both BJP and BPF had launched against each other during the campaign, Mohilary said that it happens during elections with many debates taking place but that is now over and the alliance between the two parties must continue.“All political parties including the UPPL, Congress and AIUDF contested the polls independently but now the point is that both BJP and BPF are an alliance partner at the state and centre and must help each other to form the Council”, he said.The BJP and the UPPL did not announce any formal alliance but both have indicated of a possible post-poll pact in case of a hung Council.UPPL Chief Promod Brahma, BJP Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP state unit President, BJP National General Secretary and Mangaldoi MP Dilip Saikia and Gana Suraksha Party (GSP) Chief and Kokrajhar MP Naba Kumar Sarania were engaged in late night deliberations and they again met this morning to discuss the formation of the Council.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Sarma and BJP state president along with other senior party leaders are currently holding discussions regarding the formation of the Council and the decision is likely to be announced during the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bpf-seeks-bjp-s-support-in-formation-of-bodoland-territorial-council/story-Osy47rEQvj9q8NrCZqFiZJ.html

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has said India will look to vaccinate 250-300 million people against Covid-19 in the first phase on priority by July next year.India’s Covid-19 tally has risen to 98,57,029, 9,357,464 patients have been cured or discharged from the hospitals and its death toll has mounted to 143,019, according to health ministry figures. There are nine Covid-19 vaccine candidates in different phases of development in India and of these three are in the pre-clinical phase whereas six are under clinical trials.Here’s what the Centre’s Covid-19 Vaccines Operational Guidelines say:1. The Covid-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to people above 50 years of age. It will be followed by those younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities based on evolving pandemic situation. Finally, the remaining population will be vaccinated based on disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.2. The priority group of above 50 years may be again subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 to 60 years of age for purposes of the phasing of the vaccine’s rollout based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability.Also read | Vaccination drive in India may start in January, says Adar Poonawalla as Serum Institute hopes to get nod by December3.

13-12-2020||India||Greater integration between foreign and military policies key to cope with challenges: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday called for greater integration between the foreign and military policies to more effectively deal with national security challenges and protect India’s interests around the world. Delivering the second Manohar Parrikar memorial lecture, Jaishankar indirectly referred to security challenges linked to Pakistan and China as well as routine challenges linked to India’s long borders and large maritime spaces and said the country should give “primacy to hard security”. “There are very few major states that still have unsettled borders to the extent that we do. Of equal relevance is the very unique challenge that we face of years of intense terrorism inflicted on us by a neighbour,” he said during the lecture commemorating the late former defence minister. “We also cannot disregard attempts to undermine our national integrity and unity...As India expands its global interests and reach, there is an even more compelling case to focus on hard power,” he added. Noting that foreign policy cannot be conducted by the foreign ministry alone, Jaishankar spoke of the need to build on reforms in defence and security, such as the creation of the posts of national security adviser and chief of defence staff, by giving up the concept of functioning within silos and embracing institutionalised integration. “The complexity of national security issues requires serious specialisation and that also means it requires equally serious integration,” he said. Such integration between foreign and defence policies and even beyond will ensure optimal use of resources and eliminate duplication, he added. Jaishankar referred to the magnitude, complexity and pace of changes around the world and said: “We have seen sharp shifts in the basic stance and behaviour of nations and their interplay with each other.” These global changes included the salience of China, repositioning of the US, Brexit, intra-European Union politics, the Abraham accords signed by Israel and the evolution of the Indo-Pacific. He also spoke of the role played by Parrikar, who served as defence minister during 2014-17 and died last year, in fostering greater synergy between defence and foreign policies. These efforts helped enhance India’s reputation as a first responder during humanitarian crises across the Indian Ocean and allowed the country to carry out operations such as the cross-Line of Control (LoC) strikes after the Uri terror attacks, he said. Parrikar also reformed the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), which helped India improve its infrastructure along the frontiers, Jaishankar said. India’s current national security challenges include “some perennial problems associated with national consolidation and development”, a “long-standing political rivalry...expressed as sustained cross-border terrorism by a neighbour”, and reactions to the country’s rise, such as “attempts to dilute our influence and limit our interests”, he said. In an increasingly inter-dependent world with accompanying constraints, the “era of unconstrained military conflicts may be behind us but the reality of limited wars and coercive diplomacy is still very much a fact of life”, and responding to the new range of national security challenges requires the “willingness to continuously review policy and audit performance”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/greater-integration-between-foreign-and-military-policies-key-to-cope-with-challenges-jaishankar/story-ua1YejUQQ6d9hPNDVrDKgO.html
13-12-2020||India||Hundreds of women from Haryana and Punjab join farmers’ agitation||They have long juggled the demands of field and family, making sure both are tended to, and now hundreds of women from Haryana and Punjab have added another dimension to their busy lives – the protest grounds at the various gateways into Delhi.As their husbands, sons and brothers leave home to demand a rollback of the Centre’s new agri laws, many women are joining them too, making the trip from village towards the national capital even if for only a few days at a time. For these women, who describe themselves as homemakers, farmworkers, and protesters all rolled into one, any suggestion that farmers are about being alpha males because it requires physical labour is met with scorn. “The profession of farming is not defined by gender. Our fields don’t produce crops differently if tended by women and men. Many male farmers are here protesting. Why should we sit at home?” asked 53-year-old Mandeep Kaur, a farmer from Ludhiana who refuses to be stereotyped into any one role.Mandeep took a bus to the Singhu border, a major protest site of the farmers’ agitation that has been going for more than two weeks, spent a night and returned home. “But I will be back,” she said. “We have to look after both our homes as well as our fight. I watered the fields before I came here. It will sustain the land until I return home.” While the men have been camping at the Tikri and Singhu border, the main access point into the city from Punjab, many of the women have been travelling back and forth, balancing the jobs of taking care of their homes and fields and also participating in the agitation.Mandeep’s companion on the five-hour bus ride from Ludhiana to Singhu was her neighbour Sukhwinder Kaur.  The 68-year-old widow said she was tired of sitting at home while the men in her family were out protesting, and decided she needed to come down, even if it was for a short visit.“I wasn’t being able to sleep at night properly. I couldn’t sit back at home while my brother and nephew, and all our farmer brothers, are fighting here. I had my first good night of sleep after I came here,” Sukhwinder added. It wasn’t the epitome of comfort and toilets were a problem but that didn’t matter, said the feisty women. Sukhwinder and Mandeep, with several other women protestors, slept in a water proof tent provided by Khalsa Aid, an international NGO.  Sukhwinder said she was aware of the fight the farming community had undertaken but didn’t realise what it actually took to keep the fight going until she came here.“We are ‘gharelu’ women, don’t know much about the world, but after coming here I have realised how big this fight is. We are prepared for it, however long it takes. The kind of help we are getting for the protest shows the entire country is with us. I have heard that people from Australia, Canada and America are also with us,” she said.  The farmers, with help from various organisations and generous donors, have pulled out all the stops to sustain their agitation. The site is seeing a constant supply of cooked meals, fruits, dry fruits, and even ‘chaat’.There’s also chai-pakora, cold drinks, kheer and other sweet treats. Arrangements for laundry service, and medical facilities, including regular health check ups and a dental camp, have also been taken care of.Sukhwinder only had one complaint. “The toilet is a little too far,” she said.Staying on the Haryana side of the border, she said she had to take a bit of a stroll to find a toilet, which was on the Delhi side.Inadequate sanitation facilities is one reason why many women have to go back and forth, managing to stay at the protest sight only for a few days at a time. But 75-year-old Daljinder Kaur takes it all in her stride, like many others. She is Mandeep’s aunt and insisted on accompanying her to Singhu despite her age. Daljinder said she is positive her farmer brothers and sisters will convince the government.“‘Modi ko mana ke jaenge. Apne haq lene aaye hain, peeche nahi hatenge’ (We will convince Modi. We won’t go back until we get our rights),” she said. “’And if needed, we will die here too, she said. The farmers have called for a hunger strike on December 14, when they have called for a nationwide protest. Refusing the government’s requests to make amendments to the new farm laws, the farmers are insisting that they should be repealed. On Saturday, farmers picketed highway toll plazas in Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan.They are apprehensive the new legislations will eventually do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-of-women-from-haryana-and-punjab-join-farmers-agitation/story-juKzelfNniB8U4yEuBMiJP.html

Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there’s a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,” Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday.“I am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,” he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers’ protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns.“As Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India’s recent agricultural reform legislation,” said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week.According to the letter, “hundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more.“Many of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific region”.The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus.Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-american-congressman-ro-khanna-seeks-peaceful-fair-solution-to-farmers-issue/story-iKd5M7Eb6lTnAinF116zCN.html
13-12-2020||India||Free Covid vaccine offer by Kerala CM kicks up controversy||Ahead of a key phase of local body elections, the announcement of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that the state will make Covid-19 vaccine free has kicked up a big controversy. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday approached the state election commission, saying it was a clear violation of the election code of conduct. While addressing a press conference in Kannur (north Kerala) on Saturday, the CM had said the state was waiting for vaccines from the Union government (once a candidate is approved) and that they will be distributed free of cost. He said the state will all bear expenses of the Covid vaccine , like some of the prevailing vaccines. The big announcement, which came at a time when the final phase of local body election, is due on Monday angered opposition parties. “It was a deliberate attempt to influence voters. Neck-deep in trouble, the CM is resorting to dirty politics. We have already made a written complaint to the Election Commission (EC). We need action against him,” said Congress leader KC Joseph. BJP state president K Surendran has also announced his plan to petition the EC. “He thinks vaccine will save him from impending humiliation and ignominy. But he’s mistaken,” he said. The CM’s office has clarified that it was not an announcement and he was replying to a question posed by a journalist. There was no violation of election code of conduct, it maintained. Considered a semi-final before the assembly election that is due in four months, local body elections are conducted in three phases in the state. First two phases are over, and the final, in north Kerala, will take place on Monday. Results will be announced on December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-covid-vaccine-offer-by-kerala-cm-kicks-up-controversy/story-qCOop3TIaegsRUXL16usyO.html

Arrested along with his son Akash Pathak, who has been charged with duping many job aspirants with the false promise of employment in Tata Motors in lieu of money, the father-son duo is likely to stay behind bars for some time, said vigilance officials.While Pathak is the topmost forest official to be charged with corruption in Odisha, vigilance records show 82 forest officials have been charged with cases of corruption in last 5 years.In August this year, Alok Ranjan Hota, divisional forest officer of Chilika Wildlife Division was found to be in possession of disproportionate assets worth Rs 77 lakh. In February 2016, vigilance seized Rs 1.10 crore cash from Athgarh DFO Sudhanshu Sekhar Mishra, while in February 2017, Sarat Chandra Panda, DFO of Khariar, was arrested by vigilance dept on charges of having disproportionate assets of Rs 4.5 crores. In March 2017, DFO Mahadeb Badaika, working in works department, was raided in disproportionate assets case.Besides, there have been numerous forest guards, range officers and forest rangers, foresters, junior clerks in the forest department accused of corruption in last the 5 years.Also Read: Odisha attracted investments of over Rs 1 lakh cr during pandemic: CM PatnaikEnvironmentalists alleged that the forest department has become a hub of corruption where official are defalcating money from several state forest-related schemes as well as from lucrative postings like Kendu-leaf and mining divisions.“Corruption is often linked with long tenures of officers /staff beyond the normal posting period of 3 years. Very often people in lucrative posts pay heavy bribes or use political influence to ensure that they are not transferred. This is one of the chief breeding grounds for corruption. There are numerous cases of Range Officers posted for as long as 5-6 years in the same post. DFOs/range officers who are on the “Agreed List” or “Doubtful Integrity List” prepared by the vigilance are given lucrative field posts where the scope of corruption is high. A strict policy should be not to post such officers to any key posts in the field or allow them to handle huge sums of money,” said environmental activist Biswajit Mohanty.Pathak, who worked as additional PCCF of afforestation and planning in the state forest department since June 2018, was in charge of a huge budget for afforestation that included money from CAMPA fund, NREGS as well as plantation under state schemes. During the current financial year 2020-21, the state forest department had formulated forestry projects of Rs 602 crores under NREGA that included plantations of around 40,000 hectares of area, 5,000 kilometer avenue plantation and distribution of 3.5 crore seedlings. In 2019, Centre had released Rs 5,933 crore of CAMPA fund to Odisha, the highest among all states.Neither state forest secretary Mona Sharma nor principal chief conservator of forest Sandip Tripathy responded to queries on the steps being taken to cleanse the forest department of corrupt officials.RTI activist Pradip Pradhan, who has been seeking details about various expenditures of forest department, said while the forest officials had scope for amassing money from smuggling of valuable timbers and forests products, allowing mine owners to extract mineral in forest areas and allow illegal trade in Kendu leaves, the failure of vigilance department to convict them was the major deterrence.“The vigilance department has a poor track record when it comes to conviction. It creates a sensation during arrest and lodging of cases against officials, but its paperwork is very poor. As a result, cases don’t stand in court of law,” said Pradhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spotlight-on-rot-in-forest-dept-with-odisha-s-highest-ranked-official-s-arrest/story-YhdaGqDffi3HRVJdVgdDSP.html
13-12-2020||India||Himachal to bring 4,000 hectare land under red rice cultivation in 5 yrs||In a bid to give red rice, which is “on the verge of extinction” a new lease of life, the Himachal Pradesh government has fixed a target to bring around 4,000 hectares of land under its cultivation and produce around 40,000 quintals of the cereal grain annually in the next five years, state Agriculture Minister Virender Kanwar said on Sunday.At present, the total area under cultivation of red rice -- for which the state government is also trying to get a Geographical Indication tag -- in Himachal Pradesh has been recorded at around 1,100 hectares. The total annual production is 9,926 quintals, with an average of 8-10 quintals/hectare production.According to the state government, the area under the cultivation of red rice has registered a slight increase from past years due to the sustained efforts of the Agriculture Department.“With growing health consciousness, and environmental concern, red rice -- probably the earliest of cereal grains that humans started domesticating -- which is on the verge of extinction, are making a comeback,” said Himachal Pradesh Agriculture Kanwar.An official release said that in the past few decades, farmers’ inclination towards cash crops and high-yielding variety, along with the subsidised supply of fine cereals through the public distribution system, and change in consumer preferences, had led to a decrease in the area under the red rice cultivation. “Due to shifting of farmers to apples and vegetable crop, the area under rice drastically declined in past few decades but the farmers have now returned to the cultivation of this traditional crop,” the minister was quoted in the release.As per the state government, currently, the red rice -- one of the most ancient crops domesticated about 10,000 years ago -- is cultivated in water-surplus areas under Chirgaon, Rohru and Rampur blocks in Kullu Valley, the high hills of Shimla, Sirmour and Chamba districts, besides parts of Kangra in Himachal.“Some of these popular varieties of red rice include Chhohartu from Rohru (Shimla district), Sukara from Tiyan (Chamba), Lal Zhini and Red Ramjawain (Kangra), and Jattoo and Matali (Kullu district),” the minister stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-to-bring-4-000-hectare-land-under-red-rice-cultivation-in-5-yrs/story-UpJ5n0noQkjwQxsYmMosNK.html

13-12-2020||India||Ahead of poll campaign launch, Haasan questions PM Modi on new Parliament building||Hours ahead of kicking off his election campaign, actor-and-politician Kamal Haasan on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain why a new Parliament is being built when people were starving after losing their livelihood due to the Covid-19 crisis. “Thousands of people died during the construction of the Great Wall of China and rulers said that it was to protect people. When half of India is starving after losing their livelihood due to corona, whom will the 1000-crore construction of the parliament protect? Please respond, my honourable elected Prime Minister,” Haasan’s tweet in Tamil read. PM Modi laid the foundation stone for a new Parliament House on Thursday, describing the event as a milestone in India’s democratic history and asserting that the building will become the symbol of a 21st century nation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India. Also Watch | ‘New Parliament building will witness making of Aatmanirbhar Bharat’: PM Modi The 64,500 square metre building, the showpiece of the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project, is proposed to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. The earthquake resistant structure would involve 2,000 workers directly and another 9,000 indirectly.Haasan’s party Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) launched its first phase of election campaign Sunday for the upcoming 2021 assembly polls in Tamil Nadu. His poll plank so far has been to fight corruption. MNM’s campaign will cover districts of Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Virudhunagar. Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari. Launching his poll campaign in Madurai, Haasan said, “Our political strategy is honesty.” He added that when MNM comes to power, they will made Madurai the second capital of the state. Responding to reporters in Madurai if he will form an alliance with Rajinikanth, he said, “Alliances will break and alliances will be forged. I can only say this now.”MNM members were recently in the capital to support the protesting farmers who want the three new farm bills repealed. Haasan, who launched the MNM in 2018 in Madurai, fought the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and got a 3.7% vote share. The party is expecting to improve its performance in the assembly elections where it has positioned itself as a third force. The fledgling party will be fighting Dravidian rivals -- the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) --- and their national partners, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, respectively. Haasan’s former co-star and friend, Rajinikanth, will also be launching his political party to contest all 234 assembly constituencies. Several former bureaucrats and social activists have joined hands with Haasan’s party. Earlier this month, ex-IAS officer, Santhosh Babu, who quit service in August, was appointed the party’s general secretary. Haasan is also the host of Big Boss Tamil-4, a platform which he often uses to convey his political thinking to the audience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-poll-campaign-launch-haasan-questions-pm-modi-on-new-parliament-building/story-KknG0DU8i8LJJ2U3BQRYLM.html

Raut said Pawar’s intentions were then aligned with farmers’ welfare and claimed that in 2010, corporates had not entered farming in a big way.Raut, in his weekly column RokhThok in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, commented on the controversial farm laws passed by the Centre that have triggered the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi borders along Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Raut described the three laws, billed by the Centre as key reforms in the agricultural sector, as ‘dark’ laws that will turn ‘farms into graveyards’ and spell ‘death’ for farmers. Pawar, while he was the Union agriculture minister in the UPA dispensation, wrote to various chief ministers of states seeking amendment to the APMC Act, facilitating the entry of private sector. BJP, which has been claiming that the opposition parties were engaged in political mischief and misleading the farmers by fanning their protest, used Pawar’s letter in support of its allegation and slammed the NCP’s support to the farmers’ protest.Raut, in his column published on Sunday, defended Pawar and said, “Ten years ago when Sharad Pawar sought reforms in the agricultural sector it was in the interest of the farmers. Then Ambani-Adani had not entered this field. The expansion by the corporates in the field [of agri-marketing] came about in the last six years”.Also Read: ‘Reforms aimed at increasing competition’: TomarThe article further alleged that the BJP is spreading rumours that farmers’ protest does not reflect the mood of the farmers of the nation. However, the ‘successful’ Bharat Bandh called by the farmers had disproved the theory.“The three laws will turn farms into graveyards and mean death for farmers,” Raut wrote.He warned that if farming collapses, it’ll bring the economy down. “Ministers will come and go but if the farms are destroyed the country will suffer. A communist country like China and a capitalist country like America take care of their farmers then why the indifference by Indian government,” he asked in the column.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-sought-amendment-to-farm-law-for-farmers-benefit-sanjay-raut/story-PsizFbfG0K7q19Evqh8GeM.html

The action followed a lookout notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh police against him in connection with alleged funding to foment trouble after the Hathras gang rape case, additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar said.The office-bearer of the students’ wing of Popular Front of India (PFI) was wanted over alleged funding to incite caste violence in the backdrop of the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman -- a crime suspected to have been carried out by upper caste men --- in Hathras earlier this year.Kumar said that Shareef, a resident of Kerala, was held when he reached the airport to move out of the country. He said the accused was planning to go to Muscat.A police team from the state will leave for Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday morning to take custody of Shareef and bring him to Uttar Pradesh to interrogate him. The lookout notice was issued against him on November 18 after his name surfaced for generating funds to incite violence in the state after four members of PFI were arrested from Mathura while going to Hathras on October 5. He said the FIR was lodged with Math police station of Mathura in the matter, the ADG said.He said the lookout notice was issued after investigations revealed that Rauf was in frequent touch with two of the four persons, Atiq-ur-Rehman and Masood, after the Hathras incident in September. He said Shareef provided funds as well as made other arrangements to incite violence.According to the ADG, the probe also hinted that Shareef has been involved in generating funds from abroad and using them to create tension and incite violence in the country.The Uttar Pradesh police’s special task force has been investigating the matter after taking over the case on October 22. STF officials have claimed that they had collected much evidence since then to unravel the entire conspiracy to incite caste violence with the intention to create a law and order situation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leader-of-pfi-s-student-wing-held-in-kerala-hathras-funding-link-under-scanner/story-aKSaBQ04hlxBVdOqHY1wsL.html

13-12-2020||India||TRP manipulation case: Republic TV CEO Vikas Khanchandani arrested in Mumbai||The Mumbai Police on Sunday arrested Republic TV CEO Vikas Khanchandani in connection with its probe into the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam.Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police (crime) confirmed the arrest. Khanchandani will be produced in the court today. He was previously questioned by the investigators two times.During the crime branch’s probe, it was revealed that some cable operators had used dual LCN (Landing Channel Number) technology which allowed viewing of one channel on two channel numbers at a time.The Republic TV officials also contacted cable operators to fix LCN and LCN promotion. Khanchandani knew everything as he was part of Republic’s internal WhatsApp group where discussions about LCN and Promotion LCN discussions took place, police sources said.The fake TRP scam came to light in October when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.Hansa is one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes or people’s meters.TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers.As per the police, some of these households were being bribed to tune into Republic TV and a few other channels.Republic TV has denied wrongdoing.Another of channel’s employee - western region distribution head Ghanshyam Singh - was arrested last month in connection with the alleged scam. He was granted bail earlier this month.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Mumbai Police has arrested a total of 13 persons in the case so far.Meanwhile, Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami moved the Bombay high court last week seeking a stay to further investigation by the Mumbai Police in the TRP manipulation scam.The petition, filed by Goswami and ARG Outlier Media which owns Republic TV, also alleged that one of the employees of the firm was tortured by the police in custody.It sought protection for all employees from the “malicious witch hunt” allegedly being carried out by the Maharashtra authorities.The Supreme Court had last Monday refused to entertain a plea filed by ARG Outlier Media Private Limited, which owns the Republic Media network, seeking protection for the group and its employees in the cases lodged against them in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-manipulation-case-republic-tv-ceo-vikas-khanchandani-arrested-in-mumbai/story-D2aRARk39yPFlEabLzOWTK.html

13-12-2020||India||Less than 500 daily deaths in India for 8 straight days: Covid data||Fewer patients are dying of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India and less than 500 daily deaths have been reported from across the country now for eight consecutive days.With 393 new deaths having been reported on Saturday, the total number of patients having succumbed to the viral infection in the country so far has reached 143,073.“India’s trajectory of active cases continues to follow a steadily dipping path. The total active caseload has dropped below 3.6 lakh (359,819) on Sunday. This has been made possible by the trend of recoveries exceeding new cases and low number of fatalities per day which have ensured a total net reduction of the active caseload,” said the Union health ministry in a statement.Ten states and Union Territories account for 78.05% of new deaths. Maharashtra has seen the maximum casualties (80). Delhi and West Bengal follow with 47 and 44 daily deaths, respectively. The other seven states are Kerala (29), Punjab (29), Haryana (23), Himachal Pradesh (20), Tamil Nadu (17), Karnataka (17), and Uttar Pradesh (14).“India’s Covid-19 death rate has been among the lowest in the world. Even though there was a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in between, we managed to the keep the death rate low all throughout. The maximum it went up to about 3%, which was around June, and now it has dropped to about 1.4%,” said a senior health ministry official who did not wish to be identified. India has set a target of achieving 1% or below case fatality rate (CFR) due to Covid-19.Two key interventions that have lead to the low death rate have been increased in Covid-19 testing, and standardizing clinical management of patients.India’s tests per million population recently crossed the 100,000 mark, with the country performing at least one million tests daily in more than 2,000 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved laboratories across the country. “We now know a lot more about the disease than we knew at the beginning of the outbreak. Government guidelines have been updated keeping in view the changing treatment trends. This has helped significantly in managing patients, and which is why we are losing fewer patients to the disease now,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital.Also, India’s present active caseload consists of just 3.66% of total positive cases, according to the government data. The new recoveries of 33,494 reported on Sunday have led to a net decline of 3,930 in the total active cases.About 75% of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 States and Union Territories.Kerala has reported the maximum number of single day recoveries with 4,748 newly recovered cases. And 2,873 people recovered in West Bengal followed by 2,774 in Maharashtra.Apart from these three other states with high case recoveries are Rajasthan (2,768), Chhattisgarh (2,477), Delhi (2,402), Uttar Pradesh (1,875), Haryana (1,812), Karnataka (1,807), and Gujarat (1,403).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-than-500-daily-deaths-in-india-for-8-straight-days-covid-data/story-yOuMkh40QwQfnvYNmbxDhL.html

13-12-2020||India||2001 Parliament attack: When terror struck India’s temple of democracy||Sunday, December 13, will mark 19 years since the deadly attack on Parliament by terrorist groups linked to Pakistan. Senior Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) leader LK Advani who was then the home minister called the attack “the most audacious, and also the most alarming, act of terrorism”.On this day in 2001, a five-member suicide squad comprising Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists attacked Parliament house, while the Lok Sabha was in session: the Houses were adjourned at the time of the attack, but several parliamentarians and staff were present inside the building.The attackers came in an Ambassador car, and were able to gain entry because of a forged government sticker. But as the car moved inside the Parliament complex, one of the staff members became suspicious. The vehicle was thus forced to turn back and in the course, hit then vice president Krishan Kant’s vehicle.Read more| We will never forget the cowardly attack on our Parliament, tweets PM ModiThe gunmen, armed with AK-47s and grenades, then got down and opened fire. The attack lasted for about 30 minutes, and all the five terrorists were neutralised outside the building itself. However, five security personnel of Delhi Police, one woman constable of the CRPF and two security assistants of Parliament Watch and Ward section died preventing the entry of terrorists into Parliament House. A gardener and a photojournalist too lost their lives.BJP leader L K Advani said in the Lok Sabha that the attack “was executed jointly by Pakistan-based and supported terrorist outfits, namely, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. These two organisations are known to derive their support and patronage from Pak ISI.”Within days, four people were arrested and charged as masterminds of the attack. The case against the four - Mohammed Afzal Guru, Shaukat Hussain, Afsan Guru and SAR Geelani - went on for about a decade, with the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court eventually acquitting two, and upholding the death sentence of one.Geelani, a professor in Delhi University, was acquitted for “need of evidence” by the Delhi high court in 2003, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005. Afsan Guru, too, was cleared of charges and Hussain served jail time. Afzal Guru was hanged in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2001-parliament-attack-when-terror-struck-india-s-temple-of-democracy/story-8juWPlu7D7ox6mMyFSjcII.html
13-12-2020||India||TMC MP claims pulling out 3 IPS officers from Bengal akin to ‘indirect emergency’||Alleging political vendetta, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government a day after the Union home ministry called three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers back on central deputation. “The centre is indirectly trying to impose emergency and is keeping IAS and IPS officers under coercion. The three IPS officers were on duty that day (on December 10 when Nadda’s convoy was attacked) and yesterday. They received letters from the MHA. The vindictive attitude is clear,” said Kalyan Banerjee, senior advocate and the chief whip of the TMC in the Lok Sabha. The Union home ministry on Saturday called three IPS officers, responsible for Nadda’s security, back on central deputation from West Bengal. The move comes in the backdrop of a BJP convoy, including Nadda’s vehicle, being attacked in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. “The convoy of a person enjoying Z-category security has a pilot car and a tail car. If any other vehicle wants to enter that convoy the local police needs to be informed and permission needs to be taken. Here no permission was taken. There were 50 two-wheelers and as many cars ahead and behind Nadda’s convoy,” said Banerjee in a letter written to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla.Leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit hit back at Banerjee saying that he has no jurisdiction over the issue as it relates to the relation between the Centre and the state. “Who is Banerjee? Is he someone from the state government? No. Is he someone from the centre? No. He is an MP of the state’s ruling party. What is he trying to prove? Is it so that the chief minister has no answer and that’s why she is asking her MPs, who is not related to the matter, to respond? The letter might have been thrown into the dustbin by now. The Centre had on Friday asked chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and director general of police Virendra to appear before it on December 14. “Under no law, can the centre summon the officers. The executive powers of the Union government can only be exercised only in cases under the union list and concurrent list. Law and order is in the state list of the seventh schedule. The executive power can’t be exercised here,” Banerjee had said. The TMC MP has sent a letter to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla protesting the MHA’s letter which asked the state chief secretary to release three IPS officers for central deputation. He alleged that that the Union home secretary sought meeting with the state’s chief secretary and director general of police on the instructions of Union home minister Amit Shah. “It is shameful and dangerous that all laws have been thrown out in the river by your action at the instance of Amit Shah, BJP leader and home minister of India. Your every path suffers from mala fide exercise of power,” Banerjee wrote in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-claims-pulling-out-3-ips-officers-from-bengal-akin-to-indirect-emergency/story-hbXAVQUcgmEiBBG5VKlXYL.html

During his four-day schedule, Haasan will visit Madurai, Theni, Dindugul, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Kanniyakumari districts. Earlier last month, Haasan had said that his party would emerge as the “third front” in Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu set to go to polls early next year, the political climate in the state is heating up. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) have announced that their alliance shall continue. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress are on track to fight the elections together. On December 3, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth also said on Twitter that he will launch his political party in January next year, adding that announcement about it will be made on December 31. The 69-year-old actor-turned-politician’s entry in politics had been speculated for over 25 years and his decision came three days after he held a meeting with the office-bearers and members of Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), a platform created three years ago to facilitate his entry into active politics. In 2017, Rajinikanth had announced that his party would contest on its own. On November 3, Kamal Haasan also declared that the party’s alliance is with the people, ruling out any partnership with AIADMK or the DMK. Haasan launched MNM in February 2018 but the party did create a stir in last year’s Lok Sabha elections. Although, the actor-politician has always managed to stay in the headlines. He recently slammed Tamil Nadu’s ruling party, the AIADMK, for supporting the three controversial farm bills and stressed the bills “attack the state’s autonomy”, and create a “dangerous situation wherein a state can do nothing amid scarcity or price rise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-haasan-to-launch-election-campaign-for-2021-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections/story-aQnxAeRHo243RPhfwJcEMJ.html

AIMIM, after winning five seats in recently held Bihar polls, had announced that it would contest the West Bengal assembly elections. A delegation of West Bengal unit of AIMIM, comprising leaders from all 23 districts, held a meeting with Owaisi in Hyderabad, where discussions to prepare the party’s poll strategy for the upcoming polls were held. “Owaisi is expected to come to West Bengal very soon. We would be contesting the elections in West Bengal. The state election committee would be formed soon. Owaisi is expected to announce the election committee and numbers of seats we would contest, during his visit,” said Asim Waqar, AIMIM spokesperson and the party’s Bengal coordinator. Muslims accounted for West Bengal’s 27.01% population as per the 2011 census and the community plays a decisive role in 120 out of 294 assembly seats in the state, according to surveys by the BJP and election strategist Prashant Kishor’s I-Pac. Even though Owaisi’s critics say AIMIM will end up splitting the votes and thus help the BJP, which is eyeing for around 200 out of the 294 seats in the state assembly, both the TMC and the BJP, however, said that the AIMIM won’t be a factor. Also Read: CAA will be implemented in Bengal soon: Kailash Vijayvargiya“Owaisi belongs to Hyderabad.

It also happened in Bihar. We are not concerned with Owaisi. Many people from AIMIM are joining the TMC because he has been unmasked,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP. AIMIM will not be able to make any difference in Bengal. Here the fight is between the TMC and the BJP. People want to get rid of the TMC and BJP will come to power,” said Samik Bhattacharya, spokesperson of the BJP’s state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-setting-up-election-machinery-in-bengal-bjp-tmc-play-down-threat/story-jsbSNbLZ7BJTzhuB0QqGNL.html

The Delhi Traffic Police has also deployed its personnel across important border points to ensure commuters do not face difficulties and is also constantly updating people about open and closed routes on its Twitter handle.The police in Gurugram, where the Delhi-Jaipur highway passes from, too have prepared route diversion plans. THe important points have been identified on National Highway 48, like Sirhaul toll plaza, Iffcco Chowk, Bilaspur Chowk, and the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway.Overall, more than 2,000 police officials have been deployed across different parts of the city for managing law and order as well as traffic at key points.The police said they were prepared to take measures for any untoward incident and were standing along the highway with barricades, batons and shields, to take immediate action.Meanwhile, Union minister Som Prakash, who is among the government representatives negotiating with the farmers protesting against three new farm laws, on Saturday said efforts are being made to call the next round of meeting with the leaders of the agitation soon to end the stalemate.Also Read: Farmers feel the chill at bordersAsserting that the government is ready for discussions anytime, Prakash, the minister of state for commerce and industries and an MP from Punjab, said the Centre is “concerned” about the protesting farmers and urged them to come to the discussion table.The farmer leaders, however, said they are ready to hold talks with the government, but will first discuss repealing the three new farm laws.At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-to-intensify-protest-threaten-to-block-delhi-jaipur-highway-today/story-B1OplgZMzqHFK10RwXivpN.html
13-12-2020||India||‘Reforms aimed at increasing competition’: Tomar||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar says the government is committed to reforming farm markets, and hopes that recalcitrant farm unions will eventually see the benefits of the three laws passed in September and join a dialogue with the Narendra Modi administration. Protesting farmers have rejected the amendments offered by the government to the three laws, saying they would settle for nothing less than the repeal of the Acts, but Tomar said in an interview with Hindustan Times that their essence remains. “The reforms will continue. Take for instance contract farming, it is aimed at ensuring a guaranteed price for their {farmers’} produce, security of their farming land, increase private investment, and addresses the issue of globally followed agricultural practices,” Tomar said.Those who believe in status quo can’t make history: Narendra Singh TomarThe government has done whatever it could to address the concerns of the farmers, Tomar said. “We have made that attempt through the amendments. It is also our duty to do so. The reforms were aimed at increasing competition; so far only licensed traders could buy in the mandis, now everyone can. As competition increases, the farmers will get better remuneration. It is also natural that when the farmers are protesting and there are some concerns that they have, it is our duty to allay their fears and address their concerns.”Tomar described as “baseless” the concern that corporate entities may grab farmers’ land. “So far in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Karnataka contract farming is already being practised...no one’s land has been grabbed. In the act we have made a provision that the farmer can opt out of the contract, but the buyers cannot; they cannot renege on the contract and if they do, then they have to pay a penalty of 150%.”Asked whether the BJP was worried about the electoral impact of the farm laws, Tomar replied: “It is imperative that when we go out to do something good there is a period of struggle and pain. Itihaas wohi banate hai jo itihaas se aage nikal jaate hai (those who move ahead of times make history) and those who believe in status quo cannot make history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforms-aimed-at-increasing-competition-tomar/story-AtYDG00G0KspGiXCzjh17H.html
13-12-2020||India||New laws meant to make farmers prosperous: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday strongly defended three laws enacted by his government to open up agricultural trade that he said would attract investment and technology, open up alternative markets and boost farm incomes, as farmers massed at the borders of Delhi vowed to step up protests against the legislation.In a speech at the annual meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Modi said the farm sector reforms enacted in September were part of government efforts to remove roadblocks impeding agriculture, pledging his commitment to protecting the interest and welfare of farmers. “Reforms will help draw investment in the agriculture sector and benefit farmers,” the PM said by video link.“The aim of all government reforms is to make farmers prosperous. The new legislation, which was approved in the previous Parliament session, gives farmers an additional option outside of the designated mandis to buy or sell their crops.” The recent laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers. Modi attempted to allay such concerns, which have brought farmers from Punjab and other parts of northern India to the doorsteps of Delhi, blocking key highways .Farmers’ unions have vowed to expand their protests unless the government scraps the new farm laws. “Farmers have now options to sell their crops in mandis as well as to outside parties,” the prime minister said. “While mandis are being modernised, a digital platform is also available to farmers to buy and sell their produce.”“All these efforts are directed towards improving the farmers’ income so that they become prosperous. When farmers prosper, the country will prosper,” he added. “After the implementation of recent reforms, farmers will get new markets and new opportunities and they will get help of technology. The country’s cold storage infrastructure will become modern,” the PM added. “From all these, there will be higher investment in the agriculture sector. The maximum benefit of these reforms would be to small and marginal farmers who earn their living from small holdings of land.” Modi said economic growth in the 21st century would be supported by villages and small towns and so entrepreneurs should look to invest in these places. “They should not miss the opportunity. The investment made by you will open new avenues for people in the villages. Policies of the government are designed to promote rural, agriculture-based economy.”Even as Modi held out an olive branch to the farmers, minister for railways, commerce and industry and food and consumer affairs Piyush Goyal alleged that the protests no longer remain a farmers’ movement. He said Leftist and Maoist elements had infiltrated the campaign and were demanding the release of those jailed for anti-national activities. This, he said, was clearly aimed at derailing the agricultural reforms introduced by the government. “We now realise that the so-called farmers’ agitation hardly remains a farmers’ agitation. It has almost got infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements, a flavour of which we saw over the last two days when there were extraneous demands to release people who have been put behind bars for anti-national...activities,” Goyal said at the FICCI meeting. “I would urge all well-meaning business leaders and all well-meaning intellectuals who are involved with FICCI, who are on this webcast, to talk about the benefits of these farm laws, to understand the laws. Should you have any apprehension, please talk to us,” Goyal said. Responding to Goyal’s remarks, former Ficci president and vice-chairman of Bharti Enterprises Rajan Bharti Mittal said: “Clearly, you can see when you do the tough reforms like the farm bills, please don’t step back. The industry will back you.” The opposition Congress on Saturday accused the Modi government of branding every person opposing it a Maoist and an anti-national, and urged the Centre to accept the demands of the protesting farmers.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “Mr. Modi, autocracy has no place in democracy. Yours and your ministers’ policy is to declare every opponent a Maoist and an anti-national.” “Apologise to the farmers who are on a sit-in braving the fierce cold and rains, and accede to their rightful demands immediately,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Farmers picketed toll plazas in Haryana, not allowing people manning the booths to collect fees from motorists. More than 100 farmers led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Malkit Singh and Manish Chaudhry gathered at a toll plaza on the Ambala-Hisar highway, around 15 kilometers from Ambala city. In Punjab, toll charges are not being collected from commuters as farmers have been staging sit-ins at toll plazas since October 1. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is suffering a loss of ₹3 crore per day on account of farmers’ protest at toll plazas in the state. There are 25 toll plazas on national highways in Punjab. Meanwhile, Delhi police on Saturday increased deployment of its men and placed more concrete barriers on border points; farmers have announced that they will intensify their protests by blocking the Delhi-Jaipur highway and the Yamuna Expressway. Social activist Yogendra Yadav, who is part of the ongoing protests, said farmers from areas in Rajasthan and Haryana were assembling on Saturday and their “Delhi Chalo” march would begin on Sunday. “Farmers’ ‘Delhi march’ on Jaipur-Delhi highway will not start today and it will begin from Shahjahanpur border tomorrow. Today, farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana will congregate in Kotputli and Behror,” Yadav tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-meant-to-make-farmers-prosperous-modi/story-mcMQlbiooPj2fAoo0eaVTI.html

Most states have recorded significant improvements in sexual and reproductive health indicators, including mother and child health, universal immunization, use of contraceptives and other family planning methods compared to NFHS-4 (2015-16), shows data on from 17 states and five union territories released on Saturday. ‘Reforms aimed at increasing competition’: TomarWomen are more empowered than they were in 2015-16, with all states recording a marked increase in the number of women with a bank or savings account that they use. Among large states, in Bihar the women with bank and savings accounts trebled in five years, from 26.4% in 2015-16 to 76.7% in 2019-20. In Maharashtra, it rose from 45.3% to 72.8%, in West Bengal from 43.5% to 76.5% in corresponding period. “Phase-1 results include data on 131 indictors and covers roughly half of the total 7 lakh households surveyed using the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) software, which ensures quality data collection and ensures there is no ambiguity in the results,” said Professor KS James, director, International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, which is the nodal authority for conducting the survey. Heart patients, diabetics may get doses on priority“The final report is likely to come out in May 2021 as we had to suspend data-collection because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in the end of March. But it has restarted now and the fact sheet with data of around 400 indicators from all states and UTS {Union territories} will be ready by May,” said Professor James. Most states registered a decline in the number of women who had experienced spousal violence (domestic violence) or sexual violence before the age of 18 in the 18-29 age group, found the survey. India, however, continues to struggle to improve the nutritional status of children and adults. “The findings from previous NFHS rounds were instrumental in framing several policies to tackle various issues in maternal and child health, adolescent health, child protection etc,” said Vandana Gurnani, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, and mission director, National Health Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-schemes-help-country-fare-better-on-wellness-index-survey/story-EjahPgJCJql5k0oEvWIceK.html
13-12-2020||India||Classify social media as news media, subject them to journalistic standards, says SC judge||To curb dissemination of fake news and bots in the digital age, there is a need to classify social media platforms as news media and subject them to the same journalistic standards, Supreme Court judge S Ravindra Bhat said on Saturday.Justice Bhat even questioned the neutrality maintained by such platforms in claiming no responsibility for content shared by users on these platforms. Singhu border: Farmers protest by day, watch religious films by night“In reality, as systems that mediate between users, social media platforms can never be neutral. Algorithms shape how people communicate and what information is presented to what participants in what manner and at what time,” he said. Justice Bhat was delivering the sixth justice VR Krishna Iyer memorial lecture on the topic Rule of Law in the Digital Age – A Constitutional Framework organized by the Sarada Krishna Sadgamaya Foundation for Law and Justice.Expanding his thoughts on the broad spectrum of digital platform and the need for digital constitutional governance, justice Bhat rued the fact that as more digital information was getting transacted, the dependence for news on social media platforms has increased. Farm to Facebook: Stir at borders gets online push“People source news from social media. By itself, it is not bad. But news disseminated (on these platforms) is not factual…..Fake news and planting bots have triggered riots that leads to public mischief.”In the US, almost 50% of the population sources news from social media. In India too, the social media is getting significantly relevant. “Minimally a consensus is emerging that these social media platforms be re-classified as news media and held to the same journalistic standards of truth while publicly disclosing their advertisers, political funders and conflicts of interest.”The judge remarked that these “data-fuelled giants” have business models that rely on selling their users’ personal information to advertisers. A move to identify the advertisers behind the social media has been initiated recently by Australia.The judge also spoke on another area of concern in the digital sector with growing decentralization of government services to private players. With the growth of e-commerce market spaces, payment interfaces, and online apps, consumers are subjected to terms and conditions with no judicial oversight. “This assertion that digital platforms are fully private spaces needs to be questioned in the present context where they play a significant role in governing everyday life and take over the provision of services and sectors that have been serviced by the government and now are the only players for long years,” justice Bhat said. On these platforms, there is no protection for users from unilateral changes in rules, inadequate privacy safeguards, and lack of appeal against grievance redressal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/classify-social-media-as-news-media-subject-them-to-journalistic-standards-says-sc-judge/story-M1DmbTYY652EUittMuUx0I.html
13-12-2020||India||Heart patients, diabetics may get doses on priority||Indians with heart ailments, hypertension or diabetes are likely to be classified as those with comorbidities and will be put on the list of those who will get a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine on a priority basis, officials involved in the vaccine plan said on Saturday. The officials added that there will also be a door-to-door survey across the country and existing government databases will be used to identify such people. The household surveys will also be for those above 50. People who fall in these two categories have been identified by the government as those from the general public who will get access to a vaccine first, besides health workers and frontline service staff such as police and municipal employees. Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine can be available in 1st half of next year: Official“The voter list already provides us the age-wise profile of the people in a locality. We have to conduct a door-to-door survey to reconfirm the names and also find out comorbidities. Anganwadi workers and Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) would be tapped for this purpose,” said one of these officials, asking not to be named. The three categories of people will together account for roughly 300 million of India’s population of 1.3 billion people, the government estimates. The comorbidities identified include a clutch of diseases that raise the likelihood of a patient having a serious or even a fatal outcome if he or she contract the coronavirus disease.“The list is being worked on by a panel headed by Dr Randeep Guleria, the head of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), to finalise which ailments would be included in the list of comorbidities,” the person quoted above said. Americans will receive Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 from Monday: OfficialAccording to the National Family Health Survey-4, at least 5.8% of women and 8% men across India are projected to have high blood sugar, which raises their risk of becoming diabetic. The survey also found the prevalence of hypertension to be around 13.6% among the male population and 8.8% among the female population. In terms of heart diseases, a 2018 study published in The Lancet journal found that cardiovascular disease caused more than 2.1 million deaths in India in 2015 at all ages, reflecting the widespread prevalence of heart ailments. According to the officials quoted above, the process of identifying people with comorbidities through surveys will be in addition to multiple government databases where such information is also recorded. At present, these include records under the Ayushman Bharat policy, those collected during Covid-19 testing and household surveys and the self-reported information from the Aarogya Setu mobile application.People who have had any Covid-19 test have been required to declare their Aadhaar numbers as well as details of whether they suffer from any comorbid conditions – this data will also be taken into account, the person quoted above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heart-patients-diabetics-may-get-doses-on-priority/story-iwAXliWji2XDdZgDjDE9zL.html
13-12-2020||India||Those who believe in status quo can’t make history: Narendra Singh Tomar||The government’s offer to make amendments to the new farm laws has not resulted in a breakthrough with the protesting farmers, but agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he is hopeful that farmers will recognise the benefits of the reforms. The government has said it was ready for talks and hopes that genuine farmers’ unions will step forward to find a solution through dialogue, Tomar said in an interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran. Edited excerpts:Amendments proposed by the government dilute the reforms, which are necessary for growth of agriculture. You are also ready to bring an amendment to allow states to levy a cess on private markets. Since you have yielded so much, why not repeal the laws?The essence of the laws is still there. But whatever we could do to find ways to resolve the concerns of farmers has been done. We have made that attempt through the amendments. The reforms were aimed at increasing competition; so far only licensed traders could buy in the mandis, now everyone can. As competition increases, the farmers will get better remuneration. Security up as farmers’ stir likely to intensifyThe reforms will continue. Take for instance contract farming, it is aimed at ensuring a guaranteed price for their produce, security of their farming land, increase private investment, and addresses the issue of globally followed agricultural practices. WATCH | Farmers intensify protests as PM Modi hails farm laws againFarmers fear that the reforms benefit corporate entities more.The fear that it will take away their land is baseless. So far in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Karnataka contract farming is already being practised. So far no one’s land has been grabbed. In the act we have made a provision that the farmer can opt out of the contract, but the buyers cannot and if they do, then they have to pay a penalty of 150%. Do you blame the Congress for instigating the farmers?I have always said this about the Congress that they have to leave behind their dual-faced politics. They spoke about these reforms in their election manifesto; when the UPA {United Progressive Alliance} was in power they made attempts to introduce these reforms, but could not because of dabav and prabhav (pressure and influence) (of allies). PM [Narendra] Modi Ji does not give in to pressure or influence. Either the Congress party was trying to mislead the country when they mentioned these reforms in their manifesto or they are trying to mislead the country now by opposing them. New laws meant to make farmers prosperous: ModiOpposition parties wanted the farm laws to be debated more and sent to a select committee. Why was the government reluctant? The government did not shy away from discussions, but there was no need to send it to the select committee. A select committee is not above Parliament. Four hours were spent debating these laws in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. All parties put forth their views. It was passed in Lok Sabha and in Rajya Sabha; when I rose to speak, some opposition MPs created a ruckus in the house and put a blot on the democratic process. What were they doing for four hours if they were not discussing it? They could have sat and heard the discussions and when voting took place they could’ve voted against it — that is how democracy works. It is a myth that there was no discussion...The farmers have demanded setting up of dedicated agri courts. Farmers are worried they might not be able to fight big corporate entities. There is no issue of dedicated courts. The Act provides for SDM {sub-divisional magistrate} to resolve problems within 30 days and there are no decisions that can be given against the farmer. They think the SDM will not be able to give justice, therefore, they should be given permission to go to court. If somebody wants to go to court, they can do so, but we want resolution to happen at the SDM’s level, quickly and without problems. The government does not have any ego in this. How would you describe the discussions held so far? Has there been any breakthrough? We have been successful in putting forth what we have to say. The unions have not been able to reach a decision because there is no consensus among them. I want to thank the media… in the last few days they have put out news which is very shocking… that there are many Left-affiliated elements that have infiltrated these protests. There are those who are seeking the release of those who are anti-national. These elements are not allowing the talks to come to fruition. Are those raising slogans for Sharjeel Imam farmers? These are Leftists who oppose every reform announced by Narendra Modi...It has become a fashion for them to oppose whatever good is being proposed to strengthen the country. Anti-Farm law activists deface Mahatma Gandhi statue in Washington; ‘Khalistani’ flags sightedThe anti CAA protests were called off after the court’s intervention. Do you think that is how you will be able to end this stalemate? I feel the genuine farmers’ unions will step forward and will take a decision in favour of the farmers. I have hope that they will do so. Is the BJP worried about the electoral impact this agitation will have?It is imperative that when we go out to do something good there is a period of struggle and pain.

13-12-2020||India||Non-farmers play a part in farm agitation too||They may not be directly engaged in farming themselves, but have emerged as prominent faces in the movement against three farm laws enacted by the government in September to open up trade in agriculture. They also have espoused the cause of cultivators over the years and are in the farmers’ fight purely out of a sense of activism. Take for instance Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who has been an activist and election expert and has dabbled in politics. On Saturday, Yadav was in Rajasthan to mobilise farmers of the state to join the protest.“I am here at the Rajasthan side of the border with Haryana to oversee arrangements for our programme to demonstrate on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. Thousands of more farmers will join, now that the wedding season and Rajasthan panchayat polls are over,” Yadav told HT.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could leave them at the mercy of private buyers.The solution to the protest at Delhi’s borders, where thousands have massed for almost three weeks, lies in repealing the laws, Yadav said, adding: “Agriculture needs reforms, but these are reforms that farmers have not sought.”Activist Kavitha Kuruganti, associated with the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), is equally firm that the laws are aimed more at promoting corporate interests. “The crux of the matter is that these laws are centered around big corporations, against the interests of farmers and consumers, both,” she said.Kiranjeet Singh Sekhon of the Kul Hind Kisan Federation said: “We demand repeal of anti-farmer laws,” adding, “All farmer unions have decided that we will fight till these farm laws are scrapped.”Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Dakaunda faction, claims that he has joined the farmers’ movement because the “new agricultural laws will ruin Punjab’s farmers and {farm} labourers.”“I want to stand by the working class as these laws have been made for the benefit of corporate houses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-farmers-play-a-part-in-farm-agitation-too/story-cRp6Q21ltduBgnhPzi90SJ.html
13-12-2020||India||Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine can be available in 1st half of next year: Official||Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine can be available in the country as early as the first half of next year, AstraZeneca Country President Gagandeep Singh said on Saturday.Speaking at the 93rd annual convention of industry chamber FICCI, he said that in the current pandemic the vaccine has to be made available broadly, equitably as well as in a timely manner.Pune-based Serum Institute of India is conducting clinical trials of Oxford University-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covishield in India.“We started working in April with Oxford University and currently we are hoping to get emergency use authorisation approved and that can potentially mean that we could have something which is available as early as the first half of 2021,” Singh said.In order to make the vaccine available in a time manner the entity has signed close to 3 billion dosages supply agreements across the world encompassing close to 160 countries, he noted.“On top of that due to the viral vector platform which is used to produce our vaccine, it can be manufactured on a relatively large scale and we are fortunate to partner with Serum which has one of the largest manufacturing capacities,” Singh said.More importantly, this vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at comfortable refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 degrees) which is very comfortable to handle, meaning it can be administered very rapidly across the country, he added.“That’s what we are hoping to do when we get approval from the authorities in India,” he added.Pfizer, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute have currently applied with the DCGI for emergency authorization of their vaccines in the country.Speaking at the event, Cadila Healthcare Chairman Pankaj R Patel said the phase two trial of the company’s vaccine has begun and the results have been encouraging.He said that the vaccine is stable and may not require very cold temperatures. Patel also said that the company would like to complete phase three trials before applying for the emergency authorisation. He noted that the company’s vaccine has been developed on a DNA platform so if the virus mutates, it should be able to come out with a new vaccine in a very short period of time.Bharat Biotech CMD Krishna Ella said that it has been crucial for the companies to protect the volunteers.He further said that the trials are completely transparent, and all data are enclosed. Ella noted that the company is conducting first kind of efficacy trial on its vaccine in the developing world. “We have long experience in vaccines. Covaxin can be given to a six-month baby as well to someone who is 65 years old. Safety profile of the vaccine will be extremely good and we have filed for an emergency authorisation and left it to the government to review all those things. We are giving whatever data they want. We have done everything according to international standards.” Earlier speaking at the same event, NITI Aayog Member VK Paul said there will be no pressure on the drug regulator on the Covid-19 vaccine approval and the final call on allowing its emergency use approval will be made on scientific principles. He also urged FICCI to work with the state governments to increase healthcare spending, enhance the human resources in healthcare by optimising the training in the private sector.He also asked the industry body to work towards building mental health capacities in the country and called for higher private sector participation in ramping up health infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxford-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-can-be-available-in-1st-half-of-next-year-official/story-wT77rKJLMGkm3rOl3WO4AK.html

Centennial India will not only meet its own targets but will also exceed your expectations.”The Climate Ambition Summit is hosted by the United Nations and the United Kingdom to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change which was adopted by 196 parties at 21st Conference of Parties in Paris, on December 12 2015, and entered into force on November 4, 2016. The important virtual summit being co-hosted by France in partnership with Chile and Italy will allow governments to present their commitment and compliance with the Paris Agreement.Ahead of the conference, India had underlined that it has been responsible to the commitments under the Paris Agreement but most of the developed world which is responsible for historical emissions hasn’t shown much progress. Financial commitment by developed countries to the tune of 11 trillion dollars to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change hasn’t come through yet, Prakash Javadekar, Union environment minister had said on Friday.“Five years after Paris we are still not going in the right direction. Paris promised to limit global temperature which rose to as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. The commitments made under Paris were far from enough to get there and even now those commitments are not being met. Today, we are 1.2 degrees hotter than we were before the industrial revolution. If we don’t change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees C this century. Can we still deny we are facing a climate emergency?” UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres asked at the Summit.“We are not doomed to fail. Covid-19 recovery presents an opportunity to set our economies and societies on a green path… the members of G20 are spending 50 per cent or more of their stimulus on sectors linked to fossil fuel consumption than on low carbon energy. This is unacceptable. This is a moral test. We cannot use trillions of dollars needed for covid recovery to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mounting debt on a broken planet. So the central objective by 2021 is to build a truly global coalition for carbon neutrality by the middle of the century. To make it a reality we need meaningful cuts now,” Guterres added.The occasion was marked by some important announcements like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said UK will provide 11.6 billion pounds of our overseas aid to support green technology. I call on leaders worldwide to declare a State of Climate Emergency in their countries until carbon neutrality is reached.Five years after the #ParisAgreement, we are still not going in the right direction.Let’s make the promise of a net zero world a reality. pic.twitter.com/pspktHxQc4Also read: Israel, Bhutan establish formal diplomatic relations“When I was a child of six, UK depended on coal for 70 per cent of our needs now that is down to 3 per cent. Since 1990 UK has cut CO2 to emissions by 43 per cent more than any other G20 economy and yet our economy has grown by 75 per cent and today we are putting our foot to the accelerator. We want to turn the UK to Saudi Arabia of wind power by 2030… we are liberating the potential for hydrogen; on vehicles, we are going to ban new internal combustion engines by 2030, we will continue to develop new nuclear power,” he said.Italy announced 30 million Euros for climate adaptation. China called for raising of ambition and fostering a new architecture of climate governance where every party does their part. “I had announced in September that we will enhance our NDCs. We will peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Today we are making further announcements…” said Chinese President Xi Jinping.China would cut CO2 per unit of GDP by 65 per cent by 2030, from 2005 levels and boost the share of non-fossil fuel energy to 25 per cent of primary energy demand by 2030. “China always honours commitments,” he said.Reacting to India’s steps to achieve Paris Agreement goals, Ulka Kelkar, director, climate program, World Resources Institute India said, “While many countries have announced net-zero pledges, developed countries need to urgently provide the promised $100 billions of climate finance, especially for building resilience and adapting to climate impacts. Every dollar invested in adaptation can yield up to $10 in economic benefits. In the ongoing pandemic, economic stimulus packages are providing only $2 to clean energy for every $3 to fossil fuels – this needs to be urgently reconsidered and greater support provided to building low carbon infrastructure,” she said.“India needs to continue prioritizing measures like early warning systems, disaster-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture, mangrove protection, and water conservation,” she added.In a statement delivered on Saturday, incoming US president Joe Biden said the US will increase its domestic emissions reduction target and commit to a 2050 net-zero goal, building on new climate plans by the EU and UK this week. Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan announced his country will not construct any new coal power plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-achieve-targets-exceed-expectations-pm-modi-at-un-climate-ambition-summit/story-HcCMw1iA9oZYNUDretWLaJ.html

13-12-2020||Editorials||The politics of farm protests | HT Editorial||The protests against the agrarian laws represent a significant moment in mass political mobilisation in India. There is no doubt that this is a genuine mass movement, especially in Punjab where across classes and the political divide, there is an overwhelming mood against the agricultural reforms. The government’s concessions, farm leaders have decided, are not enough and nothing less than a repeal would do — and with that objective, have intensified their protests. The government, on the other hand, believes that the movement has been taken over by “political” elements which are not interested in a solution.While the strengths of the farm movement are clear, the problem with the movement is not too much politics, but too little politics. Politics entails different elements, and agitation is only one of them. Good politics also involves the ability to negotiate, reconcile the demands of a movement with the possibilities of what can be attained, a recognition of the balance of power, and when to declare victory. This element of politics is missing in the farm movement. Once the protests escalated, and the government had no choice but to engage and offer concessions, good political leadership among protesters would have meant leveraging the moment. Symbolically claiming that a government led by a strong prime minister had to eventually listen to them, and substantially recognising that there is now a more equal playing field between mandis and markets with private traders and an assurance of continued minimum support price, would have helped calm tempers.But the fact that this political leadership is missing is visible in the competitive radicalism of the different unions which constitute the protests. No one wants to be seen as “compromising” for fear of being seen as “sold out” to the government or corporates — and no group has the courage to tell the farmers, whose fears they have stoked in the past four months, that the deal on offer is reasonable. Movements without this kind of political character often make the mistake of overreach and lose ground. The farm movement has brought the issue of the future of agriculture and the security of farmers to the centre stage; it has forced the government to climb down; it now needs to declare victory — perhaps after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself — and allow the political process to continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-politics-of-farm-protests/story-41RpTvj6xhVlLKt8caJCHM.html
13-12-2020||Editorials||Focus on people, not the population | HT Editorial||The Centre has left no room for ambiguity in its submission to the Supreme Court that it is against enforcing the two-child norm. This was in response to a public interest litigation by a lawyer seeking to introduce a population control law on the grounds that basic amenities such as health, education and rights to clean air and drinking water could not be secured without limiting family size. The Centre’s response sends a clear signal to many politicians who have advocated restricting family size that it will have no truck with such sentiments.India’s family planning programme has been voluntary and non-coercive, a tribute to the State’s commitment to personal liberty and democracy. And this has largely been successful. India’s population trajectory has been encouraging— according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-2016), the total fertility rate for urban India was 1.8, for rural India 2.4, for women with no schooling 3.4 and 1.7 for women with 12 years or more education. The required fertility rate is 1.8 for India and it stands at 2.2 at present, just above the replacement fertility level of 2.1 which is the mark of population stabilisation.These figures indicate that education and health care are the most crucial inputs to reducing the population. It is a myth that the poor want more children. They have more children as they often have no access to reversible contraception methods, the cafeteria approach which the National Population Policy 2000 advocates. The Centre’s stand that family size is a personal right is welcome and sends out the message that if you take care of people, the population will take care of itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/focus-on-people-not-the-population-ht-editorial/story-gLt4JCqLUZLJA5CWUqCt3L.html
