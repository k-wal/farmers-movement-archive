10-12-2020||News||Agriculture as a shock-absorber||The slew of agricultural reforms initiated by the government has led to a vigorous discussion in the media about the pros and cons of these policy changes. Most of these discussions have focused on agriculture as an activity that provides farmers with a regular source of income. The arguments have engaged mainly with the question of whether these reforms would increase these incomes, if agriculture became more commercialised.In all these discussions however, there is one important aspect that has got largely overlooked — the role of agriculture as an informal social safety net, specifically in times of crisis. To be clear, there are two types of safety nets that are needed in developing countries. The first is a protection against chronic poverty and unemployment in normal times. This is the objective behind Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the largest State-sponsored formal programme of this type. The second provides protection against a sudden crisis, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. As we found out when the pandemic broke out, we do not have a formal State-financed social safety net infrastructure that is adequate for such a situation.Safety nets for crisis situations are critical for developing economies that have adopted a market-led growth strategy. Markets are useful in driving higher rates of growth over time, but they are also much more vulnerable to many types of shocks. Since poor and vulnerable citizens do not have adequate savings for these hard times, these shocks expose them to health and even life risks during these periods. In the absence of formal safety nets, they turn to informal community-based support systems. In India, a significant section of wage earners who work in small towns or large cities still have their links with their villages intact. For these people, agriculture and allied sectors in their villages remain the informal safety net — a source of income if a crisis shuts down their principal livelihood in urban areas. For those who have lost these rural family links, the only alternative during these crises remains the informal retail sector — the fruit and vegetable carts.The importance of agriculture as an informal social safety net became clear during the reverse migration that India experienced after the imposition of the first lockdown. The long and arduous journeys that hundreds of thousands of people undertook were obviously extremely risky. The only reason so many migrants took such a decision was based on their trust that the agricultural sector would save their lives. In his book, How Asia Works, Joe Studwell describes a similar phenomenon in Taiwan during the first oil crisis in the mid-1970s, where close to 200,000 factory workers returned to farming. Such temporary reverse migrations in slack periods are also common in China. In contrast to these experiences, Studwell suggests that countries ranging from 18th-century Britain to the Philippines in recent times, which are characterised by larger-scale farming, have ended up with “legions of indigent poor or acres of squatter camps”. Another example of this phenomenon is contemporary South Africa, which has a significantly large group of poor and vulnerable people. But agriculture in South Africa is in the hand of a few large farms and plantation owners and, as a result, it fails as an informal social safety net. One of the effects of this is high crime rates in South African cities.So what does all of this mean for India and, more specifically, for our agricultural policies? The reforms initiated by the government are an attempt to move the agricultural sector away from the current institutional arrangements controlled by the arhtiyas towards more corporatised agricultural marketing. This is a change that is inevitable, given the market-led growth strategy that we have adopted since the 1990s. As agriculture becomes more corporatised — with the participation of large retail companies as their clients — farms will also be forced to consolidate. The logic of such consolidation is in the interest of both the corporate buyers and the farms. Large retail companies will prefer to deal with larger farms in order to cut their procurement costs. Farmers, on the other hand, will be under pressure to consolidate in order to bargain more effectively with these companies. There are various ways through which this change in average farm size can and will happen. Over time, this will lead to more families moving out of agriculture and agriculture becoming more capital and technology-intensive. One important fallout of this change is that the sector will lose its ability to provide a social safety net to the poor and vulnerable, in times of a crisis.This possibility, however, does not justify turning our backs to market-led reforms in agriculture. We just need to recognise that commercialised agricultural development will become a risky social project unless it is accompanied with the development of formal State-sponsored social safety net mechanisms on a comparable scale. This is an enormous administrative exercise that will need to identify the vulnerable and implement mechanisms to reach them in time. If we commercialise agriculture but fail to build these alternative safety nets, the next economic shock will lead to a costly urban crisis in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/agriculture-as-a-shock-absorber/story-hrMUyJPhazs666xOJ0NHyH.html
10-12-2020||News||Confronting everyday sources of pollution across the country||The annual November smog in the National Capital Region (NCR) frames the air pollution crisis — its scale, sources and solutions — in ways that undermine the long-term efforts needed. Instead of letting this episodic manifestation guide policy action, we must focus on tackling the less visible, everyday air pollution across the country.Delhi-NCR’s pollution levels witness two pronounced spikes every year — between late-October to mid-November, and again from late-December to mid-January. The first spike is attributable to stubble burning adding to the “baseload” of emissions from year-round sources that are unable to disperse due to stable meteorological conditions. The second spike is almost entirely due to the baseload and conditions being conducive to the formation of “secondary particles” from gaseous pollutants emitted by power plants, industries and vehicles in the region. Increased burning of wood and other solid fuels for heating is also an important factor during this time.Alarming as these spikes are, we should not make them the threshold for what is deemed unacceptable, and normalise objectively high levels of pollution otherwise. Consider the first week of December this year. The air quality index (AQI) remained either “very poor” or “severe” (in other words, more than twice the national standards) in Kanpur and Lucknow all seven days, and in Patna for six days. In NCR, Ghaziabad witnessed “severe” AQI on six days, while levels in Delhi and Gurugram were “very poor” throughout. Howrah in West Bengal and Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh also experienced either “poor” or “very poor” air quality throughout the week. Indeed, air quality in much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain is “poor” or worse for half the year.Our fixation with the November smog, therefore, misleads the way we approach this national public health crisis in three fundamental ways. First, although over three-fourths of India’s population breathes air that does not meet the national standards, apocalyptic levels for a few weeks in the capital become the defining feature of the crisis. Instead, the defining feature ought to be the sheer everyday nature of it, across the country. Research shows that the average exposure to air pollution is similar in rural and urban India. Given that two-thirds of our population is rural, a whopping 75% of the 1.1 million deaths attributable to air pollution in India occur in villages, as per a Health Effects Institute assessment in 2018. Yet, in terms of monitoring air quality, rural areas remain a blindspot. In the absence of official data, the rural air pollution crisis does not get due acknowledgment, let alone proportionate attention.Second, episodic sources get disproportionate blame, and year-round sources insufficient scrutiny. To be clear, stubble burning is certainly an important contributor in NCR for the few weeks during late October-mid November. But seen over the course of the year, this is only one of the major sources in the region, alongside vehicles, industries, and power plants, waste burning, and dust re-suspended due to vehicular movement and from construction activities. At a national level, household burning of solid fuels for cooking and other purposes forms the single largest source of outdoor pollution exposure, in addition to causing pollution indoors. All these sources need to be tackled in parallel to see meaningful improvements in air quality, in Delhi and elsewhere in India.Third, it results in an excessive emphasis on emergency responses, and on entirely misguided and unscientific tech-fixes such as smog towers. The only way to reduce air pollution is to cut emissions at the source, throughout the year. Since the sources are so different from each other, the agencies responsible and the types of interventions needed also vary substantially. Developing effective sectoral policies and ensuring that these are implemented well require resources, systematic planning, and political will.The onset of the November smog should be thought of as a symptom, not the disease. It is, however, an annual reminder that we have a long way to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/confronting-everyday-sources-of-pollution-across-the-country/story-tXXS7tRxrNRzKfjB4WF1aJ.html

The man made lake , which has a 26 square kilometre wildlife sanctuary towards the north, often dries up during the summer. Desiltation and pumping of additional water from other sources too have not yielded results. The lake, created by Le Corbusier in 1958, had lost about 66% of its original water holding capacity due to silting. Following this, check dams were built in the catchment area, but even then the water levels have been going down, leaving the lake with a capacity of around 500 hectare-metres against the original capacity of over 1,074 hectare metres. The Punjab and Haryana High Court is also monitoring the protection of the lake, initiating a suo motu petition in 2009 to save the water body. Declared a wetlandThe UT administration in June last year issued a final notification for declaration of 493 acres of the lake as a wetland under Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rule 2017. All activities threatening the lake are prohibited. Encroachment of any kind, setting up of any industry and expansion of existing industries are prohibited, as is conversion of wetland to non-wetland uses. Solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated waste and effluents from industries, cities, towns, villages, and other human settlements into wetlands are also banned. Any construction of a permanent nature except for boat jetties within 50 metres from the mean high-flood level observed in the past ten years is not allowed. The UT had sought help from WWF in November last year to draw up the management plan. It is also a knowledge partner for declaring Sukhna Lake a wetland, and will not charge anything for this exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/managing-migratory-birds-boating-and-trekking-part-of-wwf-s-sukhna-plan/story-qUrdJeO1YTjJkVqHG76TKJ.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Seven-fold increase in drought events, six-fold rise in frequency of extreme flood events in Maharashtra over 50 years: Study||Maharashtra has witnessed a seven-fold increase in drought events and a six-fold rise in frequency of flood events in the last 50 years, according to a first-of-its-kind independent study. Conducted by not-for-profit policy research institute Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), the study assessed patterns through district-level profiling of India’s extreme climate events between 1970 and 2019. CEEW found that in over 80% Maharashtra districts (home to 78.41 million), people were vulnerable to drought or drought-like situations and 10.23 million people were exposed to extreme flood events annually. In the last five decades, Mumbai has recorded a three-fold increase in the frequency of extreme flood events. The study was released on Thursday. Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW, and the author of the study, said, “For Maharashtra, droughts and floods have become a twin issue among major climate event concerns. Surprisingly, certain districts are witnessing droughts while others are witnessing floods during the same season.”Extreme drought events in Maharashtra rose from 11 during 1970-79 to 14 during 1980-89; 17 during 1990-99; 23 during 2000-2010; and 79 during 2010-2019. Aurangabad, Jalna, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Nashik, and Nanded were identified as drought hotspot districts. Mohanty said traditionally drought-prone areas (like Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Pune, and Sangli districts) had shown a shift towards extreme flood events and storm surges over the last decade. The data for extreme flood events in Maharashtra showed a rise from two events during 1970-79 to three during 1980-89; 10 during 1990-99; 11 during 2000-2010; and 12 during 2010-19. The hotspots for floods are Mumbai city, and Thane and Ratnagiri districts, with the island city alone witnessing two flood events per decade from 1980 to 2009. Between 2010 and 2019, flood events shot up to six and the most critical weather event for Mumbai suburban were the July 2005 floods, which claimed 1,094 lives.Mohanty said these extreme climate events were the result of a combination of factors including unplanned urban development, encroachment upon ecosystems like mangroves and weather conditions like the urban heat island effect (warm air getting trapped and unable to circulate out), periods of intense rainfall during monsoon and increased frequency of storm surges. “The impact of extreme climate events has to be understood in the context of Mumbai and other cities along the west coast wherein rising seas potentially threaten their safety. Research studies have suggested that a one-metre rise in sea level can potentially inundate 5,763 km in India,” he said.CEEW also found that some districts, such as Aurangabad, Mumbai, Nashik, Pune, and Thane, were witnessing a micro-climatic shift to a dry summer climate zone, resulting in an increase in cyclonic disturbances. “This has increased the intensity of storm surges, incessant rainfall and flooding,” said Mohanty.WHAT MAHARASHTRA NEEDS TO DO?CEEW has suggested a four-step approach to tackle the climate catastrophe, beginning with a more localised granular assessment of past events at the district level. The findings of such a survey should then be integrated into district disaster plans, and further assimilated into the state’s climate change action plan. “Until the findings are integrated, budget allocation for implementable action cannot be recognised at the district level,” said Mohanty. The next step would be to develop a state specific portal as an integrated emergency service management system for climate surveillance. “Under this government machinery, research bodies and all stakeholders can log in details of past climate hazards and develop a detailed repository to tackle future risk events,” said Mohanty. Finally, restoring natural areas and ecosystems should be restored with a focus on a climate-resilient future.FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDYThe analysis of extreme weather events in India between 1970-2019 in CEEW’s study is based on verified government data from bodies such as the Union agriculture ministry, National Disaster Management Authority, India Meteorological Department, Press Information Bureau, and international bodies such as World Meteorological Organisation and World Health Organisation. While drought events were divided as per the Centre’s classification under meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts, flooding events were classified as riverine, coastal, flash, urban, and compounded floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seven-fold-increase-in-drought-events-six-fold-rise-in-frequency-of-extreme-flood-events-in-maharashtra-over-50-years-study/story-CsrE8ZHQ8Z0bepnKwcYy9M.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government orders probe against jail authorities in Gautam Navlakha spectacles case||Two days after the Bombay high court (HC) criticised authorities at Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail for refusing to hand over a pair of spectacles to activist Gautam Navlakha, the Maharashtra government on Thursday ordered a probe into the allegations. State home minister Anil Deshmukh made the announcement saying that such a situation needs to be handled with humanity.The 70-year-old activist is an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case and is facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has alleged that till August 2018, Navlakha was a member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), an outfit banned in the country. He is currently lodged at Taloja jail.Navlakha’s partner Sahba Hussain had alleged that the activist’s spectacles were stolen in jail and that prison authorities didn’t permit a new pair sent by his family.“The Bhima Koregaon case accused Gautam Navlakha was denied spectacles by jail authorities as they refused to accept a parcel sent by his family. I have ordered an inquiry in this matter. I believe this situation should have been handled humanly and such incidents need to be avoided in future,” Deshmukh said.“If the family has sent his spectacles, he should be given those. We need to handle these things more sensitively,” he added.Taking cognizance of the matter, the bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik on Tuesday said, “We gather from news reports that Navlakha has lost his spectacles in jail and when his family took him a new pair, the jail authorities refused to accept them. Can this [spectacles] be denied,” the bench asked. “These are human considerations. Humanity is most important, everything else will follow subsequently,” the judges added.The high court also emphasised on the need to sensitise the prison staff by holding workshops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-orders-probe-against-jail-authorities-in-gautam-navlakha-spectacles-case/story-uAUznMRxEMCUurLqYgDTXL.html
10-12-2020||Chandigarh||₹55 lakh extortion allegation against P’kula policemen to be probed||The Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) has set up a special investigation team to look into allegations by a Karnal resident that two men, Sanjeev and Kushbinder Sharma, and some policemen here had extorted Rs 55.50 lakh from him and threatened to falsely implicate him in a case.A police press statement said important leads had been found during investigations in a case registered at the Sector 5 police station here on December 8 under sections 120-B, 384 (extortion) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.Sanjeev, Kushwinder Sharma and others were booked on a complaint to the Haryana home minister by Kunal Chopra from Karnal, which was forwarded to the DGP . Chopra told the police that he had spoken to Delhi resident Sanjeev about his plans to buy a house in Panchkula, who had then asked him to speak to Kushwinder Sharma of Panchkula. In his complaint to the police after which the FIR was registered, Chopra said, “I called Kushwinder Sharma, who assured me that he could get me the house of an NRI (non-resident Indian) at half price, but I would have to pay Rs 50 lakh in advance to the caretaker.” On November 26, Chopra said in his complaint that he took Rs 55.50 lakh and reached Hotel Sartaj 2 in Sector 5 here and went to his booked room. Kushwinder Sharma soon came over there with two police constables and five other men who took Chopra’s bag after accusing him of gambling. “When I rushed downstairs after them, I saw them sitting in a Bolero, on which SHO (station house officer), Sector 14 Panchkula was written,” Chopra alleged.He said when he went to the police station he was asked to leave and was allegedly threatened that they (police) would involve him in a false case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/55-lakh-extortion-allegation-against-p-kula-policemen-to-be-probed/story-M15cH6kHGcEXuuGn5DX4fM.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Lawyers, registered clerks allowed to travel in Mumbai locals in morning too||Lawyers and registered clerks will now be allowed to travel in local trains during the peak hours in the morning. Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) have allowed them to commute by local trains between 8am and 11am.Earlier, lawyers and clerks were allowed to commute by local trains during stipulated timings which did not include peak hours. Previously, they were allowed to travel up to 8am, between 11am and 4pm and post 7pm. The move was taken after the Maharashtra government requested the zonal railways to allow lawyers to travel by trains in the morning.They will, however, not be allowed to travel during peak hours in the evening between 4pm and 7pm. “Lawyers and registered clerks are permitted to travel by suburban trains during the course of the day, every day except the evening peak hours from 4pm to 7pm. It is requested that travellers who have been permitted to travel by suburban trains should follow medical and social protocols as mandated for Covid-19,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. Staff and registered clerks of the Bombay Bar Association, Advocates’ Association of Western India, Bombay Incorporated Law Society, Bombay High Court Law Library and Kirtikar Law Library will also be allowed to commute by local trains. While local train services resumed on July 15, it was earlier operational only for employees working in essential care, differently-abled passengers and cancer patients. Later, women commuters were also permitted to travel by local trains on both CR and WR lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lawyers-registered-clerks-allowed-to-travel-in-mumbai-locals-in-morning-too/story-fU3JxGiq0YVqKji2V89p2J.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai hottest in country on Tuesday, Wednesday||Mumbai was identified as the hottest location in India on Tuesday and Wednesday by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The streak of hot weather continued on Thursday as the night temperature recorded was 5 degrees Celsius above normal, making it the city’s second-highest minimum temperature during December in 10 years.According to IMD, the highest maximum temperature recorded in India on Tuesday was at the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, at 36.4 degrees Celsius, which is almost 4 degrees Celsius above normal, followed by Karwar in Karnataka at 36.1 degrees Celsius and Ratnagiri in Maharashtra at 35.4 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, Santacruz recorded 36 degrees Celsius respectively, 3.4 degree Celsius above normal, the highest maximum in India followed by Ratnagiri at 35.5 degrees Celsius and Karwar at 34.8 degrees Celsius. The hottest location within Mumbai on Wednesday was Charkop at 36.3 degrees Celsius.The day temperature fell by almost 2 degrees Celsius on Thursday both in the suburbs and south Mumbai. While the Santacruz observatory recorded 33.8 degrees Celsius, 1 degree Celsius above normal, as compared to 36 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, Colaba observatory recorded the temperature at 32.2 degrees Celsius, which fell 0.5 degree Celsius below the normal mark.“A combination of factors such as warm and dry easterly winds from over central India moved over the city as well as the very late setting in of sea breeze on both Tuesday and Wednesday led to the rise in maximum temperature, much beyond any other location in the central Indian plains or the west coast,” said Bishwambhar Singh, director, regional meteorological centre, IMD, Mumbai.Meanwhile, owing to cloudy conditions during early Thursday morning, the Santacruz weather observatory recorded the minimum temperature at 24 degrees Celsius, 5 degrees Celsius above normal. It increased by 4 degrees Celsius from Wednesday’s 20 degrees Celsius. This was the second-highest December minimum temperature in 10 years as the highest was recorded last year on December 5 at 25.3 degrees Celsius. The city had also recorded 25.2 degrees Celsius on December 1, 2008.The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, also recorded a high minimum temperature at 25 degrees Celsius, 4 degrees Celsius above normal. Location-specific minimum temperatures across the city were above 20 degrees Celsius or above the normal mark. “Warmer conditions since Thursday morning were due to the effect of a cloudy sky. Cloud cover had formed due to a low pressure weather system over southeast Arabian Sea indicating a significant cloud mass over the sea areas, allowing peripheral weather activity along the west coast. We have issued a forecast for partly cloudy sky with possibility of very light rain or drizzle for Mumbai for Thursday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Parts of the city such as Santacruz, Powai, Goregaon, Mulund and a few other areas witnessed light drizzle late on Wednesday night with traces of rain reported at Santacruz. However, no rain was recorded at the Colaba weather station. While generally cloudy conditions have been predicted for Mumbai till the weekend, a forecast of very light to light rain was issued by IMD for Thane and Palghar for Friday.Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) in Mumbai on Thursday was 152 (moderate), marginally higher than Wednesday’s 149 (moderate). It is expected to be 142 (moderate) on Friday.POSSIBILITY OF HAILSTORM IN PARTS OF NORTH MAHARASHTRAThe IMD on Thursday issued a forecast for the probability of rain, thunderstorms, and even hailstorms over parts of north central Maharashtra between Friday and Sunday across areas of Dhule, Nandurbar, Nashik, and Jalgaon. “The likeliness of this is as a result of the low pressure weather system in the southeast Arabian Sea that can activate weather factors leading to such weather activity in the coming days,” said Shubhangi Bhute, director, regional meteorological centre, IMD, Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-second-hottest-in-country-on-tuesday-wednesday/story-VvNSE4QQElb3gICVYZ2tZK.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Decision on local trains after monitoring Christmas, new year situation, says Mumbai municipal commissioner||A recommendation about permitting the general public to travel by local trains in Mumbai will be made only after monitoring the situation during Christmas and New Year revelry, Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Thursday.He also warned that if people continued to gather in defiance of coronavirus restrictions, the government will be forced to impose a night curfew in the city.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will recommend to the government that railway services resume for all only after monitoring the situation during Christmas and New year celebrations, he told reporters here.“Depending on the situation during Christmas and New Year’s Eve, we can take a decision about restarting local trains,” he said.Currently, only certain categories of persons including those working for essential services are allowed to travel by local trains, Mumbai’s lifeline.He had written to the Maharashtra government seeking a night curfew after seeing that some night clubs were operating overnight, Chahal said.Last week, BMC teams raided two night clubs where a large number of people had gathered without wearing proper masks, the commissioner said, adding that FIRs were registered against these clubs.“The government is not in favour of imposing a night curfew because it creates panic among people. Hence it has decided to wait and watch till December 25,” Chahal said.The daily number of new Covid-19 cases in the city has gone down and is in the range of 600-800 after Diwali, Chahal said, adding that the number of asymptomatic patients was high among new cases.He was speaking to the media after meeting actor Anupam Kher at the BMC headquarters.Kher gifted him a copy of his book “Your Best Day is Today”. The book, based on the actor’s experiences during lockdown, also has a chapter about the BMC’s efforts to tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-on-local-trains-after-monitoring-christmas-new-year-situation-says-mumbai-municipal-commissioner/story-zbWGbZAwNLCIbv3ZdaRtEJ.html

They include Panchkula MLA and Haryana vidhan sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta, Yamunanagar mayor Madan Chauhan, former cabinet minister Captain Abhimanyu, who is also the in charge of the MC polls in the city and MP from Kurukshetra Nayab Singh Saini.Gupta said the party had completed two rounds of interactions, with leaders visiting each ward and taking feedback from people in the first round and holding meetings with workers in the second.The Congress party, however, appeared to be taking things slow with Pardeep Chaudhary, Kalka MLA, saying: “We all are working in our own way. Different committees will also be constituted soon. We are just awaiting a nod from our party’s high command Kumari Selja.”Chaudhary, who is also a member of the selection committee, said it would hold a meeting after getting a message from Sejla: “It might come in this evening or by tomorrow, following which names of the candidates for the mayoral post and others will be finalised.”BJP launches media and IT war roomMeanwhile, to keep connected to each ward and for information inflow the BJP has launched a media and IT war room.“It’s main aim will be to keep a check on rumours and fake news against the party,” Gupta said.List of mayoral candidatesMeanwhile, the BJP has issued list of 18 names for the mayor’s post while the Congress has shared the names of nine candidates, including that of former mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia.The 18 BJP candidates include Deepak Sharma, Shyam Lal Bansal, Anil Thapar, RC Taneja, Kulbhushan Goyal, Anjali Bansal, Umesh Sood, RP Malhotra, Vishal Seth, Krishan Dhull, Sanjay Ahuja, BB Singhal, Kamal Awasthi, Sunil Talwar, Praveen Attray, Virender Garg, CB Goel and Dr Rajesh Bindal.The Congress candidates include Ranjeeta Mehta, Sudha Bhardwaj, Manveer Kaur Gill, Ravinder Rawal, Suresh Sharma, Tarsem Garg, Krishan Nanha, Anil Pangotra and Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia.The main mayoral candidate will be finalised by December 12, BJP sources said, adding that the third phase of house to house meetings too will start soon||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-holds-ward-meetings-for-panchkula-mc-polls-cong-yet-to-finalise-selection-panel/story-i0xD1DVys86fpTWrahbERL.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra not witnessing Covid-19 second wave pattern: Health department official||Maharashtra on Thursday continued to clock less than 5,000 new cases for the sixth consecutive day with 3,824 Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra, which is anticipating a potential second wave of Covid-19 cases, is not witnessing any signs of a surge so far, said state health department officials. The state’s tally rose to 1,868,172, of which 71,910 are active. Maharashtra also recorded 70 fatalities, pushing the death toll to 47,972. Of the fatalities reported on Thursday, 51 occurred in the past 48 hours and 19 in the past week. The state’s case fatality rate stood at 2.57%.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 798 new cases, taking the city’s caseload to 288,696. Mumbai also reported 13 deaths, taking death toll to 10,942. The city currently has 11,886 active cases.The state, which had anticipated a second wave of Covid-19 infections, has so far not witnessed any signs of it, said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of communicable diseases prevention control and member of the state-appointed technical committee.As per the different project models of the state health department, it was projected that Maharashtra could see a surge in fresh cases by December-end or by January-February next year. The figures over the past week have not suggested any signs of an increase in infection rate or more cases.In the past seven days, Maharashtra has reported 25,585 Covid-19 cases and 373 deaths with a daily average of 3,655 cases and 53 deaths. During the same period, the state tested 370,196 samples. The average number of tests conducted daily was 52,885 while the positivity rate was 6.91%.“These are favourable and positive signs. We had thought that since people had come out in large number before Diwali, it would trigger the second wave. One thing is beyond doubts that we are not seeing a second wave pattern in Maharashtra, especially in Mumbai and Pune. There is a lull. Now, whether this lull is one before the storm or this will result in a positive outcome, we will know in the next three to four weeks,” Salunkhe said.Health department officials, however, are still wary about lax behaviour by people in maintaining Covid-appropriate steps as it could change the pattern in the state.“At this stage, we will not say that the risk is over and that we are out of the woods. I would like to wait for three more weeks, and if the same pattern of either a plateauing or a decline continues then we will be [in a] comfortable [position],” Salunkhe added.

The incident has triggered outrage among the residents. They alleged that the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has taken no measures to curb stray dog menace in the area despite several complaints. Family members of victims said the incident could have been avoided if MC had acted on time. Neeru Sharma, a resident of the area and dog lover, said that the dog bit nearly 15 people, including three children, the youngest of whom was three-year-old Aavya Arora. “I usually offer food to dogs in the area. But on Wednesday, I noticed a change in the behaviour of one of them, as it was attacking the other dogs. I suspected that it had turned rabid and I asked residents to stay alert,” she said. She added that getting in touch with MC staff was an ordeal. “I Googled the number and tried lodging a complaint. After several attempts, I managed to get in touch with Sunil Kapoor, husband of area councillor Seema Kapoor, and asked him for help. He sent a few sweepers to capture the dog, but they failed to do it. Finally, I got the number of medical officer Dr Vipal Malhotra. I urged him to get the dog that was on a biting spree captured, and get the others vaccinated,” Sharma said. She added that after biting the residents of Green Park Valley, the dog entered the housing board colony, J-Block Market in BRS Nagar and residential area of J- Block where it bit other dogs. She said that the MC team arrived at 5pm, and captured the dog by 6.30pm. Another canine that tried to attack the team was also caught. Victims share shocking details Shashikant Goyal, a retired government employee, said that his wife Kiran Goyal, 62, was bitten by the dog while she was coming out of the park at around 5pm. “She was bitten on the hands and legs. The bite marks were so deep that she had to be hospitalised. The treatment will cost Rs 33,000. A domestic help, Dharampal, 18, was also bitten on the hand,” said Goyal. Harmohan Khurana, 72, said he was also bitten on the hand while fending off the attack. Parents of three- year- old Aavya Arora were worried as their daughter had got a fever after the she was bitten on the leg. Rajan Singh, a resident whose father was bitten six times on the legs and arms, said: “My father was attacked when he was going to fetch milk from the market on Wednesday morning,” he said. “Two more children were also attacked in the park along with Aavya. I believe that they have also been hospitalised,” Singh said, adding that he will take up the matter with cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. “Not only mental agony, but the incident has also resulted in unnecessary financial burden for families,” he said. Medical officer Dr Vipal Malhotra said that soon after receiving the information, MC team reached the spot and captured the dog that had bitten the residents. Responding to the allegations of the residents, Dr Malhotra said: “It is not justified to blame us for the delay as we had received no prior information about the incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stray-dog-bites-15-people-in-ludhiana-s-brs-nagar-residents-blame-mc-for-inaction/story-LtlQNTKhwfSeVV6rlYCTgI.html

The police had filed a supplementary chargesheet in September last year in the case against Gambhir, a BJP MP from east Delhi, and several others under various sections, including 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 34 (criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention), of the IPC.The FIR was registered over the complaint of 50 flat buyers, who alleged that they booked flats in a real estate project in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram in 2011 but it did not take off.Advocate Paritosh Budhiraja, counsel for Gambhir, said his client was just the brand ambassador of the company and had nothing to do with the day to day affairs. He also said that he was the additional director in the company for a brief time. He added that the judgment on discharge would be made available tomorrow, Friday only after which he can know about the reasoning given by the court.According to the counsel, no evidence was found against Gambhir after the police investigation in the first charge sheet where he was kept in column 12.

Mukesh is currently lodged in the Noida jail in connection with another cheating case filed by the home buyers.The complainants have alleged that “the project was extensively promoted and advertised and Gambhir, as the brand ambassador, helped in attracting and inviting buyers to invest in the project”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-discharges-gautam-gambhir-in-criminal-breach-of-trust-case/story-h5rGNDGq77Pm38VJtMzQYN.html

10-12-2020||Chandigarh||On DGP’s directions, Ludhiana traffic wing to get more manpower||Due to ongoing development works in the city, the pressure to maintain smooth flow of traffic on narrow congested roads has increased significantly for traffic police personnel. The grave situation has grabbed the attention of Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta, who has asked Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal to strengthen the traffic wing. At least 50 more police personnel will be deputed to the traffic wing, which will increase its strength from 250 to 300. Traffic police are also taking help from more volunteers to maintain smooth flow of traffic.Construction of flyovers is currently on at major roads of the city including Ferozepur Road, Pakhowal Road, Ladhowal Bypass from South City and Cheema Chowk, where heavy traffic is witnessed at all times. The roads have been narrowed due to the ongoing developement projects, and at many places, vehicles are being diverted to service lanes. “Though the authorities have made diversions on Ferozepur Road, the average speed on the stretch from Bharat Nagar Chowk to Octroi post at Ludhiana-Ferozepur road is just 10 to 15 kilometres per hour. At some points, where traffic is diverted to service lanes, bottlenecks occur,” said Jaspreet Singh, a businessman. At some places, commuters try to break the lane by overtaking, which aggravates the situation. “At some locations, police personnel are not present to manage the flow of the traffic, due to staff crunch. They can do little at other points as flow of traffic is irregular,” said Akshay Bhatia, a teacher. The situation is likely to worsen in the coming day due to foggy conditions and low visibility. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh said more manpower will help them manage traffic better. He added that the workload on traffic police has doubled due to development projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/traffic-wing-to-get-more-manpower/story-5y4gGN26VSPCAtaKMAMDvM.html

You never know what will happen next.” Raut said Pawar has “all the capabilities” to lead the country. “Pawar has vast experience, knowledge of the issues before the country and knows “the pulse of the people”, the Rajya Sabha member told reporters here.“The Shiv Sena extends good wishes to him,” Raut said, referring to Pawar’s upcoming birthday.A senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister said he had asked around in the party about this speculation. “Nobody has any inkling about this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-terms-as-baseless-speculation-over-sharad-pawar-helming-upa/story-343JIsy7ZVVfjvpPblJhRL.html

The plea was filed by Industrial Welfare Association, Panchkula, arguing that the state had no right to create a reservation in the private sector. The bill is an infringement on the constitutional rights of the employers and that private sector jobs are based on skills and analytical bent of mind of the employees, it had argued. The Haryana assembly had passed the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, with the provisions of 75 percent of the reservation to those with state domicile, last month. The Bill provides for 75% employment to local candidates in jobs having a salary of less than Rs 50,000 per month in various private companies, societies, trusts, etc., operating in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plea-challenging-75-quota-for-locals-in-private-industries-in-haryana-withdrawn/story-19WVHScx3asUBmdZiWuXQO.html

10-12-2020||Delhi||Strong winds help clean up Delhi air, AQI now ‘poor’||Strong winds came to the aid of Delhi residents on Thursday, and helped disperse accumulated pollutants with the result that the air quality improved considerably to enter the “poor” category on the air quality index. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said till December 13, air quality in Delhi will continue to improve and may even reach the “moderate” category. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Thursday was 284, in the poor zone. On Wednesday, the AQI was 358, in the ‘very poor’ category. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the wind speed started improving from Wednesday night and its impact was seen in the air quality on Thursday. “The wind speed on Thursday was around 10kmph to 12kmph. The winds started picking up from Wednesday and we saw its impact in the drastic improvement in the air quality. Even though the direction of the wind was north-westerly, the contribution of farm fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana is zero now,” Soni said. He also said Delhi residents may well be able to breathe clean air at least till December 13. “The AQI will continue to improve and is likely to reach the ”moderate” range by Saturday,” Soni said. “There is a forecast of light rain in Delhi-NCR from Saturday night to Sunday morning, the wind speed will also remain high on those days,” he said. Delhi is also likely to experience a severe winter spell from December 14, IMD scientists said. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said after the passing of a western disturbance, the minimum temperature in Delhi is expected to fall by at least three to four degrees. “From December 14, the temperature will start falling again. North-westerly winds from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which have been receiving a good spell of snowfall, will bring the chill to the plains,” he said. On Thursday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory ( taken as representative for the whole of Delhi) was 10.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 28.3 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/strong-winds-help-clean-up-delhi-air-aqi-now-poor/story-V3lMWVUSWXP50dG0VbeApN.html

10-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG takeover of 11 private colonies in the works||The process of the takeover of 11 privately developed plotted colonies by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has finally gained momentum, with the civic body planning to start the process of initiating a deficiency assessment survey in these areas early next year.On Wednesday, the MCG and department of town and country planning (DTCP) held a meeting at the Huda office complex in Sector 14, during which the DTCP submitted the detailed project report (DPR) and service estimates of all the 11 colonies to the MCG.On Monday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed both MCG and DTCP to expedite the transfer process, after he was informed by MCG councillors that there had been no progress in the matter since last year. Last year, in November, former MCG commissioner and current deputy commissioner Amit Khatri had sent a letter to DTCP in Chandigarh for taking over the plotted colonies of Mayfield Garden, Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Sushant Lok-2, Sushant Lok-3, Rosewood City, Greenwood City, Ardee City, Uppal Southend, DLF Phase-4 and DLF-5. Agendas for taking over these 11 colonies have also been approved in the MCG House meetings.The takeover of the 11 privately developed areas is limited to plotted colonies and does not include condominiums or gated societies. Following Wednesday’s meeting, the MCG has decided to initiate steps towards preparing the basic infrastructure deficiency report, for which the process of hiring a private consultant has now started. “The private consultant would compare services listed under DPR and service estimates, based on which plans were approved when the colonies were coming up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to check if any of the listed services are there on-ground at present, and if their condition is optimum or deteriorating. Based on the report, we would assess the monetary sum required to fix deficiencies in these colonies before the MCG takes them over,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.Sharma said that each private developer would be given the option to either fix the deficiencies themselves and hand over the colony or pay the requisite sum needed to do so, and immediately hand over the colonies to the MCG.The MCG has appointed executive engineer Vishal Garg to finalise the requisite paperwork for appointing a consultant and sent a proposal to MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh for approval. DLF Phase-4 and DLF-5 are located along the Golf Course Road, while the remaining nine colonies are located close to Golf Course Road and Golf Course Extension Road.MCG was scheduled to hold a meeting with DTCP officials at its Sector 34 office on Thursday as well. However, officials decided to discuss their queries over the phone instead.The takeover of 11 colonies is the second phase in the transfer of private colonies to the MCG. In the first phase, the MCG had initiated the takeover of nine private colonies.Since March 2019, the MCG has taken over privately developed colonies of Palam Vihar, Suncity, Sushant Lok-1, Nirvana Country, South City-1 and South City-2. The takeover of DLF Phases 1-3 is pending as the developer had decided to fix civic amenities instead of paying the MCG to do so and transferring the colonies with immediate effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-takeover-of-11-private-colonies-in-the-works/story-N7Za9vs1Q93QGT30MFaZhP.html
10-12-2020||Gurugram||Cops step up vigil to prevent farmers from blocking Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||The police are likely to resume checking at Gurugram’s borders with Delhi and other districts of Haryana on Friday, after groups of farmers continued to move towards the city, in protest against the new farm laws. The police said that commuters travelling to and from Delhi might face congestion due to the checks. According to the police, the motive is to ensure that protesters do not block the expressway and warned of strict action against those who try to block the highway. The police also plan to check vehicles moving from wholesale markets as they suspect protesters, who had reached the city in private cars on Thursday, to use these vehicles to gather at one of the traffic junctions on the expressway. The farmer leaders rejected a government proposal to amend the new agriculture laws on Wednesday, and announced they would intensify their agitation by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and Delhi-Agra expressways by Saturday, and escalating it to a nationwide protest on December 14. Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said that they have diversion plans in place in case the expressway is blocked. “Our force is ready with multiple plans in case the farmers block any of the crossing or expressway,” she said. More than 400 farmers from Rajasthan and Maharashtra, who had marched up to Ferozepur Jhirka in Nuh through Bharatpur in Rajasthan on Thursday, were not allowed to enter Gurugram, and have been camping at Palwal and parts of Rajasthan for the last two days, the police said. The superintendent of police, Nuh, Narender Bijarniya, on Thursday, said that a group of farmers were allowed to meet their fellow farmers at the Palwal border. “The remaining farmers were sent back to Rajasthan and were not allowed to enter Nuh to reach Delhi. The situation has been peaceful and the protesters peacefully agreed to our terms,” he said. Nuh Police has deployed nearly 900 personnel at their borders with Palwal, Faridabad, Gurugram and Rajasthan. Gurugram Police had received information that farmers had gathered near Bharatpur and Behror in Rajasthan and were planning to march to the city to block the highway. The police said nearly 2,000 personnel have been deployed at key locations. Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that protesters are planning to walk towards the expressway through Manesar and Kherki Daula toll plaza, but they were diverted to Nuh. “We had set up barricades at all borders and special teams were deployed on the Kundli Manesar Palwal (KMP) Expressway but no one has reached so far. We are expecting farmers from other states, who are likely to block the national highway but the teams are deployed and have activated our secret informers. We will not let them disrupt the traffic,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-step-up-vigil-to-prevent-farmers-from-blocking-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-ncVjhLySXvHW87wzcBIShJ.html
10-12-2020||Gurugram||Fake call centre that duped 400 in the US busted, two arrested||The chief minister’s flying squad on Wednesday night busted a call centre and arrested two suspects from Sector 61. The arrested suspects, investigators said, used to allegedly dupe people, especially those in English-speaking countries like the US, under the garb of providing technical support. Police said the call centre employees used to allegedly send an email to US and UK citizens with fake pop-up error messages stating that a malware had infected their computer systems and if not rectified immediately, their personal and financial data could be compromised. This year the police have busted 45 such bogus call centres and made 68 arrests. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department, said they received a tip-off on Tuesday that an illegal call centre was operating out of the fifth floor of a commercial building in Sector 61. “The suspects had registered a company named MWDN Techtrust Worldwide IT Services Pvt Limited. They had set up the call centre last month and had duped nearly 400 victims so far,” he said. Yadav said they had conducted an internal investigation and their teams raided the office on Wednesday late night. “We will get the recovered hard disks scanned, along with their systems, to know the exact number of people who have been targeted since the call centre began functioning,” he said. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that there were six men and two women working as tele-callers at the call centre. They had more than 20 desktops in the office and 10 laptops. After the raid, we asked the employees to continue taking inbound calls and videographed more than 50 calls to establish the fraud. We questioned all the eight employees who allegedly revealed that they had duped around 400 US citizens in the last one month alone. “The pop-ups would repeatedly show up on a user’s computer screen with warnings such as ‘malicious malware detected’, ‘personal information is not safe’, ‘your computer has been locked’. The victims would panic and contact at the helpline number that comes with the pop-up message to get the issue resolved. Instead, they would end up getting duped by them on the pretext of getting technical support,” he said.” he said. Budhiraja said the owners had no company registration certificate or DoT licence. The employees were given a script to read out and had undergone 10 days voice and accent training before hitting the floor. A case was registered on Thursday at the Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act, after which two of the owners of the fake call centre were arrested from the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fake-call-centre-that-duped-400-in-the-us-busted-two-arrested/story-JfEYcAFN8Y7nWlHX271AlJ.html
10-12-2020||Gurugram||Work on Civil Hospital revamp to start||The state and district administrations have given the go-ahead for demolition of the old Civil Hospital building near Sadar Bazar, which has been pending for the last two years due to land issues between the education and health departments.Senior officials of the administration and health department on Thursday confirmed that the directorate of school education will transfer two acres of its land to the health department for the expansion of the Civil Hospital building, which is currently spread across five acres.The decision has been taken after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on November 29, inspected the premises of Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), from which the land would be transferred for expansion of the adjoining Civil Hospital. He directed the officials to expedite the process.“Planning is underway for the new Civil Hospital building. The demolition of the existing building has been approved and a tender has also been issued,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.The development follows a meeting among the senior officials of the state, director of school education, district administration, health, education and public works department on Wednesday.As suggested by the chief minister, a wall has to be constructed between the school and hospital to start the work on the hospital premises. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “It has been decided that the education department would be giving a no-objection certificate (NoC) in one week, transferring two acres of the health department.”District education officer Indu Bokan said that the transfer of land will not obstruct the functioning of the school. She said that as a part of the school building will be taken over, a few classes will be shifted to the government school at Sukhrali. The demolition of the existing building has been on the cards since 2015, when the public works department (PWD) had prepared a report on the dilapidated condition of the hospital. The same report was submitted to the state in 2017. In 2016, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram also conducted a study, which pointed out structural deficiencies in the building and suggested that the premises be vacated. There have been several incidents of ceiling collapses at the hospital. In 2015, a portion of the ceiling in the maternity ward collapsed thrice and in 2016, a similar incident took place in the intensive care unit.Yadav also said that at the state level, a report on the scope of work on setting up 500-bed hospital has already been submitted. “Work on it will start once it is approved by the state,” said Yadav, who, along with his team, will shift to Sector 38 once the work starts.In 2017 various facilities were shifted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and the Polyclinic in Sector 31, with only the chief medical officer’s office, CT scan and MRI centre, and tuberculosis centre functional in the existing building. The diagnostics and tuberculosis centres will be shifted to Sector 10, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/work-on-civil-hospital-revamp-to-start/story-3ywngqLCmH2iY6InGuFndN.html
10-12-2020||Gurugram||Govt schools gear up to resume physical sessions, private schools unsure||As the Haryana government allowed resumption of physical classroom sessions for students of 9-12 this month, principals of government schools in the city said they are expecting students to turn up to get their doubts cleared. However, principals of private schools said they will interact with parents to take a call on resuming physical sessions.Schools across the state will reopen from December 14 for students of classes 10 and 12 and from December 21 for classes 9 and 11, nearly a month after the Haryana government decided to shut schools amid a spike in Covid-19 cases among students.Students, this time around, will have to produce a medical well-being certificate and parental consent letter for visiting schools, as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the education department.In a directive shared with all district education officers on Thursday, the directorate of education said that the state government has decided to reopen schools while taking cognisance of the board exams as well as the gravity of the Covid-19 situation. Both government and private schools will be allowed to conduct three-hour sessions between 10am and 3pm for students who are set to appear for board exams, as per the new schedule.Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari said that schools will first reopen for students who are to take the board exams, followed by students of classes 9 and 11, with precautions such as thermal scanning and sanitization in place. “All health precautions and SOPs outlined in the directive need to be followed by schools and students. Students who wish to visit schools with parental consent are free to do so whereas the rest can continue with online classes, as before,” said Kumari.While government schools are expecting students to turn up for physical classroom sessions, private school principals said that they would seek feedback from parents. “We will seek the consent of parents before asking students to visit schools. Since Covid-19 cases are still increasing, consent of the parent community will be crucial. Depending on the feedback that we receive and our examination and winter break schedule, we will take a call,” said Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that the school was expecting students of classes 10 and 12 to show up to at least get their doubts cleared. “Prior to the closure, students had been visiting schools regularly. Since this is a crucial period for students in classes 10 and 12, they might prefer physical visits over online classes, if they get parental consent,” said Sharma.Last month, the state education department had ordered the closure of all government and private schools in Haryana till November 30 as Covid-19 cases among school students started to spike, after physical classroom sessions at government schools for classes 9 to 12 had resumed on October 15. The closure was further extended till December 10.As per the directive shared by the department, students need to get a basic health checkup done and get a health clearance, stating that they do not exhibit any Covid-19 symptoms and are healthy prior to visiting schools. Students need to produce a basic health check clearance letter before visiting the school. This check-up should have been conducted up to 72 hours prior to visiting the school. Along with the health clearance, students need to bring written proof of parental consent, as per the SOP.The department said that free health check-ups at primary health centres (PHCs) and other facilities will be coordinated by the district administration, in consultation with the chief medical officer, to avoid any inconvenience to students. On Wednesday, the district health department had directed all its primary and community health centres to test symptomatic teachers or students of government schools for Covid-19 whenever schools reopen. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, had earlier told HT that primary and community health centres had been told to test teachers and students, if found to be symptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-schools-gear-up-to-resume-physical-sessions-private-schools-unsure/story-zC1r971BSER0YyYyyknrkI.html
10-12-2020||Gurugram||Active cases down by over 50% since Dec 1||The count of Covid-19 active cases, which was over 6,000 at the start of the month, has reduced to less than half — at 2,715 on Thursday — over the last 10 days, according to the district health bulletin. Senior health officials cite a constant decline in the number of new cases and high recovery rates as factors for the reduction. As many as 398 new infections were reported on Thursday as 390 recovered. The total tally has now reached 53,758 with the toll at 325.The significant drop in active cases started from December 1, when the count was 6,092. It reduced to 5,015 on December 3 and further to 3,386 and 2,709 on December 6 and 9, respectively. It is almost after 47 days of constant spike that the number has come down, as Gurugram last reported around 2,771 active cases on October 24. In over a month, the number had reached the maximum of 6,463, on November 27. “Active cases are impacted by two parameters — new cases recorded every day and recovered cases — which work simultaneously. When new infections decline and the number of recovered patients increase, the overall active case count comes down,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Yadav said, “The department has conducted extensive testing across the district in the last one month to identify asymptomatic positive cases and timely isolating them. This helped in breaking the chain of transmission, the impact of which can now be seen in the gradual decline in daily infections. We are continuing with 5,000 tests a day, whereby, on an average, 416 new cases have been recorded every day since the beginning of December.” From December 1, the district has been recording on an average 416 new cases every day, with 768 recoveries per day. In November, more than 165,000 tests were administered, when 600-700 new infections were confirmed every day. In terms of recovery rate — the ratio of recovered cases to the confirmed cases — there has been an increase too. Until November 12, the recovery rate was almost 83%, which touched 94% on Thursday. Almost 3,000 patients have recovered in the last week alone. “Cases pile up when new cases arise. But after the treatment of 10 to 14 days, the count of recovered patients increases. Cases which were reported in November are now getting recovered,” said Yadav.The count of active cases also accounts for the caseload also declined to nearly 4% on Thursday, after showing a spike of over 13% until November-end. From 14% in the first week of November, it reached almost 16% in mid- November), and declined to almost 13% by the month-end. It was at 12% on December 1.Based on the Covid-19 waves noticed in the past since the outbreak of the pandemic, Yadav said that infection has been coming in phases, with chances of infection set to rise again with a further dip in temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-cases-down-by-over-50-since-dec-1/story-hfeoYy7f6tNSeHmMpdeU0M.html

10-12-2020||Gurugram||MCG to hold review meet at three levels||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to increase the frequency of its review meetings at multiple levels in order to better supervise developmental projects and expedite work wherever required, according to a release issued by the civic body on Thursday. Mayor Madhu Azad, who was chairing MCG’s review meeting with officials and councillors of zones 2 and 4 at the civic body’s main office in Sector 34, decided to conduct a review meeting on a monthly basis, with another review meeting chaired by the MCG joint commissioners every 15 days, while executive engineers would hold review meetings within their respective jurisdictions on a weekly basis. Each of these meetings, she said, would also be attended by the councillors concerned. “There are two main reasons behind this move. The first is to ensure that councillors do not bring up localised issues during the House meeting. The purpose of the House meeting is to discuss citywide issues and other important matters. Secondly, by conducting review meetings regularly and at different tiers, there would be greater scrutiny in the working of MCG and an increase in the level of accountability,” said Azad.Azad also directed councillors that prior to issuing work satisfactory certificates to MCG contractors, they should ensure that relevant details, such as the total project cost, the type of work, the percentage of funds that need to be allotted to the contractor and the name of the MCG official supervising the project are mentioned in the certificate.MCG issues payments to contractors only after a councillor issues a work satisfactory certificate.During the meeting, Azad also reiterated that unexplained delays and negligence in working would lead to complaints against the officials concerned being forwarded to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for action. On Wednesday, during a review meeting with officials and councillors of zones 1 and 3, Azad had issued similar directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-hold-review-meet-at-three-levels/story-vKiFQHBEBQH29gHx2ShSXJ.html

So soil strengthening tests are important. The tests will be done at multiple locations of the proposed area for the sports park,” Gagneja added.Soil strengthening tests are being conducted to evaluate how deep the area has to be dug up to give a solid foundation to the structures that are proposed to be constructed on it.During the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the suggestions received regarding construction of the sports park in Jainpur, 1.5km from Ayali Khurd Bridge on Sidhwan Canal. The park is being established over a 32-acre area at a cost of around Rs 50 crore.The sports park will have grounds for cricket, football and hockey, an astroturf, Olympics-sized swimming pool, Olympics-sized football ground, a synthetic athletics track, four acrylic basketball courts, four lawn tennis astroturf courts, three Olympics-sized volleyball courts, a four-lane outdoor archery range, a 50m indoor shooting range, six badminton courts, two squash courts, two boxing rings, four table tennis tables, two wrestling rings, and a weightlifting complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-to-conduct-soil-test-before-giving-nod-to-jainpur-sports-park-project/story-JLqy5WlXhXQRQr9k5lYwuL.html

The committee of chief ministers, formed under my leadership, had recommended the extension of mandis, rather than abolishing them. “During my regime, the mandis were expanded to ensure that there was a big farm produce market at every 8-10 km radius in the state. Our government also gave additional land to mandis which were falling short of space, government procurement centres were built in large numbers and agriculture malls were established,” he added.Hooda said his committee had recommended the farmers to rate their crop under the C2 formula of the Swaminathan Commission. “However, forget about the C2 formula, there is no mention of MSP in the new laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooda-asks-govt-to-accept-demands-of-agitating-farmers-soon/story-DTGyVUkLj4dICSP8yFnT5J.html

The manner in which political violence has been institutionalized and brought to the extreme within West Bengal under TMC rule is sad and worrying for all those who believe in democratic values,” he tweeted.Later in the day, Centre sought report from the state government over the alleged security lapses during Nadda’s visit to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/anarchy-at-its-peak-in-west-bengal-jp-nadda-after-attack-on-his-convoy/story-F1ix8CG1S10Yj0YaVVQz3N.html

10-12-2020||Kolkata||Mamata compares BJP leadership to Hitler, Mussolini||West Bengal Chief Minister hit out at the BJP on Thursday comparing its leadership to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and claimed that the party is indulging in false propaganda.Banerjee, who is among the vocal critics of the saffron party, said it has a “prepared script” to break the movements against it and is trying to do so with the farmers’ movement.The TMC supremo criticised BJP national president J P Nadda’s outreach programme in her constituency Bhawanipore in the city on Wednesday and said it was poorly attended.Also Read: Trend to bulldoze democracy, crush fundamental rights: Mamata on Human Rights DayLikening the BJP leadership with dictators Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Nicolae Ceausescu, Banerjee told a protest rally by the party’s farmers’ wing here that “Narendra Modi’s party (BJP) is indulging in false propaganda to further its agenda”.She that the BJP has a “prepared script” to divert the attention of people, break the movements against it and is trying to do so with the ongoing farmers’ movement too.“The Narendra Modi government is not abiding by the principles of democracy or the federal structure or the Constitution and is encroaching upon the jurisdiction of a state government,” she said.Banerjee claimed that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had not “dared” to do such things though he had the support of 400 MPs. “But BJP with around 300 MPs is enforcing whatever laws it wishes to and is hurting the interests of the common man”. Attacking the BJP-led government at the Centre for seeking accounts of the relief fund given to the state after the Amphan cyclone, she said “We first want to know what happened to the PM Cares Fund”.Claiming that she has inputs about “many happenings”, the chief minister said that she does not indulge in personal attacks.“If anyone in my family commits any wrong, he will be punished. I am for upholding of law, peace and against any kind of violence,” Banerjee said.Describing the laying of the foundation stone for a new Parliament building by the prime minister on Thursday as a “stunt”, she said that the money allotted for this could have been given to farmers for their benefit.“The present Sansad Bhavan can suffice for now,” she added.Demanding withdrawal of the contentious agri laws by the Centre, Banerjee said that the legislations will hurt the interests of farmers and result in disastrous effect on prices of food items.Also Read: 10 years of Mamata regime: TMC to release report card todayClaiming that the rights of the farmers have been taken away by the new farm laws, Banerjee said that their produce will be “bought by force” by corporates and people will have to buy food items at high prices. “People must unite for protection of the interests of farmers,” she said at the rally held in front of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue here.Potatoes, onions and edible oil must remain within the ambit of the Essential Commodities Act so that prices of these food items can be regulated for the benefit of the common man, the chief minister said.Referring to Nadda’s programme, she said “I heard that he has said today that the Centre gives rice and the TMC eats away everything. Ask them (BJP) who takes away the money from the states and does not give back its dues.” The chief minister said that the Centre takes away money from the states collected as income tax, customs duties, GST, but does not give back their dues, which is only 40 per cent of total collected amount.The TMC supremo claimed that the BJP is not a party of Bengal but that of Delhi and “more that of Gujarat”.Alleging that the BJP is bringing strongmen from outside and sending them to West Bengal villages, she asked her party members to challenge them and file FIRs at local police stations when they come across any such persons.Claiming that Kolkata is the safest city in the country, Banerjee said “Bengal is such a nice place and they (BJP) are indulging in false claims against it.” The chief minister said that political murders from May 2001 to May 2011 in the state during the Left Front rule numbered 663, while from June 2011 to June 2019, the number stood at 153.She claimed that during the TMC rule, all religious programmes were held peacefully, including Durga Puja, Bakri Eid and Kali Puja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-compares-bjp-leadership-to-hitler-mussolini/story-vO850nvvh5yCBM6VZaqCiN.html

The arrested suspects were identified as Anil Kumar alias Swami, who is also registered as habitual offender at the Shalimar Bagh police station. His associate was identified as Arman Ali, 22. Ali was among the group of men who had shot dead the duo in West Kamal Vihar, Alphonse said.The other killer, Saddam Hasan 26, and his brother, Sai Hasan, who was also present at the crime spot, are still absconding. While one countrymade pistol has been recovered from the arrested suspects, the other firearm used in the double murder is yet to be traced, the police said.The victims, Anand Bhardwaj alias Brahmin, 20, and 22-year-old Anuj (single name), were associates of property dealer, Mukesh alias Bona, who had recently come out of jail, said DCP Alphonse.The double murder took place around 5.30pm at West Kamal Vihar and the police were informed about it through a call made by an associate of the dead men. A police team reached the spot and met the caller who told them that he along with Anand Bhardwaj, Anuj and Rohit were present near Janta Vihar Nala (drain) in Burari when they were targeted.“Bhardwaj was telling them that Saddam Hasan and his brother Sai Hasan were trying to establish their supremacy in the Burari area. While the four men were discussing about teaching a lesson to the two brothers, Bhardwaj received a call from Saddam and they had a heated argument over the phone. Bhardwaj dared Saddam and his brother to come near Janta Vihar Nala,” said the DCP.Half-an-hour later, the two brothers along with Arman Ali arrived and a fight broke out between the two groups. Initially, Bhardwaj and Anuj allegedly started assaulting the other group members with sticks, while Rohit and the other man (caller) tried to pacify them. But later, Saddam and Arman whipped out a gun each and fired at Anand and Anuj, said DCP Alphonse.“The attackers fled and the injured men were rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital, where they were declared brought dead. A murder case was registered,” added the DCP.Senior officials said that three teams probed the case and spoke to the two eyewitnesses (the caller and Rohit), who alleged that the murders were conspired and executed on the behest of Anil Kumar alias Swami. They said Anuj and Bhardwaj had a quarrel with Saddam on Tuesday as well.“Our teams conducted raids and arrested Swami and Arman Ali,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-nabbed-for-burari-double-murders-police-say-professional-rivalry-led-to-crime/story-rir99pEDs1U7Ta21vALcJO.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Two held for gunning down man in Rohini last week; police say gang rivalry was motive||Six days after a group of four-five assailants shot dead a 25-year-old man in Rohini’s Sector 24 and injured another -- the crime was captured by a CCTV camera -- the police on Thursday said the murder was the result of the longstanding rivalry between two jailed gangsters, Jitender alias Gogi and Sunil aka Tillu. Two members of Tillu gang were arrested for allegedly killing Bharat Solanki alias Yovin, who was working for the Gogi gang, the police said.The CCTV footage of the murder had surfaced on social media on Sunday and in that, Solanki’s woman friend could be seen helping him and chasing away the attackers. The firing was also caught on camera, even though the faces of the attackers, the victim and his friend were not visible in the footage. As many as seven bullets were fired and five of them hit Solanki, killing him on the spot. Solanki had a criminal background and was involved in three to four cases, including those of extortion and robbery, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra had said.The duo arrested by the crime branch for Solanki’s murder was identified as Paramjeet alias Sinna, 20, and Vishal aka Ghaisal,19, both from Haryana’s Rohtak. Two firearms and as many motorcycles, which were used in the crime, were recovered from them. The two were also found involved in other cases, including those of murder, firing at a food chain outlet, and firing at an MCD inspector in Alipur area, said additional commissioner of police (crime) BK Singh.On December 4, Solanki and his woman friend had gone to a grocery shop in Sector 24. Around 6.30pm, Solanki was walking to his car while his friend remained at the shop. Four to five assailants, who were lying in wait, opened fire at him. When a local resident, Sachin tried to intervene, the assailants shot and injured him as well. The CCTV footage shows that as Solanki fell, his woman came running and started chasing the attackers, before giving up and running to help Solanki.The crime branch team recently received information that Gogi’s associates Paramjeet and Vishal, who were involved in Solanki’s murder, would come near Raja Harish Chandra Hospital in Narela on Wednesday. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the two were caught, said the additional commissioner of police.During interrogation, the arrested duo allegedly disclosed that their gang leader Tillu suspected Solanki of providing information to their rival Gogi gang. “Tillu engaged Rahul Tyagi, Vivek, Paramjeet and Vishal to eliminate Solanki. They executed the murder on December 4. Information about Solanki’s whereabouts was provided by Tillu’s relative Himmat alias Chiku. Efforts are on to nab the remaining suspects,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-for-gunning-down-man-in-rohini-last-week-police-say-gang-rivalry-was-motive/story-RdrRQziQPL8POngFT5jORP.html

10-12-2020||Mumbai||BMC wants a night curfew to rein in Mumbai clubs; Maharashtra govt reluctant||The Maharashtra government has denied Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) request to impose night curfew between 11pm and 6am in the city, after it found many night clubs violating the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897, and operating till 4am on weekends, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Wednesday. During several raids, BMC found over 2,000 people gathered in small spaces of less than 4,000 square metres, not wearing masks, and not maintaining social distancing.The letter with this request was written earlier this week. However, Chahal said, “The government is not in favour of imposing a curfew as it creates panic among citizens, and has decided to wait and watch till December 25. If citizens continue to violate the Epidemic Act, are careless about Covid-19 guidelines, and the establishments continue to operate overnight, the government will be forced to impose a curfew.”Also Read: Maharashtra reports fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for fifth day in a rowAccording to the Epidemic Act, more than 50 people are not allowed to gather at a location at a time. On Saturday last week, BMC raided three night clubs in the city in the Bandra and Lower Parel area, after receiving a tip that they were operating overnight on Friday. Subsequently, atleast a 1,000 people were asked to leave by BMC officers during the raid, and many others left voluntarily, Chahal said. “BMC fined everyone who was not wearing a masks at this time. FIRs have been lodged against the owners of the night clubs. A decision on whether to cancel their licenses to operate has not been taken. An FIR is more serious than cancellation of licences,” he added. All assistant commissioners of the 24 wards in Mumbai have now been asked to randomly raid night clubs in the city on weekends starting this week. Presently, restaurants, eateries, bars and pubs in the city are open till 11.30pm, according to BMC’s unlock plans. Section 144 is still imposed in the city—it was first imposed at the start of lockdown in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-denies-request-mumbai-corporation-request-to-impose-night-curfew-in-the-city/story-JeKebS2QnxrdCBP8KX0stM.html
10-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP men instigated people to create unrest: Bengal minister after attack on JP Nadda’s convoy||Hours after BJP national president J P Nadda’s convoy came under attack in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas, the TMC on Thursday claimed that his party has information that saffron camp activists had “instigated” people to create unrest.Senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee sought to know if it was an attempt by the BJP to divert attention from “the historic launch” of the ruling party’s report card.“Mr J P Nadda has alleged that he was attacked. But we have information that provocation came from him, his own party men... It is necessary to find out if the whole episode was planned by the BJP,” the state panchayat minister told reporters at Trinamool Bhavan.Urging TMC activists to “avoid stepping into their (BJP’s) trap despite provocation, Mukherjee said, “We would like to ask our men to keep distance from them.” “Was the alleged attack planned to overshadow today’s event, arranged to highlight the achievements of the Mamata Banerjee government?” he said.Stones were hurled at Nadda’s convoy on Thursday morning, when he was on his way to Diamond Harbour from here, with the saffron party claiming that TMC supporters carried out the attack.Several BJP leaders including its Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya sustained injuries, sources in the saffron party said.The West Bengal Police, in a tweet, insisted that the situation was peaceful.“Shri JP Nadda, National President, BJP reached safely at the venue, Diamond Harbour, South 24 Pgs. Nothing happened to his convoy. Few bystanders at Debipur, Falta PS, Diamond Harbour PD, sporadically and suddenly threw stones towards vehicles trailing long behind his convoy.“Everyone is safe and situation is peaceful. Matter is being investigated to find out actual happenings,” the tweet added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-men-instigated-people-to-create-unrest-bengal-minister-after-attack-on-jp-nadda-s-convoy/story-0HAGojzerNMMKGrkgKf0xO.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for fifth day in a row||Maharashtra reported fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for the fifth consecutive day, taking the state’s tally to 1,864,348, with 4,981 fresh infections recorded on Wednesday. The number of active cases in the state dropped to 73,166, which is 3.92% of the total infections. The state also reported 75 fatalities, pushing up its toll to 47,902. However, of the 75 deaths, 63 were from the past 48 hours and 12 from last week, according to the state health department.The state authorities had expected a surge in Covid-19 cases after Diwali, but the number of daily infections hasn’t witnessed a massive spike. Between December 1 and 9, the state reported 42,202 cases against 42,393 cases during the same period in November, while the fatalities reduced to 751 in the first nine days of this month, from 1,000 during the corresponding period last month. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said Maharashtra has hit the plateau [of Covid-19 infections] and the situation will be much better by March if the trend continues. He, however, said it is essential for citizens to follow “Covid-appropriate behaviour”.“Crowding at public places during Diwali led to a rise in fresh infections, but it was not as high as witnessed in north India, especially in Delhi, and definitely not as intense as seen in Europe and the US. This is a very positive sign and if the plateau continues and cases decline by January, we will head towards a positive epidemiological situation. By March, we will be in a much better position then,” Salunkhe said.However, officials aren’t being complacent and the state has already directed local authorities to be vigilant and prepared for a possible second wave outbreak in January.Salunkhe said people “should not lower their guards” as the possibility of a surge in January can’t be ruled out. “Although it doesn’t seem to be happening based on the current trend, the possibility of a surge in January can’t be ruled out. People must follow all health protocols rigorously,” he said.Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to record the maximum cases in Maharashtra, with 716 infections reported on Wednesday. The city’s tally stands at 287,898, of which 12,168 are active cases. Mumbai’s toll rose to 10,929, with 15 deaths reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-fewer-than-5-000-covid-19-cases-for-fifth-day-in-a-row/story-gPRdpX6Eb9xpbFlWuM5i7L.html
10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Human rights situation grim in Tibet, says government-in-exile||The tireless efforts of the Dalai Lama have ushered in a more peaceful world and garnered global support for the cause of Tibet, where the human rights situation under Chinese rule is a matter of concern, the Tibetan government-in-exile has said. Observing the 31st anniversary of the conferment of the Nobel Peace Prize on the spiritual leader on Thursday, a kashag (cabinet) statement of the government-in-exile issued here said: “Today is also Human Rights Day. In the case of Tibet, the repressive policies of the Chinese government continue to trample upon the Tibetan people’s fundamental rights.” Since 2009, 154 Tibetans have given up their lives by self immolation for fundamental freedom in Tibet, read the release.Then in June this year, Tibetan singer Lhundrup Drakpa was sentenced to six years in prison for singing Black Hat, in which he compared the sufferings of the Tibetan people to a “hell on earth.” “Despite the Chinese government’s blatant attack on the fundamental rights and identity... Tibetans in Tibet continue to resist through non-violent protests. The struggle of the Tibetan people, which is a struggle for truth, justice and freedom, continue to receive world-wide support,” read the statement.The kashag drew attention to the UN Third Committee general debate held in October at the UN headquarters in New York, when 39 countries called on China to respect the human rights in Tibet, East Turkestan and Hong Kong. “The Chinese government must realise that it cannot continue casting a blind eye on the sentiments and aspirations of the Tibetan people in Tibet. The genuine solution for Tibet can only be met by dialogue through the Middle Way Approach,” it said.Blames China for pandemicThe kashag also blamed China’s “old tactics of crackdown on the freedom of speech through repressive censorship during the initial stage of Covid-19 for contributing to the global pandemic”.A survey by US-based Pew Research Centre indicated that China’s initial mishandling of the Covid-19 had intensified distrust against China.For China to win back this trust and to reinstate its position as a global leader, it must make timely progression towards democracy, freedom and the international rule of law, added the kashag statement.Taking the opportunity to thank governments, parliamentarians, leaders, organisations and individuals who continued to champion the cause of Tibet, the kashag prayed for the long and healthy life of the Dalai Lama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/human-rights-situation-grim-in-tibet-says-government-in-exile/story-ySMtKJpbwNyi9Xrm6UcQiM.html
10-12-2020||Environment||Maharashtra appoints panel to phase out unsustainable fishing||The Maharashtra government has formed a 12-member committee of experts to assess the extent of unsustainable fishing practices beyond territorial waters, control overfishing, and understand the impact of marine pollution on aquatic biodiversity.In a government order published by the department of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries on Monday, the names of the members of the expert committee were announced. The committee was directed to constitute guidelines based on their findings on the impact on fingerlings (juvenile fish species) to safeguard their population from fishing practices using purse seine nets—large circular nets used to catch fish in bulk—beyond 12 nautical miles along the 720km coastline of Maharashtra. Purse seine nets can stretch from 500 metres up to a kilometre, and as much as 3km if two or three nets are attached to each other. They pull out a large proportion of fish as these nets have a mesh spanning from 25mm to 35mm, blocking juvenile fish and fish eggs from falling back into the ocean, thereby stopping them from multiplying.Also Read: Maharashtra: Four-acre mangrove patch destroyed near proposed eco park in UranIn 2014-15, a similar state-appointed expert committee, chaired by former director general of the Fishery Survey of India Dr VS Somwanshi, had submitted a report against purse seine fishing, detailing its impact along the coastal environment of Maharashtra, and suggested measures to phase out the use of purse seine nets. In February 2016, the state government implemented the submissions by banning the use of purse seine nets within territorial waters and brought down permits from 494 to 182, stopped issuing new licenses, and allowed the use of such nets only between September and December in certain areas along the coast.Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner (fisheries), said, “After a gap of five years, we have constituted another expert committee, which will now tell us how we will actually reduce the number of permits already issued for using purse seine nets, whether to continue not issuing new licenses, and the extent of boats using them in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone. There has been a major delay in constituting this committee due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but we hope its reports will be beneficial in improving fishing practices.”Jadhav added that committee would also submit reports on how pelagic fish (fish inhabiting neither the bottom nor the shore of open oceans and lakes) were being caught and the overall impact of bulk fish capture using trawlers and mechanised boats not just by Maharashtra but other states as well (for comparison), and the extent of pelagic fish being exported. “We are also calling for details on overfishing, level of pollution in the marine environment due to oil exploration and other factors, and detailed guidelines on sustainable fishing,” he said, adding, “The aim is to also ensure the traditional fishing community that uses much smaller nets in shallow waters benefits. The decisions will increase fish catch and protect the fish population.”Also Read: MCZMA nod to reclaim 21 hectare more for Mumbai coastal road projectThe committee is chaired by Dr Gopal Krishna, director and vice-chancellor of the Indian Agriculture Research Council (ICAR) Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE), Mumbai, and the regional deputy commissioner (fisheries), Maharashtra, as member secretary. Along with the state chief secretary (animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries) and fisheries commissioner, the expert body includes representatives from all major national institutes involved in fishery education and research such as Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Fishery Survey of India, and Central Institute of Fisheries Technology.Ganesh Nakhawa, chairman of the National Purse Seine Fishermen Welfare Association, said it was shocking that not a single member of the fishing community or fisher leaders from Maharashtra was included in the expert committee. “The Maharashtra government continues to focus only on purse seine fishing while there are other environmentally damaging methods which use dols, bags and trawl nets by over 9,000 boats, scraping the surface of the ocean to catch rare and protected marine species. The committee’s decisions would affect the livelihood of the fishing community, but no representative (from the fishers) has been selected by government officials to express such issues. We have been calling for uniform law along the west coast because by curtailing only Maharashtra fishers, environmentally damaging methods would still continue for other states,” said Nakhawa.Jadhav countered that the committee was purely a government body but final decisions would not be taken without consulting the fishing community. “Suggestions and objections will be taken into account at the district level when this committee collects on-field data. At the same time, we will be studying not only purse seine but dol and other trawling practices too. The title of the order only pertains to purse seine but it will include a wide ambit of fisheries,” he said.Maharashtra fisheries There are 456 fishing villages in seven districts—Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. Last year, Maharashtra witnessed its lowest annual fish catch in 45 years at 2.01 lakh tonnes with a rapid decline in all major fish species being caught, according to the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). CMFRI said that environmental factors such as extreme weather events (heavy rain and five tropical cyclones) along with juvenile overfishing led to a 36% drop in number of fishing days in 2019. According to a 2018 study by CMFRI, purse seining was introduced in India between 1954 and 1958 across Kerala and Goa on an experimental basis. However, commercial purse seining was picked up by Karnataka fishers around 1975, followed by Kerala and Goa. It was not up till the late 1980s that the practice was introduced in Maharashtra across Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, mostly for catching oil sardines and mackerel. From 1998, a lot of trawl fishers were seen shifting to purse seining for higher profits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/maharashtra-appoints-panel-to-phase-out-unsustainable-fishing/story-BodeIkLjx0eKJl950qT7NL.html

10-12-2020||Pune||Nine months of Covid: Post Covid care emerging challenge for Pune||The state health department along with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and private doctors have come a long way since the first positive case of coronavirus (Covid-19) infection had been reported in Maharashtra nine months ago. However, even with the vaccines showing promises of development, the post-Covid care still is an emerging challenge for the authorities. After the city reported its first case on March 9, the virus progressed rapidly with Pune emerging as one of the hotspots of the infection. Later, the Covid-19 infection slowed down in Pune. Till July 9, Pune had seen a total of 33,394 cases and 986 deaths. By October, the cases went up to 3,08,434 and death toll touched 6,073. Till Tuesday (December 9), Pune district has reported 3,59,729 total positive cases with 7,588 deaths while the state reported 47,902 fatalities due to the virus. Speaking about the journey of the pandemic so far, Dr Sanjeev Wavare, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) assistant health chief, said that the post-Covid care in cases can be handled at medical clinics. “There is very less awareness among patients about post Covid care. We have acted very promptly while managing cases of Covid-19. We established Covid care centres and got ventilators for patients who need intensive care units (ICU). We have done all of this in the past nine months and so, today we see that there are regular flow of patients at hospitals and proper management of Covid patients,” said Dr Wavare. He further added that despite the infrastructure, the need for skilled manpower was another aspect which was challenging for the health department. “We were able to manage the infrastructure and Covid care centres for patients. However, skilled manpower was a major challenge. And for the future, having human resources that can manage important instruments like ventilators are in need,” said Dr Wavare. Sharing similar views, Dr Sudhir Patsute, superintendent at PMC-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital, said that post Covid care for patients is important. “However, social distancing and wearing masks should not be neglected by the general public. There are enough private clinics which can help in providing post Covid care to patients. However, good habits like washing hands frequently should be followed by everyone,” said Dr Patsute. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Maharashtra Indian Medical Association (IMA), said that it is very important that patients are aware about post Covid care and also the government makes treatment easier for them. “We have seen that many patients post Covid have fatigue and various other conditions that deters their health. In such cases, the patient should have a dedicated clinic to visit that tackles all similar cases. However, so far from the government’s end, there has been no concrete steps. This has to change in the near future soon otherwise we might see more challenging days for Covid patients,” said Bhondwe. He further emphasised that practices like wearing masks, social distancing and hand washing should be continued to keep the numbers low.

10-12-2020||Chandigarh||INLD’s Abhay Chautala, Haryana agriculture minister in war of words||The war of words between Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala turned ugly on Thursday when they accused each other of being involved in corrupt activities. Chautala hit out at Dalal during a press briefing at Jhajjar’s Bahadurgarh on Wednesday evening, saying, “JP Dalal is not a farmer. He was a junior engineer in the Haryana irrigation department. He was suspended as he was involved in a water theft case. He used to create problems for farmers and has a long history of providing canal water to farmers after taking bribes.” Also read: With no end to deadlock on 3 laws, farmers pile up pressure with numbersReacting to Chautala’s allegations, Dalal took to Twitter and wrote, “Everyone in Haryana knows who is the aide of robbers, thieves, criminals and a jail convict.” Chautala, the INLD Ellenabad MLA, has been targeting Dalal since he termed farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws Khalistani and accused the opposition of being behind the agitation. Dalal dividing farmers: Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry Tosham Congress MLA Kiran Choudhry also attacked Dalal for his remarks against the farmers. “Instead of addressing their grievances, Dalal has been calling them Khalistani and asking the state’s farmers to raise the issue of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal before the Centre. The BJP government has been ruling at the centre and in the state but their leaders have failed to reach an amicable solution despite the Supreme Court verdict in Haryana’s favour. Dalal is making such statements to divide farmers on the basis of states after failing to divide them on the basis of caste and religion,” she said. Dalal was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/inld-s-abhay-chautala-haryana-agriculture-minister-in-war-of-words/story-ELmGgG3hRFq3CFnlIQ20nJ.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Astad Deboo dies; artistes say India has lost a cultural treasure||Astad Deboo, pioneer of modern dance in India, died in Mumbai on Thursday, aged 73. He had been diagnosed with cancer in November.Deboo was an exponent of Kathak and Kathakali, but was best known and loved for promoting fusion dance that broke barriers of style, culture and nationality. He was one of the first Indians to do so.The dancer is survived by his sisters, Kamal Deboo and Gulshan Deboo.“He left us in the early hours of December 10… after a brief illness, bravely borne. He leaves behind a formidable legacy of unforgettable performances combined with an unswerving dedication to his art, matched only by his huge, loving heart that gained him thousands of friends and a vast, number of admirers,” his family said in a statement released online. Astad Deboo was always ahead of his time, friend and Bharatanatyam luminary Leela Samson said, speaking to HT on Thursday. “Going back 50 years, I would say he was a shy person. He carved for himself a very personal and also a very lonely journey because he was first among the contemporary dancers in the country. Even there he didn’t follow any Western norms. He went about his work in his own way. Whether it was in his costumes or his Sufi dervishes, he used his body in a way that was very much himself.”He was the kind of person who always kept in touch, she added. “We had a lot in common. He was a Bombay boy. I was a Bombay girl. And we were not from traditional families of dancers. When we spoke a week ago, he sounded very much in control. He was in a positive state of mind until the very end.”Born on July13, 1947 in Navsari, Gujarat, Deboo studied Kathak under Prahlad Das and later Kathakali under EK Pannicker. In his 20s he studied the Martha Graham dance technique in London and Jose Limon’s technique in New York.He is said to have performed in over 70 countries, in solo, group and collaborative performances. His is a legacy filled with remarkable moments — a chance performance with Pink Floyd in London in 1969, a commission by Pierre Cardin, being asked to choreograph a piece for Maya Plisetskaya, prima ballerina of the Bolshoi ballet company. He performed at the Great Wall of China, the Guruvayur temple in Kerala and the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi. “He didn’t live in a bubble. He was a person who was concerned about others. He lived with honesty and conviction,” acclaimed Bharatanatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai said, referring to his work with deaf children. He founded The Astad Deboo Dance Foundation in 2002 to provide opportunity and creative training to marginalised street children and provide artistic development to deaf dancers. Deboo received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1995, for his contribution to contemporary creative dance. He received the Padma Shri in 2007. He choreographed for films a few times, including for Vishal Bhardwaj’s Omkara (2006) and the legendary painter MF Hussain’s 2004 movie, Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities.“His support for young artistes was remarkable. He would frequently come to the NCPA to watch senior and junior performers, attend workshops and discussions,” said Swapnokalpa Dasgupta, head of dance programming at the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai. Sarukkai recalled an incident from many years ago, a testimony to Deboo’s warmth. “I was performing in London and my light designer hadn’t got his visa. The performance was in the South Bank and it was an important premiere,” she said. “And Astad was there. He came in and saw my rehearsal, took furious notes on a little piece of paper. And he told me, ‘You don’t worry Malavika, you go ahead I will do whatever I can for the lights’. And it was quite unforgettable, because he was there for me. He always stood by his friends.”Dasgupta describes him as “a senior so affectionate and unbiased, a loving soul so giving and sensitive”. “My prayers for his family and friends,” Dasgupta said. “As for our dance community, this loss is irreparable.”According to Padma Alva, a longtime friend of Deboo and a former PTI journalist, his funeral was a private affair due to the COVID-19 restrictions. “The funeral was held at Worli here at 11 am. It was a private funeral because of COVID restrictions. So only immediate family members were present,” Alva said.Deboo is noted for creating a modern dance vocabulary that was uniquely Indian. He once said there was a time when most Indians saw his style as “too western” while westerners found that it was “not Indian enough”.His innovative style of Indian dance may have raised some eyebrows in the 1970s and 80s, but the 1990s saw people embrace this new idiom. Recalling their bond of over four decades, Alva said she has lost a a “friend of a lifetime.””Astad called me a few days ago to say it was goodbye.We were in touch every day till Monday when he went under, never to come up again. Have lost a friend of 45 years, a friend of a lifetime,” Alva said.Actor Anupam Kher took to Twitter to pay tributes to the dance icon and wrote Deboo’s art would be missed.“World of modern dance has lost a pioneer and India has lost a cultural treasure. Dearest #AstadDeboo it was a privilege to know you. Will miss your art, warm persona and your infectious smile! Rest in peace my friend!!#OmShanti,” Kher said.Filmmaker Nandita Das said Deboo had a lot of dance still left in him. “Just too sad. Knew him and admired him since I was a child. You still had so much to offer #AstadDeboo I have lost too many loved ones this year,” Das wrote.Describing Deboo as a “powerhouse of talent”,music composer Ehsaan Noorani tweeted that the dancer was a man “who pushed the dimensions of dance.”Casting director Tess Joseph said Deboo was not only a generous person but a “visionary and stunning dancer.” “When Astad danced, time did stand still,” Joseph said.(With input from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/astad-deboo-dies-artistes-say-india-lost-cultural-treasure/story-lDfs2K52V08DTLYSvgRHBP.html

10-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC agrees to examine constitutionality of ‘power to arrest’ under CGST Act||The Delhi High Court has agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the provisions conferring authorities the power to arrest under the Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST) Act, 2017.The division bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula on Wednesday issued a notice on the petition and agreed to examine the vires of the constitutionality of Section 69 of the CGST Act, which pertains to the power to arrest conferred to GST authorities under the law.The High Court was hearing a petition filed by Arun Gupta, who is accused of issuing fake invoices without supplying goods and allegedly committed offences under the CGST Act to the tune of approximately Rs 13 crores, challenging the vires of various sections of the CGST Act.Advocates Vijay Aggarwal, Yugant Sharma and Nagesh Behl, appearing on behalf of Arun Gupta, showed the court a video clip wherein it was seen that the officials of the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence, New Delhi allegedly slapping and manhandling the employee of the petitioner. An audio recording of a call was also played during the hearing.The bench asked the department concerned to file a counter-affidavit, replying to the video and audio, played in the court regarding using of violence against the employee of the petitioner.The High Court further directed that no coercive action be taken against the petitioner in connection with the subject matter till the next date of hearing, and added that the house and the godown of the petitioner shall also be unsealed by the department.The plea also challenged the investigation on grounds that the same was conducted by the GST officers, in what it said was a gross non-compliance of the procedure established by the law as contemplated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, claiming the same to be in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.“The vires of Sections 69 and 132 of the CGST Act were also challenged on the ground that an arrest cannot be made under the said Act, as there is no constitutional backing to the same. Article 246-A was inserted with effect from September 16, 2016, whereby the Union and the State Legislatures were empowered to levy a tax on GST,” the plea said.“Prior thereto, the power to levy different taxes like central excise, service excise duty, service tax, VAT etc, was enumerated in the different entries of Schedule VII read with Article 246,” it added.The lawyers argued that offence under the GST is only punishable with imprisonment for five years and as per the Supreme Court of India, an arrest should not be made for an offence punishable up to seven years.As the offence is compoundable and appeal can be filed on payment of 10 per cent of the alleged amount therefore in view of the same no one should be arrested, they submitted.The lawyers said that post-arrest statement of an arrestee will be hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, right against self-incrimination, so it is in the interest of the department not to arrest people.Having the ‘power to arrest’ and “need to arrest” are two different things, they argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-agrees-to-examine-constitutionality-of-power-to-arrest-under-cgst-act/story-vLv0mJzRoOu9lCM3x9RLfK.html

In the judgment delivered here earlier this week, Kushwaha stated that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond doubt that Farid Pindari had forcibly stolen mangoes from the complainant Rashid Ali Beg’s orchard on June 7, 2008, and had tried to kill him. Rashid Ali Beg had lodged an FIR (first information report) at Malihabad police station in June 2008 alleging Farid Pindari and Hafiz Abdul Rais (both defendants) forcibly plucked mangoes from his orchard in Malihabad at around 9 pm on June 7, 2008. When Beg tried to confront them, Farid Pindari provoked Hafiz Abdul Rais to kill him (Beg), the complainant had alleged. On being incited, Hafiz Abdul fired at Beg from a country made gun, but he missed the target, the complainant further claimed. In the FIR, attempt to murder charges under Section 307 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) were levelled against Farid Pindari and Hafiz Abdul Rais. During the course of investigation and legal battle, Hafiz Abdul Rais died. Thereafter, the case against him was closed.

Therefore, he was entitled to the job as per the provisions of The Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servants Dying-in-Harness Rules, 1974, because he was the sole heir and dependant of his adopter who was an employee of the forest department at the time of his death.Also read | 2006 Mumbai serial train blasts case: 2 convicts appeal against their conviction before HC On December 17, 2016, the forest department rejected Singh’s plea for an appointment on compassionate grounds. This rejection was challenged in high court.The court declined to interfere in the rejection order passed by the forest department while holding that adoption was not in accordance with law. It said the late government official’s wife had not been divorced till his death and she was still his wife, though estranged and living separately, so her consent was necessary for the late government official to adopt the petitioner.“The provisions make it imperative for a Hindu male to secure his wife’s consent to an adoption that he makes, unless she has completely and finally renounced the world, or has ceased to be a Hindu, or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind,” the court said. “There is no doubt that Phulmati was a wife living until the death of late Rajendra Singh.

10-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI in very poor category; may improve with rainfall in next two days, says IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that Delhi and the neighbouring towns are likely to receive rainfall on December 11 and December 12. This is also likely to improve the air quality of the city which was 317 at 7am on Thursday, in the very poor category. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that Delhi and the neighbouring satellite towns are likely to receive light rainfall between December 11 and December 12, as a result of a Western Disturbance passing over the Himalayas. After the passing of this Western Disturbance, the minimum temperature in Delhi is expected to fall by at least three to four degrees Celsius. “From December 14, temperatures will start falling again. North-westerly winds from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which have been receiving a good spell of snowfall, will be carrying cold winds. This will bring down the temperature here,” said Srivastava. He said that in the second week of November, the minimum temperature had fallen to 6.3 degree Celsius, but it rose again because of a few Western Disturbances that passed over Delhi-NCR in the last week of the month and the first week of December. He said that the frequent change in the wind direction to easterly had also caused the temperature to remain on the higher end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-in-very-poor-category-may-improve-with-rainfall-in-next-two-days-says-imd/story-tIIRYQz9uEBO2ctf47DadO.html

He said, “The green cover of the satellite town was being mercilessly destroyed without rationale. Unfortunately, old trees are being cut under broad daylight without any tangible justification.”Singh pointed out that the trees were over 35-year-old and were planted during the inauguration of the PHC in 1986.

10-12-2020||Pune||CJI’s mother duped of Rs 2.5cr, family property caretaker held||One person has been arrested for allegedly duping the mother of Chief Justice of India SA Bobde to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore, officials in Nagpur said on Wednesday.The accused has been identified as Tapas Ghosh, the officials said.According to Sitabuldi police, CJI’s mother Mukta Bobde (95) engaged Ghosh as the caretaker of the banquet hall Seasons Lawn, owned by her, near the Akashwani Square here.Ghosh had been managing the property and looking after its finances for the last 10 years, Sitabuldi police Inspector Atul Sabnis said.Taking advantage of Mukta Bobde’s advanced age and frail health, Ghosh and his wife allegedly forged payment receipts of the lawn and duped her to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore, officials said. The fraud came to light when several bookings were cancelled during the coronavirus disease-induced lockdown but the customers could not get refund of the booking amount from Ghosh, the officials said.Mukta Bobde then filed an FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, and the accused was booked on Tuesday night, Sabnis said. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) is looking into the matter under the supervision of DCP Vinita Sahu, said Nagpur commissioner of police (CP) Amitesh Kumar.Ghosh, who was questioned by the SIT earlier, was subsequently placed under arrest, Sabnis said. “The inquiry prima facie revealed that around ₹2.50 crore was siphoned off by Ghosh. We are inquiring into the matter. If the complicity of Ghosh’s wife is established during the probe, we will arrest her too,” Sabnis said. Ghosh had also not paid bills for solar system installation and some fabrication work, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cji-s-mother-duped-of-rs-2-5cr-family-property-caretaker-held/story-CV9wKLBG7LmNWrJI2mBDQM.html
10-12-2020||City||Four major promises of city fulfilled: Ambala city MLA Aseem Goel||Ambala city MLA Aseem Goel while addressing the gathering after inaugurating the BJP election office on Wednesday said that since he took over the responsibility, four major promises of the city had been fulfilled.“When I took over as an MLA, the landowners were about to sell the place for a shopping complex, but we managed to build a large bus stand named after Sushma Swaraj. The condition of the roads was pathetic, though it is an ongoing process, we built the best roads in the city. Ambala city’s geophysical location makes it difficult for the rainwater to drain properly, but we also made a proper drainage and also started door-to-door garbage collection in 2015 for the first time in Haryana. Some tender issues arose, but now the garbage collection is going on smoothly,” Goel said.He further said that the party will take these issues in the public and ask for votes. The event at the cloth market near Agrasen Chowk was a show of strength that also witnessed a jugalbandi of party leaders with the JJP leaders, state mahamantri Surjit Singh Sounda, Ambala (urban) chief Harpal Singh Kamboj and Ambala (rural) chief Dalbir Punia, who were seen for the first time sharing a stage before the elections. Subhash Barala, former state BJP chief and in-charge for the MC polls, said that despite rumours against the BJP, the party had managed to win every election in the recent past. Ambala and Kurukshetra MPs Rattan Lal Kataria and Naib Saini and Karnal mayor Renu Bala Gupta were also present. HDF declares four more candidatesMeanwhile, former minister Nirmal Singh’s Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) declared four more candidates for the wards, taking the total number of declared names to 14.The front has fielded Malkit Singh from ward 1 (Scheduled Castes), Nitin Dhiman from ward 10 (general), Neeraj Bala from ward 17 (women) and Nikunj Chwala from ward 20 (W). Nirmal Singh chaired a meeting of the workers at the party office and said, “We have to work on person-to-person contact to ensure victory of HDF candidates in every ward. Soon a campaign and a high-power committee will be constituted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-major-promises-of-city-fulfilled-ambala-city-mla-aseem-goel/story-QwEkLxdUSXiJoHMZKZ2bPK.html
10-12-2020||Jaipur||BJP wins in Rajasthan local body polls, Cong suffers setback||The Congress suffered a setback in the Rajasthan rural body elections on Wednesday as the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) surged ahead in district and village councils, with experts blaming infighting for the ruling party’s poor show even in pocket boroughs of senior ministers. Elections were held for panchayat samiti and zila parishad seats in 21 of the state’s 33 districts. Of 4,371 panchayat samiti seats, the BJP won 1,989 and Congress 1,852. New members will elect heads of panchayat samities. In 2015, the BJP was in power in 163 bodies and Congress in 118.Of the 636 zila parishad (district council) seats, the BJP won 353 and Congress 252. The members will elect district council chiefs. In 2015, the BJP headed 20 zila parishads. This time, the BJP is set to have chiefs in 15 councils, Congress in five and Hanuman Beniwal’s Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) in one.The Congress did better than its showing in 2015 but this is the first time since 2005 that the state’s ruling party has not won the rural body polls. BJP president J P Nadda said the win symbolised the trust of poor people, farmers and labourers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “This is a huge victory... This is farmers’ mandate for farm reforms,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, referring to three new farm laws that sparked massive protests.Commenting on the results, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “The results of the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections have not been to our expectations... Our entire focus was on the Corona epidemic, due to which we could not promote our schemes and government’s work properly. At the same time, the leaders in opposition visited the rural areas and misled voters by false propaganda.” State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra tweeted that the results were a motivation to do better. “The Congress will do better in the upcoming local body elections (in remaining 12 districts) by keeping a good synergy between government and organisation,” he said. This was the second major election contested by the Congress after Sachin Pilot was removed as party unit chief following his rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot in July this year. In municipal council elections in November this year, the Congress performed well. The results will also boost the BJP before bypolls to three assembly seats, due in the coming months. Pilot was not able to campaign in the local body polls as he had tested positive for Covid-19 in November. The Congress lost in the home districts of senior leaders and ministers such as Dotasra, Pilot; cooperative minister Udai Lal Anjana, health minister Raghu Sharma and sports minister Ashok Chandna. A senior minister said on condition of anonymity that the party lost primarily because of infighting, poor campaign and anger of local people against some leaders for not resolving genuine grievances. “We lost in districts which were our bastions,” said a second Congress legislator, who was with Pilot when he rebelled against Gehlot. A third Congress MLA, who did not want to be named, said: “The party needs build ground force of workers and government needs make all political appointments and fill nine vacant positions in the cabinet at the earliest. The CM is in charge of 38 departments including several important ones, which is hampering efficiency,” he said. State BJP president Satish Poonia said the win came at a time when Congress was organising Bharat Bandh against PM’s policies. “Looking at the results, it seems that many Congress leaders are losing their ground. This is vote against chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s two years of misgovernance.”Political analyst Rajan Mahan said the results were setback for the Congress. “The results raise questions about traditional support base of Congress in rural Rajasthan... The infighting in Congress and no organisational structure has caused the party heavily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bjp-wins-in-rajasthan-local-body-polls-cong-suffers-setback/story-QWtjjSQ3LPlCFwzJHTZrUI.html
10-12-2020||Kolkata||Vijayvargiya and Tejasvi among leaders booked for Siliguri clash||The West Bengal Police on Wednesday booked national and state leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in connection with the violence at the rally in north Bengal’s Siliguri town on Monday. A BJP worker, Ulen Roy, was killed during a pitched battle between BJP workers and the policemen who stopped two processions from moving towards Uttar Kanya, the secretariat in north Bengal. The state police later clarified that Roy suffered injuries by a shotgun, which the police do not use and alleged that armed people in the rally killed Roy. On Wednesday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and head of the party’s national information and technology cell, Amit Malviya, posted videos purportedly showing a policeman carrying a shotgun and said it nullified the state’s claim. It was, however, not clear where the video was recorded. The policeman was also not seen firing the weapon. Officers of the New Jalpaiguri police station, where the FIRs were lodged, said that BJP leaders named in the FIRs included Vijayvargiya, state president Dilip Ghosh, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) national president Tejasvi Surya the BJYM state president Saumitra Khan. The officials,however, did not clarify the sections invoked against the leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/vijayvargiya-and-tejasvi-among-leaders-booked-for-siliguri-clash/story-MkxxPkuPWXcQEs9iZAWtzH.html
10-12-2020||Kolkata||Nadda slams CM, vows to oust TMC||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday of being the face of “intolerance”, and swore to form the next government in the state with more than 200 seats.“Intolerance, thy name is Mamata. Bengal has always been known as a state that believes in exchanging views and showing tolerance to all people. Rabindranath Tagore and Rishi Aurobindo are known for their global views but today we only see intolerance,” said Nadda, on the sidelines of inaugurating nine party offices across various districts of the state. The BJP president, who is in Kolkata as part of a two-day visit to the state , also hit out at the ruling Trinamool Congress over recent killings of BJP workers. “Our leaders and party workers are being murdered every day. Legislator Debendranath Roy’s murder was passed off as suicide by the police and the killers of Manish Shukla are yet to be arrested. We lost a party worker this morning as well. Police in this state have been politicised. This government will not stay forever,” said Nadda. He further accused the TMC government of “minority appeasement”. “She planned the lockdown in such a way so that Eid could be observed, but people could not celebrate the foundation stone laying ceremony at the Ayodhya temple,” he said. Meanwhile, around 50 people attempted to show black flags outside the new election office of the BJP at Hastings in Kolkata, while Nadda was inaugurating it. They also shouted “BJP go back”. During the sloganeering, the protesters and BJP workers pelted stones at each other, said a police officer who was present at the spot.During his visit, the BJP national president also launched the ‘Griha Sampark Abhiyan’ in Kolkata as part of the party’s ‘Aar Noi Annay’ (No More Injustice) campaign in poll-bound West Bengal, as part of the party’s massive public outreach programme in the run up to the assembly election due in April-May 2021. Nadda also interacted with the locals residing on Girish Mukherjee Road, a few kilometres away from CM’s residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/nadda-slams-cm-vows-to-oust-tmc/story-0iXEim0aaGXRo7Sc8LjgrO.html

Three states — Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan — have already passed bills in their respective assemblies to negate the laws. State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said he recently met chief minister Hemant Soren in this regard. “I have suggested a few points to the chief minister and asked him to hold a meeting of all coalition partners in the government to discuss on the matter,” he said.Patralekh said the suggestions focused on continuation of the existing agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSPs) of agriculture produces that has also provisioned jail terms, if violated. Soren is likely to hold a meeting with the coalition partners — Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal — after performance review of all government departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-govt-looks-to-bypass-new-farm-laws/story-KJwbjNvQjo5cMY7LDEwY0N.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A toilet monolith in India||Recently, the mystery apparition (and subsequent disappearance) of shiny monoliths in the United States and Romania have caused shock waves of excitement. Is it the work of aliens, or some sort of discreet artistic performance?And what about this abandoned Indian-style toilet, in south Delhi’s Deer Park? Can it be considered a work of art in its currently evolved form? Do we know where it comes from? Choked up with earth, and with a single plant growing from it, the discovery looks utterly original. The toilet lies next to a pathway snaking towards the Hauz Khas lake. Quick investigations with a gardener sunning herself on the lawn nearby reveals that a restaurant used to stand on the spot. This must have been the restaurant’s toilet, the woman says, admitting amusedly that she herself never noticed this odd sight until now. The restaurant building stands nearby, in ruins. That and the toilet’s wild state stand as a testament to Delhi’s very spirit—a land crammed with medieval and contemporary histories, which sometimes go past each other in parallel layers and sometimes intersect. This part of the Capital is littered with centuries-old Tughlak monuments, and this surreal-seeming ex-toilet is one more addition to Delhi’s many anonymous ruins—though this one is probably an early 21st century specimen. It could easily be passed off, one imagines, as a work of art in a bold and ambitious biennale—one can already imagine the all-knowing critics elaborating on their interpretations of the curious exhibit. In any case, this kind of toilet is already on its way to becoming worthy of a museum. An increasing number of homes and offices, in India’s urban centres at least, have long ago replaced it by the Western-style toilet seat, with the ubiquitous mug (lota!) being substituted with the more subtle metallic hose.Whatever, the abandoned toilet speaks on several levels. Worth a visit, if only to witness how the most commonplace things acquire a more intense personality once a ruin.The toilet is hidden beside a hedge, but is easy to locate. Very close to a signboard directing the visitors to the park’s... well, “public toilet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-toilet-monolith-in-india/story-QK4Elg2U8ME4T4uyucRSyO.html
10-12-2020||Jaipur||CM Gehlot dismayed over results of local bodies polls in 21 districts||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday expressed dismay over the results of Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls, saying they were “not as expected” and accused the opposition of misleading voters.In elections held for the 4,371 Panchayat Samiti seats in 21 districts of Rajasthan’s 33 districts, the BJP bagged 1,989, Congress won 1852, independents 439, CPI (M) 26, RLP six and BSP five.Similarly in elections held for 635 Zila Parishad seats in these 21 districts, the BJP won 353 seats and the Congress 252 with the result for one seat yet to be declared.The chief minister said his government has been working hard to curb Covid-19 in the state for the last nine months but the Opposition was working overtime in rural areas to mislead voters through false propaganda. “Our entire focus was on the Corona pandemic, due to which we could not promote properly our plans and government’s actions. At the same time, the leaders of the Opposition visited rural areas and misled voters by false propaganda,” Gehlot said in a statement. He said the government’s priority has been to save people’s lives and livelihoods and strengthen the state’s health infrastructure. He said in the coming time, the party will take its feedback from people and convey its good governance and give a befitting reply to the opposition’s propaganda.Gehlot thanked voters and the Congress workers who, he said, strengthened democracy by participating in this election.“I congratulate all the winning candidates. I am confident that all the people’s representatives will succeed in public service,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/cm-gehlot-dismayed-over-results-of-local-bodies-polls-in-21-districts/story-bhLcJWnXKnvGcQX5tCFYIN.html
10-12-2020||Kolkata||Siliguri violence: FIR against Kailash Vijayvargiya, Dilip Ghosh, other BJP leaders||West Bengal Police on Wednesday registered FIRs against veteran BJP leaders Kailash Vijayvargiya, Tejasvi Surya, Dilip Ghosh, and several other party leaders on the allegation that they encouraged violence during the party’s “Uttarkanya Abhijan” march in Siliguri on December 7.A suo moto case was registered at the New Jalpaiguri police station of Siliguri Metropolitan Police against BJP national general secretary and state observer Kailash Vijayvargiya, MP and BJP Yuva Morcha president Tejasvi Surya, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh. Police also charged Soumitra Khan, Sayantan Bose, Sukanta Majumder, Nisith Pramanik, Raju Bista, John BArla, Khogen Murmu, Sanku Deb Panda and Praveen Agarwal and others.The Police alleged that those charged encouraged the party workers to create violence, break law and order, clash with police and damage government properties.Hundreds of BJP workers and supporters marched towards Uttarkanya, the state government’s branch secretariat, on Monday, protesting the TMC government’s “misrule,” in the state when police stopped them.Workers of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and BJP and leaders fought a pitched battle with police after they were prevented from moving past the barricades at two points near the branch secretariat. The Police later issued a statement alleging that “serious acts of violence” were committed at the Siliguri protest and they used water cannons and fired several rounds of tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.One BJP party worker, named Ulen Roy, succumbed to injuries caused by pellets fired from shotgun, according to a postmortem report. The West Bengal police claimed that the force did not use shotguns and alleged that “armed persons were brought and they fired from firearms.” BJP national general secretary and state in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya alleged that a “nexus of police and Trinamool Congress (TMC) goons” was behind the death of party worker Ulen Roy.“This is police’s Nadirshahi (cruelty) and the anarchy of Mamata Banerjee government. There is a nexus between the police and TMC goons. Police were using tear gas and goons were hurling country bombs” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/siliguri-violence-fir-against-kailash-vijayvargiya-dilip-ghosh-other-bjp-leaders/story-RMHCZf3miAhA7898KIwVZK.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Sarvodaya Enclave loses 77 trees in 7 years||South Delhi’s upscale neighbourhood of Sarvodaya Enclave, which pioneered the Capital’s first tree census in 2012, has lost at least 77 fully grown trees, showed the second round of a year-long census. The total number of trees in the area has gone down from 787 to 731, despite the addition of 21 new trees.The second round of tree census conducted between 2018 and 2019 in the neighbourhood, the results of which were compiled this year, showed that 77 trees, which were recorded in the first survey in 2012, were not found in the area. Residents said that these trees were either lost to storms, construction activities, heavy concretisation or old age. The survey showed that fully grown Ashoka, Amaltas, Neem, Bougainvillea, Saptaparni, Peepal, Harsingar, Ficus Benjamina, Semal and Yellow Oleander trees had been lost. The list included around 15 Ashoka trees, six Mulberry trees, nine Frangipani, and seven Gulmohur trees among several others. On December 8, environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari sent a complaint to the deputy conservator of forests (south division), highlighting the loss of trees in the neighbourhood. “Section 10 of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, imposes an obligation to plant trees by parties that have felled them. In Sarvodaya Enclave, 77 trees are missing and have not been replaced. This is in violation of aforementioned provisions and also hints towards the direction that these trees might have been illegally felled. A thorough investigation must be conducted to know what has happened to these trees and to identify parties responsible,” the complaint read. Responding to HT’s query on the action initiated on the complaint, DCF (south) Amit Anand assured that the complaint will be looked into and necessary legal action will be taken against the erring parties. Padmavati Dwivedi, an environmentalist who also spearheaded the first and second tree census in the area, said while some residents were alarmed at the large-scale felling of trees, most were not aware of the enormity of the situation because there was no data to record how many trees were lost all over the city. “We are alarmed at large-scale felling of trees. When you take our case study, you realise that their [trees] losses are massive, that too from right under our noses in our own colonies. The only reason we take this lightly is because we don’t know how many are lost because there is no data.” She added that a tree census was required in other areas of the Capital as well. “Trees in proximity to homes are often overlooked. However, the maximum benefits one reaps from a tree depends on how close we are to it. Citizens’ tree census makes people not only notice but also record them. This results in greater involvement from their end in the protection of trees. (Tree) census ensures there is a permanent record of the tree therefore its importance cannot be overemphasised.” CR Babu, an ecologist and professor emeritus at the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem, Delhi University, said the tree census could provide an idea of how prepared the city is to fight pollution. He said that it will also help keep a check on illegal fellings and assess how many trees need to be planted in an area. “The girth and canopy would help us know how much carbon is trapped in these trees, how much dust they can trap and how much pollution they can mitigate. It is definitely a good idea to have such census across the city,” Babu said. Highlighting the need for such a local-level tree count, the residents of Sarvodaya Enclave said that since the survey was first conducted in 2012, people here have become more aware of the need for the preservation of trees in the colony. Hindustan Times visited the residential colony on Friday and found that many residents had removed the cement and tiles that were choking the roots and trunk of trees from their driveways. “Residents have definitely become more aware. When the survey was being conducted back in 2012, many were wary of why the volunteers were walking around with inch tapes and notebooks, clicking pictures of trees at their gates. We all want to do our bit for the environment, but many do not know that something as small as just allowing a tree to expand its roots by not concretising the area around it can help extend its lifespan,” said Meenal Sood,a resident of the neighbourhood. Tarun Kumar, who owns a daily needs shop in the colony, said that regular tree plantation drives are also now being organised by the residents here. “Because people here are educated and involved, they have organised plantation drives in the area. Some saplings are planted in the park and some are planted in their gardens or outside their houses,” Kumar said. Dwivedi also agreed that since the first survey, public awareness and acceptance of such a survey has increased. “The second tree census involved more people. It got less resistance from the colony. It was also easier to get volunteers from across the city. However, the builders avoided planting saplings to replace those they removed. Both the RWA (residents’ welfare association) and horticulture department of the municipal corporation must ensure that the forest department does not give permission for tree felling unless a sapling is planted first,” she said. A third survey is also likely to be conducted in the area sometime next year to maintain a regular count of trees and to ensure easy availability of data, Dwivedi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sarvodaya-enclave-loses-77-trees-in-7-years/story-JtRBN9hZCIEEQV6ce6v3bM.html

10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Steep water tariff in GMADA areas of Mohali is key issue for MC polls||The higher water tariff in 12 sectors under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has become a hot topic for the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) elections likely to be held in February next year.The residents of Sectors 66 to 69 and 76 to 81, 88 and Aerocity, with a combined population of around one lakh, are at present paying five times the amount charged in other areas under the MC.Area councillors and residents of the affected areas have held several protests and even moved the Lok Adalat, for which the next date of hearing has been fixed on December 7 this year. Efforts to solve the matter have failed. In June last year the MC house approved the agenda of taking over the water supply system from new sectors, which was approved on July 16 by the local bodies department of Punjab. “The high water tariff is a major issue in the upcoming elections. We have held a number of protests and made several representations to the authorities concerned. People of GMADA sectors are only talking about the water parity issue,” said Sucha Singh Kalaur, president of the Plot Allotment and Development Welfare Committee, Sectors 76 to 80.MP Singh, president of the Residents’ Welfare and Development Committee, Sector 79, said it was strange that the officials concerned had not been able to sort out the issue despite approvals from the local bodies department.Blaming the Congress government for the problem, former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) area councillor of Sector 80, Surinder Singh, said, most of the sectors were represented by SAD councillors in the MC so their pleas were not accepted by the government. Blaming the SAD for “playing dirty politics,” Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu asked why the party “allowed an increase in rates when the areas were under MC and not fully developed.” However, Sidhu gave the assurance that he had taken up the matter with the authorities concerned and it would be sorted out soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/steep-water-tariff-in-gmada-areas-of-mohali-is-key-issue-for-mc-polls/story-5ZddzSwkGfUjEiKiFvkm1J.html

10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Swachh Bharat Mission: MC declares Chandigarh Water Plus City, Centre to verify claim||The municipal corporation declared Chandigarh a ‘Water Plus City’ on Wednesday, the rating will be cemented after an independent third party verifies the claim for the Centre. MC commissioner KK Yadav said the corporation had applied for Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Water Plus certification this year as it fulfils all the conditions: “We are treating all waste water before it is released into the stipulated drainage system. We are also using treated waste water (tertiary water), nearly 20% of the total waste water, in different parks and institutional areas, among other places.”The Centre’s inspection may take place anytime in January 2021. A city can get the water plus certification provided all wastewater released from households, commercial establishments ,drains and nullahs is treated to a satisfactory level (as per Central Pollution Control Board norms), before being releasing into the environment. Further, the MC must ensure adequate capacity of wastewater and sewage treatment facilities. The infrastructure must be well maintained and cost recovery ensured through reuse and recycling of treated wastewater to ensure sustainability. City Forum of Residents’ Welfare Organisations (CFORWO) convener Vinod Vashisht said, “Chandigarh, being an urban planned city, meets all the minimum necessary infrastructure and regulatory conditions and thus will receive the certification in all likelihood after a third party independent assessment is conducted at 64 different locations in the city. With the Water Plus certification, the city will get an additional 200 marks (3.33% weightage) in the 2021 Swachhta Survekshan, to be conducted in January, which will ensure that the city gets a good national ranking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/swachh-bharat-mission-mc-declares-ut-water-plus-city-centre-to-verify-claim/story-29o0bp0DvS1OjvF2vYs1GL.html

10-12-2020||Mumbai||NMMC issues show-cause notice to Vashi hospital; authorities say did no wrong||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has issued a show-cause notice to Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi – A Fortis Network Hospital for allegedly not accepting patients recommended by it during the Covid-19 pandemic. The civic body has demanded that hospital carry forward the mandated quota of patients. The hospital, however, claims that it has followed the guidelines of NMMC.NMMC and the hospital had signed a public private partnership (PPP) agreement in January 2006 wherein Hiranandani Hospital was allowed to use space belonging to NMMC hospital in Vashi in exchange of treating 800 patients referred by NMMC for free every year.Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “The hospital had been declared as dedicated Covid hospital, but continued to accept non-Covid patients during the pandemic. However, a perusal of our records shows that they did not accept a single patient referred by NMMC hospitals during this period. They refused to admit not only Covid patients, but also non-Covid patients for whom we have an agreement.”He added, “We have given a large space to them and need to check if we are getting the expected benefits in return. We have not sold the space to the hospital and the hospital needs to be reminded that it has an agreement with the civic body.”Bangar further said, “The agreement had been signed to provide quality medical services to the citizens of Navi Mumbai, and we cannot allow the hospital to deny it to them. The purpose of the agreement will be defeated otherwise.”The civic chief said, “In my notice, I have raised the issue with the hospital and stated that since our patients have not been admitted all these months, the quota needs to be carried forward. The people of the city should get the super-speciality service provided by the hospital.”When contacted, a statement released by the hospital stated, “We have followed all guidelines and regulatory protocols set out by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation. Post discussion with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation authorities, the guidelines were implemented, which was in the best interest of the patients suffering from Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nmmc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-vashi-hospital-authorities-say-did-no-wrong/story-sWw2ERP04295SHGATHlZOI.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Passengers, experts question Covid-19 testing upon arrival in airports across Maharashtra||Two weeks after the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests was mandated for passengers arriving from Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat, 104 of 9,704 total passengers who underwent the test at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) between November 26 and December 8 tested positive for Covid-19. Passengers, however, have raised questions about the state government’s rule of allowing passengers to leave the airport without their test reports. Earlier, the airport had reported that many passengers were sneaking out in order to skip the RT-PCR tests. While this issue was resolved, few arriving passengers are reportedly not reacting well when asked to pay ₹1,400 per person for the test, the reports of which arrive after a minimum of 24 hours. Top sources from the civic authority said after receiving complaints, the airport operator has been allowing each passenger to leave the arrivals only after seeing the negative report in case they have conducted the test from their departing city within 72 hours before travel or the test slip as a proof that the test was conducted after landing at the airports across the state. CSMIA officials reiterated that all passengers conducting RT-PCR test at Mumbai airport are being given a slip as proof of having undertaken the test. “Security officials at the airport are only allowing passengers to exit when either they show their negative report or their test slips,” said an airport official. Sources from a leading airline said more people opt to get tested after landing. “We have seen that many passengers, especially at Mumbai airport, have been conducting tests after landing. If our flight has around 110 passengers, not less than 60 are undergoing testing at the city airport.” Another senior official from an Indian airline said, “Our staff is placed towards the end of the aerobridges at CSMIA for checking passengers’ negative report. Those yet to test are directed to the counters set up a few metres away from the aerobridge. Everything goes well until there are more than two flights landing almost at the same time. ” With an aim to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, the state government had implemented norms for passengers arriving from Delhi, Goa, Rajasthan and Gujarat. According to this norm, all passengers arriving from these four places need to carry a negative RT-PCR test report conducted from the departing city within 72 hours before take-off. Easing the norm, the government also allowed travellers to get themselves tested at the arriving airport. Experts, however, said the state government’s norm was not a good decision. “Maharashtra government allowing people to get tested after landing at airports is like conducting breathalyser tests on pilots after operating a flight and not before taking off. If the government’s aim is to control the spread of virus in its state, they should not have not been given the option to get tested after landing,” said captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation expert. He added, “As there are two options currently of either carrying a Covid-19 negative report from the departing city or getting tested upon arrival at the destination, it has not discouraged people much from travelling. However, people might have been discouraged if the only option available was to get tested prior to their flight.” Questions have been raised on the effectiveness of the norm too. Kalyan resident Rajesh Jain, who has been travelling to different cities for his work, said, “I arrived in Mumbai on December 2, and I am yet to get my report for the RT-PCR test conducted at CSMIA. Not all travel by choice; for some it is need-based like mine. I am currently in Bhubaneswar for work and I might be asked to fly to Rajasthan next week. However, before taking off for Bhubaneswar, I waited for 72 hours for my report. I live in a one BHK flat and hence isolation is a problem too. I have children at home and could not afford to take risks. Hence, I had to isolate myself in my balcony for the three days I was home.” Additional municipal commissioner P Velarusu did not reply to HT’s calls and messages. Health minister Rajesh Tope was unable for comment after repeated attempts.Borivli resident Prasad Pandit, who had to go to Goa and returned within 24 hours, received his RT-PCR reports on Tuesday night but with different names and test details. “I landed at CSMIA on Sunday evening and did my test around 8pm. I was told that my reports would be emailed to me within 24 hours but I had to follow up with the centre when I did not receive it on time. It was then that I was told that they did not have my record and that I had not conducted my test. After continuous follow ups, they handed over me a report with my surname but with a different name. Moreover, the time and day of conducting tests, too, were mentioned to be different than mine.” Pandit said he remained in isolation until he got his reports.Health professionals feel that the purpose of conducting the test is not served with such a time gap in preparing reports. “As per BMC rules, all reports have to be given within 24 hours. So, the delay of two days is a violation of rules. Secondly, the government shouldn’t allow testing at any airport which is forcing people to wait in long queues. This makes passengers more vulnerable to contracting the infection. The focus should be on doing the test before entering the airport. The test can be done within 72 hrs before the flight,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultant (AMC). Health activists also raised the issue that passengers are allowed to take private vehicles from the airport to their destinations before getting the report. “The infected passenger can not only infect the driver but also other people who come in close contact with him/her during the travel. Also, many passengers take autorickshaws which aren’t properly sanitised. This can become a source of infection. The government and the airport authority need to sit together and come up with better plans to channelise all these issues,” said Dr Abhijit More, a health activist.

10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to procure 9 lakh RT-PCR kits from Chennai||Maharashtra has ordered 9 lakh real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing kits, worth ₹4.50 crore from a Chennai-based company. Haffkine Institute, which is responsible for the procurement, had floated a tender on November 21. The first phase will see the delivery of 4.50 lakh kits by end of next week. Of these, Mumbai will receive 1.72 lakh and almost 227,400 kits will be sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. The family welfare department, also in Pune, will receive 50,200 kits. So far, Maharashtra has conducted over 1.13 crore tests for Covid-19. This includes rapid antigen tests (RAT) which give results within 30 minutes. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines, every positive RAT is treated as true positive, while those who show symptoms of Covid-19 but test negative must be re-tested using RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for Covid diagnosis. Experts have recommended increasing the number of RT-PCR tests. “Asymptomatic patients don’t show symptoms and as per ICMR, the sensitivity of rapid antigen kits is only 50%. So, thousands of asymptomatic patients are slipping through the loophole in diagnosis, as the civic body is relying more on rapid antigen tests,” said a senior epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-procure-9-lakh-rt-pcr-kits-from-chennai/story-E2a8J0rOVbiDLFvphaySCI.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra plans who will get Covid-19 vaccine and how||Set for a large-scale immunisation drive, the task force, which was appointed to chalk out the Covid-19 vaccination programme in Maharashtra, has decided the priority of groups to be vaccinated, cold chain resources, training methods and identified over 16,000 vaccinators, among other modalities. The task force, headed by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, in its first meeting, has decided that healthcare workers and daily wage labourers will be the first priority, followed by frontline workers such as police and security personnel, Asha workers and municipal staff. The third category will be of people over the age of 50 and those under the age of 50 with co-morbidities. Dr N Ramaswami, state health commissioner and member secretary of the task force, said, “The priority has been set as per the guidelines of the Government of India. The first priority will be healthcare workers, both public and private, followed by police and security personnel. We are collecting the details on people above 50 years of age and people under the age of 50 with co-morbidities, but it will be in the next phase.” According to the health department’s estimation, the number of healthcare workers in the state is around 4.5-5 lakh. “So far, we have added the data of over 90,000 people to the Central government’s [Co-Win] portal. As per the estimates, around 2.60 lakh government healthcare workers in the state will be vaccinated,” a bureaucrat said. He added that the government has identified 16,245 vaccinators and their details have been enrolled with the Centre on a designated portal. Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The vaccination programme is a huge task. We are currently preparing the data on healthcare workers. Around 99% of the data of public hospitals is updated, while in case of private healthcare workers, 78% work is done. The district-level training has started, and they will train the taluka-level staff.” The task force has planned 3,145 cold chains, including 27 storage facilities on block level, 34 on district level, nine on division level and one main central storage facility for the vaccine vials in the state. “The Centre has so far only said that it will provide for the shortage of coolers, ice-lined refrigerators, etc. by December-January. We have already submitted the details of [storage] equipment needed,” Tope told reporters. Ramaswami added, “We have adequate storage facilities for the priority categories. We need additional facilities in eight divisions of the health department. Six walk-in coolers and two walk-in freezers will be provided by the Government of India and added in these eight divisions. We are doing the civil and electrical work to make the additional equipment fully functional. The work is estimated to cost ₹45 lakh.” The task force has already set up committees from district to block level to ensure effective distribution of the vaccine. The vaccination booths, according to the state government, will have five people, including two vaccinators, one assistant on data and records, one assistant on logistics and one for crowd management. The state health department has also assured that other vaccination drives will not be affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-plans-who-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-and-how/story-O5rfgVoDnCjmRx95ngmAuJ.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra ranks second after Odisha on urban governance index according to Mumbai-based Praja Foundation||Odisha ranked first, and Maharashtra came second in terms of good governance, according to a survey conducted across 28 states and 40 cities in India. Published by Praja Foundation, a Mumbai-based think tank, the report studied urban governance reforms over three years (2017-2020) in 40 cities across 28 states and the national capital region of Delhi. Praja Foundation has been conducting data-driven research on civic issues for the past two decades.According to Urban Governance Index 2020, which was published on Wednesday, the top five states for urban governance are Odisha, Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland performed the worst. For its report, Praja mapped the status of urban reforms across four themes — empowered city elected representatives and legislative structure; empowered city administration; empowered citizens; and fiscal empowerment. None of the top five states scored more than 57%, with Odisha scoring 56.86%.Milind Mhaske, director of Praja Foundation said, “All the cities we surveyed in are not adequately empowered to provide citizens with the quality of life that they can benefit from. That was the main reason why we started mapping across the country for this index.”Praja Foundation’s report ranked Mumbai, with a score of 55.15%, first for fiscal empowerment of a municipal corporation and second for empowered citizens, and empowered city administration. The city came in at the 10th spot for empowered city elected representatives. Maharashtra is the only state where councillors are given allowances and dedicated staff for their office, and the only state where the city’s government has constituted all the committees mentioned in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act (1888). Also, these committees meet at least once a month. Mumbai specifically has adequate fiscal empowerment since its civic body has independent authority to introduce new taxes, change tax rates, and approve its budget. However, 33% of posts in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) lie vacant. Regarding fiscal empowerment of BMC, Mumbai has the highest percentage of its sources of revenue at 81%. The city has eight employees per 1,000 people in the city, which is the second-highest in the country after Panjim in Goa.Despite many urban governance schemes, no state has devolved all municipal functions, which means municipal bodies remain dependent on the state for its funds and decisions in many areas. To improve the levels of empowerment of city governments, Praja Foundation’s report suggested Maharashtra ensure that the mayor’s term is co-terminus with that of the city government (five years). The mayor should also hold executive authority over the municipal commissioner along with the authority to appoint a chairperson of the standing committee that makes financial decisions for a city, said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ranks-second-after-odisha-on-urban-governance-index-according-to-mumbai-based-praja-foundation/story-yt9Y8eVRMpaT3BMjytqdlN.html

He, however, was granted bail by the court. Akhand Kirtani Jatha spokesperson Rajinder Pal Singh had moved the court, saying Sukhbir made defamatory remarks against him in 2017 by associating him with terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa International. Rajinder Pal Singh complained that Sukhbir had made the allegation against him a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited his house on January 4, 2017. Sukhbir allegedly termed him and the Akhand Kirtani Jatha political fronts of the Babbar Khalsa International in rallies during his interactions with the media. The complainant’s counsel, PIP Singh, had claimed that Sukhbir’s statement had “badly hit Rajinder’s image and that of his organisation worldwide”. The police were asked to probe the matter under Section 202 (whether a prima facie case is made out) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). They submitted a report in the court in November 2019. Earlier in the day, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Tejpartap Singh Randhawa issued non-bailable warrants against Sukhbir, saying, “Bailable warrants issued against the accused were returned unexecuted citing ongoing construction work at the given address while he visited the residence off and on.” “It is evident that the accused is very much aware about the proceeding pending in court. Moreover, he is not a layman being a former deputy chief minister of Punjab. As he is intentionally evading the process of the court, he be served non-bailable warrants for December 12,” the order read.On this, Sukhbir’s counsel Munish Deewan apprised the judge that the case was also listed for hearing in the Punjab and Haryana High Court that stayed the non-bailable warrants giving the accused one week or 10-day time to appear in the trial court. Then the magistrate directed “not to issue the non-bailable warrants” against the SAD president who later surrendered in the court.“The offence is bailable in nature. The accused furnished bail bonds of Rs 20,000 with surety of the like amount,” the final order read. The matter was listed for hearing on December 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-surrenders-in-chandigarh-court-in-2017-defamation-case-gets-bail/story-AX5DLgrBjRMg1CzvG74J5O.html

He was wanted in the case since September as a previous arrested accused has named him in his statement.During interrogation, Mahakal revealed information about another suspect. Following this, the NCB team headed by Wankhede on Wednesday morning raided a house in Millat Nagar, Oshiwara and caught Mohammad Azam Jumman Shaikh. Upon searching his house, the team recovered 5 kg of Malana Cream charas (hashish), small quantities of opium and ecstasy pills and cash worth ₹1,351,500. “Probe has revealed that Shaikh used to order drugs from Himachal Pradesh and then he would sell it to peddlers like Mahakal. Mahakal used to supply the drugs to Anuj Keshwani, who was earlier arrested by NCB. Keshwani in turn used to supply it to Kaizan Ibrahim who would further sell it to Dipesh Sawant, Rajput’s house help,” said NCB officials.Mahakal would run his drug business under the disguise of a disc jockey (DJ) while Shaikh would use his garment business as a front. Both of them have been in drugs business since past many years.The official added, “Shaikh would go to Himachal Pradesh and place order for Malana Cream and return to city. Members of Himachal based drug suppliers would come to Mumbai for delivery of the drugs.” “We are digging up the financial aspect and would check if the house owned by Shaikh was bought from the money earned from the drugs business,” the officer added. Shaikh has been previously arrested by local police for assaulting his wife. NCB officials said Malana Cream, grown only in Malana Region of Himachal Pradesh, is the most desirable charas in the world. Its international market price ranges from ₹40-50 lakh per kg.In September, based on the interrogation of Ibrahim, NCB had raided Keshwani’s Khar residence and seized 590 grams of hashish, 0.64 gram of LSD sheets, 304 grams of marijuana including imported marijuana joints and capsules and ₹185,200 and 5,000 Indonesian currency. Ibrahim was among the peddlers who supplied marijuana to Rajput, said NCB officials. Wankhede also said, “This is the biggest seizure in the drugs case and we have unearthed the entire chain. He used to supply drugs to Mahakal and also to other drug peddlers who move around in the Bollywood industry. We are checking which peddlers are in contact of Shaikh.”NCB, which has been investigating the drug angle into Rajput’s death, has till now arrested 28 people including Bollywood celebs including comedienne Bharti Singh, her husband Haarsh Limbachiyaa, brother of Arjun Rampal’s partner Agisilaos Demetriades.2 arrested with marijuanaDindoshi police arrested two men for alleged possession of 57 kgs of marijuana worth ₹5.70 lakh.

10-12-2020||Mumbai||2006 Mumbai serial train blasts case: 2 convicts appeal against their conviction before HC||Two of the convicted accused in the 2006 Mumbai serial train blast case, Dr Tanveer Ansari (accused number 2) and Zameer Shaikh (accused number 11), who were sentenced to life imprisonment by the special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court in September 2015, have filed separate appeals in the Bombay high court (HC), seeking setting aside of the convictions. According to their lawyer, advocate Ishrat Khan, the appeals will come up for hearing in due course.Ansari and Shaikh were convicted on various counts under the MCOC Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) (UAP) Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to the appeals, the main contentions raised by both convicts is that their trial was not fair and was based merely on circumstantial evidence and confessional statements that were taken from the appellants under duress by the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) after they were arrested.Ansari and Shaikh along with nine others were convicted for being part of the conspiracy to set off massive blasts in the first-class compartments of seven trains on the Western Railway (WR) line on July 11, 2006. The blasts killed 209 people and injured over 700 others. Ansari and Shaikh were detained and arrested on July 20 and July 23, 2006, respectively. According to the appeals, both had been falsely implicated in the case and were made accused on the grounds that they had conspired along with the other accused to plan the serial train blast by carrying out recces of the trains. Ansari was accused of visiting Pakistan and getting trained by the terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET), while Shaikh was accused of facilitating the travel of some of the accused to Iran under the pretext of a pilgrimage.Advocate Ishrat Khan said that the appeals were filed as both Ansari and Shaikh were innocent and had been falsely implicated. He said the ATS had recovered their confession by subjecting them to torture and had made them sign on pre-written confessions which were later withdrawn by both. Khan further added that though the ATS had not been able to submit any concrete evidence against the two, the trial court had not taken cognisance of the same, but had based its judgement on circumstantial evidence. The appeals have further stated that the statements of the witnesses and panchas were also weak and some of them seemed to be picked up directly from unrelated cases in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana and submitted before the trial court. In light of the above averments and the fact that both convicts have already spent 14 years in prison, the appeals have prayed for setting aside of their convictions. Khan said that the appeals have been admitted and are expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2006-mumbai-serial-train-blasts-case-2-convicts-appeal-against-their-conviction-before-hc/story-m5gtyHjGHPDTp1xNujiTZK.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||FYJC assessments likely to be made easier, says Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad||In a bid to reduce stress among students of first-year junior college (FYJC) as colleges will reopen barely a few months before the new academic year ends, the state education department is mulling to tweak the assessment pattern. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that with the delay in commencing the new academic year for FYJC this year, the government wants to make sure students are not stressed about assessments. She said a proposal to include only a limited syllabus for exams is being considered. “We realise that colleges have very little time to complete the syllabus, and students too have barely any time to prepare for exams. While we already have reduced the syllabus by 25%, we are now planning to tweak the assessment pattern for these students,” she said. Gaikwad stressed that colleges will have to complete the current syllabus, but said students are likely to be evaluated only on limited components. “We are thinking of options like continuous comprehensive evaluation or keeping only a limited part of the syllabus for exams.” Wednesday was the last day to complete admissions under the second merit list which was declared on December 5. Gaikwad said colleges can start their online classes anytime now. “In areas where schools and junior colleges are allowed to reopen, they can start physical classes following the norms as stated by the government,” she said. On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s (SC) interim stay on the Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) or Maratha quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. With this, the second merit list for admissions, which was originally scheduled to be released on September 10, was stalled, leaving over 2.42 lakh students in the lurch in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region alone. While the state government has revealed that admissions to all courses will now take place without the 12% SEBC quota, it has also clarified through its recent government resolution that admissions under the quota that have already been confirmed before September 9 will remain intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-assessments-likely-to-be-made-easier-says-maharashtra-education-minister-varsha-gaikwad/story-wYlNEHQlMgdgNxicOhnX3M.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Metro car shed: Kanjurmarg land has always been state’s property, Maharashtra govt tells HC||Responding to a petition filed by the Central government seeking stay on the metro car shed work at Kanjurmarg, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday claimed before the Bombay high court (HC) that the 102-acre land has always been the state’s property.“This survey number (275 (part) of village Kanjur) always stood in the name of the state government,” said advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni. “It was always state government’s land...even before this 1981 order,” he added, referring to an order issued by the then additional collector on February 16, 1981.Kumbhakoni said that after salt manufacturing ceased, several salt pan lands were abandoned and were lying vacant and disputes had started as regards ownership of those lands. In this backdrop, he said the additional collector had, in February 1981, directed the Kurla tehsildar to conduct enquiry, as contemplated under section 20(2) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 as regards 22 salt pan lands and to replace the remark of “Khajan” or “Mithagar” in ownership column of some other salt pan lands, including the 102 acres.“Name of the state government has always been there,” the advocate general insisted.Staking claim over the salt pan lands, the Central government has moved HC challenging the October 1, 2020 order of Mumbai suburban district collector to transfer 102 acres out of Survey No. 275 (part).On October 6, the collector transferred possession of the piece of land to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and two days later the authority, in turn, handed it over to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, which has started levelling work at the site.The Central government also challenged these actions on the land claiming that the entire salt pan land, including the 102 acres at Kanjurmarg, belongs to its salt department and has always been under administrative control of the deputy salt commissioner.The Centre has also challenged the November 1, 2018, order of the Maharashtra revenue minister upholding the addition of names of the state government and some private parties in ownership column of several salt pan lands at Nahur, Mulund, Kanjurmarg, Mandale, Malvani and Pahadi areas of Mumbai. The minister’s order came on a proceedings arising out of the revenue enquiry conducted by tehsildar, Kurla. Arguing for the Central government, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, had earlier submitted that both the state government and MMRDA have accepted that the land at Kanjurmarg belongs to the Central salt department.Singh had pointed out relevant documents in support of the claim and had also brought to the notice of the HC that MMRDA had sought to intervene in a civil matter pending before the Bombay city civil court and offered to pay the Central government the market price of the land being used for proposed metro car shed.In this backdrop, Singh had urged HC to stay the operation of the transfer order passed by the collector and also stay the ongoing levelling work at the site.Kumbhakoni, however, refuted the claim. But the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was sceptical about the state government’s claim and directed Kumbhakoni to submit compilation of documents in proper order and posted the petition for further hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/metro-car-shed-kanjurmarg-land-has-always-been-state-s-property-maharashtra-govt-tells-hc/story-ulFtYJ9wjJlaLmWtZfdc6O.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||Raigad administration says no wetlands in Uran before Bombay HC panel; civic bodies pulled up for failing to restore wetland areas||The Raigad district administration informed the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed state mangrove and wetland panel on Wednesday that there were no wetlands in Uran taluka, which has faced numerous cases of environmental violations over the past two years.During the 14th meeting of the HC panel, the resident deputy collector (RDC), Raigad, informed members that following a detailed verification exercise of 13 areas that had wetland features in Uran, none qualified as a wetland as per the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. Committee members said the administration’s latest submission is contrary to claims made in previous meetings that all major natural areas in the taluka would be protected.Additionally, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) and other civic bodies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) were pulled up for not responding to repeated directions to remove debris from natural areas and restore wetlands, water bodies and mangroves. Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal, chair of the panel, alerted representatives from the civic bodies that non-compliance of the panel’s previous directions will be recorded and placed before the HC.In the Uran matter, member secretary of the HC-panel, Neenu Somraj said, “Regardless of the 2017 wetland rules, the Konkan commissioner directed that all wetlands need to be protected. The Raigad RDC pointed out that no areas in Uran were wetlands as per the 2017 rules, however, there are many wetlands protected under the National Wetland Inventory Atlas, Maharashtra 2011, and they need to be protected too.”During the last meeting of the HC-panel on November 2, the Raigad collector was directed by the Konkan commissioner to submit a proposal to the state environment department for the declaration of Panje as a wetland, and also survey and verify other areas with similar wetland features in Uran for wetland declaration.Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari said, “A complete exercise was carried out based on various parameters of what constitutes a wetland across 14 talukas in Raigad district, and accordingly, 131 sites were identified, including 13 areas in Uran, as potential wetlands. However, only four wetlands [two in Panvel, one in Pen, and one in Alibag] were finally proposed as wetlands to the environment department. Most areas were rejected on grounds of having water bodies used for irrigation, agriculture, water supply or being on private land, etc, and did not fall under the definition of wetlands under the 2017 rules.”Shocked by the submission, non-government member of the HC-panel, Stalin D submitted a preliminary list of 13 wetlands in Uran to the Konkan commissioner during the meeting. “In the last meeting, the commissioner had directed all collectors to go the extra mile and identify new wetland areas to protect. In this case, the Raigad collector intends to destroy whatever is remaining,” said Stalin.The HC-panel said that all areas proposed by members were considered. “We will be issuing a letter to the collector to have a joint inspection to understand the present status of areas and resubmit findings,” said Somraj.Choudhari said she would have to check whether any such intimation had been received. “We have got a letter from the government for Panje. That will certainly be examined. If the divisional commissioner writes to us for other such lands, that will also get re-examined,” she said.The HC, in its landmark order banning the destruction of mangroves in the state in September 2018, had directed all civic bodies to restore natural areas where debris had been dumped. “This is completely pending despite repeated reminders. We are not getting a proper response either from any civic bodies. We will be taking it on record to submit non-compliance before the HC,” said Somraj, adding that a detailed letter will be sent to the civic chiefs on this.SUB-COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO COMPLIANCE OF SPECIFIC CASESDuring Wednesday’s meeting, the HC panel also decided to form a sub-committee to check the compliance regarding all pending cases across all Konkan districts. “This is to check the extent of the investigation, action taken, and whether they are eligible for closure. The commissioner instructed to call a committee including all non-government bodies, and this process will be carried out over the next 10 to 15 days,” said Somraj. The decision was taken after Stalin D proposed that a complaint cannot be closed without the consent of the complainant, and their response needed to be factored in.URAN: WETLANDS REJECTED, RE-PROPOSEDThe verification exercise by the Raigad collector had proposed various wetlands in Uran, but not a single one was verified and finally proposed before the state environment department: Two locations at Karal, Khopte, Bori BK, Dronagiri, three locations at Bokadvira, Juipunde, Sheva, Sawarkhar, Bhendkhal, and Kaladhonada were proposed. Panje and Belpada have recently been proposed based on submissions before the HC panel. Meanwhile, these same sites have been proposed yet again by non-government members of the panel for re-verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/raigad-administration-says-no-wetlands-in-uran-before-bombay-hc-panel-civic-bodies-pulled-up-for-failing-to-restore-wetland-areas/story-Ov7GM36hOQKnZiAjYSkCMI.html
10-12-2020||Mumbai||No quota, give us benefits now, demand Marathas; SC refuses to lift stay, hearing on January 25||With the Supreme Court’s refusal on Wednesday to lift the stay on the Maratha quota likely to delay the admission and recruitment process, the community as well the Opposition want the reservation benefits to be extended with immediate effect. The Opposition has even alleged laxity in the state government’s approach while representing the case in the Apex Court. Under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018, Marathas have been promised a reservation of 12% and 13% in jobs and admissions, respectively. The reservation was stayed by a three-judge bench of the Apex court on September 9. During its first hearing before the constitution bench of the SC on Wednesday, the state government and community leaders were expecting the stay to be lifted. The SC, however, posted the hearing for January 25. Until a decision from the SC, Marathas want a supernumerary quota in jobs to accommodate members of the community in government jobs, scholarships and freeships to students for fee waiver, financial provisions for institutes meant for the welfare of the community and aid for enterprising ventures by youths. Vinod Patil, one of the respondents in the petition, which has challenged the stay on the reservation, said, “The final decision may take a couple of months. Until then, the state government should extend the benefits the Other Backward Classes get to us.” Bharatiya Janata Party’s Maharashtra chief Chandrakant Patil alleged, “None of the ministers or the advocate general of the state were present for the hearing. In the absence of a proper study and preparations, the Apex court denied to hear the plea. The state government did not even ask for permission to exempt college admissions and recruitments completed in the rounds before the reservation was stayed. The government has disappointed the community. We expect the Thackeray government to at least extend the benefits applicable to OBCs to the Maratha community. Our government gave scholarships and other benefits to Marathas, when the reservation plea was pending in the Bombay high court.” BJP MP and Maratha leader Sambhaji Chhatrapati has said it would be a challenge to effectively argue on the reservation as the three judges who stayed reservation are part of the constitutional bench of five judges. Sachin Sawant, Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson, said, “The state government has left no stone unturned in the preparations required for the legal battle. The cabinet sub-committee held several rounds of meetings. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray reviewed it regularly. The process of hearing has begun and we will soon get expected results. The Opposition is criticising the government for the sake of politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-quota-give-us-benefits-now-demand-marathas-sc-refuses-to-lift-stay-hearing-on-january-25/story-cyCkzPeb4ZK71EDY8elC5L.html

The party has also planned a slew of programs, including job fairs and blood donation camps among others.The leader is turning 80 on Saturday, and the party has decided to celebrate it uniquely by using digital technology, state unit chief Jayant Patil said on Wednesday. “NCP will be celebrating Pawar saheb’s birthday at YB Chavan Centre in Mumbai with a limited number of people, to maintain social distancing amid the pandemic. But around 3 lakh people will be participating in the program through 400 to 500 virtual rallies across 36 districts of the state,” Patil said.Considering the shortage of blood at hospitals, the party has decided to organise blood donation camps from December 13-20. On the first day, Supriya Sule, party member of Parliament (MP) and daughter of the NCP chief, will donate blood along with state health minister Rajesh Tope, at a blood donation camp to be organised at YB Chavan Centre.The party has also set a target of providing 80,000 jobs to unemployed youths with the help of the state skill development and entrepreneurship department. State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik, who is also heading the skill development and entrepreneurship department, said that party workers have started registration of youths on Mahaswayam, a job portal started by the state government.“According to the website, around 214 companies need around 40,000 people for different portfolios. We will try to register 1.25 lakh youths seeking employment by December 12 and provide 80,000 jobs,” said Malik.The portal is working to connect employers and local, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers and ensures jobs to everyone, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-to-hold-over-400-virtual-rallies-across-maharashtra-on-sharad-pawar-s-80th-birthday/story-cggY7whLPbf19QYIoyOFLK.html

The Rs 700 cap applies to samples collected at private labs, hospitals and collection centres of laboratories. The RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard in coronavirus diagnosis. An order issued by additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said that a maximum of Rs 900 will be charged by the private laboratories for samples collected through home visits. The freshly capped testing rates would be inclusive of taxes, costs involved in pick-up, use of personal protection equipment, packing, transportation of samples, documentation and reporting in Haryana.

10-12-2020||Mumbai||Cloud cover over Mumbai, unseasonal rainfall unlikely, says IMD||The city witnessed partly cloudy conditions during the day and persistent cloud cover by the evening on Wednesday. The maximum and minimum temperatures, both in the suburbs and south Mumbai, were above the normal mark.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said cloudy conditions were under the influence of a weather system in the southeast Arabian Sea, and generally cloudy skies were predicted for the next three days, but Mumbai is not likely to witness any unseasonal rainfall.“According to our weather models, a low-pressure weather system has formed over the southeast Arabian Sea and led to the formation of associated weather systems along the west coast. While Mumbai is not likely to receive any rain, there is a possibility of rain for districts of south Konkan and south-central Maharashtra in the coming days. Associated rain warning will be issued on Thursday as we are monitoring this system closely,” said Bishwambhar Singh, director, regional meteorological centre, IMD Mumbai.However, on late Wednesday evening, very light drizzling was reported some parts of the city such as Powai and Santacruz for a brief period. However, the IMD did not update its forecast for any expected rain activity for late Wednesday night or Thursday. Meanwhile, even with less sunshine, there was a marginal decline in the maximum temperature, while the minimum temperature increased by 2 degrees Celsius from Tuesday to Wednesday. At the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, the day temperature was 36 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius above normal, as compared to 36.4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the hottest December day in six years and second hottest for the month over a decade. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was 20 degrees Celsius, 2 degree Celsius above normal. At Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, the day and night temperatures were 33.8 and 23 degrees Celsius respectively, both almost 2 degrees Celsius above normal. Moisture levels were low as 53% humidity was recorded in the suburbs 67% in south Mumbai. “This kept the heat index (air temperature and relative humidity) low leading to a reduced feeling of perceived hot weather,” said Singh.Though hazy conditions were witnessed on Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) was much lower than earlier in the week. It was 145 (moderate) on Wednesday against 173 (moderate) on Tuesday and 189 (moderate) on Monday, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Researchers said high temperatures and low moisture kept air quality in check. An AQI of 139 (moderate) has been predicted for Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cloud-cover-over-mumbai-unseasonal-rainfall-unlikely-says-imd/story-KOoQo6Gk2t5HtJbfgkNc0K.html
10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala police drop murder charges against BKU farmers lodged in Naraingarh||Haryana Police have quashed the murder case registered against some farmers, including Bhartiya Kisan Union Charuni’s (BKU Charuni’s) Ambala chief Malkit Singh, after a 70-year-old farmer died during BJP’s tractor rally in Naraingarh on October 14. Ambala SP Rajesh Kalia said the case was dropped on the basis of the reports received earlier this month. An SIT led by DSP (Cantt) Ram Kumar was investigating the matter, he said. “The reports from Madhuban (Karnal) and Khanpur Kalan (Sonepat) have confirmed that the farmer died of heart failure, not as it was alleged. So, we have quashed the FIR on December 7, but other case lodged for blocking the national highway will remain intact,” Kalia added. Naraingarh police station in-charge Gurmail Singh said, “We received the reports on December 2 after which we consulted the medical team that performed the autopsy at Naraingarh civil hospital. The doctors told us that the farmer had some heart-related problem and he died of heart failure.” Bharat Singh, the deceased farmer from Baragarh village of Shahazadpur, was on a tractor that was allegedly attacked by the protesting farmers on NH 344 (Ambala-Roorkee national highway). An FIR amounting to murder was registered against seven farmers.BKU state chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said the development has exposed the government’s real agenda. “What the reports have revealed now is the same that we have been saying since he (Bharat SIngh) died. The government’s conspiracy to register false cases has been exposed,” he added. This has come almost a week after senior leaders from the JJP, including Digvijay Chautala, party’s state chief Nishan Singh and others, met home minister Anil Vij in Chandigarh, seeking cancellation of cases against farmers. It’s pertinent to mention here that Kurukshetra MP Naib Singh Saini had on October 16 held a press conference in Chandigarh where he alleged that the “goons” of Charuni, Congress and Nirmal Singh were behind the attack that claimed the life of Bharat Singh and had termed it a “murder.”However, now Saini said, “He died of heart failure as the protesters blocked our way and tortured him.”On being asked about the cancellation of the case, he said, “I’m not in a position to speak on this. I’ll check the details and respond.”Saini was the organiser of the rally in support of the farm laws and was joined by Ambala MP and Union minister Rattan Lal Kataria, Ambala BJP chief Rajesh Batoura and other party leaders and workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-police-drop-murder-charges-against-bku-farmers-lodged-in-naraingarh/story-OwseUBV53iT02apZQvBWAP.html

10-12-2020||Delhi||Mayors stay put at Flagstaff Rd as AAP, BJP spar over protest||Mayors and office-bearers of the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations continued to camp outside Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Flagstaff Road for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, demanding the release of ₹13,000 crore due to the civic bodies. The AAP retaliated and said the crisis was the outcome of “rampant corruption”, “incompetence” and “financial mismanagement” within the civic bodies.The mayors were joined by BJP MPs Gautam Gambhir and Manoj Tiwari, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and BJP MLAs. Gupta said, “It is very unfortunate that even on the third day, CM Arvind Kejriwal did not bother to talk to corporation leaders.”The mayors and councillors said they are not deterred by the cold and will continue to sit there till Kejriwal meets them. “The CM, who has been attending to all other engagements, has not stopped to even address us. This is a fight for our constitutional right,” said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash.The cash-strapped civic bodies have not been able to pay salaries of employees on time with the north Corporation being the worst-affected -- salaries are due under the municipal body for the past three to four months.Senior AAP leader and party’s municipal affairs in-charge Durgesh Pathak said, “We will run the MCDs efficiently. The mayors are aware that the Delhi government has given all funds due to the civic bodies and it is because of their corruption that the MCDs are facing this financial ruin.” The party alleged that the north corporation had waived ₹2,457 crore owed to it by the south corporation, in lieu of rent on office space. “If the south corporation pays this money then for one year, the north civic body will not have any financial issues,” Pathak said. Meanwhile, south corporation mayor Anamika Singh and Delhi BJP leaders have filed a police complaint against deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Pathak over the latter allegedly publicly threatening to kill the mayors on Tuesday. The complaint was submitted to deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal, which was later forwarded to north district. DCP (north) Anto Alphonse said, “We have received the complaint. No FIR has been registered, so far.”Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said, “Everyone has a video in which AAP leader Durgesh Pathak is publicly saying that he will kill the corporation leaders and deputy CM Manish Sisodia trying to calm him down.”Pathak refuted the claims and said, “Who are we to beat the mayors? However, owing to the things they have done in Delhi, the people of Delhi will definitely beat them….The BJP has a habit of mixing random audios with random videos to defame and malign the image of the people. But they cannot divert attention from the issue of farmers. If they think that they will do all this to divert attention from the farm laws issue, then they are wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-stay-put-at-flagstaff-rd-as-aap-bjp-spar-over-protest/story-29m3TK9auaZHMDo5FkRQQO.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Gate to CM’s house blocked, claims AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday insisted that the central government has kept chief minister Arvind Kejriwal under a virtual house arrest -- a contention the Delhi police has denied. The party has alleged that the Centre does not want Kejriwal to support the ongoing farmers’ protest against the three farm laws with the party spokesperson Raghav Chadha saying on Wednesday that the police were still blocking the main entrance to the CM’s residence. “While one gate was opened on Tuesday evening, the main entrance that everyone uses to enter the CM’s residence to meet him was shut even today (Wednesday). Access to that entrance has been blocked as 4-5 members of the BJP are camping outside the CM’s residence, with active assistance from Delhi Police. The CM’s right to free movement, a fundamental right, has been curtailed,” he said.When contacted, the police said they cordoned off a small portion in front of the CM’s residence for security reasons as mayors and councillors of the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled corporations continued their sit-in protest for the third consecutive day over alleged unpaid dues. On Wednesday, they were joined by more BJP leaders, including MPs Gautam Gambhir and Manoj Tiwari. But, Chadha said the protest by BJP leaders is “just an excuse”, adding,“They are doing this so that the revolution brought forth by the farmers doesn’t get stronger by the participation of Kejriwal”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/access-to-delhi-cm-house-still-partially-blocked-centre-doesn-t-want-kejriwal-to-support-farmers-protest-raghav-chadha/story-CTyN5wSaA5geHQih8YLiTJ.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation budget: 3 new taxes proposed to hike revenue||In a bid to overcome its acute financial crisis, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has proposed three new taxes—professional tax, betterment tax and education cess—in its budget proposal for the financial year 2021-22 presented on Wednesday.The total budget projection of the East corporation for the financial year 2021-22 is Rs 4,647 crore. With the proposed new taxes, the civic body aims to boost its revenue by Rs 50 crore annually. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the property tax collection has been hit. The corporation is facing a dual challenge of increased responsibilities in terms of providing services with limited resources to do so. So, we propose three new taxes that will together help boost the corporation’s revenue by around Rs 50 crore,” additional commissioner Alka R Sharma said in her budget presentation for the financial year 20201-22. She was presenting the budget proposal on behalf of municipal commissioner Dilraj Kaur, who is infected with Covid-19.Professional tax, which was first introduced by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, has been proposed for self-employed professionals and businesspersons with an annual income of more than Rs 5 lakh. “Professional tax for those earning more than Rs 5 lakh a year will be levied at the rate of Rs 100 per month, while for those earning above Rs 10 lakh a year, it will be Rs 200 per month. The levying of this tax is estimated to generate revenue of Rs 10 crore a year,” said Sharma.According to civic officials, this new tax would be levied on self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, architects, those working in private firms, etc. for using civic amenities. The corporation also proposed an education cess of 5% on annual property tax. “Levying of this tax is estimated to generate Rs 10 crore a year,” said Sharma.She added that betterment tax is proposed at 15% of annual property tax. “The tax will be levied against properties, the values of which have constantly seen a rise because of public infrastructure development works. This is estimated to fetch the civic body Rs 30 crore annually,” she said.The three taxes were proposed in the previous year’s budget as well, but were not approved by the House.Other than this, the corporation has also proposed hiking the transfer duty (for change in the name of properties) by 1%. This tax is levied by the corporation on the transfer of immovable properties situated in its area of jurisdiction. Currently, transfer duty is 3% for male buyers and 2% for female buyers.“This year, the property tax collected till November 30 was Rs 150 crore, as against Rs 209 crore in 2019-20,” said an EDMC official requesting anonymity.However, EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said that the new tax proposals may not be approved. “We will have to thoroughly examine the new tax proposals. We don’t want to put additional burden on the people during the pandemic,” said Jain.Manoj Tyagi, AAP councillor and leader of the opposition, EDMC, said that the budget is not people-friendly. “We are not in favour of levying new taxes at a time when the economy is slow. The budget has nothing new to offer to boost revenue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/east-delhi-municipal-corporation-proposes-three-new-taxes-in-a-bid-to-boost-revenue/story-KRDHzPnWzsKjyvJAGLWoGO.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Rethink 80% bed reservation in pvt hospitals, HC tells govt||The high court on Wednesday asked the Delhi government to reconsider its decision of reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid patients after being told that half of such beds are lying vacant.Justice Navin Chawla turned down the request of the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, who had sought that the matter be listed after 10 days for better review of the situation after the petitioner’s counsel told the court that out of 5,081 ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, 2,360 were vacant as on Tuesday and that there was no justification for continuing the reservation of beds.Taking note of the submission, the court said that 10 days cannot be granted to review the order and it should be done immediately. It asked the government to re-consider its decision and file its stand by December 14 while posting the matter for further hearing on December 15. “See the figures. If 50% beds are lying vacant, it needs immediate review and not a review after 10 days,” the court said.The court was hearing a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers, who had challenged a September 12 decision of the Delhi government asking 33 private hospitals to reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. This order was stayed by high court on September 22.Later, on October 9, a division bench of the court took up an appeal by the Delhi government, refused to vacate the stay and adjourned the matter to November 27. The AAP government approached the Apex court against these two orders of September 22 and October 9. The Supreme Court refused to interfere with the high court’s order staying the AAP government’s instruction to private hospitals and asked it to go back to the high court.On November 12, a division bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad, finally, vacated the stay considering the increase in the number of cases in the city. On Wednesday, appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, told the court that they are taking all precautionary measures and that the matter be heard after December 17.He said that a meeting was held by Delhi health minister on December 7 to review the current Covid-19 situation in Delhi. Ghose said that the order to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 hospitals would be reviewed again on December 17. However, appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Maninder Singh and advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, told the court that several ICU beds in government as well the private hospitals are lying vacant.Taking details from the Delhi corona app, Singh told the court that while 534 ICU beds with ventilator were lying vacant, another 1,038 ICU beds without ventilator are also unoccupied. Singh said in case of non-Covid-19 ICU beds, out of 1,420, at least 314 beds are lying vacant.The court agreed with the contentions raised and asked the Delhi government to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-govt-to-rethink-80-bed-reservation-in-pvt-hospitals/story-aZBW9qmvE3E7taUUmU9tuO.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||At Ghazipur, 2 elderly UP farmers start indefinite hunger strike||On a makeshift stage set-up on the Delhi-Meerut expressway, one of the prominent sites for ongoing farmers protests, all eyes were on Suresh Chand (60) and Bhudev Prasad (70).Chand and Prasad, both farmers from Uttar Pradesh, had taped their face with paper messages on them.“On hunger strike following Gandhi ‘s principles,” read the message written on the paper mask on Chand’s face. He has been on an indefinite hunger strike and a silent protest since Monday, demanding revocation of the three new farm laws passed by the Centre. He was also joined by Prasad on Tuesday. On Wednesday, both were responding to queries of people around them by writing down their answers in a notebook they kept with them.Chand, a resident of Summer Pur village in Firozabad, said he will not break his silence or eat anything till the Central government revokes the three new laws. He said that his family of 11 is dependent on the produce they grow on a 4.5 acre land. “We grow wheat, rice, maize, and potatoes on a seven bigha land and don’t earn much out of it. The new farm laws will reduce our income. already have a debt of Rs 5,000 from the bank.”Similarly, Prasad, who hails from a village in Aligarh, said that he is in debt. “I have Rs 2 lakh to repay. My family of eight is completely dependent on the 12 acres of land we own. We primarily grow sugarcane and we don’t receive our payments on time from the mill owners. That’s why we are always under debt.”“This is our state when we have Minimum Support Price (MSP). Imagine what happens when MSP is withdrawn. If we do not fight against these laws now our grandchildren will be working in someone else’s farms a few years down the line,” he said.The farmers fear the new laws will do away with the guaranteed MSP, enabling private players to procure produce at much lower rates. The government has been stating that MSP system will not be done away with.Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer from Uttrakhand protesting at Ghazipur border, said, “More people will join these two in their hunger strike in the coming days if the government does not listen to our demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-ghazipur-two-elderly-up-farmers-start-indefinite-hunger-strike/story-2Ze62E37FiRbWlPXpOOfVI.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Protest enters its 16th day, traffic on borders affected||Farmers continued to camp at Delhi’s borders for the 16th straight day on Wednesday, to protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, leading to partial or complete closure of the border points.At Singhu, Tikri, Chilla, and Ghazipur borders, protesters spent their day cooking and distributing food at langars (community kitchen), delivering speeches or putting up posters and raising slogans against the farm laws.All seven border points of Delhi — Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh in outer and south-western parts of the city and Chilla — have been shut since farmers from northern states laid a siege to demand repeal of the new laws.Since the border remained completely blocked, traffic continued to suffer in the city, as it has since November 24. Delhi traffic police said in an advisory, “Singhu, Auchandi, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh borders are closed. Available open borders to Haryana are following borders – Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.”The protest site at Ghazipur border also remained peaceful on Wednesday.The protesters on Wednesday continued to block one of the four carriageways of Delhi-Meerut expressways while traffic on other two lanes remained normal throughout the day. “We do not want to cause any inconvenience to the general public. Who would like to leave their homes and live on the roads? But our cause is important. We need to fight for it,” said Joginder Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar.At the Chilla border (Delhi-Noida) link road the farmers cleared one carriageway around 5.30 am allowing the vehicles to move into Noida from Delhi. The protesting groups at this border also remained peaceful and number of farmers remained low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protest-enters-16th-day-traffic-across-border-points-affected/story-4m02gIgBKs7nc8x0xAulXP.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Govt planning collateral-free loans, doorstep assistance of CAs||The Delhi government is planning to offer collateral-free loans and doorstep assistance of chartered accountants and lawyers to entrepreneurs with a view to encourage the growth of start-ups, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday. The chief minister was speaking virtually at the IndUS Entrepreneurs (TiE) Global Summit and shared the Delhi government’s efforts in building a comprehensive start-up policy to turn the city into a global start-up destination.“As part of the start-up policy, we plan to provide collateral-free loans for start-ups in priority areas. We will also enable easy access to experts who can aid start-ups with accounting, taxation, registration, legal help, digital marketing, and other such services. Further, Delhi government will align its public procurement in a manner that a fixed percentage of goods and services are procured through recognised start-ups,” he said. The chief minister said a helpline will also be set up to answer all start-up related queries. “Individuals and start-ups will be able to use the government of Delhi’s doorstep service, by dialling 1076 and get a CA and/or lawyer to help them,” he said. Kejriwal reiterated that there are over 7,000 start-ups — valued at an estimated $50 billion — in Delhi, making it the city with the highest number of active start-ups in the country. He said the government is taking short and long-term steps to ensure start-ups have access to the best quality human capital by imparting entrepreneurship mindset curriculum in schools and opening the Delhi skill and entrepreneurship university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-boost-start-ups-delhi-govt-plans-collateral-free-loans-dedicated-helpline-and-doorstep-assistance/story-KBxWJ1ji47HR0f0fqowdNI.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||Active Covid-19 cases down to 20,000, lowest in 2 months||With fewer cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) being reported over the last 10 days in the city, the number of active cases (those still infected) has reduced to just over 20,000.According to the government’s health bulletin on Wednesday, there were 20,546 active cases in Delhi, which is the lowest in almost two months. Of the 72,079 tests conducted, 32,976 (45.7%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging. There were 6,460 containment zones in the capital, according to the bulletin. The city reported 2,463 new cases and 50 deaths due to the viral infection. So far, Covid-19 has affected over 599,000 people and killed 9,813 in Delhi. With fewer active cases, the pressure on the city hospitals has gone down. “It is heartening to see that Delhi is emerging victorious in the battle against the virus. First time Delhi has witnessed more than 13000 vacant covid beds in hospitals. Now the effect of the pandemic is on the decline,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. Meanwhile, 5,417 people are still admitted to hospitals in the city, as per Wednesday’s bulletin. The positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive—is also showing a decline. According to Wednesday’s bulletin, it was 3.42%, marking a week of the positivity rate staying below 5%. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for two weeks. “It is a very positive sign; however the government must continue to conduct as many tests as possible. No one can say for certain if there ill be another surge—for one, it is linked to the behaviour of the community which is not easy to predict,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/active-covid-19-cases-down-to-20-000-lowest-in-two-months/story-GdnXWPE2GHVd4FrR4g5QLI.html
10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC gets shot in the arm as UT releases complete grant-in-aid||In a major financial relief for the beleaguered municipal corporation, the UT administration has decided to release the entire pending grant-in-aid of Rs 173 crore to it. On Wednesday, it issued Rs 73 crore to MC, while the rest of the Rs 100 crore will be released in the next three months. With more funds, the civic body plans to revive development works it had suspended earlier. As part of the 2020-21 Budget, UT had allotted a meagre Rs 425 crore for MC as grant-in-aid. Following losses amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the administration had announced to even cut this down by 20%.However, now the funds have been restored and the corporation will receive the original aid of Rs 425 crore.MC’s own revenue collection also took a hit in the wake of the outbreak, forcing it to suspend all development works, even those already approved. Amid paucity of funds, it has been struggling to pay salaries to its employees and had to even monetise one of its fixed deposits and divert funds from other heads. Meanwhile, the administration has directed MC to augment its revenue and work out modalities for reducing expenditure. Development plans back on table With restoration of the aid, MC will be preparing a detailed plan of development works to be carried out. Recently, the civic body had earmarked around Rs 8 crore for councillors for priority works in their wards. “MC has asked the councilors to submit a list of works that have to be carried out in their wards. Urgent works will be carried out on priority based on their recommendation,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-gets-shot-in-the-arm-as-ut-releases-complete-grant-in-aid/story-YznkqmW8waTOXzfmsPpG1L.html
10-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn ready to increase wards, invites objections||The UT administration on Wednesday notified a draft notification regarding increasing the number of municipal corporation wards from 26 to 35. The administration has sought objections from the general public and other stakeholders within seven days, after which it will issue the final notification. The delimitation exercise is being taken up after nearly 14 years. The last delimitation of the wards was done in 2006 on the basis of the 2001 census. While the process was also initiated in 2015, it was not completed as the issue of including all villages in the MC was still pending. Delimitation committee deputy commissioner-cum-chairperson Mandip Singh Brar said, “Delimitation has been done to ensure equitable distribution of population in all wards in view of the addition of 13 new villages under the MC’s jurisdiction. The legal basis of the exercise is the 2011 census. We have also referred to the city’s latest electoral data.” In the wake of councillors and political parties’ long-standing demand of ensuring a homogenous electorate in wards, the delimitation committee has tried to keep urban areas and rural areas in different wards. “We have tried to keep the sanctity of the nature of the population as much as possible. But, with only data of an entire sector available in the 2011 census, splitting a sector’s population was not possible,” said Brar. Keeping urban character intactAt present, there are 26 wards in the MC that cover urban sectors and nine villages. The process has become crucial in the wake of addition of 13 new villages under the MC’s jurisdiction. The villages that were merged with the MC last year include Bahlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas. These villages have a population of over 50,000. “The wards do not have a uniform population. This is being corrected through the latest delimitation process. In order to keep the urban character of the city intact, the population in some wards will still be higher than others,” said a senior UT official. Key election year The delimitation exercise is all the more important with the MC elections less than a year away. With jurisdiction of most of wards changing, many of the existing councillors will see their wards break up. The Congress has criticised the administration’s handling of the delimitation process as ‘high-handed’. Pradeep Chhabra, the president of the party’s Chandigarh chapter, said, “The administration did not involve political parties in the process. They should have called an all-party meeting before issuing the draft notification.” On objections being sought by the administration, Chhabra, said, “Seeking objections is a mere formality. We can also approach the courts challenging the final notification.” At present, the Congress has five councillors in the house. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also plans to submit its objections in a couple of days. Convener Prem Garg said, “We want a uniform population in all wards. The continuity of the wards should also be maintained. AAP will contest from all seats in the MC election.” BJP general secretary Chander Shekhar, said, “We will study the notification and take a decision thereafter.” BJP currently has 20 councillors in the house.

10-12-2020||Pune||Maha-Metro sets June 2021 deadline to complete crucial Nal stop chowk flyover in Pune||The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (Maha-Metro) has set June 2021 as the deadline to complete the multi-storey flyover at Nal stop, Karve road, after they inspected the site on Wednesday. Once complete, the two-tier flyover will help decongest traffic on Karve road. During a joint visit to the site by officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Maha-Metro along with local elected representatives, it was decided to construct a four-metre road with two-metre footpath till the time the flyover is ready for use. Local corporator Manjusha Khardekar, who was present there, said, “PMC’s road and drainage departments along with Maha-Metro are working together to complete the flyover before the monsoon starts next year.” So far, Maha-Metro has completed the foundation work for the flyover with partial completion of some pillars. Gautam Birhade, executive director (civil work) of Pune Metro, said, “We have set a deadline to complete the two-tier flyover by June 2021. We have discussed the plan with PMC drainage and road department officials in detail and they are ready to provide full cooperation to complete the work as per the deadline. After shifting service lines, it will make it easier for us to speed up the work.” Abhijit Dombe, executive engineer of road department, said, “Last year, people had faced a lot of problems during monsoon. So, we have instructed them to complete the work as early as possible. We have given them permission to shift service lines. Pune Metro contractor will shift the service lines as per our plan and instruction. They will take two months to complete this work.” The proposed flyover will come up on 13 pillars with three of them in the middle of Nal Stop square. The top tier of the flyover will be for the metro rail while the lower tier will cater to vehicular traffic. Flyover will start after SNDT chowk on Karve road and pass over Nal Stop chowk and will descend just before the next square. It is 572 metres in length and 6.1 metres wide. The corporation contributed Rs 30 crore and Pune metro will add Rs 26 crore to construct this flyover. Jadish Khanore, chief superintendent of drainage department, said, “To clear the problem of waterlogging in the area, Pune metro will construct a 900 millimeter (mm) diameter stormwater drain line on both the sides of the road. Besides that, the metro contractor will lay down 600mm diameter drainage lines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maha-metro-sets-june-2021-deadline-to-complete-crucial-nal-stop-chowk-flyover/story-EK21Z0b88cGfRwGIdt29YK.html

It will be used to wash roads, footpaths, and trees to curb dust pollution.“This anti-smog gun said this is mounted on a BS-VI fuel certified engine truck, which is a significant step in reducing air pollution owing to lesser vehicular emission,” the government statement said. “The 5,000 litres of the water tank can wash the road, footpath, and trees in the median and sidewalks as this anti-smog gun has the facility to atomize the water and carry particulate matter suspended in the air,” the government statement read. It added, “Around 23 anti-smog guns have been installed by the PWD (Public Works Department) at key intersections and construction sites across Delhi, to combat dust pollution in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-launches-anti-smog-gun/story-Ic7wz7o0qen2clnhsacjnI.html
10-12-2020||Pune||Defence officials ok plot of land for Pune Lohegaon airport cargo use: Bapat||Pune’s Lohegaon airport will soon get control of a long-pending stretch of defence land bordering the airport.This will be used to expand the airport’s cargo facility. The transfer of the land came to a conclusion after BJP MP Girish Bapat met with defence officials and officials of the airport authority of India in Delhi recently. A written order is expected in the coming days said Bapat. Bapat said, “Yes we are expecting the transfer of land in the next 8-10 days. After multiple follow ups, we will finally get hold of the land as the defence ministry has given an in-principle approval for the same. The decision was taken at the meeting which took place in Delhi between myself, Airport Authority of India officials and Indian Airforce officials. The airforce needs a piece of land which the Airport authority owns in Chandigarh and in exchange the air force will hand over their Pune land to the airport authority.” The piece of land which is currently in possession of the Indian Air Force is the BSO Yard and CWE office land, spread across 8.5 acres and 2.5 acres, respectively. The land will now be used for the cargo needs of the airport. During a meeting with the Airport Advisory committee, Pune Airport Director Kuldeep Singh had said that due to the absence of this land, cargo facilities could not be expanded and so the city and airport are facing huge losses. Girish Bapat is also the chairman of the airport advisory committee. As of now due to the re-carpeting work, the flight operation timings have been limited to only 12 hours from 8 am to 8 pm. Currently about 70 flights arrival and departures which was 170-175 flights being operated at the airport daily. Kuldeep Singh during an earlier interaction had said, “Currently the Pune airport has a cargo capacity of about 150 tonnes in shipment daily which could be escalated to a much higher capacity. Sky is the limit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/defence-officials-ok-plot-of-land-for-lohegaon-airport-cargo-use-bapat/story-i1gR8q2t5e2DxWrdUBWZCL.html
10-12-2020||Delhi||For first time this season, min temp falls below 10°C||The minimum temperature in the national capital dropped below 10 degrees Celsius for the first time this season on Thursday, falling to 9.4°C, three notches below the normal mercury level, even as the met department said winter is setting in early this year.The maximum temperature in the Capital, meanwhile, stood at 25.6°C, two degrees below normal.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Monday forecast that minimum temperatures would fall under the 10°C mark this week because of cold winds blowing in from the direction of the snow-clad western Himalayas. Adampur and Faridkot in Punjab recorded the lowest minimum temperatures of the season so far on Thursday at 5.6°C, Hisar, Narnaul, Rohtak, Sirsa recorded temperatures of 8.2, 8, 9 and 8°C respectively. “Normally, minimum temperatures don’t drop below 10°C in November. In recent years, in 2017 during the last week of November, the minimum temperature had dipped to 7.6 degree C. It’s unusual for minimum temperatures to drop to single digits around this time. Winter is setting in early this year,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. In 2019 the lowest November temperature was 11.4 degree C and in 2018 it was 10.5 degree C.The weather forecaster on Thursday said it expects mercury levels to fall further from Sunday.Also Read: Covid-19 restrictions reduced global pollution levels by nearly 20%, shows NASA study“We are seeing a dip in minimum temperatures across northwest India and expect temperatures to dip further from November 22, when a western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region,” Srivastava said.He added that winds are likely to get faster from Friday, up to around 18kmph, thereby also dispersing pollution in the region. Delhi on Thursday recorded an air quality index (AQI) reading of 283, categorised as ‘poor’.Also Read: After a short breather, pollution levels rise in Delhi“The fall in minimum temperature is not abrupt. There are clear skies now, so the heat is radiating back. Minimum temperatures may go up marginally on November 21 before falling again after the western disturbance passes. There is a slight northerly incursion of cold winds and we are climatologically moving towards cold days,” said K Sathi Devi, head of national weather forecasting centre.A low-pressure area has formed over central parts of south Arabian Sea. It is likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over southwest Arabian Sea during the next 48 hours. The met department, in its Thursday bulletin, said minimum temperatures are likely to fall gradually by 2-4°C over northwest India during the next three days and over central India by 2-4°C gradually after 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minimum-temperature-in-delhi-falls-below-10-c-mark-for-the-first-time-met-says-further-chill-expected-from-sunday/story-Huvzx0mX0LNWXjB5apG7dK.html
10-12-2020||World||Biden names Asian-American Tai as top trade negotiator||US President-elect Joe Biden has named Katherine Tai his top trade negotiator and enforcer as US Trade Representative. If confirmed, she will take over ongoing trade talks with Indian counterpart Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, from Robert Lighthizer, a Trump administration hardliner. The Taiwanese-American, who will be the first Asian-origin person to head this federal agency, currently serves as the chief lawyer on trade for the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and was previously chief counsel on China trade enforcement in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The Biden-Harris transition team said Tai’s experience will allow the incoming administration to “hit the ground running on trade, and harness the power of our trading relationships to help the US dig out of the Covid-induced economic crisis and pursue the President-elect’s vision of a pro-American worker trade strategy”.India and the United States have been negotiating an interim trade deal that will eventually pave the way for an ambitious Free Trade Agreement. Talks started in the summer of 2019 after the Trump administration ended special benefits for India under US trade promotion programme that had allowed more than $6 billion worth of Indian goods to enter America free of import duty. The US wants greater access to India markets in dairy and medical devices sectors and the removal of what it has called discriminatory rules.Officials on both sides have been optimistic of signing the initial pact— which was said to be a “a few phones calls away” at one stage. There were expectations they could sign it after the November 3 elections. Lighthizer’s tough negotiating positions have been seen by Indians as the key reason for the prolonged talks.Biden also announced former US National Security Adviser Susan Rice to head his domestic policy council; former Obama chief of staff Dennis McDonough at secretary of veteran affairs; Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary for third term; and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge as secretary of housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-asian-american-tai-as-top-trade-negotiator/story-ThZaJ8FpWs9zKhb0XWzgBI.html
10-12-2020||World||UK slaps sanctions on Pak ex-cop for human rights violations||Anwar Ahmad Khan, the former senior superintendent of police in Malir District, Karachi, is among 10 people and one entity sanctioned by the Boris Johnson government for human rights violations on Thursday, including travel bans and freeze of their assets in the UK.Those sanctioned include Russian, Venezuelan and Gambian human rights violators, the Foreign Office said, adding that the sanctions have been imposed alongside the United States on International Human Rights Day.On the Pakistani former policeman, it said: “Rao Anwar Khan is the former Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in Malir District, Pakistan. In his role as SSP Malir, Khan was reportedly responsible for numerous staged police encounters in which individuals were killed by police, and was directly involved in over 190 police encounters that resulted in the deaths of over 400 people, including the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in 2018. Khan is therefore responsible for or complicit in, the serious violations of the right to life”.This is the third time the UK has sanctioned people or entities for human rights violations and abuses under a UK-only regime, with the first in July and the second in September 2020. In total, the US and the UK designated 31 actors today for their involvement in serious human rights abuses, the Foreign Office said in a statement. In Russia, the UK imposed sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against three individuals and the Terek Special Rapid Response Unit the statement said is responsible for torture and other human rights violations against LGBT people in Chechnya.Others include senior security figures In Venezuela and the former president of The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “Today’s sanctions send a clear message to human rights violators that the UK will hold them to account. The UK and our allies are shining a light on the severe and systematic human rights violations perpetrated by those sanctioned today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-slaps-sanctions-on-pak-ex-cop-for-human-rights-violations/story-F2HcGMrH7HY9OVC81jtVIO.html
10-12-2020||World||Canada says 2 citizens held in China have not been tried||Canada said Thursday that it has confirmed with China that two Canadians held for two years in China in a case linked to a Huawei executive have not been put on trial, contrary to remarks by a Foreign Ministry spokesperson.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor have been confined by China since December 10, 2018, just days after Canada detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant.Asked about the Canadians at a daily briefing on Thursday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said the two had been “arrested, indicted and tried,” in what appeared to be the first public assertion that they had been brought to court.Hua gave no details, and Canada’s Global Affairs Department issued a statement later Thursday saying that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing had spoken with the ministry, which confirmed that the men had not gone on trial.Chinese officials “confirmed that the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson,” the statement said.Chinese prosecutors announced earlier this year that Kovrig had been charged on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence, and Spavor on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.Neither China nor Canada has released specifics about their cases.Canada detained Meng at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition to face fraud charges.Hua said her case and those of the Canadians were ”different in nature,” with Meng’s being a “purely political incident.” Despite that, China has consistently linked the fate of the two Canadians to its demands that Meng be released immediately.Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne issued a statement Wednesday marking their two years of captivity, saying: “These two Canadians are an absolute priority for our government, and we will continue to work tirelessly to secure their immediate release and to stand up for them as a government and as Canadians.”“I am struck by the integrity and strength of character the two have shown as they endure immense hardship that would shake anyone’s faith in humanity,” Champagne said.Meng’s arrest severely damaged relations between Canada and China, which has sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of canola from Canada.Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, is living in a luxury Vancouver home while her extradition case continues in a British Columbia court. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.It’s not publicly known where Kovrig and Spavor are being held or under what conditions, although Canada’s ambassador to China testified to a House of Commons committee this week that they were “robust.”Canadian diplomats had been denied all access to the two men from January to October because of coronavirus precautions cited by the Chinese side. On-site visits were banned and not even virtual visits were permitted.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has described China’s approach as coercive diplomacy, spoke last month with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden about the case of the two men and said he expects Biden to be a good partner in persuading Beijing to release them.The United States marked the second year of the men’s imprisonment on Thursday by calling for their immediate release.The acting American ambassador to Canada, Katherine Brucker, said in a statement that they are being arbitrarily and unjustly detained.“We echo the calls from the Canadian government, the international community, and the families of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor for these two men to be released immediately and returned home,” Brucker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-says-2-citizens-held-in-china-have-not-been-tried/story-jDcZPWdfZl6pMRU3uevnHL.html
10-12-2020||World||Trump announces Israel, Morocco to normalise relations||Israel and Morocco have agreed to normalize relations, President Donald Trump said Thursday, marking the fourth Arab-Israeli agreement in four months. As part of the deal announced near the end of Trump’s term, the United States will recognize Morocco’s claim over the disputed Western Sahara region.Trump said Israel and Morocco would restore diplomatic and other relations, including the immediate reopening of liaison offices in Tel Aviv and Rabat and the eventual opening of embassies. US officials said there would be joint overflight rights for airlines.The White House said Trump and Morocco’s King Mohammed VI had agreed that Morocco would “resume diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel and expand economic and cultural cooperation to advance regional stability.”“Another HISTORIC breakthrough today! Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations – a massive breakthrough for peace in the Middle East!” Trump tweeted.The US will recognize Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara, the former Spanish territory in North Africa where a long-running dispute has confounded international negotiators for decades. Trump noted that Morocco had been the first country to recognize the United States as an independent nation just a year after the US declared its independence from Britain in 1776.“It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara,” Trump said.The deal is the result of talks conducted by the president’s senior adviser, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his chief international negotiator, Avi Berkowitz. “This is a significant step forward for the people of Israel and Morocco. It further enhances Israel’s security, while creating opportunities for Morocco and Israel to deepen their economic ties and improve the lives of their people,” Kushner said.Morocco is the fourth Arab nation to recognize Israel as the Trump administration seeks to expand a diplomatic framework that began over the summer with an agreement between the Jewish state and the United Arab Emirates.Bahrain and Sudan have followed suit and administration officials have also been trying to bring Saudi Arabia into the grouping.“The president reaffirmed his support for Morocco’s serious, credible, and realistic autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory and as such the president recognized Moroccan sovereignty over the entire Western Sahara territory,” the White House said.All these countries are geographically far removed from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, making it easier to strike deals with Israel and the U.S. for their own particular interests. Morocco also has close ties with Saudi Arabia, which has given its tacit support to the normalization process with Israel, even at a time when peacemaking with the Palestinians is at a standstill.Morocco, a country with centuries of Jewish history, has long been rumored to be ready to establish ties with Israel.Before Israel’s establishment in 1948, Morocco was home to a large Jewish population, many of whose ancestors migrated to North Africa from Spain and Portugal during the Spanish Inquisition. Today, hundreds of thousands of Israeli Jews trace their lineage to Morocco, making it one of the country’s largest sectors of Israeli society. A small community of Jews, estimated at several thousand people, continues to live in Morocco.Morocco has for years had informal ties with Israel. They established low-level diplomatic relations during the 1990s following Israel’s interim peace accords with the Palestinians, but those ties were suspended after the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in 2000.Since then, the informal ties have continued, and an estimated 50,000 Israelis travel to Morocco each year on trips to learn about the Jewish community and retrace their family histories.US backing for Morocco’s Western Sahara claim has long been a rumored, but unconfirmed, bargaining chip in talk about diplomatic ties. Morocco had claimed the vast desert area as its “southern provinces” since 1975 as the Polisario Front, based in southern Algeria, wants its independence. A recent dust-up with the Polisario brought the issue back into headlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-announces-israel-morocco-to-normalise-relations-in-latest-us-brokered-deal/story-B05bpqwRNLWoU7UUBdTBvO.html
10-12-2020||World||Brexit: Duty-free shopping, and other things that will change for UK, EU citizens from January 1||The European Union on Thursday published contingency plans to prepare for a possible “no deal” scenario as several issues remain unresolved after several rounds of Brexit trade talks. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, after agreeing on an 11-month transition period, ending December 31, 2020. Both parties have been using this period to negotiate the terms of their future partnership. Due to significant uncertainty over a deal before January 1, the European Commission has put forward a set of contingency measures to ensure smooth road and air travel between the UK and the member countries of the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that the negotiations are still going on but there is no guarantee that the two parties will be able to secure a deal before the end of the transition period. “Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities, including not having a deal in place with the UK on 1 January 2021. That is why we are coming forward with these measures today,” von der Leyen said in a statement.Also Read | EU trade talks to face ‘moment of finality’ on weekend: UK foreign ministerHere are a few things that will change for UK and EU citizens from January 1:New Immigration system: EU citizens will be treated on par with non-EU citizens and they will have to apply and pay for a visa to move to the UK to work, live or study. Under the new visa system, points will be assigned for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions. A minimum of 70 points is required to be eligible to apply, of which some are tradeable. Separate queue at borders: British nationals will have to use separate lanes at border control from those of EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens. They will be required to show a return ticket as well as prove that they have enough money to stay in the visiting countries.More paperwork: Free movement of people between the UK and the 27-member bloc will cease to exist from January 1, but British nationals already living in any EU country will have certain protections under the Withdrawal Agreement. However, they may have to apply for residency or meet specific requirements, as per the rules of the specific country. UK citizens moving to the EU in 2021 should check the rules for each country.Return of duty-free shopping: When the UK was an EU member, British nationals were allowed to bring an unlimited amount of duty-free alcohol and tobacco from EU countries for personal use as long as the duty had been paid in the country where they made the purchase. British passengers will now be able to buy duty-free alcohol and tobacco products, wherever available. The amount that passengers can bring back with them, although limited, will also significantly increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-duty-free-shopping-and-other-things-that-will-change-for-uk-eu-citizens-from-january-1/story-94OuCygiBzayhBbXRSb3cM.html
10-12-2020||World||Car bomb kills 16 including 3 Turkish troops in northeast Syria||A car bomb killed 16 people including two civilians and three Turkish personnel Thursday at a checkpoint in the Turkish-held border town of Ras al-Ain in northeast Syria, a war monitor said.The other 11 killed were local security forces or members of a Turkish-backed faction manning the checkpoint, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Twelve more were wounded, it said.Turkey said two of its gendarmes had been killed and a further eight wounded.Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies last year seized a 120-kilometre (75-mile) stretch of land inside the Syrian border from Kurdish forces, running from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad.Such bombings are common in Ras al-Ain.In July, the blast from an explosives-rigged motorbike ripped through a vegetable market there, killing at least eight people, including six civilians.The Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG), from whom the Turks and their allies seized the territory, played a key role in the US-backed fight against the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria.But Ankara views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that has waged a deadly insurgency in southeastern Turkey since 1984.Syria’s civil war has killed more than 387,000 people and displaced millions from their homes since erupting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bomb-kills-16-including-3-turkish-troops-in-northeast-syria/story-N7HjSvZJNTqKRUwfjn6EfL.html
10-12-2020||World||US inflation measure rose by more than forecast in November||A measure of prices paid by US consumers rose in November by more than forecast as costs of hotel stays, airfares and apparel jumped, though inflationary pressures elsewhere remained subdued as the pandemic continues to curb activity.The consumer price index rose 0.2% from the prior month after no change in October, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge rose 1.2%. The core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also advanced 0.2% from the prior month and increased 1.6% from a year earlier.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.1% gain in both the CPI and core measure.While services costs picked up last month by the most since July, a broadening of inflation will likely take time as the nation awaits the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Currently, merchants have limited leeway to charge customers more as unemployment remains elevated and a surge in infections prompts some states and cities to reimpose restrictions on business.The report showed the cost of transportation services jumped 1.8%, the most in four months. Airfares rose 3.5% after a 6.3% increase a month earlier, and motor vehicle insurance advanced 1.1% in November. Lodging away from home was 3.9% more expensive than in October, the largest gain since 2005.But many economists caution against expectations of a longer-lasting acceleration in inflation, in large part because unemployment is expected to remain elevated throughout the year. Shelter costs, which include rents and make up about a third of the CPI, are also expected to remain subdued. Measures of rents and owners equivalent rent were unchanged for the first time since 2010.Goods prices, meantime, were also unchanged in November from a month earlier. Clothing costs climbed 0.9%, while prices of used cars and new vehicles declined.Tame inflation has been a hallmark of the pandemic, as the coronavirus has curbed demand for services, which make up about 60% of the overall CPI and 75% of the core measure. Market participants are increasingly projecting prices to pick up next year as demand increases for those industries most impacted by the coronavirus.Inflation has been consistently running below the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal, which is measured by the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index. The softness helps explain ultra-easy monetary policy from the Fed, which has signalled it plans to keep interest rates near zero through 2023.Forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg generally expect inflation to temporarily rise above 2% in the second quarter of 2021 on an annual basis before settling back at or slightly below that level.A separate Labor Department report on Thursday showed applications for state unemployment benefits increased in the week ended December 5. While the figure may reflect volatility around the Thanksgiving holiday, it also indicates that more business shutdowns amid a spike in infections are playing a role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-inflation-measure-rose-by-more-than-forecast-in-november/story-4lQJ3KrVsZv6Z2h8lbpGTJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US jobless claims climb over 850,000 as coronavirus situation worsens||The number of people applying for unemployment aid jumped last week to 853,000, the most since September, evidence that companies are cutting more jobs as new virus cases spiral higher.The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of applications increased from 716,000 the previous week. Before the coronavirus paralyzed the economy in March, weekly jobless claims typically numbered only about 225,000.The latest figures coincide with a surging viral outbreak that appears to be weakening the job market and the economy and threatening to derail any recovery. Consumers thus far haven’t spent as much this holiday shopping season as they have in previous years, according to credit and debit card data. And in November, employers added jobs at the slowest pace since April. Restaurants, bars and retailers all cut jobs last month.The increase reflected sharp increases across the country, with new applications for jobless aid jumping more than 47,000 in California, 31,000 in Illinois, 17,000 in New York and 13,000 in Georgia. Many states, particularly California, have adopted sweeping new restrictions on business activity. But even some states that generally haven’t imposed stricter rules on businesses reported sharp increases in jobless claims last week. In Texas, for example, they jumped by nearly 20,000 to 45,000.The worsening figures may partly reflect a rebound after applications for unemployment benefits had fallen during the Thanksgiving holiday week. Still, the increase was much larger than most economists had expected.“It’s evident the labor market is still in crisis,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at the Indeed job search website. “The gap between now and when a vaccine is widely distributed looms large. There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead for the labor market going into the new year.”The total number of people who are receiving state-provided unemployment aid rose for the first time in three months to 5.8 million, the government said, from 5.5 million. That suggests that some companies have sharply pulled back on hiring.All told, more than 19 million people are still dependent on some type of unemployment benefit. And unless Congress acts soon, nearly half of them will lose that aid in just over two weeks. That’s when two jobless aid programs that the federal government created in the spring are set to expire.The first program provides unemployment benefits to the self-employed and contract workers, who weren’t eligible in the past. The second program is the one that extends jobless aid for 13 weeks.Members of Congress and the Trump administration are fighting over a roughly $900 billion relief package that could extend the two programs into the spring, sparing about 9 million unemployed Americans from what would otherwise be deeper financial distress.A bipartisan group of senators has proposed to extend the supplemental aid for four months and add $300-a-week in federal jobless aid. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday proposed a one-time round of $600 relief checks — half the $1,200 that was provided in the spring. But Mnuchin’s proposal includes no funding for supplemental unemployment aid payments, drawing sharp objections from Democrats in Congress.With a coronavirus vaccine nearing approval, many economists are optimistic that the economy will rebound strongly next year. But most favor another federal financial relief package to support unemployed workers, small businesses, and state and local governments until then.New confirmed virus cases are now topping 200,000 a day, up from only about 30,000 in the spring. And the average number of deaths each day in the past seven days has surpassed 2,000, roughly matching its peak in April.The virus’ acceleration has led many governors to impose stricter curbs on restaurants, gyms and other business activity in states from North Carolina to California and Washington state.The pandemic appears to have also sharply restricted holiday spending, in part because of stay-at-home orders and other restrictions and in part because many consumers are reluctant to go out shopping. A jump in online spending hasn’t fully offset a steep decline, compared with last year, in spending at physical stores.According to data from Opportunity Insights, a research center affiliated with Harvard and Brown universities, spending on debit and credit cards sank nearly 12% in the week that ended November 29 compared with a year earlier. That marked a sharp drop from the previous week, when such spending was down just 2.3% from 12 months earlier.The steady stream of layoffs across the country has intensified the financial hardships for many Americans.One of the jobless, Montrell McGraw, says he just had to cancel his car insurance and now can’t drive because his unemployment benefit of just $225 a week isn’t enough to keep up with the payments. He was able to cover all his bills when the federal government provided an extra $600 in jobless aid. But that ended in July.McGraw, 26, lost his job as a cook at a Hilton Hotel in New Orleans, where he lives, back in March just after the virus erupted in the United States. He says he’s applied for 35 jobs without any luck.

10-12-2020||World||EU on brink of landmark budget, virus recovery fund deal, says Hungary PM||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Thursday that the European Union is on the brink of sealing an agreement on a massive budget and a coronavirus recovery package, signaling that it has almost overcome objections from his country and Poland about tying EU funds to upholding the rule of law.“We are just one inch from reaching a consensus,” Orban told reporters as he arrived at EU headquarters in Brussels for a two-day summit, adding that all sides are fighting for “a victory for common sense.”“It is obvious that when our nations and so many millions of people are in real need because of (the) pandemic and the economic consequences of that, we have to behave reasonably,” said Orban, whose nationalist governments has been accused of undermining judicial independence and media freedoms.The 1.82 trillion euro ($2.21 trillion) long-term budget and recovery package is considered vital for many European countries whose economies have been devastated by the virus. Poland and Hungary had agreed to the deal in July but later vetoed it over a new mechanism that would allow Brussels to cut off EU funds to countries that violate Europe’s democratic standards.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned that it’s a case of us now, you tomorrow.“We have to avoid any arbitrary and politically motivated decisions,” he said. “Today, we fear that we might be attacked in unjustified way, but of course in the future (it can be) any country.”The apparent breakthrough comes just days after it appeared that their 25 EU partners might go it alone and create a new coronavirus recovery package without them.Ahead of the two-day summit, EU diplomats and officials said the solution would take the form of a declaration clarifying that the rule of law mechanism would not be used against any country without a ruling from the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, first. That process could take a year.“A compromise is currently being found. I hope it can be finalized in the coming hours,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday.But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte still has questions. He plans to seek legal advice, particularly as to whether the compromise would violate the agreement previously reached between EU member countries and the European Parliament.Rutte said he also wants to be sure that any court ruling “can retroactively establish that violations have occurred.”If the leaders fail to adopt the budget for 2021-2027 before the end of the year, the bloc will have to function on limited resources, with a maximum of one-twelfth of the budget for the previous financial year to be spent each month.Many projects for Poland and Hungary — which are already being formally investigated by the EU for their potential violations of the rule of law — could be held up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-on-brink-of-landmark-budget-virus-recovery-fund-deal-says-hungary-pm/story-C4rvNAc88yDz7n4hnb5aPI.html

It says that its users are not locked in and that competition is just one click away on the internet. “Android provides people with unprecedented choice in deciding which applications they install, use and set as default on their devices, and enables millions of app developers around the world to build successful businesses,” Google said.Seznam said the claim, based on the period between 2011 and 2018, was sent to Google in the past few days with a 30-day deadline and it was prepared to take civil legal action.With a 25% share of the Czech search market, Seznam said it earned revenue of 4.69 billion crowns in 2019 and cumulative revenue of 32 billion crowns since 2011.Reuters reported in November that a group of 165 companies and industry bodies have called on European Union antitrust enforcers to take a tougher line against Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/google-faces-417-million-claim-from-czech-search-engine-seznam/story-BAbngYj3xzVAUr1J8xPjNM.html

The Foreign Office are following the issue of protests in India closely.”Dhesi had asked if Johnson could convey to Prime Minister Narendra Modi the anxieties in the UK about images of police action against the protesting farmers in and around Delhi.Dhesi said: “Many constituents, especially those emanating from the Punjab and other parts of India, and I were horrified to see footage of water cannons, tear gas and brute force being used against peacefully protesting farmers.”“However, it was heart-warming to see those very farmers feeding those forces who had been ordered to beat or suppress them…what indomitable spirit…it takes a special kind of people to do that”.“So will the prime minister convey to the Indian prime minister our heart-felt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock, and does he agree that everyone has the fundamental right to peaceful protest”, he asked.To this, Johnson had responded: “Of course, Mr Speaker, and our views as the honourable gentleman knows well, of course, we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle and I know that he appreciates that point”.The exchange came days after the Foreign Office had refused to comment on the farmers’ agitation, when its spokesperson said: “The police handling of protests are a matter for the Government of India.”Dhesi last week coordinated a letter signed by 36 MPs from various parties to foreign secretary Dominic Raab, asking him to raise the farmers’ issue with the Indian government. A protest demonstration was held outside the Indiann high commission on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-misheard-question-says-office-on-his-terming-farmer-protest-an-india-pak-issue/story-XbBOyRvzuYmV96eY6S8ElL.html

He headed the public works and transport ministry in 2014, shortly after the arrival of the Rhosus ship carrying a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate which detonated at the port.Officials have said the cargo of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical, was stored unsafely for years at the port, which lies in heart of the city.Diab’s office, Finianos and Khalil, who is a senior aide to Lebanon’s influential Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, could not immediately be reached for comment.Four months after one of the largest non-nuclear explosions on record, which injured thousands of people, victims are still waiting for the results of an investigation their leaders had promised would come within days of the Aug. 4 port blast.The judge leading the official inquiry, Fadi Sawan, sent a letter last month asking parliament to probe 10 former ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-judge-charges-pm-ex-ministers-over-beirut-port-blast/story-pqGf8Gs0UcPYbcWeas3OsN.html
10-12-2020||World||Fight climate change like we battle Covid-19, says Paris Accord chief negotiator||Laurent Fabius, the Frenchman who brought down the gavel to seal the Paris Accord on climate change five years ago, said he wished world powers had fought global warming as resolutely as they have confronted the coronavirus pandemic.The agreement between almost 200 states on Dec. 12, 2015 was hailed as a potential turning point in efforts to contain global warming. It called for holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.While the long-term trend in global temperatures is now downwards, progress is insufficient, Fabius said, blaming a lack of political will among many governments, not least the United States under President Donald Trump.However, in an interview with Reuters, he highlighted some positive developments, including President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to bring the United States back into the accord.Governments have taken courageous financial and social decisions to halt the virus, but climate change poses an even graver threat, Fabius said.“Unfortunately, we are not doing as much to fight climate change as we are to tackle the fallout from Covid,” said Fabius, who was chief negotiator at the Paris talks and is now president of France’s Constitutional Council.He said it was critical that in the global recovery from the pandemic, the rebound is “green” and money is not ploughed into old, polluting industries.The accord has brought some success, Fabius said. Scientific models had projected temperatures would increase 5 or 6 degrees and now estimated rises of 3 to 4 degrees by 2100. But this was still too high, he said.The thresholds set by the Paris Accord reflect scientists’ beliefs that a rise in temperatures of more than 2 degrees would doom the planet to a future of rising sea levels, catastrophic floods, droughts and storms, and food and water shortages.BIDEN: A GAME-CHANGER?Fabius, a former prime minister who was France’s foreign minister at the time of the accord, recalled sleepless nights during two weeks of intense negotiations. The accord almost fell apart at the last moment.He has a cherished replica of the green wooden hammer: cheers erupted and diplomats hugged as his gavel came down.“Since then, it’s not been the same. In particular there was the backtracking by US President Donald Trump, which was bad for America but more so the rest of the world,” he said.The United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, formally exited the accord on Nov. 4, a day after Election Day, fulfilling a Trump promise to withdraw.“A certain number of countries said to themselves: if the world’s biggest power doesn’t respect its commitments, why should we?” Fabius continued.But he said there had been a geopolitical shift in recent months. Biden has promised to rejoin the accord, China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060 and Japan by 2050.Fabius predicted that Biden’s task will not be easy, with control of the US Senate still up for grabs and energy lobby groups wielding huge influence in Washington.“(But) to move things we need every country in the world to act, not just one county.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-climate-change-like-we-battle-covid-19-says-paris-accord-chief-negotiator/story-RK8TgBFNiNv2zOIwvuKQgK.html
10-12-2020||World||China again blames India for border friction, talks of challenges in ties||India and China are facing challenges in bilateral ties, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday, blaming New Delhi for the ongoing border friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Common efforts were needed to maintain good relations between China and India, ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.Beijing was responding to Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar’s statement during an international think-tank interaction on Wednesday, saying bilateral ties are at the “most difficult phase” in the last three to four decades in the backdrop of the months-long impasse at the border.Referring to the ongoing standoff and Beijing’s role in violating existing bilateral agreements to keep the border peaceful, Jaishankar said: “Now for some reason, for which the Chinese have given us five different explanations, the Chinese have violated it.”What began as a military faceoff along the disputed LAC early May has triggered economic and cultural discord between the two neighbours with New Delhi and Beijing grappling for ways to resolve the deadlock.Asked to comment on Jaishankar’s statement, the Chinese foreign ministry – as it has done before – blamed New Delhi for the troubles.“The merits of the situation at the border area is very clear and the responsibility totally lies with the Indian side. China has been strictly observing the agreements signed between the two sides and committed to resolving the border issue through dialogue and we are committed to safeguarding regional peace and tranquillity at border areas,” Hua said.New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Beijing’s claims, saying it was the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops who had illegally trespassed the LAC. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquillity in the border areas”Spokesperson Hua instead tried to portray China as a victim of aggression from India and said it will protect its territory.“In the meantime, we are determined in safeguarding our territorial sovereignty. We hope India can work with us and contribute to solidarity, cooperation and common development,” she said.“But like all sovereign states we are determined in safeguarding our territorial integrity. So, on the Indian side, I think this is a serious question on what it should reflect upon. There are challenges in bilateral relations but China’s position and policy on India hasn’t changed,” Hua said.Referring to the boundary issue with India, she said: “On the historical issues, China believes that we should find fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solutions based on equal footed consultation and put it on the proper position in our bilateral relations.”“We hope we can reach consensus, properly manage differences, enhance practical cooperation and bring our bilateral relations back on the right track,” Hua said.On Tuesday, Hua gave no definitive answer when asked when the next rounds of talks between the two countries would be held or what was causing the delay.“China and India have been in communication through diplomatic and military channels on the border issue and we are working for further de-escalation of the border situation,” Hua added.“Based on the implementation of the current consensus, we will have consultations to determine specific arrangements for further talks,” Hua said without giving any indications when future talks will be held.Though the standoff began in May, diplomatic relations have been particularly tense since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs.Beijing hasn’t revealed the PLA’s casualty figures.Several rounds of talks including eight military-level dialogues – the last one held on November 8 – have yielded no result as the standoff continues in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-again-blames-india-for-border-friction-talks-of-challenges-in-ties/story-V4IuwP0cQNBgM0bk1DiWIP.html

10-12-2020||World||EU trade talks to face ‘moment of finality’ on weekend: UK foreign minister||Britain’s foreign minister said Thursday that negotiations on a trade deal with the European Union will reach a “moment of finality” this weekend, with both sides assessing chances of an agreement as slim.To prepare for a possible no-deal exit on January 1, the EU on Thursday proposed four contingency measures to make sure air and road traffic can continue as smoothly as possible for the next six months.It also proposes that fishermen will still have access to each others waters for up to a year, to limit the commercial damage of a no-deal split. The plans depend on the UK offering similar initiatives.“Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.Von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a three-hour dinner meeting Wednesday in hope of unblocking stalled talks, but came away without making substantial progress.“We understand each other’s positions. They remain far apart,” von der Leyen said.They told their negotiators to keep talking, but set Sunday as decision day.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Sunday deadline set by Britain and the EU for a decision was final — though he added “you can never say never entirely.”Without a deal, the bloc and Britain face a tumultuous no-deal split at the end of the month, threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in losses.Britain left the EU on January 31, but remains in its economic structures until the end of the year. That means a serious economic rupture on January 1 that could be chaotic if there is no trade agreement. A no-deal split would bring tariffs and other barriers that would hurt both sides, although most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit because the UK does almost half of its trade with the bloc.Months of trade talks have failed to bridge the gaps on three issues — fishing rights, fair-competition rules and the governance of future disputes.While both sides want a deal, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into UK industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep — hence the demand for strict “level playing field” guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.The UK government sees Brexit as about sovereignty and “taking back control” of the country’s laws, borders and waters. It claims the EU is trying to bind Britain to the bloc’s rules indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-trade-talks-to-face-moment-of-finality-on-weekend-uk-foreign-minister/story-KqmfeFwZ5Rs41RZpoha9lN.html

Trump had reiterated his claim of electoral fraud and asked why the election results weren’t immediately overturned. While the tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”, users noticed a retweet from the official Twitter handle of the Chinese embassy.Interesting retweet pic.twitter.com/5pdxSdPQyuA similar claim was made in September by Chinese embassy in the UK after its ambassador’s official handle liked a pornographic clip.

10-12-2020||World||African health official slams vaccine inequality, calls it ‘moral inequality’||“It will be extremely terrible to see” rich countries receiving Covid-19 vaccines while African countries go without, especially as a new surge in cases begins on the continent of 1.3 billion people, Africa’s top public health official said Thursday.As the world watches mass vaccinations begin in Britain, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director John Nkengasong has warned that Africa might not see vaccines until after the second quarter of 2021.Nkengasong called it a “moral issue” and urged the United Nations to summon a special session to discuss the ethical, fair distribution of vaccines to avoid “this North-South distrust in respect to vaccines, which is a common good.”Covid-19 will not be defeated in the West alone, he said, and he took aim at “today’s dialogue of suspicion” as rich countries buy vaccines “in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX facility,” the multinational initiative designed to deliver at least some vaccines to less developed countries.Africa won’t receive nearly enough vaccines from COVAX to reach the goal of vaccinating 60% of the population to achieve herd immunity, Nkengasong said, and he appealed to countries with excess doses to give them to COVAX or countries in need.“We need to show global cooperation, global solidarity,” he said, “The time to translate those powerful words into action is now.” He has warned that the coronavirus could become endemic in Africa if vaccinations take too long.Africa’s 54 countries now have a total of more than 2.3 million confirmed infections, including 100,000 in the past week.“Clearly the second wave is here, no doubt,” Nkengasong said. He called this“a pivotal moment in the history of our continent” with Africa’s development in the balance.As he spoke, the World Trade Organization was meeting in Geneva on a request by South Africa and India to waive some intellectual property rules to allow for faster, easier access to Covid-19 vaccines around the world.“But a small group of high-income countries and their trading partners have opposed it including Brazil, the European Union, Canada, the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement with Amnesty International supporting the waiver.Rohit Malpani, a Paris-based public health consultant, said opposition to the waiver would further delay the production of vaccines.“We have a situation where donor countries say they’re willing to provide funds to COVAX to buy vaccines but there are none available because of the (intellectual property) issue,” he said.“It’s like inviting someone to dinner and giving them a plate but then keeping all the food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-health-official-slams-vaccine-inequality-calls-it-moral-inequality/story-s93BzVT9W4gtkj62U67qLK.html
10-12-2020||World||EU looking to reinforce climate credentials during summit||Five years after the Paris agreement, the European Union’s climate credentials will be put to the test as the bloc’s leaders meet Thursday to try and seal an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared to 1990 levels.The EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. But the bloc’s heads of states and governments were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns among eastern countries about how to fund the green transition.But now that the bloc’s leaders are ready to sign off on the EU’s next long-term budget and coronavirus recovery package, the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package should help secure all 27 member states’ commitment to the improved target proposed by the commission, the EU’s executive arm.Large swaths of the budget and recovery aid are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants 37% of the 750 billion euros in the coronavirus recovery fund to be given to EU countries to spend on environmental objectives, while 30% of the bloc’s regular budget should be used for tackling climate change.Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for much of their energy needs. They consider it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without taking into consideration their respective energy mixes.László Palkovics, the Hungarian minister for innovation, told local media before the summit that his country was planning to propose a target of a 40% cut in emissions for all member states by 2030, with the remaining 15% to be assumed by the EU as a whole.According to draft conclusions of the summit, member states should agree that the new target “will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible. All Member States will participate in this effort, taking into account considerations of fairness and solidarity, while leaving no one behind.”World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would also be particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal. The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s.“It’s time for European leaders to deliver,” said ecological activist Adelaïde Charlier, a co-founder of Youth for Climate Belgium. “It’s crucial for the EU if they want to stay leaders, they really have to step up their game.”Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.“To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,” the NGO said in a statement Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looking-to-reinforce-climate-credentials-during-summit/story-e2dwZX9DnJKoOquvdnBQDJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Biden to pick Katherine Tai as top trade envoy: Report||President-elect Joe Biden is set to nominate Katherine Tai to be the top US trade envoy, according to two people familiar with his plans.Tai, who is chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, will be tapped as the US Trade Representative, according to the two people, who spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about it.The role is a Cabinet position, and the Senate will vote on whether to confirm Tai for the position. Biden’s selection of Tai, who is Asian American, reflects his promise to choose a diverse Cabinet that reflects the makeup of the country.Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Tai earlier oversaw China trade enforcement for the Office of the US Trade Representative, setting US strategy in trade disputes with China. Biden’s trade representative will inherit a trade war with China, put on pause by an interim trade pact in January that left many of the hardest issues unresolved and US taxes remaining on $360 billion in Chinese imports.As the top trade staffer at Ways and Means, Tai handled negotiations last year with the Trump administration over a revamped North American trade deal. Under pressure from congressional Democrats, Trump’s trade team agreed to strengthen the pact to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and demand better pay and benefits -- decreasing the incentives for US firms to move south of the border to take advantage of cheap and compliant labor.The administration also dropped from the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement what Democrats considered a giveaway to pharmaceutical companies that could have kept drug prices high.Tai is considered a problem-solving pragmatist on trade policy, which often breaks down into an ideological divide between free traders and protectionists. In a letter to Biden on Nov. 24, California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and nine other female House members praised Tai’s “experience and diplomatic abilities’’ and said she is “uniquely qualified’’ to deal with Canada and Mexico on the USMCA and with US-China trade tensions.“Katherine would be the first Asian American and the first woman of color to serve in this role, breaking barriers and clearing the way for others to follow,” Chu added in a statement Wednesday.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member on the finance committee, called Tai “an inspired choice” for the position.“Ms. Tai has the experience she needs to succeed as USTR, and her record of getting wins for American workers demonstrates she knows how to champion the values that matter to US families,” Wyden said. “She worked closely with me and my staff to craft the strongest ever protections for American workers in a trade agreement, and pass them into law with bipartisan support.”He urged Senate Republicans to quickly confirm her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-pick-katherine-tai-as-top-trade-envoy-report/story-795SWmcrmUVq7rBo9InDeP.html
10-12-2020||World||Trudeau govt didn’t want to cancel military drill with China, reveal secret papers||An aide of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had opposed a move by the Canadian military last year to cancel training with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) due to security concerns, according to a media report. Citing secret government documents, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday that Canada’s global affairs department pushed back against a decision by Gen Jonathan Vance, Chief of Defence Staff, to cut interactions with the PLA.Officials at the global affairs department, including then deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart, were alarmed that Vance had cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019. Shugart is now clerk of the Privy Council, Canada’s top bureaucrat, who reports directly to Trudeau.The newspaper’s report came against the backdrop of growing global concern over China’s increasingly assertive and aggressive actions, including the standoff with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Canada is also locked in a diplomatic spat with India over Trudeau’s comments supporting the farmers’ protest in India, which the external affairs ministry has described as interference in the country’s internal affairs.The secret Canadian documents suggested that the cutting back of interactions with the PLA could be seen by Beijing as reprisal for the arbitrary arrest of two Canadians.“Should Canada make any significant reductions in its military engagement with China, China will likely read this as a retaliatory move related to the Meng Wanzhou case,” the daily cited a February 2019 memo as saying. The memo was sent to Shugart, outlining the case for a letter he would be sending to Jody Thomas, then deputy minister of national defence.The memo described the move as a decision taken “unilaterally” by the Canadian military, apparently meaning the armed forces did not consult global affairs.“Unilateral decisions to postpone and/or cancel previously agreed DND/CAF cooperation with the PLA risk being interpreted by China or others in an unintended (and unhelpful) way. [This] could also damage Canada’s long-term defence and security relationship with China,” the memo said.Shugart subsequently asked the defence department to check with global affairs before cancelling or postponing any future engagements with the PLA. The US too had raised concerns about joint military exercises that could benefit the PLA, according to the secret documents. An unnamed senior Canadian official was quoted by The Globe as saying that Vance, on the urging of the US, cancelled winter exercises with the PLA and later all military interactions. The February 2019 memo was written months after Canada-China ties went into a tailspin after Beijing locked up two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, in apparent retribution for Ottawa’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese tech firm Huawei. Canada had arrested her following a US extradition request.The documents were released through access-to-information law, though the global affairs department said they hadn’t been adequately censored before release owing to human error. Michael Chong, the foreign affairs critic of the opposition Conservative Party, and James Bezan, the defence critic, said the documents showed a “stunning lack of leadership” from Trudeau and the Liberal government. “Clearly, the Prime Minister and Liberal ministers are more concerned about how Beijing might react than in defending Canadian interests. The Liberal government has become so timid that it can’t even say no to Chinese soldiers arriving on our territory,” they said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-aide-opposed-cancelling-military-drill-with-pla-worried-what-china-will-think/story-DTEh1sadIyUeSsPsY0oHVL.html
10-12-2020||World||Over 80 million people forcibly displaced globally as of mid-2020, Covid further worsened crisis: UN||More than 80 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide as of mid-2020, with existing and new conflicts as well as the Covid -19 pandemic dramatically affecting their lives this year, a UN report has said.According to its report on trends in global forced displacement released on Wednesday in Geneva, The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR estimates that global forced displacement surpassed 80 million at mid-year.At the beginning of this year it said that about 79.5 million people had been forced from their homes due to persecution, conflict, and human rights violations. This total included 45.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs), 29.6 million refugees and others forcibly displaced outside their country, and 4.2 million asylum seekers. “Existing and new conflicts and the novel coronavirus have dramatically affected their lives in 2020,” the UN agency said.An estimated 30–34 million (38-43 per cent) of the 79.5 million forcibly displaced persons are children below 18 years of age (end-2019).More than two thirds of all refugees under UNHCR’s mandate and Venezuelans displaced abroad came from just five countries - as of mid-2020- Syria (6.6 million), Venezuela (3.7 million), Afghanistan (2.7 million), South Sudan (2.3 million) and Myanmar (1 million). Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees, with 3.6 million people. Colombia is second with 1.8 million, including Venezuelans displaced abroad. The agency noted that for people forced to flee, Covid-19 became an additional protection and livelihoods crisis on top of the global public health emergency.“The virus has disrupted every aspect of human life and severely worsened existing challenges for the forcibly displaced and stateless,” UNHCR said, adding that some of the measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 made it harder for refugees to reach safety.At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in April, 168 countries fully or partially closed their borders, with 90 countries making no exception for people seeking asylum. Since then, and with UNHCR’s support, 111 countries have found solutions to ensure their asylum system is fully or partially operational while ensuring necessary measures are taken to curb the spread of the virus.The agency said despite UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal in March for a global ceasefire while the world fights the pandemic, conflicts and persecution continued. “Violence in Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Somalia, and Yemen drove new displacements in the first half of 2020,” it said, adding that significant new displacement has also been registered across Africa’s Central Sahel region as civilians are subjected to brutal violence, including rape and executions.“With forced displacement doubling in the last decade, the international community is failing to safeguard peace,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said. “We are now surpassing another bleak milestone that will continue to grow unless world leaders stop wars,” Grandi said.New asylum applications dropped by a third compared to the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, the underlying factors leading to conflicts globally remain unaddressed, the agency said.“Fewer durable solutions were found for the displaced in 2020 compared to the same period in previous years,” it added.Just 822,600 displaced people returned home, most – 635,000 – were IDPs. With 102,600 voluntary repatriations in the first half of the year, refugee returns dropped by 22 per cent compared to 2019.Resettlement travel for refugees was also on temporary hold due to the Covid-19 restrictions from March to June. Consequently, only 17,400 refugees were resettled in the first six months of 2020, according to government statistics, half the figure of 2019.Although the actual number of stateless people remains unknown, 79 countries in the world have reported 4.2 million stateless people on their territory, UNHCR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-80-million-people-forcibly-displaced-globally-as-of-mid-2020-covid-further-worsened-crisis-un/story-XRwsYxOgewTMB2e1P5gCBI.html

10-12-2020||World||Iran, Afghanistan open first rail link with eye on trade||The leaders of Iran and Afghanistan on Thursday inaugurated the first railway link between the two countries, expressing hope it would enhance trade links across the region.The 140-kilometer (90-mile) line running from eastern Iran into western Afghanistan will eventually be expanded by 85 kilometers to reach the Afghan city of Herat, providing a crucial transport link for the landlocked country, where decades of war have hindered infrastructure development.The $75 million project began in 2007, with Iran funding construction on both sides of the border as part of its development assistance to Afghanistan.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, speaking in a video conference, called it “one of the historic days” in relations between the two countries. He said Iran had succeeded in building the line despite sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the US withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani called the railroad a “precious gift from Iran” that would help restore the Silk Road, an ancient trade route that spread prosperity across Asia. The inauguration saw cargo trains depart from opposite ends of the line.Iran hopes to transform itself into a regional transport hub, allowing Afghanistan and other landlocked Asian countries to transport goods to its ports on the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Iran already has rail links with Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-afghanistan-open-first-rail-link-with-eye-on-trade/story-XXhPuBMm0c8gZuCtY7rvoN.html
10-12-2020||World||Tensions rise over masks as virus grips smaller US cities||Arguments over mask requirements and other restrictions have turned ugly in recent days as the deadly coronavirus surge across the US engulfs small and medium-size cities that once seemed safely removed from the outbreak.In Boise, Idaho, public health officials about to vote on a four-county mask mandate abruptly ended a meeting Tuesday evening because of fears for their safety amid anti-mask protests outside the building and at some of their homes.One health board member tearfully announced she had to rush home to be with her child because of the protesters, who were seen on video banging on buckets, blaring air horns and sirens, and blasting a sound clip of gunfire from the violence-drenched movie “Scarface” outside her front door.“I am sad. I am tired. I fear that, in my choosing to hold public office, my family has too often paid the price,” said the board member, Ada County Commissioner Diana Lachiondo. “I increasingly don’t recognize this place. There is an ugliness and cruelty in our national rhetoric that is reaching a fevered pitch here at home, and that should worry us all.”Boise police said three arrest warrants were issued in connection with the demonstrations at board members’ homes.In South Dakota, the mayor of Rapid City said City Council members were harassed and threatened over a proposed citywide mask mandate that failed this week even as intensive care units across the state filled with Covid-19 patients.The tensions are flaring amid an epic surge in US deaths, hospitalizations and infections over the past several weeks.Deaths are running at more than 2,200 a day on average, all but matching the level seen during the last spring’s peak in and around New York City. New cases per day have rocketed to more than 200,000 on average, and the number of patients in the hospital with Covid-19 stood at almost 105,000 on Tuesday, another all-time high.The grim figures led the usually stoic health director of the nation’s most populated county to become emotional. Barbara Ferrer described “a devastating increase in deaths” in Los Angeles County, with the total hitting 8,075 on Wednesday.“Over 8,000 people who were beloved members of their families are not coming back,” Ferrer said, fighting back tears.Meanwhile, protesters in Montana’s Gallatin County have gathered for two consecutive weeks outside the Bozeman home of county health officer Matt Kelley to decry regulations, including a statewide mask mandate. They have carried signs reading, “We refuse to be your experiment” and “Oxygen is essential.”Last week, around 80 people lined Bozeman’s Main Street to support Kelley and other health officials.In Montana’s Flathead County, where officials recorded 17 coronavirus-related deaths over 18 days and resistance to masks runs strong, the interim public health officer is resigning when her contract is up at year’s end, citing a lack of support from local authorities for measures to control the scourge.In Helena, Republicans who control both chambers of the Montana Legislature denied a request by Democratic lawmakers to require masks be worn inside the Capitol during the legislative session next month.In Missouri, Greene County officials recorded 51 Covid-19 deaths in the first eight days of December as hospitals overflow and hundreds of health care workers are quarantined. The area’s two major hospitals asked the city of Springfield, the county seat, to renew the city’s mask mandate before it expires in January. The county itself does not have a mask mandate, nor does the state.As the deaths pile up, Springfield Mortuary Services owner Brian Simmons is overseeing the embalming and cremation of Covid-19 victims as his own 48-year-old daughter battles the virus. She spent the past week hospitalized on a ventilator in one of the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.“You are just helpless,” he said. “There is nothing you can do about it. We haven’t seen her since she’s gone in.”South Dakota has suffered through the country’s worst rate of Covid-19 deaths per capita over the last week, but Gov. Kristi Noem has been ardent in her opposition to mask mandates or other aggressive efforts to slow infections.That hands-off approach drew vocal support at Rapid City Council meetings, even as doctors warned that the only large hospital in the western half of the state is facing a crisis and patients are being flown out of the state. The meetings drew hours of testimony from people who said the dangers of the virus are overblown and that mask requirements violate their liberties.Dr. Stephen Neabore, who works in the biggest hospital system in the region, said he has been frustrated as he tries to persuade people to wear masks. After working in New York City and studying medicine in England, he said, he sees a distinct skepticism toward government around him.“I still see people out here that will tell me that they don’t believe it’s any worse than a common cold,” he said.The City Council in Palmer, Alaska, rejected a mask mandate Friday for the community of 7,300 residents about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Anchorage.Opponents questioned the effectiveness of masks, wondered why a mandate more common in larger communities was even being considered, and threatened to take their business online or to the neighboring city of Wasilla, which doesn’t have a mask order.Many implored the City Council not to follow the steps of “liberal” Anchorage in forcing residents to require face coverings.“We are not Anchorage and should not be treated as if we are,” Rhonda Hayhurst said in an email to the council. “I moved out here to get away from tyranny as being imposed by the Anchorage administration.”Coronavirus deaths also have been rising rapidly in rural parts of Iowa, where many people disdain masks. Among the hardest hit is O’Brien County, population 13,800, where 42 deaths have been blamed on the virus.Ty Rushing, who covers the region as managing editor of the Northwest Iowa Review, said obituaries in his newspaper have been piling up.“It’s sad to say, but I think people are just numb to it or they are sticking their head in the sand about it,” Rushing said.In Iowa’s Harrison County, 47 deaths have been attributed to the virus out of population of about 14,000. Most of the deaths have resulted from outbreaks at nursing homes in small towns like Dunlap.Dunlap City Clerk Meredith Van Houten said almost everyone in the town of about 950 people has a connection to those who have died. She said one was her old neighbor.“It’s a horrible time right now,” Van Houten said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-rise-over-masks-as-virus-grips-smaller-us-cities/story-tIsVfDVzQXH6cgyqD5iysO.html
10-12-2020||World||Use diapers to cut down toilet visit, China tells flight cabin crew||Cabin crew deployed in special flights to high-risk Covid-19 destinations should wear disposable diapers to cut down bathroom visits, China’s aviation regulator has said, as fewer toilet visits will cut down the risk of infection.The recommendation is part of a new set of guidelines for airlines and flight and cabin crew issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).The 38-page long document titled “Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Guideline for Airlines” and a separate 11-page “Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Guideline for Airports” also focus on monitoring and taking care of the “psychological” health of flight crew and airport personnel.They should be provided humanistic care and psychological counselling, the guidelines said.The CAAC, which published the recommendations on its website, said they apply to charter flights to and from countries and regions where infections exceed 500 in every one million people.The diaper advice is in a section on personal protective equipment.“It’s recommended that cabin crew wear disposable diapers and avoid using the lavatory unless in special circumstances to reduce the risk of infection,” the guidelines said.Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for cabin crew members include medical protective masks, double-layer disposable medical rubber gloves, goggles, disposable caps, disposable protective clothing, and disposable shoe covers.On the mental health front, the guidelines said the crew members’ family pressures should be taken into account.“Efforts shall be made to have an understanding of the mental health conditions of front-line crew members. Duty scheduling for international flights shall be made after giving full consideration to crew members’ psychological conditions, personality, current family life pressures, social support system and other circumstances,” the CAAC recommended.Among the necessary psychological measures to be taken are creating the environment “achieve psycho-social security”.Effective mental health support and assistance shall be provided for aviation staff through cooperation among aeromedical professionals, other medical professionals, psychological professionals and aviation staff, and “a peer-to-peer supportive group shall be promoted among aviation staff to facilitate mutual support and encouragement.”Other advice for the flights includes dividing the cabin into “clean area, buffer zone, passenger sitting area and quarantine area,” separated by disposable curtains.The last three rows should be designated as an emergency quarantine area, said CAAC.While most international flights remain suspended, China’s domestic civil aviation market has shown signs of rapid recovery.A total of 371,000 domestic passenger flights took off in September, up 3.5% from a year ago, Qiao Yibin, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told a news conference in October.Domestic passenger numbers reached 47.75 million, or 98% of 2019’s levels, Qiao said.Airlines have rolled out promotional deals featuring all-you-can fly packages to fuel a recovery in Chinese passenger numbers, though based on lower fares than the prior year, a Reuters report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/use-diapers-to-cut-down-toilet-visit-china-tells-flight-cabin-crew/story-l1Uaw3hV7O3ir8K5TduyjN.html

The Australia-India Strategic Research Fund (AISRF) has funded six new projects, including one to develop Covid-19 diagnostic technologies and a study of the longer-term effects on the hearts and lungs of patients who have recovered, the Australian science and industry ministry said on Thursday. The other projects will develop risk management systems to protect farmers from disasters associated with climate change and demonstrate how food-drying technology using renewable energy can reduce pollution in the food processing sector. Australia’s industry, science and technology minister Karen Andrews said work in these important areas will continue after significant delays caused by the pandemic. Also read | Gates Foundation pledges additional $250 million to deliver coronavirus vaccines; total Covid funding at $1.75 billion“This latest funding will enable Australian and Indian researchers to contribute to the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including in crucial screening and diagnostic testing,” she said. India and Australia have tackled several shared challenges since AISRF was established in 2006, with important progress made in areas such as agriculture, energy and health, she said. “The Australian government remains committed to our strong, strategic relationship with India, which provides numerous economic benefits for both countries,” she added. In June, the Australian government announced it would commit Australian $15 million to extend AISRF for another four years till 2024, bringing its total funding for AISRF grants to nearly $100 million over 18 years. AISRF is Australia’s largest fund dedicated to bilateral science collaboration.

Also Read | Drone movement spotted at international border in J-K’s RS Pura sectorKhattak’s case is emblematic of a series of documented enforced disappearances in Pakistan, where many human rights defenders are similarly silenced for their legitimate work of monitoring, documenting and advocating against a range of human rights violations and attacks against minorities.“We welcome the fact that proof of life was demonstrated recently when Mr. Khattak was granted his first contact with the outside world in a short, supervised visit from a family member,” the experts said.“However, additional steps must be taken without delay in order for Mr Khattak’s most fundamental rights to be restored, including his right to an independent medical assessment, his right to unrestricted access to a lawyer, his right to a trial in full compliance with due process and his right not to be detained arbitrarily.”“Unacknowledged detention exposes both the victims and their loved ones to severe and prolonged suffering that may well amount to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in clear violation of Pakistan’s obligations under international law,” the experts said.“All victims and their families have the right to justice, truth and reparations,” said a press release issued by the United Nations. Pakistani authorities have committed to actively engage with Special Procedures. In the case of Mr Khattak, experts have repeatedly raised their concerns directly with the Government and will continue to closely monitor the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-scourge-of-enforced-disappearances-torture-in-pakistan/story-rBpRhrp8nzpvI2LnyGyb1H.html
10-12-2020||World||Canada govt objected to military decision to cancel training with Chinese Army: Reports||The Trudeau government invited the Chinese army for training in Canada last year just months after the arbitrary arrests of two Canadians, including a former diplomat, and was miffed when the military cancelled the drill, media reports have said citing documents.The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) had been invited for joint training at the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) at Petawawa in the province of Ontario. The exercise was cancelled by Canadian Armed Forces to the chagrin of the government, according to the documents cited by the Globe and Mail, Rebel News and other media outlets.A department of defence official stated in a document, “The winter training will not take place this winter. Future options have not been considered.”Instructions from a general were that the department “tailor a message” that the training could not be conducted “at this time.”However, a note from the Trudeau government to the Armed Forces indicated its displeasure over the cancellation. “Given the heightened scrutiny, any decision by Canada to reduce-cut ties should be carefully considered to avoid sending any unhelpful or unintended messages,” it said.In a Memorandum for Action, Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, noted that the Canadian Armed Forces’ Chief of Defence Staff had “unilaterally elected not to proceed” with the 2019 programme.The cancellation came in the wake of the detention of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of the Chinese telecomm giant Huawei in Vancouver on December 1, 2018 in a case related to bank fraud to sidestep sanctions on Iran. Days later, two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested by China, where they just completed two years in captivity on December 10. Commenting on that, the Memorandum added, “While resolving the consular cases is the Government of Canada’s top priority, ensuring a certain amount of continuity in other parts of the Canada-China relationship remains important.”In another email, Ian Shugart, deputy minister at Global Affairs Canada said it be “consulted before any activities are cancelled/postponed, particularly initiatives previously agreed to between DND/CAF and the People’s Liberation Army.”He added that Canada did not want to be a “partner that is reducing normal bilateral interactions” and there was “still a desire to maintain an ongoing relationship with China, while recognising and managing the risks.” Shugart is currently Clerk to the Privy Council, Canada’s senior-most bureaucrat.A defence official pointed to the concern within the Five Eyes (the intelligence and security alliance including the US, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand) over the “winter survival” exercise with the PLA, while a Global Affairs official questioned, in an email, whether this was connected to the Donald Trump administration’s changed stance towards Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-govt-objected-to-military-decision-to-cancel-training-with-chinese-army-reports/story-Ls6WZNOE7q2bp9yqtjbB9L.html
10-12-2020||World||‘Under the rug’: Sexual misconduct shakes FBI’s senior ranks||An assistant FBI director retired after he was accused of drunkenly groping a female subordinate in a stairwell. Another senior FBI official left after he was found to have sexually harassed eight employees. Yet another high-ranking FBI agent retired after he was accused of blackmailing a young employee into sexual encounters.An Associated Press investigation has identified at least six sexual misconduct allegations involving senior FBI officials over the past five years, including two new claims brought this week by women who say they were sexually assaulted by ranking agents.Each of the accused FBI officials appears to have avoided discipline, the AP found, and several were quietly transferred or retired, keeping their full pensions and benefits even when probes substantiated the sexual misconduct claims against them.Beyond that, federal law enforcement officials are afforded anonymity even after the disciplinary process runs its course, allowing them to land on their feet in the private sector or even remain in law enforcement.“They’re sweeping it under the rug,” said a former FBI analyst who alleges in a new federal lawsuit that a supervisory special agent licked her face and groped her at a colleague’s farewell party in 2017. She ended up leaving the FBI and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.“As the premier law enforcement organization that the FBI holds itself out to be, it’s very disheartening when they allow people they know are criminals to retire and pursue careers in law enforcement-related fields,” said the woman, who asked to be identified in this story only by her first name, Becky.The AP’s count does not include the growing number of high-level FBI supervisors who have failed to report romantic relationships with subordinates in recent years — a pattern that has alarmed investigators with the Office of Inspector General and raised questions about bureau policy.The recurring sexual misconduct has drawn the attention of Congress and advocacy groups, which have called for whistleblower protections for rank-and-file FBI employees and for an outside entity to review the bureau’s disciplinary cases.“They need a #MeToo moment,” said U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who has been critical of the treatment of women in the male-dominated FBI.“It’s repugnant, and it underscores the fact that the FBI and many of our institutions are still good ol’-boy networks,” Speier said. “It doesn’t surprise me that, in terms of sexual assault and sexual harassment, they are still in the Dark Ages.”In a statement, the FBI said it “maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment” and that claims against supervisors have resulted in them being removed from their positions while cases are investigated and adjudicated.It added that severe cases can result in criminal charges and that the FBI’s internal disciplinary process assesses, among other factors, “the credibility of the allegations, the severity of the conduct, and the rank and position of the individuals involved.”The AP review of court records, Office of Inspector General reports and interviews with federal law enforcement officials identified at least six allegations against senior officials, including an assistant director and special agents in charge of entire field offices, that ranged from unwanted touching and sexual advances to coercion.None appears to have been disciplined, but another sexual misconduct allegation identified in the AP review of a rank-and-file agent resulted in him losing his security clearance.The FBI, with more than 35,000 employees, keeps a notoriously tight lid on such allegations. The last time the Office of Inspector General did an extensive probe of sexual misconduct within the FBI, it tallied 343 “offenses” from fiscal years 2009 to 2012, including three instances of “videotaping undressed women without consent.”The latest claims come months after a 17th woman joined a federal lawsuit alleging systemic sexual harassment at the FBI’s training academy in Quantico, Virginia. That class-action case claims male FBI instructors made “sexually charged” comments about women needing to “take their birth control to control their moods,” inviting women trainees over to their homes and openly disparaging them.In one of the new lawsuits filed Wednesday, a former FBI employee identified only as “Jane Doe” alleged a special agent in charge in 2016 retired without discipline and opened a law firm even after he “imprisoned, tortured, harassed, blackmailed, stalked and manipulated” her into having several “non-consensual sexual encounters,” including one in which he forced himself on her in a car. The AP is withholding the name and location of the accused special agent to protect the woman’s identity.“It is the policy and practice of the FBI and its OIG to allow senior executives accused of sexual assault to quietly retire with full benefits without prosecution,” the woman’s attorney, David J. Shaffer, alleges in the lawsuit.One such case involved Roger C. Stanton, who before his abrupt retirement served as assistant director of the Insider Threat Office, a division at Washington headquarters tasked with rooting out leakers and safeguarding national security information.According to an Inspector General’s report concluded this year and obtained by AP through a public records request, Stanton was accused of drunkenly driving a female subordinate home following an after-work happy hour. The woman told investigators that once inside a stairwell of her apartment building, Stanton wrapped his arm around her waist and “moved his hand down onto her bottom” before she was able to get away and hustle up the stairs.After Stanton left, he called the woman 15 times on her FBI phone and sent her what investigators described as “garbled text” complaining that he could not find his vehicle. The heavily redacted report does not say when the incident happened.Stanton disputed the woman’s account and told investigators he “did not intend to do anything” and only placed his arm around her because of the “narrowness” of the stairs. But Stanton acknowledged he was “very embarrassed by this event” and “assistant directors should not be putting themselves in these situations.”Stanton retired in late 2018 after the investigation determined he sexually harassed the woman and sought an improper relationship. He did not respond to requests for comment from AP.Earlier this year, the Inspector General found that the special agent in charge of the Albany, New York, office, James N. Hendricks, sexually harassed eight subordinates at the FBI.Hendricks also was not named in the OIG report despite its findings. He was first identified in September by the Albany Times Union. One current and one former colleague of Hendricks confirmed his role in the case to AP.Hendricks now writes a law enforcement blog in which he touts his FBI accolades but makes no mention of the misconduct allegations. He did not respond to requests for comment.Becky, the former analyst, told AP she once believed FBI’s “organizational values and mission aligned with how I was raised.” But she was disabused of that notion after reporting to management that Charles Dick, a supervisory special agent at the FBI Training Academy at the time, sexually assaulted her at a farewell party.Becky told AP her assailant had threatened her at least two times before. “Once while we were waiting for the director he said, ‘I’m going to touch your ass. You know it’s going to happen.’”“His boorish behavior was well known,” she added. “He was getting away with everything.”In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Becky accused the former agent of wrapping his arm around her chest while posing for a photograph and “reaching under her and simulating” penetration of her “with his fingers through her jeans.”Dick denied the charges and was acquitted in state court in Virginia by a judge who ruled it “wholly incredible” that Becky would “stand there and take it and not say anything,” according to a transcript of the proceeding. Dick retired from the FBI months before the Inspector General followed up on Becky’s internal complaint, Becky alleged in her lawsuit, adding she faced retaliation for coming forward.“It’s much easier to suffer in isolation than it is to go public,” she told AP. “But if I don’t report it, I’m complicit in the cultural and institutionalized cover-up of this sort of behavior.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-the-rug-sexual-misconduct-shakes-fbi-s-senior-ranks/story-fVyfHKdexG8dEpUGIIbdAI.html
10-12-2020||World||Senator Ted Cruz praises slain Sikh police officer Dhaliwal||Slain Sikh police officer Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, who was gunned down in the line of duty during a routine traffic stop in Houston a year ago, was a hero and a trailblazer whose commitment to his faith will inspire generations of Sikhs and other religious minorities to serve in law enforcement, a top US Senator has said.Senator Ted Cruz’s remarks came after the US Senate unanimously passed a legislation to name a post office in Houston after him.Cruz, the US Senator for Texas, said that Dhaliwal has left a profound legacy on the law enforcement community. “That is exactly who Deputy Dhaliwal was, a hero. He was deeply committed to his faith, his family, and to serving others with compassion,” Cruz said in his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “Moved by his Sikh faith, Deputy Dhaliwal was a trailblazer. When he was first recruited by the sheriff’s office, Deputy Dhaliwal petitioned the office to allow him to wear his turban and beard while in uniform, becoming the first to be allowed to do so,” he said. “Dhaliwal’s commitment to his faith will inspire generations of Sikhs and other religious minorities to serve in law enforcement and protect our communities,” he said.On September 27, 2019, Deputy Dhaliwal, 42, was killed in the line of duty in service of his community. In his remarks, Cruz also remembered Dhaliwal’s commitment to love and peace. “When Hurricane Harvey decimated the Texas Gulf Coast, Deputy Dhaliwal served meals to Houstonians who were left homeless. In the wake of Hurricane Maria, he travelled to Puerto Rico to assist in the relief efforts there. He also worked to deliver water and supplies to Punjab, India, while the area was suffering from a severe drought,” he said.“Dhaliwal leaves behind an unmistakably beautiful legacy of a life marked with faith, devotion, and service to others. I am grateful my colleagues have moved to rename the US Postal Office in Houston the ‘Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building,’ to ensure Deputy Dhaliwal’s selfless service and heroism is remembered,” Cruz said.The US House of Representatives and Senate have passed the bipartisan legislation to rename the post office at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston as ‘Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building.’ The bill is now headed to the White House for it to sign into law by outgoing President Donald Trump.The post office named after Dhaliwal in Houston is only the second US post office to be named after an Indian American. The first one was named after the first Indian American Congressman Dalip Singh Saund in Southern California in 2006.Born in India, Dhaliwal moved to Houston along with his parents. In 2015, Dhaliwal of the Harris County Sheriff’s office became the first Sikh American in Texas to receive a policy accommodation to serve while wearing his articles of faith, including his turban and beard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senator-ted-cruz-praises-slain-sikh-police-officer-dhaliwal/story-jPiNho2GSTEmYyYAqYXKfP.html

It took about an hour to put out the fire.South Korea’s forensic agency would investigate the car to identify the cause of the accident, police said.Tesla was not immediately available for comment.In January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate and recall 500,000 Tesla vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports.The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said.Tesla sold 11,601 cars in South Korea from January to November, sharply up from last year’s 2,430 sales, according to CarIsYou Data Research Institute.The US electric car maker is also under investigation by South Korea’s transport ministry over its autopilot functions, the ministry said earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-investigates-fatal-crash-of-tesla-model-x/story-bLA0V4C7MPBsexkHA9cNXI.html

10-12-2020||World||UK GDP growth slows to six-month low as Covid-19 hit hospitality||Britain’s economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases dealt a blow to the hospitality sector, official figures showed on Thursday.Gross domestic product rose 0.4% on the month after expanding 1.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said, the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown.Britain has Europe’s highest death toll from Covid-19, with more than 62,000 fatalities, and also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year.Output in October was 7.9% lower than it was in February, before the pandemic struck Britain’s economy, the ONS said, and 8.2% weaker than in October 2019.Government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-Covid size until the end of 2022 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted that Britain’s recovery would be weaker than anywhere bar Argentina.“The economy continued to grow in October, but at a snail’s pace. And with the Covid-19 restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, the economy is in for a difficult few months yet,” Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics said.Although the economy picked up rapidly after the initial shock of the lockdown, it lost momentum as Covid cases started to rise again in September and accelerated in October.Government restrictions on socialising in much of the United Kingdom, as well as greater caution from some of the public, led to a 14.4% fall in output across the accommodation and restaurant sector.Business surveys in October had already shown a slowdown in growth, and most economists think output fell outright in November, when the government imposed a four-week partial lockdown in England, which closed non-essential shops and most hospitality venues.However, the decline is expected to be much more limited than in the first lockdown, when restrictions were tighter and businesses had less time to adapt.The end of a post-Brexit transition period will also pose a challenge for many businesses from Jan. 1, when exporters will face new border checks for goods they want to sell in the EU, and potentially tariffs as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-six-month-low-as-covid-19-hit-hospitality/story-XBocorblZfUg19J2syLwEP.html
10-12-2020||World||China: Trump administration ‘digging hole’ for future relations||Beijing, Dec 10 (AP) Trump administration officials are “digging a hole” for the future US administration’s relationship with China through their actions targeting the country and its officials, China’s official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday.Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have “again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-US relations for their own political gain,” Xinhua said in an editorial.The US State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hardline stance adopted by the administration in its waning days.While President-elect Joe Biden has signaled he intends to keep pressure on China, he’s also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington’s stance toward Beijing.“By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-US relations on issues concerning China’s core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration’s relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,” Xinhua said.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and the South China Sea.Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the US market and the US has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.On Wednesday, Pompeo accused US universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was “poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.” Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying US accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office January 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.“Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” Xinhua said. “The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-US relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trump-administration-digging-hole-for-future-relations/story-f9EgWjugI5gyINGWc7HKCM.html

Israel is ready to make 60,000 vaccinations per day, and this is a huge figure, “Netanyahu said in a speech, broadcast by Israeli TV channels.The country’s health authorities will grant the so-called green passport for those inoculated to allow them to move freely, the prime minister added, noting that he plans to get vaccinated first.Earlier in the day, a plane carrying the first doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine aboard landed at the Ben Gurion airport. In mid-November, Netanyahu announced the signing of a contract with Pfizer to secure two-dose jabs for 4 million of its citizens.Apart from the contract with Pfizer, Israel also has deals with US biotechnology company Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers. In addition, the country launched clinical trials of its own vaccine in November. Phase 3 is scheduled for April-May.Earlier, Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Center, one of Israel’s most authoritative medical facilities, said it had ordered 1.5 million doses of Russian-made coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, with the deliveries pending the ministry’s approval. If the ministry refuses authorization, Hadassah plans to use the vaccine in its foreign branches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-start-mass-vaccination-against-covid-19-in-late-december/story-XdUDgzwLcn9Rvnlq4hqmEM.html
10-12-2020||World||Xi Jinping wants to make China the number one power abroad: Mike Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that President Xi Jinping wants total control at home and make China the number one power abroad, asserting that the top Chinese leader was also building up the military and manipulating international organisations as part of this plan.Pompeo made the comments on Wednesday during his virtual address to the Georgia Institute of Technology in a special speech.“General Secretary (of the ruling Communist Party of China) Xi Jinping has made clear his intentions. You only have to listen to what he says. He says he wants total control at home, and to make China the number one power abroad. And he’s well on his way to working on that project,” Pompeo said.“He’s building up the People’s Liberation Army. He’s manipulating international organisations for Beijing’s benefit. And he’s engaging – as we have seen in TV only just these last two days, he’s engaging in a vast influence campaign all across the world,” the top US diplomat said.Xi, 67, has amassed power the likes of which has not been since Chairman Mao Zedong. He is now President, General Secretary of the CPC and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. In 2018, China’s Parliament removed the two-term limit on presidency, allowing Xi to remain in power for life.“The Chinese communists used the wealth that was created by this to tighten their grip on power, their grip on power over the Chinese people, and to build a high-tech repressive state like the world has never seen,” he said.The US last week imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and individuals engaged in overseas influence operations, the latest punitive measures against China by the outgoing Trump administration.The restrictions are the latest measure taken against China’s leadership and economy in response to sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.Pompeo said that over the past year, he has talked to America’s governors in Washington about this, state legislators in Wisconsin, tech leaders in Silicon Valley, and many other groups.“And that may for some of you sitting at home today seem like a long way away and a very ambitious touch for Xi Jinping to make, but I must say he has his eye on each and every one of us,” he told the students of Georgia Tech in his virtual address.“Just think about it. Chinese Communist Party scientists aren’t pioneering cancer cures. We are. And it’s not North Korean biochemists that are producing safe Covid vaccines. We are. And Iranians aren’t ahead in supercomputing. No. In fact, we are. It is the free world and free peoples that produce these superior results. And we should be very proud of that fact,” he said.“But we have an obligation to protect it, to preserve it, to make sure that that’s the case 10 and 50 and 100 years from now,” he said.Pompeo said that the Chinese Communist Party knows it can never match American innovation.“It has state-owned enterprises; it’s an authoritarian regime; it is a government-centric focus. That’s why it sends 400,000 students a year to the United States of America to study – 400,000 students a year studying in our universities come from one country. It is no accident,” he said.“Much of the high-end industrial base inside of China is based on stolen technology, or technology purchased from other nations. It’s not home-grown. Beijing doesn’t want Chinese researchers to stay here in the United States. Indeed, after they’re trained, they want them to come back. They want to induce their return for the singular purpose of serving the Socialist Motherland,” he added.“Look, the Party’s propaganda apparatus cannot tolerate pesky Americans or Chinese nationals exposing its bankrupt system, or the fact that the Chinese people can actually flourish when they are in free societies. It doesn’t want you to know what I’m about to tell you,” he said.The Communist Party of China, he said, doesn’t just target Chinese nationals, they want to influence American students as well, professors and administrators too.“Look, they know that left-leaning college campuses are rife with anti-Americanism, and present easy targets for their anti-American messaging,” he said.“That’s why they planted Confucius Institutes on our campuses. And under President Trump, our State Department has made very clear these Confucius Institutes are literally up to no good. Many have gone away. Many campuses have seen that and they’ve chosen to close down these institutes. But right here in Georgia, Wesleyan College still has one in Macon,” he asserted.“Look, it’s why there are groups on campuses called Chinese Students and Scholars Associations here too. They’re directed and almost always funded by the Chinese Embassy or a local Chinese consulate. Its purpose: to keep tabs on students and to press pro-Beijing causes,” he said. Beijing has previously criticised Pompeo for his anti-China and anti-CPC remarks. “Pompeo’s continuous fabrication of political lies to smear and attack China exposed his deep-rooted ideological prejudices and his nature of a politician to seek personal gains, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-wants-to-make-china-the-number-one-power-abroad-mike-pompeo/story-xgBUe0lrpfE3lZ5MttEsyK.html
10-12-2020||World||Gates Foundation pledges additional $250 million to deliver coronavirus vaccines; total Covid funding at $1.75 billion||The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will commit an additional $250 million to strengthen global efforts to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This brings the foundation’s total funding to the Covid-19 response to $1.75 billion, with today’s $250 million representing the largest single pledge. This funding will support continued innovation to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines that are easier to scale up in different, including low-resource-settings. The commitment will also support the delivery of new Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The foundation also called for global commitments to making these innovations available in 2021 to everyone who needs them. “Everyone, everywhere deserves to benefit from the science developed in 2020,”said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation. “We are confident that the world will get better in 2021, but whether it gets better for everyone depends on the actions of the world’s leaders and their commitment to deliver tests, treatments, and vaccines to the people who need them, no matter where they live r how much money they have,” she said. It will enable countries to use cutting- edge technology and delivery systems to plan and implement the rollout of vaccines. It will also support efforts to engage communities in the process to increase trust and improve communication about new Covid-19 interventions. “Thanks to the ingenuity of the global scientific community, we are achieving the exciting medical breakthroughs needed to end the pandemic,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation. “We have new drugs and more potential vaccines than we could have expected at the start of the year. But these innovations will only save lives if they get out into the world.” To address the logistical challenge previously unmatched in scale and complexity, the world can draw on the expertise of global organisations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, which have collaborated with governments to deliver vaccines, tests, and treatments against infectious diseases to people in lower-income countries for 20 years. “The next phase of fighting this pandemic will be much costlier than the initial development of safe and effective vaccines. Our commitment today is only a fraction of what is needed and will be focused on the areas where philanthropy can best add value,” said Gates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gates-foundation-pledges-additional-250-million-to-deliver-coronavirus-vaccines-total-covid-funding-at-1-75-billion/story-j5XnA3nRP6w5aRexx21JnK.html

10-12-2020||World||Trump virus coordinator Deborah Birx seeks role in Biden government||When Dr. Deborah Birx was brought into President Donald Trump’s orbit to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, she had a sterling reputation as a former US Army physician, a globally recognized AIDS researcher and a rare Obama administration holdover.Less than 10 months later, as Trump’s time in office nears its end, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator’s reputation is frayed. And after serving every president since Ronald Reagan, her future in the incoming Joe Biden administration is uncertain.Over the course of the pandemic, Birx drew criticism from public health experts and Democratic lawmakers for not speaking out forcefully against the president when he contradicted advice from medical advisers and scientists about how to fight the virus.On everything from Trump’s aversion to masks to his dangerous suggestion that ingesting bleach might ward off the virus, critics and backers say Birx stepped carefully to try to maintain her influence in hopes of pushing the president to listen to the scientists.“The president’s departure from reality become so extreme that it put her and others on the task force in an untenable position,” said Michael Weinstein, who heads the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and got to know Birx professionally after she was named the global AIDS coordinator in 2014.“History will have to judge whether they enabled the president by giving him credibility based on their expertise or whether she and the others did more in helping prevent more people from being hurt by the craziness,” he said.Birx has made clear that she wants to stick around to help the Biden administration roll out vaccines and persuade the American people to be inoculated.She has reached out to Biden advisers in recent days as she tries to make the case for a role in the incoming president’s virus response effort, according to a person familiar with the Biden team’s personnel deliberations and a Trump administration coronavirus task force official. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.Birx has conveyed that, at best, she envisions herself in a scaled-back role as Biden shapes his own team. Biden has already appointed transition co-chair and Obama administration alumnus Jeffrey Zients to serve as White House coronavirus coordinator. But Birx’s reluctance to publicly challenge Trump when he downplayed the virus has left some in Biden’s transition skeptical that she retains credibility with the public, according to the person familiar with Biden transition deliberations.Speaking at a Wall Street Journal CEO conference on Tuesday, Birx, a public servant for 40 years, said she planned to remain in government but has yet to hear from the Biden transition team about how or if she’ll be used on the pandemic.Birx was pulled away from her ambassadorial post as the US global AIDS coordinator to assist the task force. She worked alongside her mentor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, who was less hesitant to directly contradict questionable statements by Trump. She was appointed to the AIDS post in 2014 by President Barack Obama, and it is up to Biden whether to return her to that position.“I think the one thing I bring to this is really understanding epidemics around the globe,” she said.The Biden transition team declined to comment. A White House task force spokesman said Birx was unavailable for comment.Birx certainly had fans in Biden’s orbit before and immediately after she was tapped to serve as coronavirus coordinator in the Trump White House.Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, called Birx “great.” Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who will serve as a special envoy on climate for Biden, described Birx at her 2014 swearing-in ceremony to serve as the US global AIDS coordinator as someone who “embodies the best of what it means to be a pioneer, to be a practitioner, and a public servant all rolled into one.”In her coronavirus task force role, Birx faced criticism for defending Trump after he suggested during an April briefing that ultraviolet light and ingesting disinfectants could serve as treatment for the virus. Birx explained that Trump “likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue.”Birx urged Trump to follow the data as he pushed to relax social distancing restrictions. She wasn’t above flattering the president. She faced criticism after she said in a television interview early in the crisis that Trump’s “ability to analyze and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.”Jeremy Konyndyk, now a member of the Biden transition’s Health and Human Services team, applauded Birx’s appointment early in the crisis. But Konyndyk, who led USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance in the Obama administration, soon became a critic.“My confidence in Dr. Birx has been eroding in recent weeks,” Konyndyk tweeted after Birx defended Trump’s decision in April to suspend funding for the World Health Organization. “But with this, it is lost. This statement is not credible as public health analysis, and is clearly not intended to be.”Weeks later, Konyndyk tweeted that Birx “has repeatedly undermined her scientific credibility, publicly, in order to shield the President.”By late summer, Birx’s stock in Trump’s eyes also diminished.Trump was irate with Birx for what he called a “pathetic” response to criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Democratic speaker said in early August that she had “no confidence” in Birx for not pushing back harder on the president as he repeatedly diminished the impact of the virus.Days later, Trump brought on as a pandemic adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution and a critic of virus-related restrictions on the economy. Birx’s public role at the White House was sharply reduced after that, and she spent recent months traveling the country urging states to be more aggressive in fighting the virus.In recent days, Birx has herself become more pointed in her criticism of Trump.Asked during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday about officials in the Trump administration repeatedly flouting public health experts’ pleas for Americans to avoid large gatherings and commit to wearing face masks, Birx voiced concern about leaders “parroting myths.”“And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong and you can see the evidence base,” Birx said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-virus-coordinator-deborah-birx-seeks-role-in-biden-government/story-f1KFYuHIV6a16NIDsBU5uJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US sets new grim record with over 3,000 Covid deaths in single day||The US has set a new grim record of more than 3,000 Covid -19 related deaths in a single day, reflecting a bleak reminder of the pandemic’s devastating toll, even as two coronavirus vaccine candidates appear to be on the verge of clearing the country’s final regulatory hurdles. According to The Covid Tracking Project, the US on Wednesday reported as many 3,054 reported deaths -- the highest single-day total to date. The previous single-day record was on May 7 at 2,769 deaths, it said.Overall, there were 1.8 million tests reported on Wednesday, 210,000 cases, and a record 106,688 Covid -19 patients in US hospitals, it said. The 7-day average for Covid -19 deaths are at an all-time high as deaths are rising throughout the country, it said.So far more than 15 million Americans have been infected with Covid -19 and 286,249 people have lost their lives, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US, the worst-affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, is in the final stages of approving at least two Covid -19 vaccines -- one by Pfizer and BioNTech and another by Moderna.The US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to give emergency use authorisation to the Pfizer vaccine.“Based on current production schedules, we expect to have enough doses to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of this year, 50 million total by the end of January, and at least 100 million total by the end of the first quarter,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters at a news conference.Within 24 hours of an emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the FDA, the vaccine could be shipped out to distribution sites across the United States to make it available to the Americans who need it the most, said Army Gen Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed.“Our goal is to make sure that we can ensure the vaccine is delivered in a timely manner, is to be delivered safely, securely, and it’s ready to be utilized to start administering the vaccine as soon as possible,” Perna said.On Tuesday, the FDA released an internal assessment of the Pfizer vaccine’s trial data. The FDA assessment showed that the vaccine was around 95 per cent effective, was efficacious across different groups, including the elderly and people with comorbidities, and did not show any significant safety concerns. Perna said that he had given permission to distribute syringes and needles, alcohol wipes and dilutant, which is required in support of the Pfizer vaccine. “We’ll begin that today. The distribution will be completed by Friday, again only to set conditions. And if it sits there for another week or 10 days or whatever, then it does. But planning for success, we wanted to make sure that the states had all that they needed to have,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-new-grim-record-with-over-3-000-covid-deaths-in-single-day/story-7xTcFVdgpNye7Vu6aiy9nO.html

From the global pandemic to the US elections, the Year in Search continues to recapitulate the top search trends.The list of top searches on Google included coronavirus, US election results and Indian Premier League (IPL) among others.Globally, ‘coronavirus’ was the top search, while IPL surpassed all other queries in 2020 and became the top trending query on Google in India. Searches on Kobe Bryant and Zoom also made to the list of top trending queries on Google.Meanwhile, coronavirus, election results, Iran, Beirut and Hantavirus were top trending news searches on Google.Other important news events that triggered heavy search activity included the unprecedented lockdown, Nirbhaya case, Beirut explosion, bushfires in Australia, and locust swarm attack.The most interesting search terms were centred around ‘How to’ and ‘What is’ lists. ‘How to make paneer?’ and ‘How to increase immunity?’ topped the list, followed by the distinctive ‘How to make dalgona coffee.’ ‘What is’ queries included the baffling ‘What is Binod?’, followed by many virus-related queries such as ‘What is plasma therapy?’ and ‘What is hantavirus?’.Google also created a recap video to highlight the ‘Year in Search 2020’ in audio-visual format. The three-minute video shows the uncertainty we had this year and how it made us curious about different things.It is important to note that Google provided its ‘Year in Search’ results on the basis of spikes it received in traffic for particular queries between January 1 and November 10. This means that the queries pointed out by the search giant aren’t the most searched or top search topics on the Google site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-year-in-search-2020-coronavirus-ipl-among-top-global-trends/story-5asAaH688UQTTln5n5Y3TP.html
10-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s top North Korea envoy urges Kim to return to talks||US President Donald Trump’s top North Korea envoy urged Kim Jong Un to return to talks, while expressing disappointment that negotiations since the two leaders first met didn’t achieve more.Deputy US Secretary of State Stephen Biegun made his appeal in a speech Thursday in Seoul that appeared intended to bolster the Trump administration’s legacy of unprecedented engagement with Pyongyang. Biegun expressed continued belief in the need for a “complete recasting of relations” between the two longtime enemies, while acknowledging it “has yet to deliver the success we hoped for.”“You might wonder if I am disappointed that we did not accomplish more over the past two years. I am,” Biegun told the Asan Institute research center. “Regrettably, much opportunity has been squandered by our North Korean counterparts over the past two years, who too often have devoted themselves to the search for obstacles to negotiations instead of seizing opportunities for engagement.”North Korea’s nuclear arsenal remains among the biggest foreign policy challenges awaiting US President-elect Joe Biden despite Trump’s decision to hold face-to-face summits with the North Korean leader. Despite Kim’s vague commitment in 2018 to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” he has continued to advance his nuclear weapons program.The two sides have made little progress since Trump walked out of his last summit with Kim in Hanoi in early 2019. Kim has since resumed launches of short-range ballistic missiles and in October paraded the world’s largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile through the streets of Pyongyang.North Korea has long demanded a step-by-step and synchronized denuclearization process where it gets compensated during the process of denuclearization. Washington had wanted a commitment to complete denuclearization before economic sweeteners.Biegun, who was making a four-day trip to Seoul before leaving office next month, urged Kim to return to talks.“We do not expect North Korea to do everything before we do anything, nor should North Korea expect such an outcome from us,” he said. “But, we must agree to lay out a road map for action, and we must agree on where that road map ultimately leads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-top-north-korea-envoy-urges-kim-to-return-to-talks/story-rvi4uKeoTOihiS8x3S728N.html
10-12-2020||World||Indian-American Pramila Jayapal elected as chair of powerful Congressional Progressive Caucus||Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has been elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers for the 117th Congress.Jayapal, 55, who was elected on Wednesday, said that the caucus is going to advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality and help transform the country.  “As a lifelong organiser, I am honoured that my colleagues have elected me to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus at this pivotal moment,” Jayapal said soon after her election to this most powerful Congressional Caucus, which is slated to play an influential role during the next Biden Administration.Joe Biden, 78, is due to take over as the 46th president of the US on January 20. “We have massive crises knocking at our nation’s door, and the work of the Progressive Caucus has never been more important. The American people need Congress to lead with vision, conviction, empathy, and dedication to people and families in every community who are struggling right now,” said Jayapal.The incoming Executive Board of CPC is made up of 26 members – one Chair, one Deputy Chair, one Whip, two Chair Emeriti, two Special Order Hour Conveners, ten Vice Chairs, one Executive Board Member At-Large and eight Deputy Whips.The CPC Executive Board is representative of the diversity within the caucus – more than half of Executive Board members are people of colour and more than half are women.Incoming CPC Deputy Chair Congresswoman Katie Porter said that in 2018, many of her Democratic colleagues and she successfully ran campaigns rooted in progressive values.“Rather than shying away from our core principles, we embraced them— making it clear that a progressive agenda is not only the right policy for America, but also a winning political message,” she said.CPC Whip Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said, “we have a unique opportunity to fight for transformative change in the 117th Congress— whether that is addressing the coronavirus pandemic, passing universal healthcare, tackling the climate crisis or reorienting our foreign policy.” “I look forward to continuing to represent my colleagues in building an effect progressive voting bloc in Congress alongside fearless leaders like Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Katie,” she said.Among others, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has been elected as Deputy Whip, while Congresswoman Rashida Talib as vice chair for member services.“We have massive crises knocking at our nation’s door and our work has never been more important. It’s time for Congress to act boldly and restore power to where it belongs: with the people,” Jayapal said in a tweet.“Together, our caucus is going to deliver real relief to families, advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality, champion climate justice, and help transform this country so working people can finally get ahead. Let’s get to work,” Jayapal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-pramila-jayapal-elected-as-chair-of-powerful-congressional-progressive-caucus/story-HnjS8K2gmd7LYzMqLhdMxL.html
10-12-2020||World||Biden’s son under investigation; Trump goes to Supreme Court on election||US president-elect’s son Hunter Biden, who had been a target of intense Republican attacks during the presidential election, said on Wednesday he was under federal investigation over his taxes.“I learned yesterday for the first time that the US attorney’s office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter Biden said in a statement released by the Biden-Harris transition team.“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,” he added.The Biden-Harris transition team said in an accompanying statement that President-elect Joe Biden “is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger”.No further details were made available by the transition team but news reports suggested the investigation had been underway for some time now but it had not been made public because of the elections, which were completed on November 3, under justice department rules.President Donald Trump and his Republican allies had used Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings to smear his father. They had alleged, without presenting verifiable evidence, he had landed lucrative deals in Ukraine in 2015, where he sat on the board of an energy company with a fancy compensation package, because of his father who was then vice-president. They had also accused the only surviving son of Biden (Beau Biden, the elder son died of brain cancer in 2015) of influence peddling in China. The evidence they had produced, as published by a New York tabloid, was dodgy and failed to make any headway outside of the Trump echo chamber.Hunter Biden’s admission to being investigated came amidst continuing efforts by President Donald Trump to overturn his election defeat, undeterred by a dismal run of court losses.Trump on Wednesday requested the US Supreme Court to allow him to intervene as a party in his capacity as a candidate for re-election in a lawsuit filed by Texas’s Republican attorney general seeking the rejection of the election outcomes in Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, the four battleground states that were instrumental in consigning Trump to history as a one-term president.Texas AG Ken Paxton argued in his partisan lawsuit that election rules that were changed by these four states to make it easier for people to vote in view of the Covid-19 pandemic were unconstitutional. The suit, which makes a post-facto argument that is doomed to fail, has been joined by 17 other states; all of them were filed by Republicans officials.Trump has made a flurry of fraudulent and baseless claims of election irregularities to challenge his defeat, which was not even close. He lost the popular vote by more than 7 million and the Electoral College by 232-306, the same tally that he had won in 2016 and had called a landslide. All 50 states and DC had certified their results by Tuesday deadline, and their 538 electors will vote on Monday — separately in their states — to elect Biden.Trump’s intervention in the Texas case was announced by his campaign in a statement from his new attorney, John Eastman, who had earlier suggested falsely, reprising a racist conspiracy theory, that Indian-descent Kamala Harris was not qualified for the vice-presidency and the presidency because she was born to immigrants who had not become naturalised citizens at the time of her birth. “I think his intervention in this case strengthens an already very strong original action by the state of Texas,” Eastman said.The Supreme Court summarily and unanimously dismissed a lawsuit by a Republican ally of Tromp to block the certification of election results in in the battleground state earlier in the week. Legal experts contended the Texas lawsuit with Trump and 17 other states on its coattails was headed for the same dustbin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-son-under-investigation-trump-goes-to-supreme-court-on-election/story-fw70xmuVWNwEXMh6w4j7CM.html

The announcement was made at Florida’s Kennedy Space Centre, beneath one of only three remaining Saturn V moon rockets from the 1960s and 1970s Apollo programme.My fellow Americans, I give you the heroes of the future who will carry us back to the moon and beyond, the Artemis generation, Pence told the small crowd, seated several feet apart from one another.Five of the astronauts the only ones in attendance walked onto the stage, waving and wearing masks.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stressed there would be more astronauts joining the group. NASA has 47 active astronauts.The space agency is aiming for a moon landing by 2024, although the chances of that happening are growing increasingly dim. The upcoming change in administration also adds uncertainty.Half of the NASA astronauts have spaceflight experience. Two are at the International Space Station right now: Kate Rubins and Victor Glover.The two astronauts who performed the world’s first all-female spacewalk last year made the cut: Christina Koch and Jessica Meir.It’s a fairly young group, with most in their 30s or 40s. The oldest is 55, the youngest 32. Only two Joe Acaba and Stephanie Wilson flew on NASA’s old space shuttles.The other experienced members on the list include Kjell Lindgren, Anne McClain and Scott Tingle, both former space station residents.Among those yet to rocket into space: Kayla Barron, Raja Chari, Matthew Dominick, Woody Hoburg, Jonny Kim, Nicole Mann, Jasmin Moghbeli, Frank Rubio and Jessica Watkins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-picks-18-astronauts-including-the-first-ever-woman-to-set-foot-on-moon/story-nhWpwyCi2lK0yjMVswBsgM.html
10-12-2020||World||China slaps more taxes on Australian wine amid tension||China’s government on Thursday slapped more taxes on wine from Australia, stepping up pressure in a bitter diplomatic conflict over the coronavirus, territorial disputes and other irritants.China, Australia’s biggest export market, already has blocked imports of its wine, barley, beef and other goods since the Australian government expressed support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic that began in China last December.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said an investigation begun in August concluded Australia improperly subsidizes wine exports, hurting Chinese producers. The ministry said importers will be required to pay a deposit of 6.3% to 6.4%, effective Friday, pending a final ruling.Also Read |  Australia scrambles to find customers outside Chinese for its cottonThat is on top of taxes of more than 200% imposed earlier on Australian wine, which the country’s trade minister said would make it unsellable in China.China’s foreign ministry has demanded Australia take unspecified steps to repair relations.Beijing increasingly uses access to its populous market as leverage to extract concessions from its neighbors and increase its strategic influence.Chinese leaders were irked by Australia’s decision to pursue a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which Beijing sees as a strategic rival, and to join Asian governments and the United States in objecting to China’s claims to most of the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest trade routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-more-taxes-on-australian-wine-amid-tension/story-fXJOv3AICezOBq64vTkPUJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Australia scrambles to find customers outside Chinese for its cotton||Australia is seeking to boost demand for its cotton from countries such as Vietnam as tensions with China threaten to leave Canberra with large stockpiles, sources familiar with the plan said on Thursday.In October, Chinese cotton mills were ordered to stop buying Australian cotton, threatening a trade worth about A$900 million ($672.30 million) amid escalating tensions between the two countries.Australian producers didn’t immediately feel the impact, however, as their country had little stocks to sell after a sustained drought led to record low production.But since then, rains soaked Australia’s east coast, and the country’s growers are on course to produce 506,000 tones of cotton - the highest since 2018 - leaving exporters scrambling to find alternative markets.“China typically takes 60% of Australian exports. We are working to boost buying from Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries,” said a source familiar with the plan, speaking anonymously because he is not authorised to speak to the media.Australia will begin harvesting its 2020/21 crop in April, giving exporters several months to line up new customers.Australia’s relationship with China soured in 2018 when it became the first country to ban China’s Huawei from its 5G network, and worsened this year when Australia called for an enquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.As ties deteriorated, China imposed tariffs on Australian barley and slowed its imports of Australian beef and coal.China will also temporarily impose anti-subsidy fees on some Australian wine imports starting Dec. 11, ramping up pressure on the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-scrambles-to-find-customers-outside-chinese-for-its-cotton/story-3hWF5UsO8JRr5dRQewZFcL.html

The illustration was done by Manchester-based artist Camilla Ru.On this today 41 years ago, Lewis was jointly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work to model the economic forces that impact developing countries.Although Lewis faced racial discrimination, in 1932, he won a government scholarship and set out to study at the London School of Economics, where he eventually earned a doctorate in industrial economics.He was the first Black faculty member at the London School of Economics, first Black person to hold a chair in a British university, and the first Black instructor to receive full professorship at Princeton University.He was born on January 23, 1915, in the Caribbean island of St Lucia. His parents, both school teachers, were immigrants from Antigua. He complete his school curriculum at the age of 14 and went to work as a clerk in the civil service. In 1932, he won a government scholarship and went on to study at the London School of Economics. Despite facing racial discrimination, at the age of 33, he became a full professor - one of the highest distinctions of a tenured professor.Lewis contributed immensely to the United Nations and shared his expertise as an adviser to governments in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. He also helped establish and served as the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank.In honour of his lifelong achievements, the British government knighted Lewis in 1963.Besides commemorating important events and festivals, Google also celebrates renowned personalities every now and then whose contribution to the field of science, history and various other fields are significant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-celebrates-nobel-prize-winning-economist-sir-w-arthur-lewis-with-a-doodle/story-vdm5vEA0dQni2gTwNKqeOP.html
10-12-2020||World||Trump administration set to execute 1st of 5 inmates before Biden inauguration||The Trump administration is planning an unprecedented five more federal executions before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, starting with a Texas street-gang member set to be put to death Thursday for his role in the 1999 slayings of an Iowa religious couple whose bodies he burned in the trunk of their car.Brandon Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas. He would be the ninth federal inmate put to death since July, when President Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.If Bernard, now 40, receives a lethal injection as planned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, it would be a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when the crime occurred.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was during the presidency of Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking, subservient member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial. Bernard, they say, has repeatedly expressed remorse.“I can’t imagine how they feel about losing their family,” Bernard said about surviving Bagley relatives in a 2016 video statement from death row. “I wish that we could all go back and change it.” He also described taking part in youth outreach programs and embracing religion, saying, “I have tried to be a better person since that day.”The case has prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is among those who have asked Trump to stop the execution, saying in a series of recent tweets that Bernard’s “role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved.”The Justice Department refused to delay Thursday’s execution of Bernard, another inmate on Friday and three more in January, even after eight officials who participated in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus. The eight federal executions in 2020 already is more than in the previous 56 years combined.One of Bernard’s co-defendants, Christopher Vialva, was executed in September. Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, released a statement after that execution, saying, “I believe when someone deliberately takes the life of another, they suffer the consequences for their actions.”Prosecutors said Vialva, the oldest of the teens at 19, was the ringleader who shot the Bagleys, as they lay in the trunk before Bernard set the car on fire.The teenagers, three of whom were under 18, approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men, which critics said seemed calculated to make them less controversial amid summer protests over racial discrimination. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.The federal prosecutor who now wants a life term for Bernard, Angel Moore, says recent research shows people tend to view Blacks as more to blame than their white counterparts when the facts surrounding a crime are the same, and that young Black men are less likely to be given benefits of the doubt by jurors because of their immaturity.“I always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation’s honor,” Moore, who is now in private practice in San Antonio, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Indianapolis Star.One juror whose 2016 written statement was included in the White House petition said he still believes Bernard is responsible for “horrible decisions that had horrendous outcomes.”“However, his young age at the time does weigh on me,” he wrote. “I do not believe that Brandon should be executed for bad choices he made when he was 18.”A statement from Bernard’s 16-year-old daughter is also included in which she describes her father as constantly warning her to stay away from the wrong crowds and how a single bad decision can ruin your life.She added: “I am hoping and asking the President to spare my dad’s life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-set-to-execute-1st-of-5-inmates-before-biden-inauguration/story-lQwiKZTTCySDxGn8vYkE9O.html
10-12-2020||World||UN chief says will take Covid-19 vaccine publicly, calls it his ‘moral obligation’||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that he intends to take the Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available and he will do so publicly, asserting that vaccination for him is a “moral obligation” towards the whole community.“Of course, I intend to receive the vaccine when it becomes available for me in whatever the situation that will be justified for that. And, obviously, I will have no doubt in doing it publicly,” Guterres said on Wednesday.The 71-year-old UN chief was responding to a question during a press briefing at the UN Headquarters on whether he would publicly take the Covid-19 vaccine when it’s available to him.“I encourage everybody that has access to the vaccine to be vaccinated, because it is a service, not only that we provide to ourselves. Each one of us being vaccinated provides a service to the whole community because we are no longer spreading... there is no risk of spreading the disease. So, vaccination is for me a moral obligation in relation to all of us,” he said.His remarks came during the hybrid press conference with Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat following the Fourth UN-AU Annual Conference.Guterres reiterated his call for a Covid-19 vaccine to be a global public good available to everywhere and particularly, available in Africa.“Most African countries lack the financing to adequately respond to the crisis, due in part to declining demand and prices of their commodity exports,” he said.In response to a question that while floodgates to Covid-19 vaccines are opening in rich countries, Africa might not begin to see vaccines until the second quarter of 2021, he said: “It’s true we are seeing vaccine nationalism moving with full speed.” He added that if Africa is not properly supported, “we will not be able to fight the pandemic anywhere effectively.He said the only way to ensure that the vaccines reach Africa timely is to make sure that the COVAX initiative is financed and gets the USD 4.2 [billion] it needs in the next two months “to make sure that vaccines approved by the World Health Organization can be distributed in Africa sooner rather than later.” COVAX is a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved.Guterres said there is an “enormous effort” by several countries to ensure vaccines for their own populations.“But COVAX is working hard. There are several vaccines in the pipeline for COVAX, and it is perfectly possible to deliver if the financing is guaranteed,” he said.The UK, Bahrain and Canada have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine within the past week.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorise the use of the vaccine as early as this weekend after its own study concluded the two-dose vaccine provided benefits even after just the first injection—cutting the risk of getting Covid-19 by about half.The Pfizer-BioNTech was found to be 95 per cent effective after the second dose. The European Medicines Agency has said a decision on either the Pfizer-BioNTech shot or Moderna Inc.’s vaccine could come by the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-will-take-covid-19-vaccine-publicly-calls-it-his-moral-obligation/story-7pLoQFAGn1gmgC6CwqBRQO.html

10-12-2020||World||‘Stack and Stack’: a South Korean student’s attempt to recycle in Covid times||Bothered by the waste caused by disposable face masks, many of which are made of polypropylene, the South Korean furniture design student has come up with an eco-friendly solution, melting them to make stools he calls “Stack and Stack”. “Plastic is recyclable, so why don’t we recycle face masks, which are made of plastic?” the 23-year-old said.In June, Kim set up a mask collection box at his school, the Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang city, south of Seoul. He has since gathered 10,000 used masks, and has received more than a tonne of defective ones from a factory as well. To lessen the risk of coronavirus transmission, Kim keeps them in storage for at least four days. Then, removing elastic bands and wires, he wields a heat gun over the masks in a mould, melting them down at temperatures over 300 degrees Celsius (570 degrees Fahrenheit).The result? Three-legged stools 45cm (18 inches) recycled from white, pink, blue and black masks, which Kim displayed in his graduation exhibition. Next, Kim hopes to make other furniture pieces from the recycled masks such as a chair, table or some lights. He is also urging the government and private companies to recycle face masks by setting up a separate box for their collection.In September alone, South Korea produced more than a billion face masks for domestic use, government data showed.Though the stools are not yet for sale, fellow students were impressed by the idea and rough-surfaced design.“It has such a strong message,” said art student Park Sung-chan, 20. “This will remind us what we’ve been through in 2020 with the coronavirus and is also environmentally friendly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stack-and-stack-a-south-korean-student-s-attempt-to-recycle-in-covid-times/story-V635oyUYgz5fKuUOTwcE1K.html

10-12-2020||World||Second wave of coronavirus hits South Africa as cases surge||South Africa has declared a second wave of coronavirus as the number of cases surged with the per day infections exceeding 6,000.The deadly virus has so far infected 828,598 people and claimed 22,574 lives in South Africa.“We are now experiencing a second wave,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday.A total of 6,709 new cases were reported overnight. The virus also claimed 135 lives in the last 24 hours.Daily cases peaked at around 15,000 in July.The current positivity rate is 18 per cent, Mkhize said.The second wave is being driven by Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, he said.A seven-day moving average graph shows that the increases in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng are exponential, the minister said.“This means that we should expect faster rising numbers with a higher peak than in the first wave,” he said.Mkhize expressed concern that in the last two days the peak of infections was among young people aged between 15 and 19.“This is believed to be due to large number of parties involving young people drinking alcohol with no adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing of masks, social distancing and hand and surface sanitising. This inevitably leads to super spreader events which spill over into the rest of the country as this age group is highly mobile and the majority of the carriers are asymptomatic,” he said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The sixth edition echoes similar instructions in previous, less lengthy versions.The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the recommendation applies for charter flights to and from countries and regions where infections exceed 500 in every one million people.The diaper advice is in a section on personal protective equipment, which also recommends the following for cabin crew:Flight crew should wear masks and goggles, but they don’t need diapers.Other advice for the flights includes dividing the cabin into “clean area, buffer zone, passenger sitting area and quarantine area,” separated by disposable curtains. The last three rows should be designated as an emergency quarantine area, CAAC said.China’s aviation market was hit hard at the onset of the outbreak in Wuhan and subsequent spread around the country. But it has recovered -- on the domestic front at least -- to close to pre-pandemic levels, while other regions such as Europe and the U.S. struggle to bring Covid-19 under control.Airlines have insisted that it is safe to fly during the pandemic, partly thanks to the hospital-grade air filters on planes, but some researchers say it isn’t yet clear to conclude there’s minimal risk. Some cases have documented transmission on flights when passengers wore masks and sat far apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-cabin-crew-to-wear-disposable-diapers-on-high-risk-covid-19-destinations/story-PDtbhegBiWjvlW69CK5q6I.html
10-12-2020||World||Win, lose or settle: Facebook lawsuits will take years to resolve||Facebook, faced with two major antitrust lawsuits, could be forced to breakup, settle with changes to its business, or it could prove its government challengers wrong and win in court, antitrust experts said.The Federal Trade Commission and a major coalition of states are asking that Facebook be forced to sell WhatsApp and Instagram, saying it used a “buy or bury” strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.If the government wins, the judge could rule Facebook must divest its photo sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp.“At first blush, it’s a very strong case on the merits. The remedy is tough, because breakup is an unusual remedy, but it certainly may be merited here,” said Sam Weinstein, who teaches at Cardozo Law.While a “breakup remedy” is rare, Weinstein said, “this is a case where it’s possible, I’d say, and maybe even likely.” He noted the Facebook case contained damning evidence from the company’s own documents, unlike the Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google.Although breakup is not common, even on a small scale, in 2014 the Justice Department sued BazaarVoice after it bought PowerReviews and forced the deal between the consumer review sites to be undone. Most famously it forced the breakup of the telephone company ATT in 1982.President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration, which did not respond to a request for comment, would also likely support the lawsuit. FTC commissioners voted 3-2 to file its lawsuit with two of the three votes in favor coming from Democrats.One difficulty the FTC will face is that it cleared Facebook’s purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 -- a point Facebook made in its response to the lawsuits. “It’s very difficult to unwind a consummated merger that’s been in place for years,” said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. “A court would be very reluctant to unwind the merger.”Further, Bloom said the argument in the complaint that Facebook required software developers on its platform to refrain from competing with Facebook was potentially outdated and certainly easy to resolve. The complaint said: “Specifically, between 2011 and 2018, Facebook made Facebook Platform, including certain commercially significant APIs, available to developers only on the condition that their apps neither competed with Facebook ... nor promoted competitors.”In a blog post, Facebook argued that the restrictions were standard in the industry.“Companies are allowed to choose their business partners, and it gives platforms comfort that they can open access to other developers without that access being exploited unfairly,” wrote Facebook General Counsel Jennifer Newstead.Facebook also believes it can prevail in court. Newstead said the company continues “to operate in a highly competitive space.“We look forward to our day in court, when we’re confident the evidence will show that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp belong together, competing on the merits with great products,” she said. With no criminal charges in the lawsuit there is no incentive for Facebook to cut a deal, argues George Hay, who teaches antitrust at Cornell University law school. He also predicted the case would take years of litigation.“It’s not an obvious winner,” he said of the government’s arguments. “Everything that Facebook does is out in the open and it’s been out in the open for 15 years. They’ve never done anything without consulting with teams of antitrust lawyers.”Still, Facebook agreed last year to pay $5 billion to resolve an FTC investigation into its privacy practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/win-lose-or-settle-facebook-lawsuits-will-take-years-to-resolve/story-xgHbOFGz1PSh5TzVOFGr6L.html

To wait for the end of the trial would be the middle of next year,” Hill said in remarks released by NBC. “That’s too late to take the value of this vaccine, which is effective, available at large scale and easily deployed.”Dr. Larry Corey, a top U.S. scientist overseeing Covid-19 vaccine trials, last week said the large U.S. AstraZeneca study may determine how effective the vaccine is, after perplexing results from other trials by the company and partner Oxford.Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the U.S. Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, said last week that U.S. trial data and potentially a request for U.S. emergency use authorization by AstraZeneca could come in late January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-not-wait-too-long-on-astrazeneca-vaccine-oxford-s-hill-says/story-Hvtx2O3fIM9LSerWQXEigI.html

10-12-2020||World||Senate falls short of halting Trump’s 23 billion dollar arms sales to UAE||The Senate fell short in trying to halt the Trump administration’s proposed $23 billion arms sales to the United Arab Emirates, despite bipartisan objections to the package of F-35 fighter jets and drones stemming from a broader Middle East peace agreement. Senators on Wednesday argued the sale of the defence equipment, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally authorised last month after the Abraham Accords normalising relations with Israel, was unfolding too quickly and with too many questions. The administration has billed it as a way to deter Iran, but UAE would become the first Arab nation — and only the second country in the Middle East, after Israel — to possess the stealth warplanes. “Can a lasting peace be purchased with more weapons?” said Sen. Rand Paul in a speech ahead of the vote. Congress has shown a willingness to confront Trump in one main area — on defence policy. But on Wednesday the effort to turn back the arms sales failed to reach the 51-vote majority needed for passage. Trump was expected to veto the two resolutions anyway. The showdown over the sale, alongside sweeping bipartisan support for the annual defence bill despite Trump’s threats to veto it, is potentially a final power play between the executive and legislative branch in the final weeks of Trump’s presidency. The Senate will take up the broader defence bill soon. On Wednesday, senators narrowly rejected one resolution to disapprove of the F-35 sales, 47-49, and the other over the sale of armed drones, 46-50, in procedural votes largely along party lines. That’s far short of the two-thirds majority that would have been needed to overcome a potential presidential veto. Action is halted for now, though the House, where Democrats have control, would likely be able to pass them easily. Sen. Chris Murphy said the UAE’s track record in war-torn Yemen and Libya and its “complicated” relationships with China and Russia raise more questions than answers. “I’m not here to say that we shouldn’t be in the security business with UAE,” said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But, he said, “without resolving those issues, is this the moment to be selling for the first time ever F-35s, armed drones into the heart of the Middle East?” The arms sale emerged after the US brokered the Abraham Accords to normalise relations between the UAE, Bahrain and Israel. In notifying Congress last month, Pompeo said the authorisation of the sale was in recognition of the “deepening relationship” with the UAE and its need to deter threats from Iran. Pompeo said the “historic agreement” reached with the Abraham Accords offered a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to transform the region’s “strategic landscape.” The sale, worth up to $23.37 billion, includes dozens of F-35s, advanced armed drone systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said a list of questions senators sent to Pompeo and then-Defence Secretary Mark Esper about the arrangement remains unanswered. A classified briefing for senators did not appear to adequately answer their questions. “We must assert our congressional prerogative,” Menendez said. Voting “sends a message to the executive branch.” Israeli officials have previously expressed some concern about an F-35 sale. But in October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm Israel’s consent. Even after Wednesday’s setback, Congress is poised to approve the sweeping annual defence bill despite Trump’s objections. Trump has warned he would veto the bill over a provision to study stripping the names of Confederate leaders from US military bases. He also wants lawmakers to include an unrelated provision to clamp down on the big technology companies over what Republicans, and some Democrats, say is unfair treatment on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. But lawmakers say the tech provision doesn’t belong in the defence policy bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-falls-short-of-halting-trump-s-23-billion-dollar-arms-sales-to-uae/story-du54dkLS0gWeuiY4V6IlqN.html

The US Attorney’s Office declined to comment, and Hunter Biden’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.During the campaign, Trump and Republicans questioned potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president to Democratic President Barack Obama.Trump was impeached by the Democratic majority US House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate in February on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.Trump called during the campaign for China to investigate involvement of Biden’s son in a fund that sought to raise Chinese capital. Trump accused Hunter Biden of using his position of influence to secure China’s financial backing for his investments.Trump never provided evidence to support this claim, and Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Joe Biden won the November 3 election. Trump has filed numerous lawsuits to overturn the results; none have succeeded.A source familiar with the newly revealed investigation, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters “this is not related to the attacks the Trump team and their allies made against Hunter during the campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-says-us-prosecutor-investigating-his-taxes/story-nH5ffwJdNhBVW5ROrjtu9J.html
10-12-2020||World||Mike Pompeo accuses US universities of ‘China ties’||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused US universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. The attack, which included identifying two university administrators by name, comes as the Trump administration seeks to cement its anti-China policies before leaving office in January.Pompeo took aim at universities across the US, claiming they refused to address the Trump administration’s concerns about China’s attempts to influence students and academics. He specifically called out the president of MIT, alleging he refused to host Pompeo’s speech, and a senior official at the University of Washington over a case involving a Chinese student.Both universities swiftly and emphatically denied the charges.Pompeo defended the Trump administration’s tough stance on China in remarks at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The speech came less than a month before Georgia’s two critical run-off races that will determine control of the Senate.“Americans must know how the CCP is poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends, and how those actions degrade our freedoms and our national security. If we don’t educate ourselves, we’ll get schooled by Beijing,” he said. “They know that left-leaning college campuses are rife with anti-Americanism, and present easy target audiences for their anti-American messaging.”Pompeo has been a champion of the administration’s hardline stance on Chinese policies in Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, the western region of Xinjiang and the South China Sea, and he has made similar pronouncements before. He has imposed multiple layers of sanctions on Chinese officials; restricted visas for Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics; and lobbied other countries to reject Chinese high-tech communications.But his comments on Wednesday were striking in that he named the two American university officials as complicit in alleged Chinese malfeasance.Pompeo said he had initially wanted to give his Georgia Tech speech at MIT, but the president of the renowned scientific institution, Rafael Reif, had turned him down for fear of offending Beijing.“MIT wasn’t interested in having me give this speech on their campus,” Pompeo said. “President Rafael Reif implied that my arguments might insult their ethnic Chinese students and professors.”MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen rejected Pompeo’s assertion, saying the university declined to host the speech because of coronavirus restrictions. She said several other prospective high-level events had also been rejected.Reif “had real concerns that a high-level visit might not only draw crowds but suggest to students that MIT was not taking its own rules seriously,” she said. “President Reif verbally conveyed MIT’s decision — based on a commitment to the health of our students and our surrounding community — with his deep regrets.”Pompeo also criticized Sarah Castro, the University of Washington’s director of federal relations, for allegedly refusing to help Vera Zhou, a student of Chinese origin who had been detained in China in 2017, so as not to jeopardize a “multimillion-dollar deal” between the university and Beijing.“Now, thank God, Vera was eventually released, and returned to the US,” Pompeo said of the student. “But no thanks to the University of Washington, and no thanks to its deal with China.”A statement from university spokesman Victor Balta called Pompeo’s remarks a “shameful” and “outrageous” deflection by an administration that took “no effective action” on behalf of Zhou.“That the Secretary of State would think a university has more power in this situation than the United States government is bizarre,” he said. “That he would single out a staff member by name is unbecoming of the office and his statement is flatly wrong.”The university has no record of contact from the State Department regarding any negotiation with China, Balta said, and officials don’t know what “multimillion-dollar deal” Pompeo was referencing. He added that, as of this quarter, Zhou is again enrolled at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-accuses-us-universities-of-china-ties/story-dIIzkv0HTLVS2C7svol9FM.html
10-12-2020||World||UN chief warns `vaccine nationalism’ is moving at full speed||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that “vaccine nationalism” is moving “at full speed,” leaving poor people around the globe watching preparations for inoculations against the coronavirus in some rich nations and wondering if and when they will be vaccinated.The UN chief reiterated his call for vaccines to be treated as “a global public good,” available to everyone, everywhere on the planet, especially in Africa. And he appealed for $4.2 billion in the next two months for the World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people.After a virtual UN meeting with the African Union, Guterres said at news conference that financing COVAX is the only way to guarantee vaccines will be available in Africa and other developing areas.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a high-level UN General Assembly meeting last week on Covid-19 that “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter” to end the pandemic. But, he added, vaccines “must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.”Tedros said WHO’s cash-strapped ACT-Accelerator program to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly, which includes the COVAX project, “is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture” without major new funding. COVAX will require an additional $23.9 billion for 2021, he said, stressing that the $28 billion total is less than one-half of 1 percent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries..The United Kingdom and Russia have already started vaccinating people against the coronavirus. In the United States, the Pfizer vaccine could get a green light for emergency use in the coming days and the Moderna vaccine in the coming weeks. Canada announced approval of the Pfizer vaccine Wednesday,Guterres said Africa’s 54 nations have registered more than 2.2 million cases of coronavirus infections and over 53,000 deaths from Covid-19.“There is real hope that vaccines — in combination with other public health measures — will help to overcome the pandemic,” he said.But to end it, he added, vaccines must be available to all and “most African countries lack the financing to adequately respond to the crisis, due in part to declining demand and prices of their commodity exports.”The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said in late November that vaccinations against the coronavirus on the continent might not start until the second quarter of next year. “I have seen how Africa is neglected when drugs are available” in the past, he told reporters.Guterres said Wednesday when asked about Nkengasong’s assessment: “It is my hope that we’ll be able to do it before the second quarter, but it is true that what we’re seeing today is an enormous effort by several countries in order to ensure vaccines for their own populations.”“It’s true we are seeing vaccination nationalism moving at full speed,” the UN chief said.“If Africa is not properly supported, we will not be able to fight the pandemic,” he said. “There are several vaccines in the pipeline for COVAX, and it is perfectly possible to deliver if the financing is guaranteed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-warns-vaccine-nationalism-is-moving-at-full-speed/story-ZSsoH99xNuycfvsiLTwoQK.html
10-12-2020||World||Japan’s bird flu outbreak worsens, government orders disinfection of poultry farms||Japan’s bird flu outbreak worsened with two more prefectures reporting poultry deaths and exclusion orders in place on Thursday as the government ordered the disinfection of all poultry farms in the country.Highly pathogenic bird flu, most likely brought by migrating birds from the Asian/European continent, has spread to 8 of Japan’s 47 prefectures.While officials say that it is not possible to catch avian influenza from the eggs or meat of infected chickens, they are concerned about the virus making the “species jump” to humans and causing a pandemic like the coronavirus one raging now.The virus was confirmed at an egg-laying farm in Kinokawa city in Wakayama prefecture near Kyoto, Japan’s agriculture ministry said on its website.Three broiler farms in Oita prefecture on Kyushu island also reported outbreaks, the ministry said.Japan’s worst outbreak since at least 2016 started last month in Kagawa prefecture on Shikoku island, which is close to Kyushu.The government on Wednesday called for the disinfection of poultry farms across Japan to contain the outbreak, national broadcaster NHK said.“The need for vigilance is stronger than in usual years,” chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato was quoted by NHK as saying after meeting with other government officials.More than 130,000 chickens at the farms in Oita and Wakayama will be slaughtered and buried, while exports in a 3km (1.8 mile) radius around the farm will be restricted.The latest cullings mean more than 2 million chickens will have been slaughtered since the latest outbreak began. Japan had a broiler chicken population amounting to 138 million head last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-bird-flu-outbreak-worsens-government-orders-disinfection-of-poultry-farms/story-fPp6Y7j2J25ncsMSeMRgWJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Britain considers toughening tax rules on ‘sharing economy’||The United Kingdom is considering tougher tax rules for the so-called sharing economy to lift revenue and ensure a “level playing field” for all businesses, a government paper showed.In a consultation document published on Wednesday, the UK Treasury said the growth of the sharing economy “could potentially create certain challenges to the VAT (value-added tax) base,” and raised concerns that the current state of affairs might hand unfair advantages to the sharing economy over traditional businesses.“The government considers that the Sharing Economy not only creates challenges for VAT but impacts upon a range of different taxes,” the consultation said.When self-employed contractors carry out services booked on platforms like Uber and Airbnb, they often individually fall below the 85,000 pounds ($113,755.50) VAT registration threshold.The Treasury’s consultation document highlighted examples of the business practices it wanted to look into for action where no VAT was being charged “where it might have been (charged) in the traditional economy.”The Treasury said its review was designed to “test the government’s view of the VAT challenges the sharing economy creates.”The International Monetary Fund told Britain late in October to keep up its Covid-19 spending and plan for tax hikes.Carbon taxes, VAT and property taxes were all areas where Britain could boost revenue without hurting growth. IMF staff had said tax increases would be almost inevitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-considers-toughening-tax-rules-on-sharing-economy/story-LZHWrGsiCrXk26P6g9SyWJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US awaits vaccine approval as daily national deaths top 3,000||The United States on Wednesday crossed an ominous new threshold of 3,000 lives lost to Covid-19 in a single day while public health officials stepped up preparations for a vaccine campaign of historic scope ahead of imminent regulatory approval.Steady movement toward a vaccine rollout on the eve of a critical review by leading U.S. medical experts comes as Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations surged alarmingly higher, straining healthcare systems in some pandemic hot spots to the breaking point.Ten mostly rural counties scattered across California reported having no intensive care unit beds available on Wednesday, according to state health data analyzed by Reuters.In the agricultural heartland of the California’s Central Valley, Covid-19 admissions have overwhelmed some individual hospitals altogether. In Fresno County, home to 1 million people, only seven ICU beds remained unfilled on Wednesday.The number of Covid patients hospitalized nationwide grew to a new all-time high of 105,805 by late Wednesday, up 18% over the previous two weeks.The United States also has documented an average of 2,259 deaths and 205,661 new infections each day over the past week, a toll that U.S. health officials warn is likely to accelerate in the coming months before a vaccine becomes widely available to the public.At least 3,112 U.S. patients perished on Wednesday alone, according to a Reuters tally of state-by-state data, surpassing the previous Dec. 3 record of 2,861 deaths and marking the first time the virus has claimed 3,000 American lives or more in a single day.To date, the highly contagious respiratory illness has killed more than 289,000 Americans, out some 15 million known to have been infected since January.Medical experts have said the crisis will only worsen in the weeks ahead amid colder weather, especially if Americans continue to disregard warnings to avoid unnecessary travel and large gatherings over the holidays. Besides the monumental human cost, the pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, forcing millions out of work as public health authorities imposed sweeping restrictions on social and economic life in an effort to tamp down the contagion.Congress, meanwhile, struggled to end a months-long political stalemate over an economic assistance.The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on a one-week stopgap funding bill to buy more time to reach a deal on a larger relief package, as a bipartisan group released details of their proposal.U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that lawmakers were still “looking for a way forward” on Covid-19 aid, then took to the Senate floor to blast Democratic leaders for rebuffing two Republican offers earlier this week.VACCINES ON THE WAYOffering a new glimmer of hope, some officials said vaccinations could begin as soon as this weekend, and states have escalated plans for what is likely to be distribution effort of unprecedented dimensions.“I can’t think of a government operation that has been commenced that is more difficult and intricate than what governments will be asked to do here,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing on Wednesday.A panel of independent medical experts was due meet on Thursday to decide whether to recommend that a vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. should receive emergency use authorization of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.In a sign that approval could come swiftly, documents released by the FDA on Tuesday in preparation for the advisory review raised no new red flags over the safety or efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine.FDA approval could come as early as Friday or Saturday, followed by the first U.S. injections on Sunday or Monday, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, told Fox News on Tuesday.Britain became the first Western nation to begin mass inoculations with the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday. Canada on Wednesday approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after an accelerated review process.The United States is in dire need of a new mechanism for fighting the pandemic, given that so many Americans have refused to follow guidance for wearing face coverings and keeping their distance for people beyond their own households.Experts and officials expect yet another surge of infections and hospitalizations following year-end holiday gatherings.The World Health Organization director for the Americas, Carissa Etienne, said on Wednesday that jumps in weekly Covid-19 cases in the United States and Canada were particularly worrisome as winter approaches. The expected post-holiday surge would be in full force by the time President-elect Joe Biden succeeds President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.Even though Trump has refused to concede defeat in his bid for a second term, and is attempting to overturn the Nov. 3 election, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar vowed on CNN to ensure a “full, cooperative, professional transition” on pandemic matters. Azar also told “CBS This Morning” he expected inoculations to be reaching the general public in February, March and April, with enough vaccine supply “for all Americans” during the second quarter of next year. Still, a sizable percentage of the U.S. population has expressed skepticism about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, creating an additional challenge.Biden set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people - nearly a third of the U.S. population, within the first 100 days of his administration, or by April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-awaits-vaccine-approval-as-daily-national-deaths-top-3-000/story-3Xd94jMkozK4LvSUR0y4SP.html
10-12-2020||World||UK medicine regulator says people with anaphylaxis risk should not take Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine||Britain’s medicine regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, giving fuller guidance on an earlier allergy warning about the shot.Starting with the elderly and frontline workers, Britain began mass vaccinating its population on Tuesday, part of a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there had been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. “Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,” MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.“Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 outweigh the risks... You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.”Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body’s immune system, which the National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.The fuller guidance, clarifying that the main risk was from anaphylaxis specifically, was issued after consulting experts on allergies. The MHRA had initially advised anyone with a history of a “significant allergic reaction” not to take the shot.Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA’s investigation.Last week, Britain’s MHRA became the first in the world to approve the vaccine, developed by Germany’s BioNTech and Pfizer, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) continue to assess the data. A top U.S. official said on Wednesday that Americans with known severe allergic reactions may not be candidates for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine until more was understood about what had happened. Canada’s health ministry said it would look at the reported adverse reactions in Britain, but said adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot, after the country approved the vaccine. ALLERGIC REACTIONMHRA chief Raine told lawmakers such allergic reactions had not been a feature of the Pfizer’s clinical trials.Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate’s ingredients were excluded from their late stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA’s emergency approval protocol.However, the allergic reactions may have been caused by a component of Pfizer’s vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines.Imperial College London’s Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology, who has been advising the MHRA on their revised guidance, told Reuters: “As we’ve had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true.”“The ingredients like PEG which we think might be responsible for the reactions are not related to things which can cause food allergy. Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,” Turner told Reuters.The EMA said in an email that all quality, safety and efficacy data would be taken into account in assessing the vaccine, including data generated outside the EU.In the United States, the FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for an advisory committee meeting on Thursday, saying the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization.The briefing documents said 0.63% of people in the vaccine group and 0.51% in the placebo group reported possible allergic reactions in trials, which Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said was a very small number.“The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well,” he said. However, Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that the MHRA and NHS had overreacted initially.“I would not have broadened to the degree they did,” he said.“It’s reasonable to let the world know about this, and to be aware of it in terms of people who have had reactions like this to vaccines. I think to say medicines, foods or any other allergies is past the boundary of science.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-medicine-regulator-says-people-with-anaphylaxis-risk-should-not-take-pfizer-biontech-vaccine/story-RCWg3joZWG4Yf2hD9jX8AO.html
10-12-2020||World||Mike Pence announces pool of US astronauts for planned moon mission||Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday announced 18 astronauts chosen for possible participation in planned NASA missions to return to the moon’s surface during the final U.S. space policy meeting before he and President Donald Trump leave office next month.At a meeting of the White House’s National Space Council at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Pence unveiled the pool of nine women and nine men who could go to the moon under NASA’s Artemis program, intended to put people back on the lunar surface for the first time since the 1970s. All of the astronauts to reach the moon thus far have been men. The mission’s target date is 2024, though that is expected to slip.Pence said the chosen astronauts “will carry us back to the moon and beyond.” The Artemis is planned as a steppingstone to the more-ambitious goal of placing astronauts on Mars.“This is the first cadre of our Artemis astronauts,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.“I want to be clear, there’s gonna be more,” Bridenstine added.The 2024 goal, viewed by some in the U.S. space agency and American space industry as unrealistic, is expected to be pushed back after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Before the meeting of the space council, Pence toured Patrick Air Force Base and formally renamed it Patrick Space Force Base. It is named after the space service branch of the U.S. military created under Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-announces-pool-of-us-astronauts-for-planned-moon-mission/story-pE1WlBaBEfdzl1ufwuDnOK.html
10-12-2020||World||Pfizer says some vaccine documents accessed in EMA hack||Pfizer Inc. said some documents it had submitted to Europe’s top drug regulator regarding its Covid-19 vaccine had been accessed in a cyber-attack on the agency.The US drugmaker and German partner BioNTech SE said in a statement they had been told by the European Medicines Agency that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for their experimental vaccine that had been stored on the EMA server had been unlawfully accessed.The companies said that none of their systems had been breached in connection with the incident and that they are “unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed.”Pfizer and BioNTech said the EMA informed them that the attack would have no effect on the timing of the vaccine review. Regulators are already evaluating clinical trial data on a rolling basis, and a clearance is expected toward the end of the year.Pfizer shares closed on Wednesday down 1.7% to $41.85 in New York.The EMA issued a brief statement Wednesday saying that it had been attacked and had “swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities.” It declined further comment.Moderna Inc., another U.S.-based pharmaceutical company with a comparable Covid-19 vaccine in development, said it hadn’t received any notification from the European regulator about a data breach.“We are engaged with them and monitoring the situation,” a company spokesperson said. “Moderna remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats.”Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-dose vaccine regimens rely on a new technology known as messenger RNA. Moderna is slightly behind Pfizer in the race to bring forth an authorized Covid-19 vaccine. The biotechnology company has approached the EMA for a conditional marketing authorization and is also under a rolling review. A clearance could be issued within weeks, according to the EMA.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the American drug regulator, declined to say whether it had been targeted recently by hackers. “Information security and the protection of industry and public health information are among FDA’s highest priorities,” according to Stephanie Caccomo, media relations director. “The agency is always enhancing its cybersecurity strategies to ensure FDA information security systems provide adequate protection of industry data and public health information on a continual, long-term basis.”Since the pandemic began, hackers aligned with governments including Russia and China have been accused of targeting companies and research institutions working on Covid-19 research. Cybersecurity researchers at International Business Machines Corp., for instance, recently disclosed that unknown hackers, probably tied to a nation-state, were targeting companies and government agencies involved in vaccine distribution.The hackers pretended they were from one of the world’s largest cold-chain providers, who offer the type of refrigeration necessary for certain vaccines. It wasn’t clear if the victims fell for the scam. But if they did, the credentials they stole could help an attacker “gain insight into internal communications, as well as the process, methods and plans to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine,” IBM Security said in a statement.In addition, in November, Microsoft Corp. said hackers in Russia and North Korea had targeted seven “prominent” companies working on vaccines and treatment research. Microsoft, which didn’t identify the companies, said the majority of the attacks were blocked.In July, the UK, US and Canadian governments accused Russian intelligence of attempting to steal private information from researchers racing to develop a vaccine. And in May, the U.S. government warned that hackers working for the Chinese government were trying to steal research on vaccines and treatments from U.S. health care, pharmaceutical and research organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-some-vaccine-documents-accessed-in-ema-hack/story-1aXZCg1KIVW0vq0zUwRVtJ.html

America’s preeminent infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, and its incoming vice president, Kamala Harris, join the Renaissance master himself, Leonardo da Vinci, atop this year’s list of most mispronounced words, as complied by the US Captioning Company, which captions and subtitles real-time events on TV and in courtrooms. The list released on Wednesday identifies the words that proved most challenging for newsreaders and people on television to pronounce this year. The caption company said it surveyed its members to generate the list, which is now in its fifth year and was commissioned by Babbel, a language-learning app company with headquarters in Berlin and New York. Todd Ehresmann, a senior linguist at Babbel, said the list, unsurprisingly, reflects a year dominated by presidential politics and the coronavirus pandemic. “All of these have added some new phrases to our national vocabulary, which may take some practice,” he said. Here’s how Ehresmann broke down the proper pronunciations for the commonly misspoken words: Anthony Fauci (AN-thon-nee FOW-chee): Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Bangtan Sonyeondan (PUNG-tahn SOH-nyun-dahn): The full name of South Korean K-Pop band ‘BTS’, which translates as “a group of bulletproof boys” or “bulletproof boy scouts.” Giannis Antetokounmpo (YON-nis AHN-de-doh-KOON-boh): Greek basketball player who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks and was named the NBA’s ‘Most Valuable Player’ this year. Isias ( ees-ah-EE-ahs ): The name given to a powerful hurricane that caused significant damage to the East Coast and Caribbean this summer. Kamala Harris (CAW-ma-la HAIR-iss): The Vice President-Elect. Leonardo da Vinci (lee-oh-NAR-doe dah-VIN-chee): The Italian painter, architect, and engineer who created the ‘Mona Lisa.’ A mispronunciation of his name was the subject of a viral meme on social media this year. Mahamayavi Bhagavan Antle (mu-HAH-muh-yaw-vee bag-AH-wahn ANT-uhl): The full name of wildlife park operator ‘Doc’ Antle, who shot to fame in the Netflix documentary series ‘Tiger King.’ Nevada ( nev-ADD-ah ): Homestate of Las Vegas that played a central role in the presidential election. X Æ A-Xii (EX-aye-eye): The name given by business magnate Elon Musk and musician Grimes to their first child born in May. The pronunciation is according to Grimes. Yosemite (YOH-sem-it-ee): The famous national park in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, it was notably mispronounced by President Trump in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-kamala-among-famous-names-on-mispronounced-words-list/story-r1tYQcGrJ5Zzh6K86AqNzM.html
10-12-2020||World||90% in poor nations may not get a vaccine in 2021||Nine out of 10 people in dozens of poor nations could miss out on getting vaccinated against COVID-19 next year because rich countries have hoarded far more doses than they need, campaigners said on Wednesday.Rich nations home to 14% of the global population had bought 53% of the total stock of the most-promising vaccines as of last month, said the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition including Oxfam, Amnesty International and Global Justice Now.They said pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organisation (WHO) so more doses can be manufactured.“This shouldn’t be a battle between countries to secure enough doses,” Mohga Kamal-Yanni, an advisor for People’s Vaccine Alliance, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“During these unprecedented times of a global pandemic, people’s lives and livelihoods should be put before pharmaceutical company profit,” she added.While high-risk groups in Britain received on Tuesday the first shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, most people in 67 low- and lower middle-income countries including Bhutan, Ethiopia and Haiti, risk being left behind, they said.Among the three COVID-19 vaccines for which efficacy results have been announced, almost all the available doses of two of them - Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech - have been acquired by rich countries, the Alliance report said.While AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have pledged to provide 64% of their doses to people in developing nations, that would only reach 18% of the world’s population by next year “at most”, it added.The campaigners used data from science information and analytics company Airfinity to analyse the deals done between countries and eight leading vaccine candidates, including China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V.The EU, United States, Britain, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, New Zealand, Israel and Kuwait have acquired 53% of these potential doses - with Canada buying enough to vaccinate its population five times over, Oxfam said.“By buying up the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply, rich countries are in breach of their human rights obligations,” Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/90-in-poor-nations-may-not-get-a-vaccine-in-2021/story-fIlfvyOXleS16w3JnKYYvN.html
10-12-2020||World||Facebook faces lawsuit for ‘predatory’ conduct from US govt, 48 states||The US government and 48 states and districts sued Facebook Wednesday, accusing it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors and seeking remedies that could include a forced spinoff of the social network’s Instagram and WhatsApp messaging services.The landmark antitrust lawsuits, announced by the Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General Letitia James, mark the second major government offensive this year against seemingly untouchable tech behemoths. The Justice Department sued Google in October for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to buttress competition since its historic case against Microsoft two decades ago. Amazon and Apple also have been under investigation in Congress and by federal authorities for alleged anticompetitive conduct.James noted at a press conference that “it’s really critically important that we block this predatory acquisition of companies and that we restore confidence to the market.”The FTC said Facebook has engaged in a “a systematic strategy” to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals like Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. James echoed that in her press conference, saying Facebook “used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users.”The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 for privacy violations and instituted new oversight and restrictions on its business. The fine was the largest the agency has ever levied on a tech company, although it had no visible impact on Facebook’s business.Facebook called the government actions “revisionist history” that punishes successful businesses and noted that the FTC cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions years ago. “The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,” Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said in a statement that echoed the company’s response to a recent congressional antitrust probe.Facebook is the world’s biggest social network with 2.7 billion users and a company with a market value of nearly $800 billion whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the world’s fifth-richest individual and the most public face of Big Tech swagger.James alleged Facebook had a practice of opening its site to third-party app developers, then abruptly cutting off developers that it saw as a threat. The lawsuit — which includes 46 states, Guam and the District of Columbia — accuses Facebook of anti-competitive conduct and using its market dominance to harvest consumer data and reap a fortune in advertising revenues.North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who was on the executive committee of attorneys general conducting the investigation, said the litigation has the potential to alter the communications landscape the way the breakup of AT&T’s local phone service monopoly in the early 1980s did.“Our hope is to restructure the social networking marketplace in the United States, and right now there’s one player,” Stein said in a news release. James said the coalition worked collaboratively with the FTC but noted the attorneys general conducted their investigation separately.Antitrust expert Rebecca Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, said it is “hard to win any antitrust lawsuit and this one is not any different.” But as far as antitrust cases go, she added, the government has a strong one.The Justice Department’s suit against Google, announced just two weeks before Election Day, brought accusations of political motivation from some quarters. It was filed by a cabinet agency headed by an attorney general seen as a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has often publicly criticized Google.The FTC, by contrast, is an independent regulatory agency whose five commissioners currently include three Republicans and two Democrats.President-elect Joe Biden has said the breakup of Big Tech giants should be seriously considered. He has singled out Facebook’s Zuckerberg for scorn, calling him “a real problem.”Instagram and WhatsApp are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years. But they are the ones most frequently held up by Facebook critics as properties that should be split off.Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, bolstering the social network’s business a month before its stock went public. At the time, the photo-sharing app had about 30 million users and wasn’t producing any revenue. A few years later, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging service, for $19 billion.Zuckerberg vowed both companies would be run independently, but over the years the services have become increasingly integrated. Users are now able to link accounts and share content across the platforms. Instagram now has more than 1 billion users worldwide. Such integration could make it more difficult to break off the companies.NetChoice, a Washington trade association that includes Facebook as a member, quickly panned the lawsuits. The case for antitrust enforcement against Facebook “has never been weaker,” NetChoice vice president Carl Szabo said in a statement, pointing to newer social services such as TikTok and Snapchat as rivals that could “overtake” older platforms.“These lawsuits mark an important turning point in the battle to rein in Big Tech monopolies and to reinvigorate antitrust enforcement,” said Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-faces-lawsuit-for-predatory-conduct-from-us-govt-48-states/story-rAcKZuHdQxWYcchvadUv8N.html
10-12-2020||World||EU medicine regulator assessing Covid-19 vaccines affected by cyberattack||Two pharmaceutical companies in line for first conditional approval for their Covid-19 vaccine by the EU’s medicine regulator said Wednesday their documents were “unlawfully accessed” during a cyberattack on a European Medicines Agency server.Pfizer and BioNTech said documents relating to its vaccine candidate had been accessed but that “no systems have been breached in connection with this incident.”“We are unaware of any personal data being accessed,” Pfizer said in a statement, while BioNTech added “we are unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed.”“The EMA has assured us that the cyberattack will have no impact on the timeline for its review,” they added.Swift investigationEU’s medicines regulator earlier Wednesday said it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.The Amsterdam-based EMA said the incident was being investigated, but did not specify when it took place or whether its work on Covid-19 was targeted.“EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,” the EMA said in a brief statement.An EMA spokeswoman later told AFP “the EMA is fully functional and all work continues”.The Dutch national police high-tech crime team was involved in the probe into the cyberattack, but police gave no more information, the Dutch news agency ANP reported.The EMA’s role as the drugs regulator for the 27-nation EU means it has access to data on the safety and quality of medicines from clinical trials and lab tests from companies that apply for authorisation.The agency has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest, while a ruling on Moderna’s version should follow by January 12.It is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.News of the cyberattack came the day before the EMA’s chief Emer Cooke was due to brief the European Parliament about the process for approving coronavirus vaccines.The EMA -- which moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019 -- is also due to hold a special online public meeting to discuss Covid-19.Series of warningsThere have been a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.In July Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research. Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.Spanish laboratories have reportedly been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September. Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and “malign actors” after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said. It is also not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicine-regulator-assessing-covid-19-vaccines-affected-by-cyberattack/story-zcinfLIFaY6BF11jM23zzJ.html

10-12-2020||India||Following India protests closely, says UK after Boris Johnson gaffe||The UK Foreign Office is closely following the protests by farmers in India, a government spokesperson said on Thursday as it clarified that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had “clearly misheard” a question in Parliament when he responded with Britain’s stance on the India-Pakistan dispute instead. The gaffe occurred during the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) session in the House of Commons on Wednesday, when Johnson reiterated that any dispute between India and Pakistan was for the two countries to settle bilaterally in response to a question by Opposition Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi about conveying British Sikh “anxieties” over the ongoing protests against agricultural reforms in India. A UK government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister clearly misheard the question in Parliament. The Foreign Office are following the issue of protests in India closely”. Dhesi, who has been very vocal on the protests by farmers against India’s agricultural reforms, had raised the issue of the footage of “water cannons, teargas and brute force” being used against the peaceful protesters. “So, will the Prime Minister (Johnson) convey to the Indian Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) our heartfelt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock and does he agree that everyone has a fundamental right to peaceful protest,” he questioned Johnson. The British Prime Minister, in his brief response, seemed to be addressing the Kashmir dispute instead. “Our view is that of course we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle and I know that he appreciates that point,” said Johnson. A perplexed Dhesi took to social media immediately to brand Johnson as “absolutely clueless” and was joined by scores of fellow Labour politicians and others in expressing shock at the gaffe. “The incompetence from this government continues. The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has failed to brief the PM on one of the largest protests the world has seen,” said fellow British Sikh Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill. “It would seem our Prime Minister (and former Foreign Secretary) doesn’t know the difference between Punjab and Kashmir. Why are we not surprised,” added Emily Thornberry, Labour MP and former shadow foreign secretary. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has refused to be drawn into British politicians’ representations seeking UK government intervention in the matter, stating that “the police handling of protests are a matter for the government of India”. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/following-india-protests-closely-says-uk-after-boris-johnson-gaffe/story-FgwMDRntRLOVcT6t8TLJKN.html
10-12-2020||India||Odisha job scam gets bigger, investigators suspect 100 youths were cheated||The Tata Motors job scam which led to the arrest of former BJD MLA Pradeep Panigrahy seems to be getting bigger with the Odisha CID estimating that at least 100 youths in Ganjam district were defrauded of anything between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for a job at the company.Last week, the CID had arrested former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy on several criminal charges including defrauding jobless youths of lakhs of rupees by promising them with jobs at Tata Motors. A week before that, vigilance officials had got the wind of the massive job scam after they arrested Abhay Pathak, a 1987-batch Indian Forest Service officer and his son Akash Pathak, a 25-year-old mechanical engineering graduate from a private engineering college in Bhubaneswar on charges of amassing disproportionate assets. Further interrogations of the Pathak duo by the vigilance officials brought out the extent of the job scam that the junior Pathak had hatched allegedly with Panigrahy.CID sleuths who are investigating the Tata Motors job scam said the junior Pathak spun a web of lies from posing as managing director of Tata Motors ‘passenger division’ to handing out fake joining letters to the youths for the posts of graduate engineer trainees as well as management trainees in the Tata Motors to creating fake LinkedIn profile of himself.His name made it to the police files after Tata Motors lodged a complaint with state CID in May this year about Akash posing as the company’s MD. Tata Motors followed up with another complaint in September. However, there was little action on that till the disproportionate asset case of his father blew up last month.“He may have been a mediocre engineering graduate. But the kind of fraud he has perpetrated upon the youths is unbelievable. While we have seen people posing as IAS or IPS officers, this is the first time we have seen an engineering graduate posing as MD of a BSE-listed company like Tata Motors. From our preliminary assessment, we have found that at least 100 youths paid anything between Rs 5 and 10 lakh for a job in Tata Motors. He is nothing short of Mr Natwarlal,” said a senior CID officer who is probing the case.Officials said with the help of Panigrahy as well as his disgraced father, Akash Pathak started offices of “Tata Motors” in Mumbai, Pune as well as one from his father’s official quarters in Bhubaneswar. Apart from floating advertisements on job portals for recruitment in Tata Motors passengers division, he conducted interviews of candidates online. He even appointed a personal assistant to help him out in airline bookings and answering his mails. He had also hired bouncers from Mumbai.David Peter, who worked as his personal assistant from November 2019, revealed how a person in Ganjam used to coordinate the recruitment till Pathak himself took interviews through Zoom app during the Covid pandemic. “Before the pandemic, he used to make a list of job aspirants and call them up for a meeting at the office. The candidates who were selected for the post of management trainees were promised annual CTC of Rs 11 lakh while the graduate engineering trainees Rs 6 lakh. For a moment I never doubted that he was not MD of Tata Motors as he used to fly to Delhi, Mumbai and Pune and stay in the swankiest hotels of the country,” Peter told his CID during questioning.During the lockdown when regular commercial flights were not allowed, Pathak along with his father Abhay Pathak as well as his prospective father-in-law Panigrahy took 14 chartered flights to various cities in the country. He also stayed in star hotels at least 15 times this year with room rents going beyond Rs 2.3 lakh per day. Posing as Tata Motors MD, he even donated Rs 5 lakh to the Chief Minister’s relief fund.The Bhubaneswar police have lodged a case against the Pathak father-son duo for not paying Rs 65 lakh to a city-based travel agency that booked their chartered flights, five star hotels and air tickets. The agency had billed them Rs 2.78 crore, but has so far been paid Rs 2.13 crore. When the agency asked them for the rest of the money, they were threatened.Vigilance officials who investigated the disproportionate assets of Abhay Pathak, said around Rs 17 crore was transacted through his son’s account over the past year and at one instance cash of Rs 1 crore was deposited through ATM. Investigators who are still tying up the loose ends of the case say that Panigrahy’s money as well as the senior Pathak’s money was being deposited in Akash Pathak’s account.While his can of worms are spilling out, officials said Pathak is still adamant over his claim being Tata Motors MD. “He is still claiming that he is Tata Motors MD and can prove it. He was just an engineering graduate who could not have even managed to become a senior engineer in Tata Motors in 2 years time. We may have to do his psycho-analysis,” said an official. The father and son duo who were arrested on November 27, continue to be in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-job-scam-gets-bigger-investigators-suspect-100-youths-were-cheated/story-hPCesKiLIMaBiry3YCR2fL.html

The move comes two days after the Bombay High Court criticised authorities at Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail for refusing to hand over a pair of spectacles to the activist.“Bhima-Koregaon case accused Gautam Navlakha denied spectacles by jail authorities as they refused to accept a parcel sent by his family. I have ordered an inquiry in this matter. I believe this situation should have been handled humanely and such incidents need to be avoided in future,” Deshmukh said.“If the family has sent his spectacles, he should be given those. We need to handle these things more sensitively,” the minister added.The 70-year-old activist is facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has alleged that till August 2018, he was a member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), a banned outfit. He is currently lodged at the Taloja jail.Navlakha’s partner Sahba Hussain had alleged that the activist’s spectacles were stolen inside jail and that prison authorities did not permit a new pair sent by his family.Taking cognisance of the matter, the bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik on Tuesday said, “We gather from news reports that Navlakha has lost his spectacles in jail and when his family sent him a new pair, the jail authorities refused to accept them.”“Can this (spectacles) be denied,” the bench asked. “These are human considerations.

Badal also hit out at the central government for allegedly trying to project the protesting farmers as “anti-national” and demanded that the Centre repeal the new farm laws. “Farmers want these laws should be repealed. If farmers do not want these laws, why are you forcing upon them?” he asked. “This policy of forcing upon like earlier they (Centre) forced upon demonetization and GST (goods and services tax), and now they want whatever decision they make while sitting in offices should be implemented forcibly,” Badal told the media on Thursday evening. “This is a democratic country. If farmers do not want it (laws). You have seen all the farmers’ organizations have joined hands. Bharat Bandh was observed. Farmers do not want these laws and then why they are keeping it (laws). I do not understand it,” the SAD chief said. He alleged that it has become the attitude of the government to “confront and suppress” the voice. “You cannot suppress (voice) in a democracy. They are our countrymen,” he said. “It is bad that the Centre is trying to project farmers as anti-national. If you are saying they are anti-national then why did you hold meetings with them. Because now your meeting has failed, you termed them anti-national,” he alleged. “It has been an attempt of the central government that whosoever does not agree with it, be it a political party or a section of people, they try to project them as anti-national. These farmers are not anti-national,” he said. Badal condemned the union government for not acceding to farmers’ demand of repealing the new agri legislations. “The farmers do not want the black laws framed by Modi sahib (Prime Minister Narendra Modi). Democracy means that it is the duty of the government that it should not implement those things which the public do not want,” he said. Farmers were being shown as “extremists” and “Khalistanis”, said Badal, adding that they were also being shown having been associated with a particular religion. “Do not repeat Congress’ blunders of divide and rule. Do nothing that weakens national unity or disturbs peace and communal harmony for which Punjabis, specially the SAD, have made supreme sacrifices,” said a resolution of the party’s core committee that met here. Harcharan Bains, principal advisor to Badal, said the SAD will observe the centenary of the party as “Sangharsh Samarpan Divas”, with focus on farmers’ interests and justice for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-trying-to-thrust-black-laws-like-it-imposed-demonetization-gst-sukhbir-badal/story-ZAbIhDkhR0atAeffCg2jWN.html
10-12-2020||India||Nine newborns die in Kota hospital in 2 days, probe ordered||Nine newborn babies have died at the Rajasthan government’s JK Lon Hospital in Kota in two days – five on Wednesday night and four on Thursday – prompting the hospital to order a probe into the deaths. Rajasthan’s health minister Raghu Sharma has also sought a report from the Principal of the Medical College Kota (MCK) into the death of the babies.Sharma gave strict instructions to the hospital administration for proper care of the newborns and warned of strict action for negligence.JK Lon Hospital superintendent Dr SC Dulara said most of the deceased newborns, aged between 1 and 5 days, either had congenital disorders or ailments. “Out of the nine deceased newborns, two were referred from Kapren in Bundi district with septic shock and three were brought dead to the paediatric unit. Three newborns had congenital ailments -- one had oligohydramnios with renal anomaly, one had placenta praevia and the other had anencephaly. One newborn was suffering from intrauterine growth restrictions (IUGR) with refractory hypoglycemia,” he said. “The head of the pediatric department will conduct a probe into the deaths.” Dr Dulara said more than 30 deliveries take place every day at JK Lon Hospital and on an average there are 2 to 3 newborn deaths daily. “However, nine deaths of newborns in 24 hours cannot be termed normal,” he said. “Newborns are referred to JK Lon Hospital not only from four districts of Kota division but also from neighboring districts and even from Madhya Pradesh. A total of 1,700 newborns had died at JK Lon Hospital in 2019, which was the lowest in its previous five years. Current year’s data is being compiled,” he said.The parents of the deceased newborns alleged apathy and negligence by the medical staff of the hospital. “None of the paramedical staff or doctors saw my newborn son on Thursday morning and later when ECG was done, he was declared dead,” said a parent from Kota. “My nephew was born three days ago at the hospital but the staff did not look after the baby properly,” alleged Jitendra Kumar (30) from Kapren in Bundi. Dr Dulara said, “The committee of the paediatric department will probe negligence allegations and staff will also be sensitised about behaviour.” Officials said the hospital still faces a crunch of doctors. “There is only one professor and one associate professor. There should be three professors and four associate professors for 120 beds. The assistant professor strength is 7 which is considered sufficient,” an official said on condition of anonymity. There are 120 beds in the pediatric unit, of which 98 are now occupied. Kota South BJP MLA Sandeep Sharma and Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha district president Girriraj Gautam visited the hospital separately after receiving information about the deaths. “Once again newborn deaths at JK Lon Hospital have highlighted the negligence by the state government. Additional doctors were appointed last year after over 100 newborn deaths, but now they have been removed,” Sharma said. The hospital claimed that infrastructure and resources have improved. “The Rajasthan government is constructing a 150-bed pediatric hospital and indoor OPD unit on the campus of JK Lon Hospital for ₹30 crore under the smart city project. There is no dearth of nursing staff; we have 73 nurses against the requirement of 75,” Dr Dulara said. “Out of the 481 medical equipment in the paediatric unit, 383 are working and the rest are being repaired. Out of 71 body warmers, 60 are working; 41 pulse oximeters out of 43 and 15 ventilators out of 24 are also functional.” He said a new central oxygen supply line has been laid after 100 infants died last December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-newborns-die-in-kota-hospital-in-2-days-probe-ordered/story-TAc3RweqIlXuZ5trJzCkbK.html

The Ministry of External Affairs on Tuesday informed the authorities of the decision to reopen the rail route, said Katihar Divisional Railway Manager Ravinder Kumar Verma. The distance between Haldibari railway station till the international border is 4.5 kilometres while that from Chilahati in Bangladesh till the zero point is around 7.5 kilometres, sources in the NFR said.Both Haldibari and Chilahati stations were on the old broad gauge railway route between Siliguri and Kolkata that went through areas in present-day Bangladesh.When passenger train service begins on this route, people will be able to travel to Kolkata from Jalpaiguri, which is near Siliguri, in seven hours, five hours less than what it takes now, Verma said after visiting Haldibari station on Wednesday.Headquartered at Maligaon in Guwahati, the NEF zone covers the entire Northeastern region and parts of Bihar and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-hasina-to-virtually-re-launch-cross-border-rail-route-after-55-years/story-XcbK2wc4ZG64yxpIm7m64I.html
10-12-2020||India||Karnataka Deputy CM says government will not ask IT companies to open offices, remote working may continue||The Karnataka government on Thursday said it will not ask IT companies to open office spaces and that the work from home arrangement that is currently in place may continue for a few more months due to prevailing Covid-19 situation.Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan, who is also incharge for IT and BT department, made it clear that the government cannot mandate the companies to open their offices and ask employees to report to work there, instead of working from home or work from anywhere.He was responding to a question raised by an Independent MLA from Hoskote Sharath Bachegowda in the assembly.“Eventually, they (offices) will open. The companies will take a call when the time is right..,” he said adding that there was no thought before the government to ask the companies to make its employees to attend to work at offices, also the situation is still not appropriate for it.Bachegowda while pointing out that most of the IT workforce was still working from home, claimed that it has affected productivity, and asked the government to put pressure on the companies to open offices.He also pointed to its impact on other dependent work forces like transport.Udupi MLA K Raghupati Bhat too said that with IT companies yet to open, cabs, canteens and other dependent livelihoods are getting affected, and it was time for the government to ask companies to open offices.Responding to this Narayan said once offices open up, ancillary services will also get back on track, and maintained that work from home was still the safe option due to the prevailing situation.He pointed out that technology came to the rescue of several sectors during the pandemic as he acknowledged the efforts of the IT, startups and innovation sector.Several IT companies closed their offices in March and asked its employees to work remotely as Covid-19 infections started increasing in the state, especially Bengaluru.The union government has extended connectivity norms for work from home for IT and BPO companies till December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-deputy-cm-says-government-will-not-ask-it-companies-to-open-offices-remote-working-may-continue/story-rrqF0P0qf8IXTVbQ9Hd5LI.html
10-12-2020||India||Not without India: World’s pharmacy gears up for vaccine race||India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, is getting set for the massive global blitz to contain the coronavirus pandemic with its pharmaceutical industry and partners freeing up capacity and accelerating investments even without firm purchase orders. India manufactures more than 60% of all vaccines sold across the globe, and while its $40 billion pharmaceutical sector is not yet involved in the production of the expensive Pfizer Inc and Moderna shots, the nation will play a pivotal role in immunizing much of the world.Indian companies are set to produce eight, more affordable vaccines designed to fight Covid-19, including AstraZeneca’s Covishield, called the “vaccine for the world by its developers.“There are many vaccines being produced in countries around the world but there’s only one nation that has the manufacturing capacity to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of citizens in every country, and that’s India,” said Australia’s ambassador to India, Barry O’Farrell, after touring vaccine manufacturing sites in India with many other diplomats.Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine maker, has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot, even as it awaits emergency-use approvals from both British and Indian authorities. SII plans to make a total of 400 million doses of Covishield by July and is setting up new production lines to roll out roughly one billion shots a year.Pharmaceutical packager Schott Kaisha, meanwhile, is stepping up production of vaccine vials and Deutsche Post’s DHL is working out how best to distribute the shots within the country and around the world.“Because of the large volumes coming out of India and of course the affordable vaccines, there is no other country that will contribute more towards ending the pandemic than India,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters at the company’s sprawling campus in the western city of Pune. Here, automated machines fill and seal thousands of vials with the AstraZeneca shot every hour before they are moved to a vast, high-ceiling cold room.But much of India’s vaccine production could be, at least initially, for domestic use.With nearly 10 million infections, the world’s second-highest after the United States, India’s government is likely to order a huge chunk of the vaccines for its 1.3 billion people.Calculated riskPrime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to specify how much India will require, but his government has said some vaccines may be approved in the next few weeks and that it was “committed to partnering with all interested countries in vaccine-related efforts”.Poonawalla said he expects to sell hundreds of millions of doses at home. Even as immediate local demand is met, nearly half of its production would go overseas, the company has said.India’s Bharat Biotech, which has also sought emergency approval for its government-backed vaccine candidate, is in discussions with more than 10 countries in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe to sell its product.Russia, meanwhile, has signed deals with Indian companies to make the country the production and export hub for its Sputnik V vaccine, starting with more than 100 million doses a year.Many companies in India’s vaccine supply chain are laying out investments without deals in hand.“We’ve taken a calculated risk,” said Rishad Dadachanji, a director at Schott Kaisha that is in supply talks with around 10 vaccine makers at home and abroad.It is increasing its annual manufacturing capacity by 300 million to 1.5 billion vials by November.Executives at rival firms SGD Pharma India and Piramal Glass said they were expanding their production base, or re-allocating manufacturing lines to focus on vials.SGD plans to add 100 million units to its current capacity of 350 million glass vials, while Piramal says it can double its specialised vial capacity at just a month’s notice “to meet any unforeseen demand.”Syringes and cold storageOthers that are likely to benefit from an expected surge in demand are: pharmaceutical firms Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cadila Healthcare and Hetero; logistics company FedEx; cold chain storage specialist Snowman Logistics and Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices, among others.Hindustan Syringes says it will increase capacity by 42% to 1 billion units by the first half of next year. It has already shipped some 140 million syringes that disable themselves after one use for the global vaccine distribution program COVAX.But because the Indian government has not yet signed any contracts with vaccine suppliers, some ancillary companies have been left guessing what kind of products they should prepare for as specifications may vary from vaccine to vaccine.Vial maker SGD’s managing director, Sardar Akshay Singh, warned that a last-minute rush to secure vaccines for India could hit exports - similar to the way officials stalled shipments of masks and sanitizers early in the pandemic to meet local demand.“We have been feeding the government a lot of information but they’ve not come up with a plan so far,” said Sunil Nair, CEO of India’s biggest cold chain operator, Snowman.The company’s ongoing expansion will nevertheless double its vaccine handling capacity to 200 million doses by March.It operates some 500 trucks fitted with containers refrigerated by Carrier Global, has vendors on standby if more are required, and says it can deliver vaccines from production site to inoculation centres within hours thanks to its countrywide reach.SII, which also has Covid vaccine tie-ups with US biotech firm Codagenix, Novavax and Austria’s Themis, has scaled back production of shots for other diseases and is readying more cold rooms, buying more trucks and hiring more workers.For DHL, the world’s largest courier and logistics company, vaccine transportation work has already begun in India. It recently brought in Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine for trials and says it will play a crucial role in exporting vaccines, and distributing them within the country.“The next 12-24 months are going to be significantly exciting and there’s going to be a lot of capacity issues, but I think it’s a positive headache to have,” DHL Express India head R.S. Subramanian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-without-india-world-s-pharmacy-gears-up-for-vaccine-race/story-x60zI6hZvdIIH5hKfFzvrN.html
10-12-2020||India||Kerala assembly Speaker rules out resignation, denies gold smuggling link||Kerala assembly Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan on Thursday rejected allegations of his alleged links with the main accused in the gold smuggling case and said since his hands are clean he has no plan to resign.He acknowledged that knew Swapna Suresh, one of the accused in the in the smuggling case, but only as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and he was not aware of her past or other dealings. He denied the opposition charges that he made several trips to the west Asian countries with her. He said he had cleared the air when the case cropped up four months ago and it was unfair to rake it up again. “I never made any trip with her and or met her abroad. It is a fact that I knew her as an employee of the consulate and attended some functions after being invited by her. Those who see negativity everywhere will suspect wrong even in a handshake or a pat,” he said at a press conference.The opposition had pilloried him citing an old video in which the Speaker was seen patting Suuresh after a function. When the Customs busted the gold smuggling racket in July, Suresh was working as a consultant with the designation of a Special Officer in the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited.He said he was ready for any probe and would be happy to share details which he knew with any agency. But he conceded that he failed in understanding the background of the accused and should have kept enough distance. He said it was not proper to attack constitutional bodies on the basis of mere hearsay and speculation. He said once he came to know about her background he never contacted her. The opposition Congress and BJP had raised serious allegations against him earlier. BJP state president K Surendran had alleged that he made several foreign trips with Suresh and he was aware of her activities and helped her on several occasions. The Congress also alleged kickbacks in the assembly modification contract awarded to a labour co-operative society, which is reportedly close to the ruling CPI(M). Speculation is rife that in the confessional statement given by Swapna Suresh under section 164 of the CrPC she had mentioned names of four VIPs. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the Speaker’s explanation was not satisfactory. The ruling CPI (M) has criticised the opposition for denigrating a constitutional post based on mere hearsay. “Both BJP and Congress have the same tone and tenor in Kerala. They are not even sparing the Speaker who is above politics,” said the party’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-speaker-rules-out-resignation-denies-gold-smuggling-link/story-pP8Ghq8k1VUNWCHX77J04O.html
10-12-2020||India||Union home secretary discusses possible Covid-19 vaccines roll-out with states||Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Thursday reviewed with top officials of state governments the arrangements for the roll-out of vaccines when these are available and asked them to prepare a database of frontline workers like police personnel who will be administered on priority, officials said.The meeting was attended by the Director Generals of Police and other senior officials of the state governments and Union Territory administrations. The union home secretary reviewed the arrangements for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out and asked the state and UTs to prepare a database of the frontline workers who will receive the vaccine during the initial stages, a home ministry official said. Bhalla told the state government officials to prepare the database of police, home guards, and civil defence and fire brigade personnel. The meeting came days after three vaccine manufacturers sought emergency approval for rolling out their vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on November 28 visited Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune to review the development and manufacturing process of coronavirus vaccines at facilities in these cities. The central government has been putting in place measures for quick and effective distribution of coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. An estimated one crore frontline health workers will also receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine whenever it becomes available, with around 92 per cent of government hospitals and 55 per cent of private hospitals across all states and UTs providing data identifying the workers. Police’s role while enforcing the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown, help provided to the common people and facilitates given to the migrant workers in different parts of the country was praised by all across.  According to an estimate, about 80,000 police and paramilitary personnel were infected by the Covid-19 in the country and over 1,000 of them succumbed to the virus. Among the infected are about 35,000 paramilitary personnel and 25,000 policemen in Maharashtra, the worst hit state in India. The deaths included 100 paramilitary personnel and about 300 in Maharashtra Police, almost all of them while playing different roles during the pandemic. India’s Covid-19 caseload climbed to 97,67,371 with 31,521 fresh infections, while the total number of recoveries surged to 92.53 lakh, pushing the national recovery rate to 94.74 per cent, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Thursday. The death toll rose to 1,41,772 with 412 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed. The Covid-19 case fatality rate stands at 1.45 per cent. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 92,53,306.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-home-secretary-discusses-possible-covid-19-vaccines-roll-out-with-states/story-bRRNy8FvFM4vLa8DCRKfBI.html

10-12-2020||India||Protesting farmers threaten to block railway tracks if demands not met||The farmers who have been agitating for the past two weeks against the new agri laws on Thursday announced that they will block railway tracks if their demands are not met by the government. The farmer unions, which held a meeting on Thursday, said they will soon announce a date for blocking tracks across the country. Addressing reporters at the Delhi’s Singhu border where they have been protesting for almost two weeks to demand a rollback of the agri laws, the farmer unions also reiterated that they will intensify their agitation and start blocking all highways leading to the national capital. Also Read | Govt ready for talks, urge farmer leaders to go through the proposal, says Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar“We will block railway tracks if our demands are not met. We will decide on the date and announce it soon. The blocking of tracks will not be limited to Haryana and Punjab but it will be done across the country,” farmer leader Boota Singh said at the press conference. The announcement by farmers came on the day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table.Tomar also urged farmer union leaders to consider proposals sent to them to break the deadlock over protests against the three new farm laws and said the government is ready for further discussions with them any time.“The Centre has admitted that laws have been made for traders. If agriculture is a state subject, the central government does not have right to make laws on it,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, another leader.  Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points for almost two weeks seeking a repeal of the new agri laws, which they claim were aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the ‘mandi’ system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce.  The government had on Wednesday proposed to give a “written assurance” that the existing MSP regime for procurement will continue. However, the farmers’ unions rejected the proposal and said they would intensify their agitation until the government accepts their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws. The government has also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the ‘mandi’ system.“Five rounds of talks have already been held with the government, but they remained inconclusive.

Banerjee said that it will take at least two quarters for the government to get everybody vaccinated. On the state of the country’s economy, the Nobel laureate said that he doesn’t know “how quickly the recovery will be”.Also read: ‘India is important part of the Walmart story’ - CEO Doug McMillon at HTLS 2020 #HTLS2020 | "This is a wasted crisis; We could have done more on the fiscal side," says Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee Watch LIVE - https://t.co/Gp3xZcBPB7 #DefiningANewEra pic.twitter.com/awb0mseOEP“We need a demand bounce as there has been a massive demand shock. Investment has been slow because our domestic economy is not providing huge rewards, hence people are sitting on their money and not investing,” he said. Describing the Covid-19 pandemic as a “wasted crisis”, Banerjee said that the government “could have done more on the fiscal side”.“I have always taken the view that there should be more fiscal stimulus,” he added.Banerjee talked about federalism in India and said that the size of states in the country is way too big. “We need much more federalism, Indian states are way too big,” he said.On the budget for the upcoming fiscal year, Banerjee said the government should focus on “things which are visible”, such as infrastructure projects. “The government should show that it is focussed on development. People like the assurance that growth will be restored. The government has a commitment toward ensuring growth,” he said. On the ongoing farmers’ protest, Banerjee said that all negotiations will eventually have to go through some state government. “I think Haryana state government is well placed to do that,” the Nobel laureate stated.

They seek repeal of the new farm laws, which they say are aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce. “Jidd will not solve it, charcha will (Stubbornness will not help, dialogue will),” reiterated CM Chouhan. Earlier today, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar urged farmer union leaders to consider proposals sent to them to break the deadlock over protests and said the government is ready for further discussions with them any time.When asked whether the government would consider a new bill on the MSP system, the minister said the new laws do not impact the MSP system and that will continue.“The government is ready to consider with an open mind any provision in the new laws where farmers have any issues and we want to clarify all their apprehensions,” Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We kept waiting for suggestions from farmers’ leaders to address their concerns, but they are stuck on the repeal of laws,” he said, while virtually ruling out conceding to the key demand with which thousands of farmers are protesting.The government fad on Wednesday proposed to give a “written assurance” that the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime for procurement will continue. However, the farmers’ unions rejected the proposal. The government has also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the mandi system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-will-not-end-will-not-end-will-not-end-shivraj-chouhan-to-farmers/story-uuvLkNbBIcPn7YYs1y1KCL.html

Taking to Twitter to condemn the incident, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “The goons entered his house in police presence when he was away.” Why is BJP getting so desperate by the day in Delhi? he asked in the same tweet.Earlier in the day, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj addressed a conference during which he also accused the police of helping the BJP workers and alleged that police “did not stop the goons” from entering Sisodia’s residence. Bhardwaj also claimed that they even removed the barricades around the house. However, the police has denied the allegations. Reacting to the incident, AAP leader Atishi Marlena called it a “black day” in Delhi’s political history.“This is a black day in Delhi’s political history that the Union Home Minister is now using his party goons and Delhi Police to attack the family of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in his absence from his residence,” she said at the press conference.The police has already launched an investigation into the matter. “Based on a complaint by C Arvind, secretary to deputy Chief minister Manish Sisodia, a proper offence has been registered by Delhi Police under appropriate sections of law and investigation is going on,” news agency ANI quoted Delhi police as saying. The police has also arrested six people in relation to the case. Earlier in the day, BJP workers staged a protest near Sisodia’s residence over an alleged conspiracy to kill mayors and leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations staging an indefinite dharna demanding payment of dues from the Kejriwal government.The Delhi BJP, however, refuted the allegations, saying their protest was peaceful as its vice president for the national capital, Ashok Goel Devraha claimed AAP leaders were trying to divert attention from the ‘conspiracy’ to kill BJP mayors and other corporation leaders.“We protested outside Sisodia’s residence to make it clear that the BJP workers are capable of answering any form of challenge,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deputy-cm-sisodia-s-residence-attacked-by-bjp-goons-in-police-presence-alleges-aap/story-PemYPERhExGhaoQr2HtyaL.html

10-12-2020||India||Law-making process ‘unconstitutional’, BJP leader urges PM, home minister for reform||Calling the existing law-making process “undemocratic and unconstitutional”, senior Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay has urged the Prime Minister and home minister to put a new process in place. He said that the draft of any new legislation should be put in the public domain for two months so that people get adequate time to discuss it and give their feedback.Referring to the ongoing farmers’ protest in the Capital against the three farm laws, Upadhyay said that the law is not anti-farmer, but they are protesting due to misinformation. The protest has disrupted life in the National Capital Region (NCR), he said.Upadhyay said, “There is a need to change the law-making process, as the existing process is not only undemocratic, but unconstitutional also. I have urged the PM to amend the process. I’ll be writing to him today.”He tweeted a video on Thursday expressing concern about the process. In the 2.19-minute video, Upadhyay said, “The existing law-making process is faulty. The law is made in the name of people’s welfare, but their opinion is not taken.”Like the three farm laws, the Citizenship Amendment Act had led to large scale protests throughout the country last year. He said that the laws despite being citizen-friendly are being misunderstood by people due to lack of information.Speaking to HT, Upadhyay said, “The IAS officers who draft the laws don’t even have practical knowledge about the issues. There are no detailed discussions done before the law is enacted, as a result, we have seen protests and PILs against the laws in the recent past despite them being citizen-friendly laws. The CAA was not anti-Muslim and the three farm laws are not anti-farmer, but due to misinformation, it has resulted in protests by people.”He added, “The three farm laws are not anti-farmer, but anti-middlemen. But due to the misinformation campaign and lack of awareness among people, farmers are on the streets. The ongoing protest has disrupted life in the NCR and adversely impacted the economy.”He has requested the PM to amend the law-making process. “To avoid misinformation, it’s important that the draft of the law should be put on law ministry’s website two months (60 days) in advance. This will give time to people, politicians and elected members to discuss it at the grassroot level. The discussions on the draft law can be better if MPs have the draft of the proposed law in advance. This will not only bring a strong legislation, but also reduce the number of PILs filed in the court. The recent laws such as CAA have been challenged in the court,” said Upadhyay, a former Delhi BJP spokesperson. Upadhyay, an AAP rebel, had joined the BJP in 2014. Delhi BJP said it is Upadhyay’s personal opinion. “Delhi BJP doesn’t endorse Upadhyay’s views. It is his personal view and shouldn’t be seen as the party’s view. The PM and the government know the law-making process very well. They are well aware of the issues,” said Harish Khurana, Delhi BJP spokesperson and media relation in-charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-making-process-unconstitutional-bjp-leader-urges-pm-home-minister-for-reform/story-V08XtqWP76v0D9rrGuLcdP.html
10-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand HC seeks govt’s reply on mandatory online registration for Mahakumbh pilgrims||With Mahakumbh 2021 scheduled to start in January, Uttarakhand high court has directed the state government to file its reply by December 23 on the suggestion of making online registration mandatory for pilgrims attending the four-month mega religious congregation, said Shiv Bhatt, counsel of one of the petitioners. The court’s directions came while hearing a bunch of PILs on Wednesday. The PILs have been filed by Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, and Rajendra Arya related to various issues regarding the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic in the state. The HC hears these PILs related to the Covid-19 situation in the state on every Wednesday. Mahakumbh will begin from January 1 and conclude on April 28. The first Shahi Snaan (royal bath) of Mahakumbh will be held on March 11(Shivratri), second on April 12 (Somwati Amawasya) and the third on April 14 (Baisakhi Mesh Poornima). The Mahakumbh is held once in 12 years.Before the pandemic, over 12 crore pilgrims were expected to participate in the mahakumbh. But now it is not clear yet how many pilgrims would actually turn up. Shiv Bhatt, counsel of Sachdanand Dabral said that he and the government counsel Rakesh Thapliyal had put forth many suggestions for checking Covid-19 spread during Mahakumbh like making online registration a must for pilgrims. “I also apprised the court that the state government had earlier stated that pilgrims would have to go for Covid test before attending Mahakumbh. The court directed the state government to file an affidavit on preparedness for checking Covid spread during mahakumbh by December 23”, he said. On November 24, the Uttarakhand government had stated that it was planning to allow pilgrims to attend Mahakumbh only after undergoing a Covid-19 test. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat while reviewing the Mahakumbh preparations had said “It is our responsibility to ensure that pilgrims are able to take holy bath safely amid this pandemic. For that, a mechanism should be made to allow only those pilgrims who have undergone a Covid-19 test and test negative,” he had said. Uttarakhand has so far reported over 79,000 Covid-19 cases and a total of 1,320 people have died of the disease.

Trust’s Chief Executive Officer Kanhuraj Bagate had clarified that it is only an appeal, and the trust has not imposed any dress code on devotees. On her way to Shirdi in a bus, Desai was stopped by police near Supe and later detained with her supporters. Earlier on Tuesday, sub-divisional magistrate Govind Shinde had served notice to Desai, asking her not to enter Shirdi in Ahmednagar district from December 8 midnight to December 11 midnight citing law and order. Desai defied the notice and headed to Shirdi with over 10 members of her outfit ‘Bhumata Brigade’ to remove the boards at the Saibaba temple there. Ahmednagar Superintendent of Police Manoj Patil said the police have detained around 15 people, including Desai. “The action against Desai has been taken under section 68 of the Bombay Police Act,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-trupti-desai-on-her-way-to-shirdi-to-remove-temple-notice-detained/story-uECr2lE6JzV4PIElGVr86H.html

The farmers’ stand was reiterated by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is spearheading the stir.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said that the government is interested only in ending the protest instead of resolving the issue.“They (central government) want amendment in them but we want these laws to be repealed. We don’t want changes. We will end our protest only when these laws are withdrawn,” Tikait was quoted as saying by new agency ANI. He further demanded that the government should bring a bill on the minimum support price (MSP) as it has no policy on the same. “Like the government brought the three bills, they should also bring a bill on the MSP,” he said, ANI reported.Also Read | With no end to deadlock on 3 laws, farmers pile up pressure with numbersThe comments come a day after the government sent a proposal of amendments which it plans to incorporate in the farm laws to the protesters at the Singhu border near Delhi. However, the agitating farmers rejected the proposal and demanded the complete withdrawal of the laws passed in September.On the prospect of future talks with the government, Tikait said they are still ready, even after several rounds of talks. “Whenever the government invites us, we will talk to them,” Tikat said, according to ANI.So far, five rounds of talks have taken place between government and farmers but no solution has been found to end the stir.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Why agri reforms are hard to sellThe farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Meanwhile, the protesters on Wednesday announced that they will intensify their agitation by blocking highways to further increase the pressure on the government.

10-12-2020||India||No one can stop making of Aatmanirbhar Bharat: PM Modi||India will not allow its “flood of opportunities” to go waste, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, indicating the growing potential for India in a post-Covid world order. The PM also emphasised that no force can stop the making of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and that debates and discussions must continue in Indian democracy both inside and outside Parliament, as he laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building here. At the star-studded event, attended by senior ministers, foreign envoys, top industrialists and others, the Prime Minister spoke about 21st century being India’s century and added, “At times, it looks like there is a flood of opportunities for India. There’s no way we can let go of these opportunities. We can’t waste time. No one can stop making of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.” Observers feel that Modi hinted about utilising the growing opportunities for India as the world looks forward to a post-Covid scenario with the arrival of vaccines. Also read | HIGHLIGHTS: We will have to take the pledge of ‘India First’, says PM ModiModi also invoked Guru Nanak to say that you speak sometimes and you listen at other times, as long as life continues. “Debate and discussion must go on both inside and outside Parliament. Service to the nation must also continue,” he said. The PM also emphasised that the responsibility of his government is to uphold democracy while all its policies are aimed at “nation first”. Hailing the day as historic, Modi described the event as a moment of pride for 130 crore Indians. “The construction of a new Parliament building is the symbol of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. It is also a symbol of coexistence of old and new,” the PM said, adding that he can’t forget the moment when he entered Parliament as an MP in 2014 and he bowed before the building. “When India got Independence, there was a lot of apprehension whether democracy can survive in India, given its poverty, social condition, literary levels. Predictions were made that democracy would fail in India. Today, we can say with pride that those apprehensions have been proved wrong,” the PM said. He also cited evidence of democratic systems and writings in ancient India, much before Magna Carta, to say that “One day, the world will recognise India as the mother of democracy.” The new building, the PM said, would not only give more facilities to lawmakers and inspire them to work more, but will be a witness to Aatmanirbhar Bharat, fulfilling aspirations of a 21st century India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-force-can-stop-making-of-atmanirbhar-bharat-says-pm-as-he-lays-foundation-stone-of-new-parliament-building/story-fbfekSnHJeKAgK0w4CFsSK.html
10-12-2020||India||Robot in Kerala polling booth tells voters to follow Covid-19 norms||Sivaraman Nair (68), a retired government servant was in for a surprise Thursday morning when he reached his polling booth in Ernakulam community hall to vote in the local body polls.At the polling booth, there was a robot which greeted him, took his temperature, gave him sanitizer and instructed him in a sweet voice to keep the required distance at the venue amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Named Sayabot the robot completed its task in one minute. Nair had read about robots in Japan and China but this was the first time he came across one, that too in a crowded polling booth. Sayabot seems to have bowled over both voters and officials.When another voter came her temperature was slightly high and it immediately advised the voter to approach the polling officer and exercise her franchise separately so as to avoid possible infection to others. It went on to remind another voter who was wearing his mask casually, to cover his nose properly. “Perhaps, this is the first a robot is being deployed in a polling booth in the country. It is doing its job perfectly. It enforced discipline and distancing in style. This is on a pilot basis and after gauging its success we will deploy it in other places after consulting the election commissioner and others,” said Ernakulam district collector S Suhas. Sayabot was developed by a Kochi-based start-up firm Asimov Robotics. “We are making a multi-purpose humanoid service robot, called Sayabot. It is a versatile robot that can be customised to perform assigned tasks with precision and accuracy,” said CEO of Asimov Robotics T Jayakrishnan. He said the robot at the polling station was developed in two days after the district administration approached his firm. He said Sayabot robots were deployed in banks, education and hospitality sectors in the state and outside. Polling began Thursday morning in five districts - Ernakulam, Kottayam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad - in the second phase of the local body elections. The hotly- contested poll is crucial for major parties in the state ahead of the assembly elections due in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/robot-in-kerala-polling-booth-tells-voters-to-follow-covid-19-norms/story-bCNqoXbTwPjWZtHFM6GcXO.html
10-12-2020||India||With no end to deadlock on 3 laws, farmers pile up pressure with numbers||The number of farmers at Delhi-Haryana borders is increasing with each passing day with more from across Punjab and Haryana making a beeline to join the protest in the national capital against the three farm laws that they deem to be detrimental to their livelihood.The agitation entered the 14th day on Wednesday with a constant flow of farmers carrying black flags on their actor-trailers, SUVs, cars, trucks and canters, marching forward on NH 44----- Delhi-Chandigarh national highway-- towards the national capital.With talks with Union government remaining inconclusive, the farmer leaders are requesting more and more followers to join the protests to increase the pressure on the government for the withdrawal of the three laws. Farmers in the villages along the highways and Gurdwaras are serving langar (community kitchen) for travelling farmers. Another reason behind the continuing surge in the numbers lies in the fact that sowing of wheat is over and the farmers are free for about a month till the first irrigation of the crop.Also Read: Traffic restrictions continue on Delhi borders as farmers carry on with protest“We hired a bus and 45 farmers from my village left for Delhi on Wednesday morning as we should help our brothers and sisters, who are sitting there for the past two weeks,” said Rampal Sharma from Bhor Saidan village of Kurukshetra district.“We want to tell our chief minister that farmers from Haryana are also with their counterparts from Punjab and we will stay in Delhi until these anti-farmer laws are withdrawn,” said a young farmer, Vikas Kamboj, from Yamunanagar.He is on way to Delhi with his four friends in his black SUV.Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Why agri reforms are hard to sell Farmers, especially the youth, are expressing their solidarity with ongoing agitation using social media.

10-12-2020||India||‘New Parliament building will be witness to Atmanirbhar Bharat’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for a new Parliament complex, saying it will serve India of 21st century. Calling it the beacon of democracy, the Prime Minister said that the previous Parliament house - which was constructed 100 years ago - fulfilled the needs of the country, and the building will fulfill the country’s aspirations and ambitions.“I can never forget the moment in my life when I had the opportunity to come to Parliament House for the first time in 2014 as an MP. Then before stepping into this temple of democracy, I had bowed my head and saluted this temple of democracy,” PM Modi said at an address after the groundbreaking ceremony in New Delhi.Foundation-laying ceremony of new Parliament building: Track live updates“This is a day of pride for over 130 crore Indians when we are witnessing this historic moment. The new Parliament building is an example of the co-existence of the new and the old. This is an effort to make changes within oneself in accordance with the time and needs,” he further said.He then talked about how the new Parliament complex will help the legislators as well as those who come to meet them. PM Modi said that there were space constraints in the old building, but that has been taken care of in the new complex. “The current Parliament building is nearly 100 years old; it was upgraded many times, but now it needs rest,” said PM Modi.“The old building fulfilled the needs of the country, the new Parliament building will fulfill the country’s aspirations. If the old Parliament House gave direction to post-Independence India, the new building would become a witness to the creation of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” he added.The Prime Minister then delved into democratic history of India, saying the texts available here are older than the Magna Carta, which is considered the foundation of democracy. “Magna Carta was written in 13th century, but philosopher Basavanna envisioned a public Parliament in 12th century in the form of Anubhav Mantapa,” said PM Modi.“If we go back further, some ancient inscriptions in Tamil Nadu from 10th century talk about categorising villages into groups - like modern day wards. They also talked about disqualifying a public representatives from contesting elections. The criteria was to declare the contestants and their relatives’ assets,” he added.The Prime Minister said it is ironic that other countries teach India about democracy. “When other countries talk about democracy, they only discuss elections and other administrative issues. But in India, democracy is a sacred, a way of life. The democratic system has been developed based on centuries long experiences. There were several changes, but the spirit remained as it is. Ironically, other countries teach is about democracy. I think that day will soon come when out countries will say ‘India is mother of democracy’,” said PM Modi.He then emphasised on the spirit of democracy and why it is important. The Prime Minister also said that there can be differences, but the ultimate goal should be to serve people.“We’ll have to take the pledge of ‘India First’. Our decisions should make nation stronger and be measured on the same scale - that nation’s welfare comes first. Our efforts in next 25-26 years should be towards how do we want to see India in 2047, in our 100 years of Independence,” said PM Modi.He also called upon the political leaders to breathe life in the new building by following the dynamic principles of democracy.Earlier on Thursday, PM Modi laid the foundation stone for the new building of Parliament. The ceremony was attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, foreign envoys and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The new Parliament building will cost Rs 971 crore and is estimated to be completed by 2022. The current Parliament building was constructed by the British and its foundation stone was laid on February 12, 1921.The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. The Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats, keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parliament-building-will-be-witness-to-atmanirbhar-bharat-pm-modi/story-tKHqVKWR93smblUyRuizqK.html
10-12-2020||India||Apollo hospital chain ready to vaccinate 1 million daily||India’s largest hospital chain says it’s ready to administer one million coronavirus vaccine doses a day, but the government has not made clear how vaccines will be distributed and whether private health-care networks will be involved.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. has so far trained 6,000 staff to give out jabs across its network of 71 hospitals, hundreds of clinics and thousands of pharmacies, according to Managing Director Suneeta Reddy, who said the company’s talks with officials in New Delhi had yet to provide any firm guidance.“We need to know if the government wants to handle the whole thing or allow the private sector to do it,” Reddy said in an interview Tuesday. “The issue here is how can we double the amount of people that can be vaccinated,” she said from Chennai, adding that Apollo is ready to help in any capacity. The government “can do it, but it will take time.”How and if India decides to work with its large network of private hospitals on vaccine distribution could be crucial to any success in reining in the world’s second-worst outbreak, which has inflicted deep economic damage. India may start inoculation efforts within weeks as front-running developers apply for emergency authorization.There will be a “flood of Covid vaccines” in the next five to six months, Krishna Ella, the chairman of Bharat Biotech International Ltd. -- which is producing one of India’s leading indigenous candidates -- told a conference on Tuesday.Apollo has been telling clients via its digital app that a shot “should be available in 60-120 days” and customers will “be the first ones to know about the vaccines.”Capacity ConcernsCompanies vying to roll out those vaccines, along with public health experts, have raised concerns about India’s capacity to swiftly inoculate its population of about 1.3 billion people. There are also fears of unequal access, given the enormous wealth disparities across India’s cities and vast hinterlands.Apollo Hospitals has held talks with the Serum Institute of India Ltd., the world’s largest vaccine maker which has already produced millions of doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot. But Reddy said developers are waiting on direction from New Delhi “because all of them have committed capacity to the government first.”Rajesh Bhushan, secretary to the federal health ministry, told Bloomberg last month that India will rely on its national immunization network, which currently targets 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women every year. Experts believe that system will need to be significantly built up with help from private players to meet India’s needs.Private hospitals in India have been criticized for sitting on the sidelines of the coronavirus crisis. Though the private sector accounts for around 60% of India’s total hospital bed capacity, there were widely reported instances of some private hospitals and doctors refusing to treat Covid-19 patients as cases accelerated in India starting from June.Apollo has treated more than 30,000 Covid patients and provided about 400,000 tests, said Suneeta Reddy, one of four daughters of octogenarian founder Prathap C. Reddy, who established the company in 1983. India has nearly 10 million cases of the coronavirus, and is adding over 30,000 new infections daily.The company saw a “lost quarter” earlier this year, Reddy said. This followed the sudden decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impose a draconian national lockdown in March with little notice. While Reddy said she supported the restrictions, Apollo suffered a loss of 2.08 billion rupees ($28 million) in the three months through June, though it’s seeing a better-than-expected recovery, posting net income of 602.7 million rupees in the latest quarter.Medical TourismWith about 12% of the firm’s revenue derived from international customers, Apollo has received a blow from the near total disappearance of thousands of overseas patients who visit India each year. Until October, India had closed its borders to medical tourism, a market that was expected to be worth $9 billion in 2020, according to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry.A rise in local demand has compensated for that loss, Reddy said. Many wealthy Indian patients who used to go abroad for treatments are now Apollo’s customers. Occupancy rates across Apollo’s hospitals now runs at about 67%, close to pre-pandemic levels. Roughly 15%-20% of those are Covid patients in specially segregated facilities, she said.“I’ve always said the international thing was just icing on the cake, definitely not our bread and butter,” Reddy said. “It’s great if it comes, but without it we’ve learned to meaningfully fill our beds.”The company will raise up to 15 billion rupees through an equity issue in January, Reddy said. The proceeds will be used to acquire IHH Healthcare Bhd.’s remaining 50% stake in a Kolkata hospital, reduce Apollo’s debt, as well as fund upgrades of its digital app and any potential bolt-on acquisitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apollo-hospital-chain-ready-to-vaccinate-1-million-daily/story-zbawfZccnf3w8fHW3j5olK.html
10-12-2020||India||Government proposes easy access of satellite-based remote sensing data||The government has proposed to come out with a new space-based remote sensing policy to enable enhanced participation of Indian industry and ease of data access with simplified procedures.The Department of Space has published a draft “Space- based Remote Sensing Policy of India (SpaceRS Policy 2020)” along with draft “Norms, Guidelines and Procedures (SpaceRS NGP 2020)” for its implementation.“We have put it (the drafts) in the public domain and after getting comments, that will go (the policy will come into effect after Cabinet approval),” the Department’s Secretary and Chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), K Sivan, told P T I.SpaceRS Policy 2020 is aimed at enabling wider stakeholders’ participation and ease of data access.It was noted that India has made tremendous progress in the field of space-based remote sensing by building and launching satellites operating from various orbits, encompassing imaging and non-imaging observation in optical, infrared and microwave regions of electromagnetic spectrum.The new draft policy has taken into consideration the global trends, advancement of technology, wide ranging demand for remote sensing data - both within and outside the country -- and the recent initiative of the government towards ‘self- reliant’ India.It aims at encouraging various stakeholders in the country to actively participate in space-based remote sensing activities to enhance commercialisation of space technology.“An easy access of space based remote sensing data and information shall enable unfolding of knowledge-based solutions, addressing many planning and monitoring requirements of the nation,” according to the draft.The government shall promote Indian industries to carry out space based remote sensing activities within and outside India, and enable easy access to space-based remote sensing data, except for “sensitive data and information, it said.It shall also provide a timely and responsive regulatory environment for the commercial Indian industry to establish and operate space based remote sensing systems.In order to unlock the immense potential of remote sensing data, easy dissemination of data and services originating from space-based remote sensing systems in the country will be enabled, the draft said.Any service provider will be free to provide remote sensing data and services to any user in the country, it added.However, a simple process of registration/authorisation of space asset is envisaged to keep the government informed about the space asset whose data and services are being offered to the users in the country.Due to national security considerations, a category of data will be identified as ‘sensitive’ and a different mechanism for dissemination of such data is envisaged, it was stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-proposes-easy-access-of-satellite-based-remote-sensing-data/story-iec0eAkXnsa4kg9FyrKnEL.html

10-12-2020||India||JP Nadda’s cavalcade stoned in Abhishek Banerjee’s constituency in Bengal||The vehicles of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president J P Nadda, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh and several other state and national leaders of the saffron party were stoned while they were going to attend an organizational meeting at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district on Thursday afternoon. The assault was telecast live by several Bengali news channels. Vehicles of some media houses were also damaged. Diamond Harbour is the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Over the last few weeks, the BJP has sharpened its attack on Abhishek Banerjee and the chief minister, calling them bhaipo (nephew in Bengali) and pishi (aunt) at almost every public meeting and in social media posts. The windows and windshields of several vehicles were smashed in the attack on Thursday. Vijayvargiya and BJP national secretary Anupam Hazra were hurt by pieces of stones. The BJP leadership alleged that the attack was planned to foil Nadda’s programme and there were no policemen along the highway connecting Kolkata to Diamond Harbour. “Bengal has become a state of lawlessness and a state of intolerance. It is because of the blessings of Maa Durga that I reached here. The hooligans of the Trinamool Congress left no stones unturned to stop us. I am safe because I have a bullet proof car,” Nadda said while addressing party workers at the meeting. “This mentality to crush democracy has to be crushed. We need your cooperation and blessings. This government needs to be ousted. Is this the culture Rabindranath Tagore and Rishi Aurobindo left for us?” said Nadda. “Eight BJP workers were killed last month. More than 130 of them have been killed in recent years. It is a shame on democracy. There is no administration. We could not have moved in the state if we did not have security cover. I can understand what our workers must be facing. Democracy has collapsed here. Prepare for elections. The lotus will bloom in Diamond Harbour,” said Nadda. No police officer commented on the incident till 1.45 pm. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar wrote a tweet on the incident and said the government took no precaution. “Concerned at alarming reports of anarchy and lawlessness @MamataOfficial indicating ruling party harmads on rampage at BJP President Convoy and political police @WBPolice in support. This happening inspite of my alerts to CS & DGP early morning indicated collapse of law & order,” tweeted the governor. Harmad is an almost a 200-year-old word people in Bengal’s coastal belt coined for Portuguese pirates but these days it is commonly used in reference to people involved in political violence.The chief secretary and the director general of police are supposed to meet the governor in the evening. It is a pre-scheduled meetingAlso Read: ‘Lotus will bloom in Bengal in 2021’: BJP chief JP Nadda after convoy attackedBengal panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee alleged at a press conference that Nadda has been provoking people since Wednesday and the attack could have been carried out by BJP workers with an ulterior motive. “We have seen the BJP carrying out such attacks on their own people in other states. The government will conduct an inquiry. If it is found that our men were involved, then we will definitely take action. Action will also be taken if BJP workers were behind it,” said Mukherjee.“We have reports that the BJP has been circulating provocative videos when Nadda’s convoy was on the move. I urge our party supporters to stay away from BJP people,” said Mukherjee. Also Read: BJP Bengal unit informs Amit Shah about alleged lapses in party chief Nadda’s security coverState Urban development minister Firhad Hakim suggested that the state government was not asked for security cover for Nadda. “They did not even inform the state government who is coming and who is going. The Central government provides security cover to Nadda and other BJP leaders. If they had asked for security cover, we would have made arrangements,” Hakim said on the sidelines of a TMC programme. BJP state unit chief Dilip Ghosh told the media that the attack was a proof of how security of opposition leaders is at stake. “This is a breach in security although the state government was informed about the programme. Abhishek Banerjee’s men attacked the cars and assaulted our local supporters as well. They were attached with stones and sticks,” said Ghosh. Bottles were thrown at an SUV in which Ghosh’s security personnel were travelling. Ghosh was travelling in Nadda’s car. On Wednesday, Nadda was shown black flags by a group of Hindi-speaking youths outside the new office of the party in south Kolkata shortly after he arrived in the city on a two-day visit. The demonstrators condemned the new farm laws and shouted “J P Nadda murdabad, BJP murdabad” (down with J P Nadda, down with the BJP). The agitators were not carrying flags of any political party. It was a snap demonstration that caught the police and BJP workers by surprise. The demonstrators climbed up on the cars parked outside the office and raised slogans. This was the first time any BJP leader in Bengal faced a demonstration on the farm laws issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-s-cavalcade-stoned-in-abhishek-banerjee-s-constituency-in-bengal/story-YRIoQ8Iy5PnoYwC0eqiOxI.html

10-12-2020||India||Shiv Sena MLA Sarnaik joins ED’s probe into ‘money laundering’ by TOPSGRUP||Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, on Thursday, joined Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) money laundering probe linked to security service giant TOPSGRUP, owned by Rahul Nanda. The central agency suspects that the Sena legislator was involved in alleged financial irregularities and received kickbacks from the security company that was providing services to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). However, Sarnaik has been refuting all the accusations alleging a political vendetta.Sarnaik, who has secured interim relief from the Supreme Court in the case, reached the ED office around 11.30am on Thursday for enquiry.ED officials aware of the developments in the probe said that the anti-money laundering agency wishes to grill Sarnaik in connection with the suspicious funds transfers linking MMRDA security service contracts and Nanda.Nanda, too, has denied all the allegations against him in the past and said that Sarniak was his old friend but his company had no business with Sarnaik or Shiv Sena.Earlier, the agency raided several premises linked to Sarnaik and others in Mumbai and Thane. Later, the ED arrested Sarnaik’s close associate Amit Chandole last month and also TOPSGrup’s managing director M Shashidharan in the case. “Topsgrup had obtained a contract for providing security guards for the MMRDA projects in collusion with Pratap Sarnaik through illegal means by a well-thought out strategy,” ED had claimed.The agency claimed that the aim of these allegedly ‘illegal’ manoeuvres was to get additional benefits by inflating the number of contracted security guards deployed at the cost of MMRDA and to procure illegal cash gratification for Sarnaik for facilitating the alleged irregularities. For his ‘active’ role and ‘criminal conspiracy’, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract, and sometimes, the money used to be transferred to the account of a third person, said the ED officials. Chandole accepted the receipt of cash from Topsgrup for the MMRDA projects, ED claimed. Therefore, part of the amount received by Topsgrup from MMRDA appears to be proceeds of crime, said ED. Also Read: Sanjay Raut’s retort to claim of ‘Pak-China hand’ behind farmers’ stirPreviously Sarnaik had claimed that he was being targeted by the Central agency for taking a stance against actor Kangana Ranaut and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.He even claimed that the ED officials told his son that his father (Sarnaik) spoke a lot on Ranaut and Goswami.‘I will continue to speak wherever Mumbai, Maharashtra or its police are maligned. I have done nothing wrong in my business,” he said last week after ED raided his properties and questioned his son, Vihang, who has been summoned for the second round of questioning.The agency said that other people linked to Sarnaik’s businesses would soon be asked to join the probe.ED’s money laundering probe against Nanda and his family members is based on an FIR registered by Mumbai’s Yellow Gate police on October 28 on the direction of 16th metropolitan magistrate court. The case was transferred to the Mumbai police economic offences wing (EOW) for further investigation. The complaint filed by Ramesh lyer, the former chairman of Topsgrup, alleged that Nanda and others diverted huge funds from the firm’s accounts to various accounts in India and overseas. He further alleged that these funds were utilised by Nanda and others for their personal purposes such as purchasing property. The security firm was thus defrauded of Rs175 crore. Also Read: DGHS surrenders 262 vacant UG medical, dental seats from all-India quota to MaharashtraIyer and Topsgrup’s former director of finance Amar Panghal, in their statements, said, that in 2014, a contract was signed by Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd with MMRDA, according to which, 350-500 guards had to be deployed at project sites on a monthly basis. While only 70% of the guards were actually deployed, the firm billed MMRDA for all the guards and charged the authority for their salaries and provident fund, ED stated before the court. The duo reportedly also informed ED that huge cash amounts were withdrawn from the bank accounts of Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd and given to a former top executive. In financial year 2017-18, an amount of around Rs 92 lakh was handed over to the said executive and there was an arrangement with two persons, one of whom was Chandole, who got a monthly share of profits earned on the MMRDA contracts. In addition, a fixed commission of Rs 50,000 per month and Rs 500 per guard deployed was being paid to Chandole and the other man by the top executive, said ED. As per the details provided by lyer, from May 2017 to June this year, the amount aggregating to Rs 2.36 crore has been shared as commission. Of the said amount, Rs 90 lakh was paid through bank transfers to Chandole and the other man. As per lyer, all these amounts are still being paid from Topsgrup’s bank accounts and a commission of around Rs 7 crore has been paid to the duo since 2014, when the contract with MMRDA was initiated. During the course of investigation, the top executive’s statements were recorded on November 24 and 25, in which he purportedly said that Nanda acquired a United Kingdom (UK)-based firm, Shield Guarding Company Limited, in 2014 for around Rs 200-250 crore. On the pretext of meeting the expenses of the overseas company, Nanda used to allegedly siphon-off money from the Indian company for his and his family’s personal expenses, including buying several immovable properties in Dubai and the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-mla-sarnaik-joins-ed-s-probe-into-money-laundering-by-topsgrup/story-QHnVKk9l41P8NQuKI3vepJ.html
10-12-2020||India||Bring agri reforms in BJP-ruled states first, others may follow suit if they like the outcome: Raut to Centre on farmers’ protest||As the deadlock in the farmers-government talks continues, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has asked if the Centre is even serious about resolving the issue. The Sena MP also said that if the Centre wanted to bring in reforms it should have tried it first in one of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states.“The real question is does the Centre want to find a solution. If they wanted to find a solution, they would have. It seems that they want to keep this issue hanging. If the Centre wants to bring in reforms in agriculture, then it should start with BJP-ruled states, experiment there. The other states will see the outcome and accept it,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.A day after Union minister of state Raosaheb Danve claimed that Pakistan and China are behind the ongoing protests by farmers, the Sena leader said, “If a Union minister has information that China and Pakistan have a hand behind farmers’ agitation, then, the defence minister should immediately conduct a surgical strike on China and Pakistan.”Speaking at the inauguration of a health centre in Maharashtra’s Jalna district, Danve, the minister of state for consumer affairs, had said, “The agitation that is going on is not that of farmers. China and Pakistan have a hand in it. Muslims in this country were incited first. What was said (to them)? That NRC is coming, CAA is coming and Muslims will have to leave this country in six months. Did a single Muslim leave?” He added. “Those efforts didn’t succeed and now farmers are being told that they will face losses. This is the conspiracy of other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-agri-reforms-in-bjp-ruled-states-first-others-may-follow-suit-if-they-like-the-outcome-raut-to-centre-on-farmers-protest/story-rLweftozRVmeDQ0Nn1J50J.html

10-12-2020||India||BJP Bengal unit informs Amit Shah about alleged lapses in party chief Nadda’s security cover||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit has sent a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, informing the latter about the alleged lapses in security cover in BJP’s national president JP Nadda during his tour of the state. The letter also requests Shah to direct the home secretary of West Bengal to provide adequate security to Nadda who was in the state on a two-day tour. “We request you to issue required directives to the state home secretary on the matter of extending and providing adequate security cover during tomorrow’s (December 10) programme of JP Nadda. This is especially important in view of today’s (December 9) serious security lapses in Kolkata during his programme,” the letter written by state president Dilip Ghosh said. On Wednesday, Nadda participated in a door-to-door campaign at Bhowanipore in south Kolkata, which is the home turf of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. On Thursday, he would be camping at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas, which is the constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew.

Police did not intervene to stop them and casually allowed them to come within close range of Nadda’s vehicle,” said the letter. It also alleged that the pilot car didn’t provide any smooth passage and the convoy was stopped at various traffic intersections, raising security concerns. Ghosh’s letter also alleged that the state government failed to ensure full security arrangements as per government protocol during the visit of the BJP chief who has a Z category security cover by CRPF.

10-12-2020||India||India, Nepal to start flights under air bubble arrangement||India and Nepal have decided to start flights under a bilateral air bubble arrangement, people familiar with developments said on Thursday, marking another step by the two sides to normalise ties hit by a border row earlier this year. “Initially, we are starting with one daily flight from each side between Delhi and Kathmandu. From the Indian side, it will be Air India which had a daily flight between the two capitals in the pre-Covid-19 period,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Flights between the two countries and cross-border movement of people through several checkpoints were suspended following the outbreak of Covid-19. The movement of essential supplies and cargo, however, had continued as Nepal is largely dependent on imports from India. The move follows a string of visits to Nepal by senior Indian officials to reset ties that were hit after Kathmandu issued a new political map in May that included Indian territories, including the strategic Kalapani region. Following visits by Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel and Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla travelled to Kathmandu last month for wide-ranging talks with the Nepalese leadership to take forward bilateral ties, especially in connectivity and trade. The two sides also agreed to respect each other’s sensitivities and handle the border issue through existing mechanisms. The people cited above said the creation of a bilateral air bubble arrangement had been proposed to Nepal by the Indian side some time ago, and Kathmandu had cleared the move after Shringla, during his recent visit, highlighted the importance of people-to-people connectivity in the special relations between the two sides. “We are starting the air bubble arrangement with Indian and Nepalese nationals and holders of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and Person of Indian Origin (PIO) cards of all nationalities, and all valid Indian visa holders, except tourist visas,” said the person cited above. The air bubble arrangement will follow all medical protocols as is done with other countries that have similar arrangements, and this includes reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test report of 72 hours prior to the travel, the people said. India currently has air bubble arrangements with 22 countries, including the US, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Tanzania, the Netherlands, the Maldives, Japan and Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-nepal-to-start-flights-under-air-bubble-arrangement/story-7Rd5zSuqa99lguZIQlxDjO.html

Every year, December 10 is observed as the Human Rights Day. It was on this day that in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “Today is #HumanRightsDay. Nowadays, there is a big trend to bulldoze democracy, crush fundamental rights, and muzzle the voice of the people. Our government is committed to upholding #humanrights,” Banerjee tweeted. The chief minister has, on many occasions, lashed out at the BJP-led Centre, accusing it of allegedly violating the country’s federal structure, using central agencies to scare state governments and politicians, stifling the media and forcefully suppressing any kind of protest against it. On its part, the BJP has said that more than 100 party workers have been killed in West Bengal during Banerjee’s regime and around 1,500 party workers and supporters are languishing in jails after the TMC-led government in the state implicated them in false cases. Meanwhile, on Human Rights Day, Banerjee, went on to say, “The GoWB has set up 19 human rights courts in the last nine and half years. It was after repeated protests and movements by me that the West Bengal #HumanRights Commission was set up in 1995. My best wishes to all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trend-to-bulldoze-democracy-crush-fundamental-rights-mamata-banerjee-tweets-on-human-rights-day/story-hUPsmGqDZmLCADC0IXvjiL.html

In her letter to S Jaishankar, Saba Fatima, a resident of Chandrayangutta in the old city, requested that the external affairs ministry directs the Indian embassy in the US to speak to her husband, Abdi Wali Ahmed, a Somalia national, who is presently working as a driver in Boston, USA, and settle the divorce issue as soon as possible. “I request you to interfere in this matter and help me in getting justice. I cannot remarry without any authentic divorce papers,” Fatima said in her letter. She got married to Ahmed on January 25, 2015, when he was studying engineering in Hyderabad, while his family lived in Abu Dhabi. “A relative of ours brought the alliance stating that he was a good boy and I would have a bright future if I married him. Ours is a very poor family and I was a high school dropout. I thought my father would not have brought a better match for me and hence, I agreed for the marriage,” she told Hindustan Times.The Nikah was performed by a Qazi as per Islamic laws and registered with Telangana Wakf Board. “A week after the wedding reception, Ahmed left for his parents’ place. After that he used to come to Hyderabad every six months and we used to stay in a rented house in Tolichowki and Malakpet areas of Hyderabad,” she said. The last time Ahmed visited Fatima was in February 2020 and later, he visited his mother in Dubai as she was held up there because of the coronavirus lockdown. “Later, he went to Boston where he got a job as a driver. He used to be in touch with me even from the US. He told me he had got some other job there and was earning around Rs 4 lakh a month. He also sent me money for my daily needs,” she said. Also Read: Air India’s non-stop Hyderabad-Chicago flight from Jan 15On October 7, Ahmed called Fatima’s father, Mohd Fareed, stating that he was divorcing her. “He asked my father to switch-on the speaker of the mobile and pronounced triple talaq, without any reason. I called him up again and had an argument, but he did not reveal why he was divorcing me,” she lamented. Later, Ahmed blocked her and her family members’ mobile numbers and did not take any calls. Fatima tried to contact her mother-in-law in Dubai and sister-in-law who stayed in London. “Though they assured me of justice initially, they, too, blocked my number later and could not be reached,” she said.

It may be mentioned that Parliament had passed Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage), Bill, 2019, last year, which criminalised instant triple talaq among Muslims. The bill got the presidential assent in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/given-triple-talaq-by-husband-in-us-hyderabadi-woman-knocks-on-mea-doors/story-mY4KH5ZxJWwK4Q12u47ioI.html
10-12-2020||India||Parliament: From a circular building of Rs 83 lakh to a Rs 970-cr triangular edifice||Old timers recall how, in the initial years of Indian democracy, lawmakers could simply hop off a public bus (private cars were a luxury for nearly all MPs at that time) in front of the main gate of the Parliament building and walk inside. Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee once came in a bullock cart in 1973 along with other political leaders to protest against the increase in petrol and kerosene prices. Eleven years later, the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi saw the introduction of deep layers of security that has only enhanced over the years as security risks went only northwards. But during Gandhi’s time, the Parliament complex saw its first expansion since Sir Edward Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker built the iconic edifice. On October 24, 1975, a not-so-awe-inspiring Parliament House Annexe was added to the estate. The office building was useful as both the scope of work as well as the workforce of the two Houses have increased manifold and there was space constraint. The circular building of Indian Parliament, built originally to house Central Legislative Assembly and Council of State, has been privy to many historic events. The transfer of power from Britain to India took place within its precincts. Jawaharlal Nehru’s midnight speech was delivered from the Central Hall of Parliament. The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India in the same Central Hall, shaping lives and destiny of millions of Indians. Also read | New Parliament complex will cater to future needsThe current building took six years for construction at a cost of Rs83 lakh. The Central Legislative Assembly met for the first time in Parliament House on January 19, 1927, marking the beginning of representative rule in India. During Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure, the plan for another new building—to house Parliament library was conceptualised. On August 15, 1987, Rajiv laid the foundation stone of Parliament Library Building. But the new building, a few metres less in height than the Parliament building, took quite some time and only during 2002, when Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, the Library Building was inaugurated by the then President KR Narayanan. Seven years later, as Parliament’s work expanded further, an extension of the annexe was planned. On May 5 2009, the foundation stone of Extension of Parliament House Annexe was laid by vice-president Mohammad Hamid Ansari and Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. The extension of the Parliament House Annexe was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 31. But on Thursday, India will see a giant leap in its parliamentary heritage as foundation stone would be laid by Modi for an altogether new Parliament building. The authorities expect the new building to be completed by 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its Independence. The new building, to be built at a cost of around Rs970 crore, will be triangular in shape with a constitution hall in the middle of the complex. The state emblem of India—an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath, is proposed to be placed atop the New Parliament complex. The triangular complex is also proposed to have six entrances for public use, MPs and for VIPs, including the speaker and the vice president. The new complex will provide offices for all key functionaries of the Parliament, offices for administrative staff attached to key functionaries, café and dining facilities, Committee Meeting Rooms, VIP lounges, common rooms and a separate ladies’ lounge. A central courtyard will provide an open meeting space for the members of both Houses along with an adjoining café. There will be museum grade galleries and exhibits which will be accessible to all. The complex is designed to include 120 offices along the periphery of the complex, similar to the current complex. On the third section of the new complex is an open courtyard surrounding the lounge, dining area and the new library. There is a plan to plant a huge banyan tree in the middle of the courtyard. In addition, a separate chamber for MPs offices is being planned opposite the Parliament complex where central government buildings, the Transport Bhawan and the Shram Shakti Bhawan, are situated. According to officials aware of the development, the two buildings will be razed to build an office complex for more than 700 MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-from-a-circular-building-of-rs83-lakh-to-a-rs970-crore-triangular-edifice/story-Zeu6tvV0kDJqGWnar5nvjL.html

10-12-2020||India||Indian scientists identify new potential drug treatments for Covid-19||Indian scientists have identified drugs and possible cocktails that can target vital proteins of the novel coronavirus, and may potentially help treat Covid-19. Using a virtual screening of the DrugBank database, the research published in the journal Scientific Reports, identified a variety of as yet unexplored ways to attack SARS-CoV-2, even as it mutates. The Drugbank database is a chemical space of compounds approved by FDA and molecules under drug trials. The researchers from Alagappa University in Tamil Nadu and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden propose a list of individual drugs and cocktails that deserve testing for the treatment of Covid-19. A key part of the study, the researchers said, is the identification of drugs that target or bind to multiple proteins that are essential for replication of the virus, and which are also involved in the initial stage of host-cell infection. According to Vaibhav Srivastava and Arul Murugan, the corresponding authors of the study, multi-targeting offers an effective route to deal with drug resistance, which would enable a drug to work around mutations of the virus. “The virus is mutating rapidly, which means that it is modifying its proteins. If we have a drug that can target several proteins, and if one becomes mutated, the drug will be effective on others,” Srivastava said. This attribute allowed the team to propose cocktails that have versatility. “It was possible for us to propose cocktails, or blends of drugs, in which each drug can bind to a specific target protein with high affinity,” he said. The study proposed one cocktail, baloxavir marboxil, natamycin and RU85053, which targets the three viral proteins respectively, 3CL Main protease, papain-like protease and RdRp. The researchers noted that such drug cocktails have proven effective in the treatment of other virally-transmitted diseases, such as HIV. Murugan says that the reliability of their approach was validated by the fact that the screening also identified drugs that are already in clinical trial. Such studies can provide valuable insights regarding why certain drugs were found to be ineffective, the researchers said. For example, the drug hydroxychloroquine was non-effective mainly due to its poor binding affinity towards viral proteins, they said. Other drugs that the study recommended for testing were tivantinib, olaparib, zoliflodacin, golvatinib, sonidegib, regorafenib and PCO-371. The research also provides a listing of multi-targeting drugs such as DB04016, phthalocyanine, tadalafil, which can also be effective in combating the rapidly-mutating coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-scientists-identify-new-potential-drug-treatments-for-covid-19/story-NCn6gp7NvbvIv6r9J4rdWL.html
10-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest: Why agri reforms are hard to sell||As the 1990s began, India found it difficult to pay interests on the $90 billion in foreign loans that had propped up a socialist system, triggering a balance-of-payments emergency. The country then turned to a burst of economic reforms to claw out of the crisis. The Big Bang reforms of 1991 led by then finance minister Manmohan Singh cut some of the world’s highest taxes and tariffs, ended a system of government permits known as licence raj and devalued the currency. The reforms however bypassed India’s agriculture, dominated by heavy subsidies. On Wednesday, a desperate Union government sent out a lengthy set of proposals to farm unions to mollify farmers protesting in thousands at Delhi’s borders against a set of sweeping farm-reform laws, the first attempt to open up the antiquated agriculture sector. Farm unions however have stuck to their demand of scrapping three pro-market agricultural laws they say will hurt their livelihoods, dealing a blow to the Union government’s reformist agenda. Farmers fear losing out to big corporations if private traders get a free-run in deregulated markets. The government says the changes will give farmers greater market access and spur investments. The agriculture sector employs half of all Indians, but adds only 16% to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), meaning far too many people are engaged in agriculture than is required to generate the same levels of farm incomes. Some scholars, such as Ashutosh Varshney of Brown University, say a distinction needs to be made between “mass politics and elite politics” in debates around the “politics of economic reforms”. “So, it is easier to do a stock-market reform or financial reforms because its scope is limited to a certain elite section of the population. But when it comes to hard reforms affecting masses, such as labour reforms or agriculture, these are areas where we will see big challenges,” said KK Kailash, who teaches political science in the University of Hyderabad. The new farm laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and set new rules for contract farming. The government says allowing traders to stock large quantities of food commodities will incentivise them to invest in supply chains and storage space, which is scarce. Lack of storage means farmers often dump produce such as tomatoes and potatoes during oversupply, when prices crash. Concessions offered by the government provide for more oversight of private markets proposed under the new laws. Farmers have come to trust decades-old regulated markets despite studies that show these markets are run by trader cartels who rig prices. These cartels also lend money to farmers, creating interlocked markets that limit farmers’ bargaining power. Catch LIVE Updates of farmers’ protest hereRecent studies show evidence of monopolistic practices in these regulated markets the government now wants to open up to private competition. In December 2010, when onion prices spiraled, a probe by India’s statutory anti-monopoly agency, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), revealed that one firm accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total trading that month in Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest onion market near Nashik in Maharashtra. A 2012 report by the National Council of Applied Economic Research identified collusion as a major hurdle in fair trade, with a handful of traders monopolising almost all big markets. India’s farm trade is commission-based. Licences for all intermediaries — from commission agent, wholesaler, transporter, storage chain owner and even the railway agent — are often held by the same business families, in effect producing oligopolies. Yet, these markets also offer farmers assured minimum prices for staples, shielding them from risks and providing a sense of security because of government control. The new reforms allow corporations to operate with minimal regulations. “The core concerns (are) about removing regulation on traders and companies and thereby removing all protections to farmers offered by the regulation system,” said Kirankumar Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a farm activist opposing the reforms. Despite evidence that the current system of farm trade is highly inefficient, farmers say the very objective of the new reforms is to favour big corporations. “The crux of the matter is that the government’s laws are centered around large corporations which are against the interest of farmers and consumers. Why can’t markets be farmer-led?” said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, a farm activist who took part in the recent talks with the government. Economists attribute India’s impressive economic growth over the years to reforms in industry, currency markets and manufacturing. According to official data, farm sub-sectors, such as horticulture, milk and fishery – where government intervention is low – have grown on average 4-10% annually, compared to a flat growth rate of 1.1% in cereals where government intervention is high. “This clearly indicates that in recent times,liberalised markets are more favourable to agricultural growth,” states a paper authored by researchers at Niti Aayog, the government’s think tank. But some economists argue that reforms that give a big walkover to the private sector will not work in an impoverished agriculture sector. “Agriculture broadly needs a combination of reforms, investments, support prices and subsidies. Emphasis on one over the other will not help,” said K. Mani, a former economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-why-agri-reforms-are-hard-to-sell-to-farmers/story-TttH29JU5SjVwoABKAlYBI.html

My mission is to make it Rs 5 lakh crores in 2 years.”While speaking on the theme, “Reboot to rebound: Stimulating demand and supply side,” Gadkari said that the Central government’s target is to create five crore more jobs in the next five years. “Presently, the MSME sector employs 11 crore people. Our target is to create 5 crore more jobs in the next 5 years.”Further speaking during the event, the Union Minister Gadkari said, “For making Atmanirbhar Bharat, the most important target for the ministries is to make Indian economy strong and for that reason, we need to increase more export at the same time we need to decrease the import.”Last month, Gadkari at Virtual Horasis Asia Meeting had said that Centre is planning to take the MSME contribution to the economic growth from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.“Our target is to take the MSME contribution to the economic growth from 30 per cent to 40 per cent and also increase the MSME export from 48 per cent to 60 per cent. The government is also planning to create 5 crore more jobs from MSME sectors only,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-increase-turnover-of-village-industry-to-rs-5-lakh-cr-in-2-yrs-gadkari/story-fJMJ4CmJXOGsHjtAT5sruK.html
10-12-2020||India||Rajnath Singh’s message at Asean meet aims at China, advocates self-restraint||In a thinly veiled reference to China, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday called on members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and its dialogue partners to exercise self-restraint and avoid actions that complicate the situation. Singh’s remarks, made during a virtual gathering of the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus) that was joined by his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, came against the backdrop of the India-China standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “As we enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region,” Singh said in his address. Singh also took a swipe at Pakistan, without naming the country, for allowing its soil to be used for terrorism directed against India. Describing terrorism as a major scourge for the region and the world, he said “structures that support and sustain terrorism continue to exist, including in India’s neighbourhood” and called for strengthening international mechanisms to jointly fight terror. He emphasised India’s call for an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, peaceful resolutions of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international laws. He reiterated India’s support to freedom of navigation and over-flight for all in international waters in line with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). India has accused China of unilaterally attempting to change the status quo along the LAC since April. Following a clash in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers and caused unspecified Chinese casualties, both countries have mobilised tens of thousands of troops that have dug in along the LAC for the harsh winter. Singh met Wei on the margins of a meeting of defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Moscow in September and there have also been meetings and contacts between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, senior military commanders and diplomats, but the two sides haven’t been able to agree on disengagement on the LAC. ADMM Plus, which includes the 10 members of Asean and its eight dialogue partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US, was formed in 2010 to strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace and development in the region. This annual meeting was chaired this year by Vietnam. Singh appreciated the central role of Asean-led forums, including ADMM Plus, in promoting dialogue for a pluralistic and cooperative security order in Asia amid the “current regional environment with visible strains”. Pointing to the 10th anniversary of ADMM Plus, Singh said field training and table-top exercises help members of the grouping understand each other and maintain peace. “Our ability to collectively respond to challenges in the region based on the fundamentals of freedom, inclusivity and openness will define our future,” he said. “Threats to the rules-based order, maritime security, cyber-related crimes and terrorism...remain the challenges that we need to address as a forum,” he added. ADMM Plus has become a “fulcrum of peace, stability and rules-based order in this region” and India’s concepts of “vasudhaive kutumbakam” or “the whole world is one family” and “sarve bhavantu sukhinah” or “all be at peace” emphasise inclusivity, equality and openness, Singh said. The Asean outlook on the Indo-Pacific underscores the “impetus to cultivate strategic trust and continuously promote Asean centrality in the regional architecture”, and also has much in common with India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), he added. Members of ADMM Plus are major stakeholders in the regional security dynamic and exercises in maritime security, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, counter-terrorism and peacekeeping operations have helped build confidence, he said. “Cyber-security and military medicine are at the forefront of our challenges today. Another notable step has been the adoption of the concept paper on expanding Asean Direct Communication Infrastructure to the Plus countries,” Singh said. ADMM Plus needs to continue its efforts to address threats such as bioterrorism, transnational trafficking and pandemic diseases and members of the grouping should build capacity to address shared security challenges that are increasingly trans-boundary in nature, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avoid-actions-that-complicate-situation-rajnath-tells-asean-defence-ministers-meet/story-tQeAJrNbDxe26uWnv13e8K.html
10-12-2020||India||BJP leader Dilip Ghosh alleges security lapse during party chief JP Nadda’s visit to Bengal||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Dilip Ghosh on Thursday alleged security lapse during party president JP Nadda’s visit to West Bengal. He said he has written to Union home minister Amit Shah and the state administration over the same. Ghosh alleged serious security lapses surrounding Nadda’s programmes on Wednesday. “Today during his different engagement in Kolkata, it was observed that there was serious lapses on security arrangements, purportedly due to negligence and/or casual approach of the State Police Department. At our party office at Hestings, Kolkata, there was a mob of 200 plus with sticks, bamboos etc. demonstrating raising black flags. Some of them climbed on the cars parked outside the office and raised slogans. Police did not intervene to stop them and casually allowed them to come within a close perimeter of Nadda Ji’s vehicle,” Ghosh wrote in a letter.Ghosh alleged that during the whole day’s program, the pilot car provided by the state police did not create a smooth and safe passage for Nadda for travelling from one place to other, adding that his convoy was stopped at many traffic lights, causing serious concern for potential security hazards.“This has also been noticed that there exists complete violation on the part of West Bengal Government to ensure full security arrangements as per Government Protocol which are immediately concerned with the visit of Sri JP Nadda, a Z category of security covered by CRPF,” Ghosh said.On Thursday, there will be a day-long programme at Diamond Harbour. “Our party karyakartas have informed us that tomorrow (Thursday) also the goons of TMC are planning to do big protest in multiple places on the way towards Diamond Harbour from New Town. We have already informed the West Bengal Home Secretary and the SP of the Soth 24 Parganas district to arrange adequate security cover for our National President. Unfortunately the State Police Department is non-committal about this serious aspect,” Ghosh said.Ghosh has requested Shah and the Bengal administration to issue required directives to the state home secretary on the matter of extending and providing adequate security cover during today’s programmes. Nadda is on a two-day tour of West Bengal to participate in various programmes targeted at strengthening the party’s cadre as well as its presence at the booth level.He is expected to camp in Diamond Harbour, another TMC stronghold, adjacent to Kolkata in south Bengal. Diamond Harbour is Abhishek Banerjee’s constituency, who is TMC MP and nephew of the chief minister. The BJP president will address a press conference and also party cadres and will interact with members of the fishermen community.Nadda’s tour is part of his 120-day national tour that is aimed at strengthening the party’s presence across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-dilip-ghosh-alleges-security-lapse-during-party-chief-jp-nadda-s-visit-to-bengal/story-hCwdUqWt4v8Ye3SXYGXUuI.html

The agency has said this is the biggest breakthrough in their probe into the drug case related to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Jumman is known as the “biggest drug dealer” in Mumbai, an NCB official has told ANI.On Wednesday, the agency raided several locations at Milat Nagar in Lokhandwala based on the information given by Rigel Mahakala, who was arrested late on Tuesday night. Rigel Mahakala was linked to Anuj Keshwani who in turn was linked to Kaizan Ibrahi. All three of them are in jail now. In its biggest seizure so far, the NCB on Wednesday recovered five kilograms of malana cream valued around Rs 2.5 crore, ecstasy tablets, a certain amount of opium and Rs 14 lakh in cash. Sheikh is the main supplier of drugs linked to this case, the NCB has said. He apparently sourced malana cream, the most desirable Charas in the world, from Himachal Pradesh. An NCB officials told PTI malana cream grows only in Malana region of Himachal Pradesh and its cost ranges from Rs 40-50 lakh per kg in the international market.Apart from the recovery, the agency has said that it has also found a list of Jumman’s Mumbai clients. Sushant Singh Rajput’s friend Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik were arrested in this case. Both of them are now out on bail. A special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) court has also said that the charges of illicit drugs financing does not apply to Showik.A number of Bollywood personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal have been interrogated by the NCB. Comedian Bharti Singh and her husband Harsh Limbachiyaa were arrested in NCB’s drug probe and were later granted bail. The NCB started its investigation after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which was probing money laundering charges linked to the case, shared some social media chats retrieved from Rhea Chakraborty’s mobile phone, hinting at the alleged use of banned drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-to-produce-drug-kingpin-azam-sheikh-in-court-today-in-its-probe-related-to-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case/story-spdPmxvpz82j22KYt92oKM.html

The Declaration established a set of common basic values both with regard to the view of human beings and to the relationship between the state and the individual. It also set standards for human rights, which take precedence over political, economic, cultural and religious differences. Human rights are rights that states, through international agreements, must guarantee individual people. These rights serve to limit the state’s power over the individual. The theme of Human Rights Day 2020 is to “Recover Better - Stand Up for Human Rights”. This chosen theme is in sync with the Covid pandemic. It focuses on creating equal opportunities for everyone and addressing the failures and disappointments we all were exposed to due to Covid -19. The agenda is to use the day as an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of human rights so as to be able to rebuild the world that we seek, for achieving global solidarity, thus advocating shared humanity across communities. The UN website lists the measures that should be kept in mind while bridging the gaps in human right protection which have been exposed and further fuelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. These include: ending discrimination of any kind, addressing inequalities, encouraging participation and solidarity and promoting sustainable developmentThe aim of this day is to engage the public and the partners of Human Rights as well as the UN family to take transformative action and showcase inspirational practical examples that could contribute in making resilient societies that can recover in a better way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-rights-day-2020-recover-better-stand-up-for-human-rights/story-hEX2ZTQfEHBXAqM4uIdTsN.html

10-12-2020||India||SC allows other courts to deal with BCCI, cricketing associations||The Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted its year-long stay and allowed other courts in the country to also adjudicate issues relating to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), state cricket associations and clubs.In March 2019, the top court had appointed senior advocate PS Narasimha as the amicus curiae and sought his assistance in resolving disputes of the cricketing bodies through meetings and mediation. At that time, the court had restrained all other tribunals and courts from entertaining or proceeding with any matter pertaining to BCCI or any state cricket association till reports on resolution of disputes are submitted by Narasimha.On Wednesday, an SC bench, headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, took note of the relevant reports submitted by the amicus, and said that the restraining order can now be lifted to enable other tribunals and courts to decide the issues within their jurisdiction.The bench thus modified the 2019 order, recording that the amicus has submitted that the process of mediation with various cricketing bodies are over now.In terms of this order, the court also wrapped up more than two dozen applications filed by several bodies, including cricket associations of Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana and Bihar. The bench asked all these applicants to approach the suitable forum for adjudication of their contentions now that the interim order of restraint has been lifted.While dealing with a clutch of other applications, it declined to entertain requests for either reviewing the terms of mediation or setting it aside. The order stated that the court has to repel all attempts at wriggling out of the mediation, undertaken by Narasimha with various bodies.“Mr Narasimha had meetings with representatives of associations, clubs and the committee of administrators (CoA), BCCI. After a series of meetings, disputes between parties in these series of interlocutory applications have been resolved and signed minutes of meetings are also submitted,” pointed the court while refusing to admit pleas for modifications of the terms of settlements.It also noted that the majority of state associations have complied with the Lodha Committee reforms, as accepted by the Supreme Court in 2018, following which elections have also been conducted. The bench said that taking note of these developments, the majority of the pending applications can be disposed of.About other matters which required a hearing in view of possible contests by the opposite side, the bench said it would hear them in the third week of January.The Supreme Court, in a string of orders since 2014, have revamped the BCCI and compelled all recognised cricketing associations in the country to adopt and implement the reforms recommended by Justice Lodha Committee.Its orders had led to ouster of N Srinivasan as BCCI chairperson over conflict of interest following a probe into IPL betting and spot fixing scandal, besides dispensing with the inclusion of ministers and civil servants over 70 years of age as BCCI members.The court also made it mandatory for all state associations to adopt the recommendations by the Lodha Committee to be able to continue as recognised associations with a right to vote in the BCCI polls apart from keep receiving funds from the apex cricketing body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-other-courts-to-deal-with-bcci-cricketing-association/story-BeSDubQ721241VyPLzXn2J.html

Free medicines and ambulance services are also being provided to the agitating farmers. Dr Kanwar Pal Singh, a volunteer associated with United Sikhs NGO, which has set up many such camps, told ANI people mostly complained of fever and sore throat here. “Protesters, however, are taking all precautions here amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said on Thursday.Doctors and volunteers said that many already have existing health problems, for which they need regular medicines and health check-ups. “Our volunteers are available here round the clock. Ambulance service and even surgeons are available here. Two hospitals, within a distance of 1 km, are providing free treatment for minor problems to the protesters,” said a volunteer associated with the NGO. Protesters said the camps were of great help, keeping them healthy even in this stressful environment.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, are protesting the three farm laws that were passed in Parliament in September by voice vote, despite objection by opposition parties.They are the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-50-medical-camps-set-up-for-farmers-at-singhu-border/story-D7sLP7dU2ez4shS2EjfAuJ.html

10-12-2020||India||India’s greenhouse emissions dip with switch to renewables, economic slowdown||India is projected to meet its pre-2020 climate pledge, also called the Cancun pledge, made in 2010. It is also likely to meet and possibly overachieve its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 has said on Wednesday.India, which emits 7.1% of global emissions and has per capita emissions that are 60 % lower than the global average, recorded a fall in emissions growth in 2019. India’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions grew by 1.4% in 2019, lower than the average of 3.3% per year over the last decade according to the report.This slower than expected growth is primarily due to increased hydropower from a record monsoon and weaker economic growth, along with India’s continued growth in renewables, the report said. In comparison, China’s CO2 emissions grew by 3.1% in 2019 to reach a record high compared to growth of 2.4% in GHG emissions on average for the past decade.Also read | Low carbon recovery from Covid-19 slowdown can solve climate crisis: ReportSeveral countries, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America, are projected to miss their Cancun pledges and Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America are set to fall short of their NDCs under the Paris Agreement.India had pledged in 2010 to reduce its emissions intensity of GDP (excluding the agriculture sector) by 20–25% below 2005 levels by 2020 which it has achieved. Further, under NDCs, India has committed to reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 33 to 35% by 2030 over 2005 levels.Overall, despite the global slowdown and reduction in emissions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the world is not on track to meet global warming goals and 2020 is on track to be one of the warmest years on record.Due to the pandemic, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are expected to fall by 7% this year compared to 2019 but the world will still be heading for a temperature rise of over 3 degrees C this century, the report said. A green recovery from the pandemic, however, with investments in sectors that will help curb CO2 emissions can take the world to a 2 degree C rise pathway as defined in the Paris Agreement goals, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report said.For Covid-19 recovery from slowdown, governments are spending at an unprecedented scale the report has found, currently amounting to roughly US$12 trillion globally, or 12% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. Most governments have focused on funding rescue measures to reboot businesses and jobs in their immediate economic response to Covid-19, with only a few including conditions that encourage businesses to decarbonize.India has allocated about 10.1% of 2019 GDP for Covid-19 rescue and recovery measures, according to the report based on data from Oxford Recovery Project which has an overview of total fiscal rescue and recovery measures of G20 members. But most of India’s recovery measures have high carbon effects shows data.“India’s Covid-19-relief package was nearly 10% of its annual GDP, but had no substantial investments impacting the climate. Additional stimulus must focus on recovery and rebuilding, accelerating an energy transition in the power sector, transport, and urban planning. Without this, the likely drop in emissions from the lockdown will rise again without a green recovery. A long-term strategy may be the most convincing and coherent way of articulating to the international community about India’s ongoing development needs (which are unlikely to be exhausted by 2050). It is imperative that the focus remains on not only a ‘green recovery’ but a resilient one that is beneficial over the long-term,” said Abhishek Kaushik, Associate Fellow and Area Convenor, Centre for Global Environment Research at The Energy and Resources Institute.There are large disparities in post-Covid-19 fiscal spending around the world. Fiscal spending of some G20 members is as high as 40% for some members and as low as 1.7% for some. France, Germany, South Korea and the UK have among the highest investments with low carbon effects.The reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 due to Covid-19 is likely to be significantly larger than the 1.2% reduction during the global financial crisis in the late 2000s. But, 2020 is currently on track to be one of the warmest on record, with wildfires, droughts, storms and glacier melt only intensifying. A fall of 7% in CO2 emissions this year means only a 0.01 degree C reduction of global warming by 2050.On the brighter side, the report says there is scope for course correction now. Investing in zero emission technologies and infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel subsidies, not building any more coal plants, promoting nature-based solutions like large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation could put emissions in 2030 at 44 GtCO2e which would mean a 66% chance of keeping global temperature rise to below 2 degree C compared to pre-industrial levels.In addition, the ambition of various nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will have to be tripled to meet the 2 degree C target and increased by at least 5 times to meet the 1.5 degree C goal (threshold that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet). The current pledges under the Paris Agreement are inadequate and could only limit global temperature rise to 3.2 degree C, the report has warned.The report has estimated that following the initial dip in CO2 emissions, there could be a rebound effect in many countries in order to bounce back from the Covid-19 induced slowdown. Some countries could rollback climate policies as part of covid 19 responses, then the decrease in global emissions by 2030 could be significantly smaller at around 1.5 GtCO2e or may actually increase by around 1 GtCO2e compared with the pre-covid 19 current policies scenario.“The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director. “However, UNEP’s Emissions Gap report shows that a green pandemic recovery can take a huge slice out of greenhouse gas emissions and help slow climate change. I urge governments to back a green recovery in the next stage of Covid 19 fiscal interventions and raise significantly their climate ambitions in 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-greenhouse-emissions-dip-with-switch-to-renewables-economic-slowdown/story-Xd8f8Fb1Z6jBRLqTZ62pFL.html
10-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest enters 15th day, ‘No rift among our unions,’ say protesters||The ongoing farmers’ protests which laid a siege to the national Capital entered its 15th day on Thursday, a day after the farmers rejected Centre’s final proposal of amendments to the three farm laws and announced a bigger movement. The stalemate is likely to continue as there is no further meeting scheduled between farmers and the Centre. More protesters will be joining the agitating farmers from today onwards and, according to their plan, the Delhi-Jaipur highway will be blocked by December 12. On December 14, there will be a nationwide protest.With the protest now facing a dead end, with no communication from the Centre after the farmers rejected its proposal, there are speculations of a rift among farmer unions which they have dismissed. Over 30 unions of farmers are spearheading the protest and the rumours of a division started doing the rounds on the day the union leaders were called for a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. It was decided that the meeting would take place at Shah’s residence and accordingly a few leaders reached his residence at the given time. But later the meeting was shifted to Indian Council of Agriculture Research. Two leaders reportedly had walked out of the meeting over the confusion but later joined. “We take decisions unanimously. It is about consensus and not majority...it cannot be that some people are agreeing to it and others are not. If all unions say the laws should be scrapped, that’s our decision...There is no question of having a personal opinion,” Shiv Kumar said dismissing speculations of a rift.“In all five meetings with the farmer unions, the government held marathon discussions on the same points (that figured in the proposal). Finally, we asked them (government) to answer in ‘yes or no’…whether they want to repeal the three new laws and guarantee MSP or not?” Kakka said.Where does the protest stand now?Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Jagmohan Singh said farmer leaders are open to continuing the dialogue. “We will come for the meeting if the government invites, but our demand should be met. It has become a mass movement. We cannot return to our villages with empty hands,” he said. The farmers may send a rejoinder to the Centre.Agriculture minister Narendra Tomar is likely to make an appeal to the farmers to end their agitation and work with the government, ANI said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-enters-15th-day-no-difference-among-our-unions-say-protesters/story-ALTAghLu1F1QZVfNP1DNcN.html

At least two FIRs have been filed. A BJP worker, Ulen Roy, was killed with a shotgun during a pitched battle between BJP workers and policemen who stopped two processions from moving towards Uttar Kanya, the secretariat in north Bengal. The state police said in a statement on Tuesday that Roy was killed with a shotgun that the police do not use and alleged that people in the rally were carrying firearms to incite violence. On Wednesday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and head of the party’s national information and technology cell, Amita Malviya, posted videos showing a policeman carrying a shotgun and said it nullified the state’s claim. However, the location of the recording of the video was not clear. The policeman was also not seen firing the weapon. None of the senior police officers in Siliguri or Jalpaiguri talked to the media on the FIRs. Officers of the New Jalpaiguri police station, where the FIRs were lodged, were not ready to mention the sections of the IPC under which charges were filed. They only said that BJP leaders named in the FIRs include Vijayvargiya, state president Dilip Ghosh, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) national president Tejasvi Surya the BJYM state president Saumitra Khan.

A total of 111 candidates are in fray in the 19 constituencies in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts. Voting took place in 21 BTC constituencies in Baksa and Udalguri districts in the first phase of polling held on Monday. Voting started at 7:30 am and will continue till 4:30 pm. Long queues of voters were seen outside most polling stations since early morning prior to the start of voting. A total of 10.23 lakh voters will exercise their vote on Thursday. “Security arrangements are in place to ensure smooth polling and we expect voting to take place without any hiccups,” Bhaskar Phukan, deputy commissioner of Kokrajhar, said. “As per Covid-19 protocols, face masks and sanitisers have been given to poll personnel and also for distribution among voters, if needed. Social distancing will also be maintained during polling,” he added. Polling for the first phase on Monday had passed peacefully with over 77% voting reported in Baksa and Udalguri districts. This is the first election being held in Assam since Covid-19 pandemic started. The polls were scheduled to be held in April but had to be postponed because of the pandemic and all the four districts under the BTC were placed under governor’s rule. Assembly polls in Assam are due in March-April next year and the BTC polls are being viewed as a semi-final contest among the parties.

Pfizer’s application was not taken up for deliberation on Wednesday as the company sought more time.Here are the latest updates:1. The Centre will start sending additional cold storage equipment to states and union territories from tomorrow, as its preparation for vaccination drive has already begun.2. Serum Institute of India now will have to submit an updated safety data of phases 2 and 3 clinical trials in the country. The expert committee has also sought the immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK along with the UK regulator’s assessment before the grant of the authorisation.3. Bharat Biotech will have to submit the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial in the country.4. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given conditional approval for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of India’s first mRNA Covid-19 vaccine candidate -- HGCO19 -- being developed by Gennova Biopharmaceuticals.5. Pfizer has said it will have differential pricing on its COVID-19 vaccine for different countries, as the company aims to make the vaccine available across the world.6. Britain’s medicine regulator has advised that people with a history of significant allergic reactions do not get Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine after two people reported adverse effects on the first day of roll-out.7. However, it’s not yet a cause for worry, scientists have said. Many people can be sensitive to components in the shot, like gelatin or egg protein, or to the vaccine itself. People with egg allergies are sometimes advised not to get the flu shot, since that vaccine is mostly grown in chicken eggs, experts said.8. Pentagon will begin Covid-19 vaccinations on small scale at 16 defence sites in the United States and abroad.9. Israel will start vaccinating its people from December 27. It has received the first shipment of Pfizer vaccine doses.10. Canada’s health regulator on Wednesday approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. It will receive up to 249,000 doses this month and 4 million doses of the vaccine by March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-data-india-seeks-from-serum-institute-bharat-biotech-canada-s-approval-to-pfizer-10-points/story-cXqiVKhG8XcHSmMcCCswtI.html

The ADMM-PLUS is a platform for ASEAN and its eight dialogue partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States (collectively referred to as plus countries), to strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace, stability, and development in the region.  As we enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh https://t.co/nshwTkVYurSingh during his address further pointed out that the collective achievement in the past decade has been remarkable in advancing multilateral cooperation through strategic dialogue and practical security cooperation. “ADMM has grown in the last decade to become the fulcrum of peace, stability and rules-based order in this region,” he said adding that exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region. In 2019, Singh had attended the meeting in Bangkok and the opening ceremony of Defence and Security 2019 Exhibition. Since 2017, the ADMM-PLUS has been meeting annually to allow enhanced dialogue and cooperation among ASEAN and the PLUS nations amid an increasingly challenging regional security environment.

10-12-2020||India||No Covid-19 posters outside homes: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed all states and Union territories (UTs) not to put up home isolation posters outside houses of Covid-19 patients unless authorities under the disaster management law issue specific directions on a case-by-case basis. In what may put an end to the practice across states, the top court issued its order after underscoring that the central government never obligated or recommended that states and UTs paste such posters or other signage outside the residences of those who tested positive for Covid-19. The top court bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, reproduced the Centre’s November 19 letter to states and UTs, which mandated them to strictly comply with the guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) for Covi d-19-positive patients under home isolation. This letter emphasised on the absence of there being any requirement of pasting of posters, and called for “scrupulous” adherence to the norms. Taking on record this letter, the bench said in its order: “We only observe that no state or Union territory is required to paste posters outside the residence of Covid-19 positive persons, as of now.” The bench, which also included justices RS Reddy and MR Shah, added that such measures can be taken only after the authorities empowered under the Disaster Management Act, 2015, prescribe this in certain specific instances. The court order fortifies the central government’s recent communication to the states and UTs about various concerns over affixing home isolation and Covid-19 positive posters. While the November 19 letter just talked about the absence of any obligation to put up such posters, the court order is expected to go a longer way in mitigating apprehensions of those who might be reluctant to come forward and get tested fearing social stigma due to the pictorial warnings. Citing the decision by the governments in Delhi and Punjab to stop this practice, the bench had last month said the central government should come up with guidelines dealing with the matter for the entire country. Subsequently, the letter dated November 19 was sent to all states and UTs, stating: “MoHFW Guidelines do not contain any instructions or guidance regarding affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found Covid-positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-posters-outside-homes-supreme-court/story-SnhZDoAmHmT8Ind4IPwdPN.html

Mohiuddin was once tipped to be the chief minister candidate during PDP-Congress coalition government in J&K. He is facing a tough contest from the PAGD (People’s alliance for Gupkar declaration) candidate, Shaukat Ali Khan, who is from Sajjad Lone’s Peoples’ Conference.On Tuesday night, police had stopped and questioned a close relative of Mohiudin near LoC following allegations that he was distributing money among the voters at Kamalkote.Sajjad Lone accused the administration of trying to hush up a case of money distribution.“Attempts to hush up a case involving distribution of money in Parenpeela, URI, DDC constituency. The constituency goes to polls tomorrow. The L-G has a moral duty to ascertain who all r(are) behind attempts to hush up the case,” Sajjad Lone tweeted late on Tuesday night.Police, however, denied the allegations.“A news is making the rounds in the media about the arrest of a close relative of a DDC candidate in Uri along with some government employees. However, routine nakas viz a viz security beef up and for checking of violation of model code of conduct were established at many places along the length and breadth of Paranpilla DDC constituency.

10-12-2020||India||Youth Congress scraps internal polls for president selection||The youth wing of the Congress has scrapped the internal elections that were started in 2008 by former president Rahul Gandhi in an effort to bring internal democracy into the organisation, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. The Youth Congress has abolished the electoral-college and secret ballot methods and devised a new format that is based on membership enrolment to elect its state unit chiefs, one of the functionaries said. According to the new selection method launched in Himachal Pradesh recently, a person who enrols maximum numbers of members will be eligible to become a Youth Congress president for the state. The top three candidates with maximum enrolment will be called for an interview and the final selection will be based on ideology and previous organisational work, according to the Youth Congress website. The other posts will be allocated in the sequence of members enrolled, it added. In Himachal Pradesh, three candidates – Nigam Bhandari, Yadopati Thakur and Amit Pathania – were shortlisted for the final selection. Bhandari, who had enrolled 39,796 members, was appointed the president of the Himachal chapter, while Thakur, with the enrolment of 37,665 members, bagged the post of working president. With 5,968 enrolments, Pathania was named the state vice-president. The posts of general secretaries in open and reserved categories were filled accordingly. The same model will be adopted in the upcoming selection process in Gujarat, Telangana and Mumbai, the functionary quoted above said on the condition of anonymity. However, elections to the posts in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh will be held as per the old format given that the process in these states had started some months ago, the functionary added.The new changes came into being following a series of complaints to Rahul Gandhi by senior Congress functionaries and other leaders regarding the anomalies in the internal election process in the Youth Congress. Some of these leaders had also repeatedly raised the matter with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. A second Congress functionary, who did not want to be named, said the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest decision-making body of the party, will review this model in January-February next year and take a final call on the selection process to be adopted in the youth wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-congress-scraps-internal-polls-for-president-selection/story-KTBrUlaG5nsf6gG7TzfBTN.html
10-12-2020||India||Evidence ignored to appease vote bank, claims new book||A trail of evidence available months before the May 1991 assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was not seriously investigated by the local administration to mollify a section of the Tamil vote bank that sympathised with the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a book by the lead investigator in the case has claimed.The book, Khaki In Dust Storm, is written by former Indian Police Services (IPS) officer Amod Kanth. He served as the then deputy inspector general of police of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which investigated the assassination of 46-year-old Gandhi in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur town in May 21, 1991 by LTTE extremists. Four of Gandhi’s assassins are on death row. In the book, Kanth said that a year before Gandhi’s assassination, another similar murder of a political leader held many crucial clues. Kandasami Padmanabha, a Sri Lankan Tamil leader who was a rival of LTTE chief V Prabhakaran, were murdered, along with 12 associates, on June 15, 1990. The type of explosives used and modus operandi was almost the same in the two killings, the book claimed. An eyewitness who saw the killer -- a man known as one-eyed Sivarasan -- informed the police but nothing happened.“It was believed at that time that the party in power did not pursue the Padmanabha case and other terror attacks in right earnest to protect Tamil vote bank before 1991 Lok Sabha elections,” Kanth said. At the time of Padmanabha’s killing, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was in power in Tamil Nadu but the government was dismissed in January 1991 and President’s Rule was imposed in the state. DMK MP and spokesperson TKS Elangovan rejected the claims in Kanth’s book. “We put pressure on the Rajiv Gandhi government to implement the 13th Amendment. When (Indian) peacekeeping forces were sent to Sri Lanka and they killed Tamils, our leader (Karunanidhi) did not receive them when they came back because of the atrocities against Tamils,” he said. The 13th Amendment to the constitution of Sri Lanka is an outcome of the Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987 between Rajiv Gandhi and then Lankan president JR Jayawardene during the civil war. The legislation provides for devolution of powers to the Tamil community by creating provincial councils in the island nation. For decades, the Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka has been an emotive and electorally important issue in Tamil Nadu, which goes to the polls early next year. In 1987, the Indian government sent peacekeeping forces to Sri Lanka, which was in the middle of a civil war between the Tamil-controlled northern provinces, headquartered at Jaffna, and the Sri Lankan government. They were withdrawn in 1989-1990. After murdering Padmanabha, Sivarasan escaped to Sri Lanka on a fishing boat and returned in April 1991 with nine accomplices -- including Gandhi’s assassin Dhanu -- the book said. Kanth said the eyewitness Thomas immediately identified Sivarasan when he was shown pictures taken by Haribabu, hired by Sivarasan to capture Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, thereby linking the two killings, 11 months apart. “Surprisingly, even a series of terrorist crimes that seriously disturbed the peace and law and order of Tamil Nadu failed to awaken the investigators of the state police from their stupor and make them take up the openly known cases like Padmanabha’s assassination. And, sadly enough, between the investigative wings of Tamil Nadu police and Intelligence agencies, everyone knew that the series of bomb blasts were orchestrated by LTTE. They also knew about the identities and movement of certain perpetrators, who got exposed as being closely concerned to Rajiv Gandhi assassination,” the book read. “The LTTE feared that Rajiv Gandhi will become the prime minister again and he may back the Sinhalese Sri Lankan government, and therefore, decided to kill him. All was on basis of presumption,” added Kanth in the book. Sivarasan, who allegedly planned Gandhi’s assassination, died by suicide on August 19, 1991 near Bengaluru before the CBI’s investigating team could catch him.  The book also talks about the Delhi Police’s handling of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots after killing of then prime minister Indira Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evidence-ignored-to-appease-vote-bank-claims-new-book/story-0VDh2TMQ07Vf0Ajzk5yE3N.html
10-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest to intensify ahead of Dec 14; Stalemate continues as talks fail||Farmers have been protesting against the Central government’s three agricultural reforms for the last 15 days. Several rounds of talks have been held between leaders of farmer groups and union ministers, but they have failed to reach a logical conclusion. The sixth round of talks which was supposed to be held on Wednesday got cancelled but the two sides maintained they were open for dialogue. The leaders further rejected the Centre’s proposal to amend the new reforms and added they would intensify their protest by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra expressways by Saturday, and further escalating it to a countrywide protest on December 14.Here are the latest updates on the ongoing farm stir:1. Union agricultural minister Narendra Singh Tomar met home minister Amit Shah to discuss the next course of action after representatives of farmer groups rejected the Centre’s proposal to amend the new farm reforms, according to news agency PTI. The Centre offered to amend 7-8 issues, including providing a written assurance for the minimum support price (MSP) policy.2. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) asked the Narendra Modi-led government’s ‘stop playing games’ with farmers and withdraw the laws ‘immediately and unconditionally’. A former ally of the BJP, the SAD added that Centre’s proposals to amend the three laws were nothing but delaying and diversionary tactics and tricks which have rightly been rejected by the farmers.3. Leaders of opposition parties met President Ramnath Kovind on Wednesday and sought removal of the farm laws. The five-member delegation comprised NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, CPI general secretary D Raja, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and TKS Elangovan of the DMK. Rahul Gandhi after the meet said that the laws were passed without any discussion or conversation with the opposition parties or with farmers adding that farmers would not relent and continue their protests until the laws are taken back.4. Union minister of state for food and public distribution Raosaheb Danve claimed the ongoing agitation against the reforms was backed by China and Pakistan. “The farmers’ agitation that is taking place in Delhi is not that of farmers. The Central government is ready to spend for the benefit of our farmers. Countries like China and Pakistan have a hand behind these protests,” Danve said while addressing a gathering.5. Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala met protesting farmers at Tikri border on Wednesday and said the entire country stands with them against the Centre’s new reforms. Selja, who was a former Union minister alleged the BJP govt neither heard the opposition’s nor the farmers’ voice and ‘imposed these black laws on the peasants’.6. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said the government was sensitive towards the concerns for farmers and expressed hopes that ongoing deliberations with them, which he termed a ‘work in progress’, would yield results soon. He added that several rounds of talks were held with the farmers regarding the reforms and the Centre was keen to resolve their issues.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-to-intensify-ahead-of-dec-14-stalemate-continues-as-talks-fail/story-NM4eBECRg0WeSAnavtdb5K.html
10-12-2020||India||BJP steps in to resolve infighting in Tripura||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) central leadership has stepped in to iron out differences between Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb and a section of party functionaries, and asked him not to hold a public meeting next week to seek the “people’s mandate” on whether he should continue as CM. A person aware of the developments said the party is concerned that the ongoing hostility between Deb and senior state leaders, including BJP legislator and former Congress leader Sudip Roy Barman, could adversely impact the party’s performance in the 2023 assembly elections and weaken its hold on the erstwhile Left bastion. The schism in the BJP’s state unit was evident earlier this week, when a section of party leaders raised slogans against the CM during the visit of Vinod Sonkar, the new state in charge. Though the CM’s team blames the Left cadre, Deb later said he would seek the people’s mandate on continuing in his post. “I’ll go to Vivekananda Maidan on December 13 and ask people of Tripura to tell me whether I should stay as CM. If people don’t support me, I’ll inform the party high command,” Deb told reporters after slogans of “Biplab Hatao, BJP Bachao” (remove Biplab, save the BJP) were raised during Sonkar’s visit. Sonkar, meanwhile, said he and Deb spoke to BJP chief JP Nadda, and the CM should continue to serve the people. Amid speculation that the CM could be replaced, a second functionary said the central leadership “will not take a hurried decision”. Differences in the unit have been exacerbated by disagreements between Deb and Barman, who claims to have support of 20 MLAs (in the 60-member assembly) in seeking a change in leadership due to Deb’s “administrative and governance deficiencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-steps-in-to-resolve-infighting-in-tripura/story-KfIWtsZz2Mdyia2zR76SJM.html

The prime minister will deliver his address on the occasion at 2.15pm, they said. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had earlier said, “The existing temple of democracy is completing 100 years... It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that the new one will be built by our own people as a prime example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.” “The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of Independence (2022), Parliament session will be held in the new building,” he said. The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said.All you need to know about the new Parliament building: 1. The existing building is a British-era structure, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi, according to a press release. 2. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. 3. The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space, the release added.4. In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The Lok Sabha chamber will have an option to increase its sitting capacity to 1,224 members during joint sessions. This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.5. In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament building. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project. 6. The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.7. The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has twelve gates.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-new-parliament-building-all-you-need-to-know/story-vd8gpA7SBK5HUZKRYiAgMO.html
10-12-2020||India||IAF raises objections to Netflix trailer||The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday objected to a trailer of an upcoming film starring veteran actor Anil Kapoor and director Anurag Kashyap, asking for certain scenes to be deleted. The trailer of the film AK vs AK that streaming platform Netflix calls its “first mockumentary drama’’ shows Kapoor wearing an Indian Air Force uniform using expletives in an apparent parody of Kashyap’s style of edgy films such as Gangs of Wasseypur.While the trailer of the film directed by Vikramaditya Motwane was released on Monday, the Indian Air Force’s Twitter handle tweeted on Wednesday: “The IAF uniform in this video is inaccurately donned & the language used is inappropriate. This does not conform to the behavioural norms of those in the Armed Forces of India. The related scenes need to be withdrawn.’’ The film is due for release on Christmas eve.When contacted, an official of the IAF told Hindustan Times that they came across the clip as part of their routine work of scanning social media for any references to the force. “You can do satire but you cannot do that while wearing an Indian Air Force uniform,’’ said the official who did not wish to be named in this report.This is the second time in recent months that the IAF has expressed displeasure over Netflix content. Its objections over the Janhvi Kapoor film Gunjan Saxena which depicted gender discrimination that a woman pilot had to experience is already being contested in court. The IAF official did not rule out taking legal action against AK vs AK as well.Hours later, Anil Kapoor, 63, tweeted an apology in a video statement. “It has come to my attention that my trailer has offended some people,’’ said the Slumdog Millionaire actor. “I want to sincerely offer my humble apologies for unintentionally hurting anyone’s sentiments.”While a Netflix spokesperson refused to comment, the platform clarified its position on Twitter. “AK vs AK is a film in which Anil Kapoor and his co-stars are playing themselves as actors. At no point does the film represent the Indian Air Force or our Armed Forces. We have nothing but the highest respect for the brave people protecting our nation,’’ said the tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-raises-objections-to-netflix-trailer/story-UY2mQC3uCz4T8mydDUw8zM.html

The people of the state, the Congress party, and the state government stand with the chief minister,” the statement quoted Channi. He further said that the Punjab Government, led by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already passed four bills in the assembly to nullify the centre’s laws and the BJP government in the centre was not able to digest the historic bills.“History reveals that Capt Amarinder Singh always stands rock solid with the people of Punjab and even resigned from Lok Sabha for the state’s interest or termination of water agreement bills,” he added. This comes amid the mass agitation taking place in and around the national capital. Farmers from across the country, mostly from Punjab and other northern states, are protesting three of the Centre’s farm laws that were passed in Parliament on September by voice vote, despite objection by opposition parties.The farmers are protesting against the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-attempting-to-sabotage-farmers-protest-alleges-punjab-minister-charanjit-channi/story-PbrUrtzkVCQ1jgHu8dicRL.html

10-12-2020||India||China, Pakistan behind farmers’ protest: Union minister Danve||Union minister Raosaheb Danve on Wednesday claimed that China and Pakistan were behind the ongoing protests by farmers, who are seeking repeal of three new farm laws.He also alleged that Muslims were earlier misled over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but as those efforts did not succeed, now farmers were being told that they will face losses due to the new laws.Danve was speaking at the inauguration of a health centre at Kolte Takli in Badnapur taluka of Maharashtra’s Jalna district.“The agitation that is going on is not that of farmers. China and Pakistan have a hand behind this. Muslims in this country were incited first. What was said (to them)? That NRC is coming, CAA is coming and Muslims will have to leave this country in six months. Did a single Muslim leave? “Those efforts didn’t succeed and now farmers are being told that they will face losses. This is the conspiracy of other countries,” Danve said.The minister, however, did not elaborate on what basis he claimed that the two neighbouring countries are behind the farmers’ protests.“The government is buying wheat at Rs 24 and rice at Rs 34 per kg and giving it to people at Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kg respectively. The government is spending Rs 1.75 lakh crore on the subsidy for this. The government is spending money for the welfare of farmers,” the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs said.“These initiatives by the central government show that it is ready to spend money for farmers, but others don’t like it,” the BJP leader claimed.Danve said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the prime minister of farmers and none of his decisions would be against farmers.The Shiv Sena slammed Danve for dragging China and Pakistan in the farmers’ stir, saying the BJPleaders are out of their senses.Sena spokesperson and former Union minister Arvind Sawant told PTI that the BJP leaders are out of their senses because they lost power in Maharashtra.“They don’t know what they are speaking,” the Sena leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pakistan-behind-farmers-protest-union-minister-danve/story-tOJWJn9H1SBNvPolwSW9yM.html
10-12-2020||India||4,800 ineligible people in updated NRC, HC informed||Nearly 4,800 ineligible persons got included in the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam, says an affidavit filed in the Gauhati high court, according to court documents.The affidavit was filed this week by the office of the Assam state coordinator for NRC in the court of justices Manojit Bhuyan and Soumitra Saikia in connection with a petition. According to the affidavit, the NRC office detected 4,795 ineligible persons whose names got included in the list while verifying details of 10,199 persons after the updated list was released in August last year. These persons included doubtful (D) voters, declared foreigners, persons against whom cases are pending in foreigners’ tribunals and their family members — all categories which were to be excluded from the updated NRC. Similarly, among the 10,199 persons whose details were verified, it was found that names of 5,404 persons which should have got included in the NRC didn’t find themselves in the list. In October this year, the high court had asked the NRC state coordinator to file a comprehensive affidavit on how some ineligible persons managed to get included in the final list. The court was hearing a petition by Rahima Begam, a resident of Mukalmua in Nalbari district, who had challenged a 2019 order of a foreigners’ tribunal that had declared her a foreigner. But despite the tribunal’s order, Begam’s name was in the NRC list, which aimed to weed out illegal foreigners. The court noted that the present case was of “great importance” and was not a “solitary instance” and stressed that insertions of names of ineligible persons in the NRC list was “against the law”. The updated NRC released in August last year had excluded over 1.9 million of the 33 million people who had applied to be included in the list that sought to identify genuine Indian citizens in Assam and weed out illegal immigrants. The exercise, which involved updation of a similar list in 1951, was done following a Supreme Court order and was conducted under its supervision. Soon after its release, almost all political parties and organisations in the state denounced the list, saying it included names of ineligible persons and left out many genuine citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-800-ineligible-people-in-updated-nrc-hc-informed/story-ADRighYPvxH7Y8sfxmelUM.html
10-12-2020||India||New Parliament complex will cater to future needs||Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach. The mission of India has been to “guide humanity”, Shri Swami Vivekananda rightly said. India is striving hard to achieve the objective of social welfare through its parliamentary democracy. Today is a historic day when the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji would be laying the foundation stone of the ultra-modern triangular Parliament building having seating capacity of 1,224 MPs sitting together, a symbol of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” and “temple of democracy” for supplementing the infrastructure of the existing iconic circular Parliament House designed by architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker in 1912-13, based on the Chausath Yogini temple, Morena, Madya Pradesh, one of the oldest heritage sites in India, inaugurated in the year 1927. It is expected that this new building will be completed before Winter Session 2022, with its full grandeur as “har Bhartiya ka swabhiman” epitomising “Ek bharat shreshtha Bharat”.Since long, there has been a need for addressing severe structural constraints of the existing Parliament House building, more vividly realised during the last Monsoon Session of Parliament held in the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic. Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Central Hall have seating capacities of 552, 245 and 436 respectively, with no facility of desk space before most of the seats. The proposed new Parliament building is being designed to cater to the present as well as future needs of digitisation, providing for adequate seating space in both Houses, and for joint sittings. Further, for meeting the future demand of possible expansion of strengths of the Houses of Parliament with delimitation in 2026, the new building would provide seating capacities of 888 and 384 members for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha respectively, befitting the largest democracy of the world of 1.3 billion people. We all know that the Constitution is a living and dynamic organism which is supreme. The Constitution is what it is, and not what the Supreme Court says or Parliament wishes it to be. The judiciary, executive and legislature are all creatures of the Constitution; their powers and functions are defined and delimited by the Constitution. At this historic occasion, I would like to remind all legislators and the public at large through them about certain ideas recently floated by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on November 26 before the 80th Conference of Presiding Officers of all Legislatures in India to have serious thought and action thereon in public interest. 1. We all know that the language of our laws, rules and regulations is quite difficult to be understood by people of common prudence. Complaints about complexity are as old as the law itself, and technical language is often blamed for baffling and excluding the lay person. In many parts of the world, plain English movement is catching up. In Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States – and many other countries – the language of the law is being simplified. In India we are yet to begin. In public interest, there is the need for taking concerted steps for introducing drafting of laws/rules regulations, etc in a simple and lucid language which can be easily understood.2. The central government is moving to repeal archaic laws that bloat up statute books, occasionally conflict with other laws, and may hinder governance and growth. Lawmaking is the routine business of legislatures, and review for possible repeal should also happen routinely. If a review system were in place, our statute books would be slimmer. To achieve this objective, more than 1,486 Acts/statutes at the Union level have so far been repealed by Parliament so as to make statute book slim. These steps are required to be taken in all states so that number of laws on the statue book are brought to the bare minimum. 3. Recently, at the central level, sunset clause has been introduced in amending laws [The Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act,2020] and it is also being considered for inclusion in Appropriation Acts and other laws in appropriate manner. Sunset clauses should invariably be incorporated in all amending laws because as per section 6A of the General Clauses Act,1897, the amending law merges with the parent law on enactment and repeal of such amending law does not affect continuance of its provisions. I would also like to suggest the incorporation of sunset clause in amending laws, expiring laws and Appropriation Acts in all states so that no procedural requirement of their formal repealing from statute book is required.4. The PM also put emphasis on digitisation of all legislatures in India including two Houses of Parliament by adopting a single platform with central and individual dashboards: National e-Vidhan Application under the Digital India Programme. It is a great opportunity for Parliament to fully switch to the digital platform before Winter Session 2022 when their new chambers would be ready for use. The government has already dedicated two mission mode projects in the name of “e-Vidhan” for state legislatures and “e-Sansad” for two Houses of Parliament under the Digital India Programme.There is also a need for a considered debate on the idea of having provisions for a constructive no-confidence motion so as to avoid superfluously moving of no-confidence motions in Indian legislatures. An appropriate provision in the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of legislatures may be incorporated so as to ensure stability and good governance by providing for constructive confidence/no-confidence motions like that of Germany. In Germany, as per Article 67 of the Constitution under constructive no-confidence, alternative arrangement is required to be suggested. Under this mechanism if majority of a government comes under a test, besides no confidence in the existing government, confidence in the alternative government is sought in the elected House.Let us again commit ourselves to the service of the last man in the row through our cherished democratic values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parliament-complex-will-cater-to-future-needs/story-YTB10CNWugXRVS9123hfLI.html
10-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India’s drugs regulator met on Wednesday to consider applications by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for approval of the Covid-19 vaccines developed by them — the first on the basis of trial data of Phase 3 trials conducted outside India, and the second on Phase 1/2 trials conducted in India.The vaccine developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and made locally by SII will likely be India’s first line of defence against a disease that, till Tuesday night, had infected 9.7 million people and killed 141,415 in the country. On Tuesday, The Lancet published a peer reviewed paper detailing the findings of trials showing the vaccine’s efficacy and safety. Given this vaccine’s importance to India, it makes sense to take a close look at this. Neither Moderna, nor Pfizer/BioNTech has published a peer-reviewed paper on the findings of the Phase 3 trials of their vaccines. The UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last week and started its vaccination drive on Tuesday. The UK will also likely approve the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine shortly. The US FDA indicated on Tuesday that it would likely approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine soon. As for the AstraZeneca/Oxford one, confusion surrounding the results of its own Phase 3 trials will probably mean that the US FDA awaits the results of an ongoing Phase 3 trial in the US before signing off on it. The paper published in The Lancet combines the results of four trials — a Phase1/2 one in the UK; a Phase 2/3 one also in the UK; a Phase 3 one in Brazil; and a Phase 1/2 one in South Africa — to show the vaccine’s safety. Of the around 23,700 people covered in these studies, three developed adverse effects, including one who developed transverse myelitis, a neurological disorder that involves the inflammation of the spinal cord. The trials were halted because of this, but later allowed to resume. So far, so good. The efficacy bit is more complex. This is based on two of the four trials listed above — the Phase 2/3 one in the UK and the Phase 3 one in Brazil. Together, these involved around 11,600 people. It is irregular to combine two trials for the purpose of analysis of efficacy, but it can be done. It is also irregular to combine two trials with different protocols — the placebo used in one was saline and in another a meningitis vaccine. And finally, one of the studies, the UK one, involved a subset of people who were given a smaller first dose (by mistake), and then a very late booster second dose (almost three months later in most cases). This mistake was then written into the revised trial protocol; all the participants in this subset were 18-55 years old. It is in this (much smaller) subset that the vaccine was 90% effective.There were two other subsets in the UK leg of the study — 18- to 55-year-olds who were given two standard doses; and people between the ages of 56 and 69, who were given two standard doses. The results of these were combined with those of the Brazil study, covering health workers and those with a high risk of being exposed to the infection, and all older than 18. These people were given two standard doses, 12 weeks apart. It is the combined reading of these two subsets of the UK study and the Brazilian study that showed that the vaccine is 62% effective in preventing infections. Since the trials are still ongoing, these results are interim, but it is on their basis that the UK, and India, will grant the vaccine approval. SII is conducting its own Phase 3 trials of the vaccine, but that data hasn’t been released yet. A 62% efficacy level exceeds the 50% floor set by the US FDA and would have likely been cheered in any other context other than the one in which the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine trial results were announced — in the wake of announcements by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that showed a 95% effectiveness of their own vaccine candidates. But what the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine lacks in effectiveness it makes up for in terms of cost and ease of storage and transportation (it doesn’t require the sub-zero temperatures of the other two).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-2rPumMppWaQdbDlCXmhkgM.html
10-12-2020||India||India may wait for UK nod before Oxford vaccine call||India may need to wait till authorities in the United Kingdom clear the coronavirus vaccine developed by University of Oxford and AstraZeneca as experts from India’s drug regulators sought this data before proceeding with an assessment of their own, according to details of discussions at the first meeting to review options for the country.The vaccine candidate, being manufactured and tested in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), is among three that have applied for an emergency approval. The others include Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine that last week became the first to be approved following late-stage trials anywhere in the world, and an indigenously developed shot called Covaxin by Hyderabad’s Bharat Biotech.“After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should submit the following data/information for further review: 1. Updated safety data of the Phase II/III clinical trial in the country; 2. Immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in UK and India; (and) 3. The outcome of the assessment of UK-MHRA for grant of EUA (emergency use authorisation)”, according to recommendations by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)’s Subject Expert Committee (SEC). HT has seen the document. The SEC’s assessments will be sent as recommendations to the CDSCO, which will take the final call.The committee also asked Bharat Biotech, which presented Phase I/2 data, to present data from its Phase 3 trials. “After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase III clinical trial in the country for further consideration,” the committee recommended.Wednesday’s meeting marks the formal beginning of assessments of Covid-19 vaccine candidates that may have derived enough data to judge its safety and efficacy. This data is usually available only in Phase 3 studies and once enough infections are recorded to reach a particular checkpoint.At present, Bharat Biotech’s trial is far from this milestone – its enrolment began on November 11 and protective antibodies develop only 42 days from the date of the first shot.The third manufacturer, Pfizer, sought more time to appear before the committee. Pfizer’s vaccine candidate, developed in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech, was approved by UK’s MHRA last week. But on Wednesday, health authorities in the UK advised caution after two people given the dose developed non-serious allergic reactions. “Pfizer sought and was granted some more time before it could make a presentation before the committee. The other two manufacturers explained the data gathered so far and were asked to provide some additional information, which they have promised to submit,” said an official from the health ministry. A second official in the government, who asked not to be named, said Pfizer has been told they can approach whenever they are ready. The next SEC meeting is likely to be scheduled once the two manufacturers submit their data. The second official quoted above, who asked not to be named, said the committee has already received “thousands of pages of data” and a decision is likely “very soon” once the information sought is provided.“The panel, comprising of domain experts who are not government officials, sought additional clarifications from both manufacturers which are technical and scientific in nature. Both SII and Bharat Biotech have promised to come back with the additional clarifications. The next meeting is expected to happen as soon as they are ready with the information,” this person said, asking not to be named. Oxford University’s Sarah Gilbert and UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) chief executive June Raine told ITV that it was still not clear when the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot can be cleared. Raine said MHRA was still receiving data, and no timeline could be given on when a decision was expected, ITV reported on Wednesday. Both of the Indian government officials cited above said the approval process is likely to involve thorough reviews and the process could take at least a couple of weeks.“A decision cannot be taken on whether a vaccine is to be approved or not within two hours. This is a routine procedure. If you take for example Pfizer, it had applied for an emergency use authorisation with the US FDA on November 24 and they have had only two meetings of their committee so far. They had applied to the UK authorities on November 20 and it has just been approved. It will take time for the committee to go over the data,” said the health ministry official the cited above. Both SII and Bharat Biotech declined to comment. Pfizer’s vaccine is the furthest along, having completed clinical trials in entirety and showing 95% efficacy. However, there has been no trial in India for the vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca, to be manufactured and marketed by the Serum Institute of India, is currently conducting a phase III trial in India with 1,600 participants across 15 sites. The vaccine has shown an efficacy of 62% when volunteers were given two full doses of the vaccine. A half dose followed by full dose regimen — which was initially given by accident during UK testing of the vaccine — was found to be 90 effective. Bharat Biotech, which has developed Covaxin in collaboration with the government’s Indian Council of Medical Research, has just completed phase I and II trials, the data for which hasn’t been made public yet. The phase III trials that started in mid-November has so far only enrolled about 5,000 of the total 26,000 sample needed. Most volunteers have only received the first dose of the vaccine, with the second to be administered 28-days later.

10-12-2020||India||Congress dissenters meet to chalk out future course of action||After a brief lull, some Congress leaders belonging to the group of 23 dissenters held a meeting in the past two days to chalk out their future course of action, people familiar with the development said Wednesday. A Congress functionary said the meeting took place at the residence of a senior leader who is not part of the group and could be playing the role of a troubleshooter following the death of Ahmed Patel. Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her 10, Janpath residence on Tuesday, a day after her return from Goa. While the functionary said there is a possibility that the dissenters could have met at Nath’s residence, there was no confirmation about that meeting. Repeated calls to many leaders of the group went unanswered. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is a part of the group of 23 letter writers who had earlier demanded internal elections and organisational overhaul, is said to have attended the meeting. He did not respond to phone calls either. Soon after the Bihar results were out, Azad claimed that the “five-star culture” has gripped his party and that its structure has collapsed. He added that the party needs to be rebuilt by having elected leaders from the block to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) level. Azad also claimed that there is a huge disconnect between the people and the Congress leaders and that “five-star culture” has gripped the party. In Bihar, the Congress proved to be the weakest link in the opposition ‘mahagathbandhan’ by winning just 19 of the 70 seats it contested. While the Rashtriya Janata Dl (RJD) won 75 seats and emerged as the single largest party in the 243-assembly, the Left parties bagged 16 of the 29 they fought as part of the so-called grand alliance. The group of 23 signatories, also known as G-23, had written to the Congress president in August this year, seeking full-time and active leadership and introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old party while outlining an 11-point action plan. Apart from Azad, those who signed the letter included Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik, Jitin Prasada, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithiviraj Chavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-dissenters-meet-to-chalk-out-future-course-of-action/story-24UPFDvAOXit6zSaY2JRjO.html
10-12-2020||India||Why are farmers sticking to stand?||Farm unions have stuck to their demand of scrapping three pro-market agricultural laws they say will hurt their livelihoods, dealing a blow to the Union government’s offer to bring changes to the laws to end weeks of agitation by farmers. On Wednesday, the farm ministry sent out a lengthy set of proposal to farm unions protesting at Delhi’s borders to address their concerns. Farmers fear losing out to big corporations if private traders get a free in deregulated markets. The government says the changes will give farmers greater market access and spur investments. The agriculture sector employs half of all Indians, but adds only 16% to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), meaning far too many people are engaged in agriculture than is required to generate the same levels of farm incomes. The new laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and set new rules for contract farming. Concessions offered by the government provide for more oversight of private markets. Farmers, however, say they want nothing short of a full repeal of the laws. Farmers have come to trust decades-old regulated markets despite studies that show these markets are run by trader cartels who rig prices and lend money to farmers, limiting their bargaining power. Yet, these markets also offer farmers assured minimum prices for staples, providing a sense of security. The new reforms allow corporations to operate with minimal regulations. “The core concerns [are] about removing regulation on traders and companies and thereby removing all protections to farmers offered by the regulation system,” said Kirankumar Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a farm activist. The government on Wednesday said its concessions will protect farmers’ bargaining power. Farmers say the very objective of the laws is wrong. “The crux of the matter is that the government’s laws are centered around large corporations which are against the interest of farmers and consumers. Why can’t markets be farmer-led?” said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, a farm activist who took part in the recent talks with the government. Economists attribute India’s impressive economic growth over the years to reforms in industry, currency markets and manufacturing. The burst of reforms initiated in 1991 sidestepped the farm sector altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-are-farmers-sticking-to-stand/story-IO08zYk3pAFOWAYmAJGGsO.html
10-12-2020||India||Hearing in Bombay High Court today for quashing of FIR in Anvay Naik case||The Bombay High Court on December 10 will hear the pleas filed by Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and other accused seeking to quash the FIR filed against them in interior designer Anvay Naik suicide case.The journalist and other accused had sought a direction from the high court for staying the investigation into the case and quashing of the FIR against them. The accused trio has been charged under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 109 (punishment for abetment) and 34 (common intention).In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had announced that he had ordered a fresh probe in the case -- closed by the police earlier -- following a complaint by Adnya Naik, Anvay Naik’s daughter.Goswami and the two others were arrested by Alibaug police in Maharashtra’s Raigad district on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused. However, they got bail from the Supreme Court on November 11.The police on December 4 filed the charge sheet before a court in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district, where the case for alleged abetment of suicide of Naik and his mother has been registered. The charge sheet claims that the accused did not heed interior designer Anvay Naik’s threat to end his life if his dues were not paid. Later, Goswami moved the Bombay High Court seeking a direction to the Alibaug court not to take cognizance of the charge sheet.Meanwhile, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had questioned the Shiv-Sena-NCP-Congress government’s decision to file a charge sheet despite the Supreme Court’s observations while granting bail to Goswami and others.“Isn’t this a mockery of Supreme Court’s judgment? Are they again trying to suppress personal liberty?” Fadnavis had asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hearing-in-bombay-high-court-today-for-quashing-of-fir-in-the-anvay-naik-case/story-0s6fQSstA0x0GjfXaBjV3K.html

The family of Swapan Das, the deceased, and local BJP leaders alleged that he was murdered by workers of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). BJP national president J P Nadda, who is in Bengal on a two-day visit, also mentioned the death in his first address to party workers in Kolkata. The body of Das, a goldsmith, was found hanging outside the canteen at Andaran-Fulbari Girls’ High School, said the police. A resident of Subhas Palli in the Andaran-Fulbari gram panchayat area, Das went missing on Tuesday morning but his family did not report it to the police. Das is survived by his wife and two minor daughters. There were bloodstains on his feet, alleged Chumki Das, the BJP worker’s wife. Malati Rava Roy, the BJP district president, said, “His feet were on the ground, this cannot be a case of suicide.” “My husband was murdered by TMC-backed goons. He did not hang himself,” said Chumki Das, who named two TMC workers in her police complaint. The TMC denied the allegation. Rabindra Nath Ghosh, north Bengal development minister, said, “BJP supporters are killing their own people and putting the blame on other parties. The TMC has nothing to do with this death.” K Kannan, superintendent of police, Cooch Behar, said, “We have registered a case of unnatural death and an investigation is on.” Agitated BJP workers staged a demonstration with the body outside Tufanganj police station. Sibapada Paul, TMC’s district spokesperson, claimed that Das died by suicide because of a family feud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-supporter-found-hanging-in-bengal-party-charges-tmc-with-murder/story-S0Xf4MbF0ZBLVHrnY77GZM.html
10-12-2020||India||PM-WANI: Cabinet gives nod for setting up of public WiFi networks||The Union cabinet approved on Wednesday a new policy to allow businesses to offer wireless internet hotspot services by setting up calling office-like facilities, paving the way for the expansion of high-speed internet into remote areas and regions with patchy 4G mobile network coverage.The project, among three major telecom-related initiatives approved by the Prime Minister-led Cabinet, will not entail a licence fee and is aimed at improving internet penetration that will ultimately help enhance the ease of doing business, employment opportunities and incomes, the government said in a press release. “It is a decision that will unleash a massive wave of WiFi connectivity in the country,” minister of communications Ravi Shankar Prasad said during the Cabinet briefing separately. Public WiFi in India: Govt approves scheme, grocery shops can be WiFi pointsThe project -- Public Wi-Fi Access Network Interface or PM-WANI -- will have several components with public data offices (PDOs) being the point where wireless internet will be offered. Additionally, businesses can set up aggregators to create a network of such PDOs, and develop and operate applications that will allow people to find and use services at such PDOs. “A public data office can be a small shop; anyone can register as a PDO. They can get the internet bandwidth from a service provider. Aggregators will compile and keep information about the PDOs. Apps can be downloaded from the store or from the website. This way, you can directly get WiFi from any PDO,” Prasad said.According to the government, no license fee will be charged, which until now was 8% of the adjusted gross revenue, and those applying to run services as a PDO will not require to register with the Department of Telecom – the other two, however, will need to register themselves with the government. “There are about 5 lakhs public WiFis at present,” said an official of the department of telecom, asking not to be named. “The number will increase by 10 times over the next two years. It will help extend the services across the country. Bharatnet will also be used to provide public WiFi,” this person added.The official added that the scheme will create employment, with kirana shops, paan shops, etc becoming public WiFi hotspots. “It will be additional service. People will be happy to use it if they provide good bandwidth.” It was not immediately clear what sort of tariffs or charges end users will need to pay.Former telecom secretary Shyamal Ghosh told Hindustan Times that in principle, the move is a good step. “It will give access to more and more people through WiFi. It will help connectivity and make it easier to download data. The service provider that gives the access may charge for the data downloaded, but it depends on the modalities of the scheme.” The cabinet also approved the setting up of a submarine optical fibre cable between Kochi and Lakshadweep. The project is estimated to cost Rs 1,072 crore and will be funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). The government, in terms of policy decisions, spearheads the USOF, however, contributors to the fund include private players such as DoT licensees Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance and Tata Telecom. All of them contribute a mandatory 5% of their license fee AGR to the fund and will now be able to lease the fibre to provide connections in the islands. Earlier this year, the government had approved its first 2,300-km submarine fibre optic cable in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The project had cost Rs 1,224 crore.By 2022, the government also aims to provide mobile coverage to 2,374 villages (1683 in Arunachal Pradesh and 691 in two districts of Assam) using the USOF scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-wani-cabinet-gives-nod-for-setting-up-of-public-wifi-networks/story-wLBykYJTgOXjVucz1EvZXK.html

10-12-2020||India||Maharashtra: Four-acre mangrove patch destroyed near proposed eco park in Uran||A group of environmentalists has unearthed a four-acre patch of dried up and destroyed mangroves at a site less than 200 metres from the proposed mangrove park by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Belpada, Uran.The group, Shri Ekvira Aai Pratisthan (SEAP), said at least approximately 1,500 mangrove trees were destroyed after tidal water was blocked off by locals for captive fish breeding or aqua culture activities. The patch had turned dark brown while trees located at the site of the proposed park remained lush green.“Local vested interests have been involved in these illegal activities. Strict corrective action must be taken against the culprits otherwise these kind of practices may be repeated everywhere. Local residents need to be made aware about the importance of this ecosystem,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP, who filed a complaint with various state authorities requesting a first information report in the matter and an investigation by the revenue or forest department. Last week, Pawar also filed complaints about alleged debris dumping at other locations Belpada, Sawarkhar, and Sonari areas of Uran.Also read | Maharashtra scraps jetty project to protect turtle nesting beach in RatnagiriIn November, JNPT announced that it planned to build a 200-hectare (ha) mangrove (eco) park to protect dense mangrove patches and house visiting galleries, mangrove walkthroughs (boardwalks), a nature interpretation centre, and a nursery with rare mangrove species, at Belpada in Uran at a cost of Rs5 crore for the first phase.The proposed site is covered with healthy mangroves, said Dilip Koli from the Paramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti, a local fishing community. “It is a rich fishing area especially for fish, shellfish, crabs etc. We are dependent upon these stretches for our livelihood but it would be lost due to this park,” said Koli.During the last meeting of the Bombay high court (HC)-directed state mangrove and wetland grievance redressal committee on November 2, the Konkan commissioner, chairman panel, said JNPT could go ahead with the project. “A mangrove park will lead to awareness for locals in Uran but we will convey our final decision during the next HC panel meet scheduled this month,” said Annasaheb Misal, Konkan commissioner.Based on the panel decision, NatConnect Foundation wrote to the committee on Tuesday, expressing apprehensions over the destruction of mangroves and debris at Belpada.“The local fishing community is worried over the loss of their source of livelihood and this must be addressed. On one hand, mangroves are being destroyed but an ecological park is being planned right next to it. I have appealed to the HC committee to keep the park project on hold and clear the free flow of tidal waters to mangroves, restore the wetland, and then commence their plans,” said BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.The Belpada area has been officially identified as a wetland under the National Wetland Inventory Atlas, Maharashtra. However, Koli and other fishers alleged that 450 hectares of natural areas were buried and landfilled in 2018-19 without any clearance permission from the HC or the state’s coastal authority. “JNPT had responded to our right to information query stating that they had not destroyed anything at Belpada,” said Koli.Natural areas lost in Uran, alleges traditional fishing community In a fresh complaint to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the traditional fishing forum has alleged reclamation by state agencies such as JNPT, City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd., and Special Economic Zone across Uran areas in 2019-20 --like Sheva island where 100 ha has been allotted for a tank farm, 600 ha for truck parking, 90 ha for road widening, 118 ha for expansion of a police station at Jaskhar, 100 ha near Belpada through debris dumping, and 300 hectare across the proposed JNPT SEZ. “Also, obstructions have been created in the creek estuaries of Sheva, Jaskhar, Sonari, Belpada etc.,” Koli’s complaint to CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-four-acre-mangrove-patch-destroyed-near-proposed-eco-park-in-uran/story-EcSZOjvDRHgkY8kPIxqP6H.html
10-12-2020||Editorials||Vaccine: Science over speed | HT Editorial||India began assessing options for a coronavirus vaccine this week, reviewing submissions by two pharma companies for emergency approval. At the outset, a panel of experts deemed that the data was insufficient to judge the two key parameters — safety and efficacy. While it may seem like this decision will delay the rollout of inoculations for Indians, it is an encouraging sign that the experts are upholding the process to the necessary standards. The nature of the recommendations they offered to both companies suggested that they had jumped the gun in filing their submissions. Serum Institute of India (SII) has to now wait till authorities in the United Kingdom (UK), where clinical trials were held, take a decision on their shot. Bharat Biotech will need to present efficacy data from phase 3 trials that have only just begun.Neither company has offered comments on the timing or the nature of their submissions, but a quick look at the regulatory literature indicates the bar they failed to meet was clearly defined. Vaccines need to demonstrate safety as well as efficacy, with the latter usually determined only in phase 3 trials. And if the vaccine is made outside of India (such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca one that SII sought cleared), it needs to be approved in a foreign market first. It is only Pfizer, the third vaccine developer that also applied but later requested more time, that ticks both these boxes. But even in Pfizer’s case, news broke yesterday that people predisposed to allergic drug reactions should be closely monitored after some people in the UK who got the shot developed reactions. These were deemed not worrying, but they highlight the risk of unknowns that can still persist when a process that takes years is collapsed into months.It is thus important that domain experts are armed with every bit of information, and free of any pressure of anticipation, to make the right decision on the vaccines. This information and its assessment are projected to take a few weeks, like it has in the United States, and the UK (where vaccine makers have been making rolling submissions). Science must prevail over speed. In the meantime, India must devote its energy and focus on other challenges, such as planning more purchases, strengthening the distribution plans and, most importantly, keeping infections low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/vaccine-science-over-speed-ht-editorial/story-LOJL60UGLxXDTXOT13A7HI.html
