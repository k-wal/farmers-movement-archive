23-12-2020||News||A data rights agenda for platform and gig economy workers||A steady stream of public commentary is flowing in about the implications of the draft Rules on Social Security Code, 2020, and the Motor Vehicle Aggregators Guidelines, 2020, for the rights of platform workers. We interrogate these developments from a data rights standpoint. The draft Rules on Social Security Code, 2020, propose the creation of a centralised database of platform and gig workers. Enrolment on this database is to take place through two routes — self-registration using Aadhaar authentication and periodic sharing of worker data records by platform aggregators. The data fields will range from address, mobile number, number of work days, skill-sets, to any other particulars that the Centre chooses to add. While it can be argued that the creation of such a database is imperative for effective targeting in social security schemes, the proposed design raises some concerns.No recourse has been made available to workers in case of a dispute between self-declaration and an aggregators’ records, or erroneous deletion of names in any de-duplication exercise that may be undertaken. Paradoxically, the onus of updating records falls fully on the shoulders of individual workers — with Rule 50 (2)(h) even cautioning that in the absence of such updation, they will not be eligible to receive benefits.The absence of purpose limitation safeguards with respect to use of worker records by aggregators and/or government agencies exposes platform workers to the threat of discriminatory profiling. It is not difficult to imagine that their records may be used by aggregators to unfairly profit off workers. The risk of algorithmic systems being used by the State to weed out “undeserving” workers has been well-documented in the administration of social security. These risks are compounded by the absence of a robust personal data protection legislative framework. For its part, The Motor Vehicle Aggregators (MVA) Guidelines, 2020, requires ride-hailing aggregators to store “data generated on the app” on a server in India, and make this data available to states as per due process of law. Considering the difficulties that governments have faced in obtaining access to valuable non-personal data from ride-hailing apps for public interest purposes, the obligation for mandatory data- sharing is a welcome move. However, the absence of specific provisions that distinguish between state agency requests for anonymised non-personal data with potential public value, and those pertaining to personal data (especially of drivers), and inadequate attention to the higher standards of safeguards required for personal data protection, create room for concern. Additionally, the collective claim of drivers, unions, and driver-run data trusts over data generated from their behavioural footprints has not been recognised.The MVA Guidelines, 2020, also place transparency obligations on ride-hailing aggregators with respect to various aspects of their business model, including “functioning of the app algorithm”. The data collected by aggregators feeds into complex algorithms that make a variety of decisions, from routing drivers through the city to off-boarding them from the app. However, this provision does fully ensure algorithmic accountability, unfortunately not incorporating a “right to explanation”.Platform workers’ organisations need to incorporate a data rights agenda, which, in the short term, must comprise the following demands — one, a federated database architecture with room for democratic and decentralised data stewardship arrangements; two, appropriate personal data protection safeguards underpinning mandatory data-sharing obligations under the MVA Guidelines, 2020; and three, recognition of platform workers’ right to explanation. In the long-term, a well-rounded data rights agenda that acknowledges privacy and personal data protection considerations as well as workers’ collective claim need to become the new 21st century frontier for the labour movement.Nandini Chami and Sadhana Sanjay are with www.ITforChange.net The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-data-rights-agenda-for-platform-and-gig-economy-workers/story-9ZtpX9kavVSN5TNQcE289M.html
23-12-2020||News||What agriculture needs: Risk mitigation||At the heart of the debate on farm laws is the issue of the level of farm incomes. Income volatility is a key dimension important for farmers’ welfare, understanding their anxieties, and the success of a pro-market reform. The two main risks associated with farming are production risks and price risks. While production-related risks that come from weather, pests and disease are well understood, price risks induced by the market or policy are more subtle.Market price realisation of agricultural produce is usually uncertain. When sowing, farmers have to guess the price their crops will get after four or five months when harvest occurs. After sowing, they have limited ability to change their decision. Price risks are exacerbated by policy. India abruptly changes export restrictions on crops like cotton and onion, often multiple times between sowing and harvest. Thus, farmers are unable to make informed decisions; when international prices are too high, export bans also keep farmers from making a profit.Globally, governments provide farmers with various risk-mitigation instruments. In India, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY), the government’s crop insurance programme, deals only with production risks. It does not cover livestock. Enrollment remains low and operational challenges leave much scope for improvement.To deal with price risk, the only real instrument that the government provides is procurement at minimum support prices (MSPs). When available, farmers use it to the fullest. In the 1960s, before procurement of paddy and wheat started, Punjab’s farmers grew many other crops like maize, bajra, pulses and oilseeds. Three decades of assured procurement has turned it largely into a paddy-wheat producing state. Farmers understand the environmental costs of growing water-intensive crops. But they choose to grow these crops, as they minimise their ex-post risk, even if they don’t maximise their incomes or welfare of future generations.When farmers don’t have access to public procurement, they mitigate risk by sowing low-value low-risk crops conditional on agro-ecology. Research has shown that India’s domestic market integration has increased income volatility and induced farmers to switch to lower-risk crops. Consider the flood-prone areas of Bihar, where paddy crops get damaged due to monsoons. In unintegrated markets, this would increase local prices. Thus, farmer income, which is a product of prices and quantities, is stabilised. In integrated markets, a reduction in local production leads to inflow of paddy from neighbouring regions keeping prices stable. This is good for consumers. However, farmer incomes decline as their production loss is not offset by a price increase.A single instrument, procurement at MSP, is being used to solve multiple problems — risk, remunerative prices, and food security. However, it is not the best solution. It cannot be made universal, is operationally challenging, and environmentally detrimental. Therefore, India needs a better plan. What are the elements that we need to consider?First, to provide immediate relief there is a need to strengthen PM-Kisan (and its state-specific variants), especially in states where there is no public procurement. It should also be expanded to include landless farmers. The second is the debate over removing various subsidies — MSP, power, fertiliser etc — and replacing it with an equivalent transfer. If the latter is done, then we must ensure that the basic PM-Kisan infrastructure works, and be cognisant about whether distribution chains of key inputs work and are competitive. The switch will, then, have greater acceptance. The production systems in Punjab and Haryana have gradually evolved as a response to the procurement systems that the government implemented for three decades. Overnight reversal is hard. Thus, farmers must be compensated for policy induced adjustment costs. These compensations will have environmental benefits when farmers switch from paddy to other crops.Third, to insure price-risk, we can consider a procedurally simple version of the Bhavantar scheme to compensate farmers for losses from market price crashes. A price monitoring and market intelligence system is necessary for it to work. However, this should be a top-up over the basic income transfer to target extreme events. If governments still have to procure crops for the public distribution system, we should move toward a limited procurement regime, at market-linked price, spread across states, and include a wider range of crops. Governments must also resist the temptation to follow a counter-cyclical trade policy, banning exports when international prices are high.Finally, there will be residual yield risks, especially given the climate crisis. Thus, additional insurance payments will need to be made when there are clearly visible weather or disease shocks in certain tehsils or districts — but this must be done in lieu of debt write-offs, not in addition.In sum, certain principles are important. First, the reduction of existing subsidies should be gradual and begin after farmers are assured the digital infrastructure and supply chains work. Second, none of the above instruments are perfect but they complement each other. Third, taking into account what might be implementable in India.The level and volatility of farmer incomes are intricately related. Uncertain incomes force farmers into debt and poverty. A credible risk mitigation strategy is necessary for a successful agricultural reform that will be acceptable to farmers as freer and integrated markets will make their incomes even more volatile.Shoumitro Chatterjee is assistant professor of economics, Pennsylvania State University, and a visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-agriculture-needs-risk-mitigation/story-PWiO0ofS0eMFgvnaZ5IrNM.html
23-12-2020||News||Where the Indian economic story went wrong||A set of economists has defended the record of reforms of the present government. This must be taken seriously. But there is a more fundamental question here: Reforms, even if yes, towards what end?The Indian economy has continued to slow post the sudden demonetisation (one of the big ticket “reforms”) and the roll-out of the ill-conceived Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. Investment, exports, private consumption and government expenditure were already seriously impaired before Covid-19 put the proverbial last nail in the coffin. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has fallen into a technical recession and most independent economists are unanimous that contraction this fiscal will be 8-10%. Even with the vaccine in sight, the economy will continue to be seriously impacted for the next two years before we can see a real turnaround.The global slowdown or pandemic alone cannot explain the current situation. While the pandemic is unprecedented, it is important to understand how the economy has come to a sorry pass. Thirty years since the 1991 economic liberalisation, there is much we can be proud of. For one, State intervention in the economy was minimised, allowing free markets to develop. As negative consequences, such as increased inequality, became evident, schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) were brought in to reduce poverty. This has been globally acknowledged. The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative report has noted that, “India remains the country that has the largest reduction in number of poor, with over 270 million persons leaving poverty (from) 2005-6 to 2015-16.” India went from being a poor, slow-growing country to the fastest-growing major economy in the world. According to the World Economic Outlook (2016), the United States (US) and India were the two pillars of strength of the world economy. So what went wrong? It must be acknowledged that during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)-2, with inflation going double digit and fiscal deficit running out of control, the economy was taking a severe beating. In 2013, with the US Fed indicating withdrawal of Quantitative Easing (QE). India faced what infamously came to be known as the “taper tantrum” with the rupee plummeting to a then record low of more than ₹68 to a dollar. With 2G, coal and other crises, the government seemed to have lost the plot. Much has been said about the new government inheriting an economy that was in a downward spiral in 2014. However, the truth is otherwise. From 2012-14, UPA-2 took bold measures which reflected in the quick recovery over the following two years. Apart from clearing bottlenecks for large infrastructure projects, the FDI regime was liberalised considerably, financial market instruments such as Infrastructure Debt Funds, InVITs and REITS were introduced, price deregulation of diesel was put into motion, a fiscal consolidation roadmap was laid down and the rupee tantrum very effectively managed. The results were dramatic. GDP clocked a growth of 6.9% in 2013-14 as against 5.1% in the previous fiscal. Growth in 2014-15 was 7.4%, built on the back of the dramatic recovery the previous year. The government has the instruments to effectively intervene and manage economic cycles provided it has the capacity and the will to do so.The sudden negative shocks of demonetisation and hasty introduction of GST started the downward spiral, which has led the economy into recession this year. India is no longer in the list of the top 25 nations in AT Kearney’s Global FDI Confidence Index 2000 despite claims of improving the country’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business. Once an alternative model for economic growth vis-a-vis China, India has dropped to the 23rd rank for 2020 from among the top three fastest-growing economies in Economist’s weekly chart of 43 major economies.Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be a well thought-out strategy to bring the economy out of the morass except for a much touted Atmanirbhar Bharat package, which has received mostly adverse reviews. According to global research firm, AB Bernstein, “The need to announce measures that add up to this top down number made the entire package aimless”. The firm described it as a “lost opportunity”. By various estimates, close to 90% of the workforce in India is employed in the unorganised sector and this has been severely impacted. There have also been huge retrenchments and salary cuts in the organised sector and an estimated loss of around than 80% of the demand. The much acclaimed fact about the “economy bottoming out” is a mirage. The latest Consumer Confidence Survey, conducted in the first half of November, states that more than half of the respondents continue to report a fall in income and employment. Clearly the ongoing economic recovery is being driven by a small section of the economy, and led by profits rather than wages. We can hope, on a wing and a prayer, that the government will finally act.Arvind Mayaram is former finance secretary of the Government of India (2012-14) and currently serves as vice-chairman, Rajasthan Economic Transformation Advisory Council The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/where-the-indian-economic-story-went-wrong/story-ZLK8TSGwH82mCd9MtKQPWI.html
23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Educational institutes in Ludhiana learn a lesson in adaptation||The education sector underwent a complete transformation in 2020 as it substituted the age-old classroom with virtual classes and incorporated Zoom Classes, You Tube Live sessions, Doordarshan classes and pre-recorded lectures to its repertoire.After schools were closed in March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, teachers and students had to upskill and embrace technology to ensure learning was not disrupted. The chasm between the rich and the poor was apparent as while private schools were able to use of technology to reach out to students, government schools sadly staggered behind, facing hurdles such as non-availability of smart phones and laptops among the student body, insufficient data packs and poor internet connections.To ensure no child was left behind, the state education department tied up with different radio and television channels so that government school students who did not have access to advanced technology could catch up. However, the measures fell short as they had to cater to a vast audience.Schools restarted for students of Class 9 to 12 in October, however, with infections on the rise, minimal attendance was recorded. Around 12 government schools had to shut down after a few teachers contracted the deadly virus.The sale of books and uniforms was also affected. Once the lockdown was lifted in June, the sales of books picked up but few people purchased uniforms even after schools reopened in October.HIGHSStellar resultsThe year 2020 will also be remembered for the students’ excellent performance in board exams. Many teachers and principals were also honoured for increasing enrolment in government schools.In the Class-12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) results, Gurveen Kaur, a humanities student at Sacred Heart Convent School, Sarabha Nagar, scored a whopping 99.8%. In the CBSE Class-10 examinations, a student of the same school scored 98.6%. While government senior secondary school (GSSS), Rajewal, student Balwinder Kaur, who appeared in the Class-12 Punjab School Education Board Balwinder Kaur, scored 99.78% in humanities and stood first in the district.Gurpreet Singh Wadhwa ranked 23 in the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).Rural govt school wins awardSPS GSSS (boys), Gill, was adjudged second in the best school category during the second edition of the Ministry of Jal Shakti’s National Water Awards. The school was awarded for its outstanding efforts in the area of water conversation.Student wins national-level quizA student of GSSS, Jawahar Nagar, Jiya Seth, topped in a national-level online competition organised by Xplore and Vigyan Prasar.2,000 teachers and school heads honouredIn the last six months, state education secretary Krishan Kumar has applauded school teachers and heads for making efforts to increase enrolment in their respective schools. Appreciation letters were issued to them and many primary and middle school teachers were appreciated for using e-content.3 teachers get state award, DEOs receive administrative awardFormer district educational officer (DEO) secondary Swaranjit Kaur, DEO elementary Rajinder Kaur received administrative awards, while GSSS, Threeke, teacher Rapwinder Kaur, GSSS, Siyaar, principal Jatinder Pal Sharma and GPS ,Jargari, teacher Parvinder Kaur received state awards.LOWSProlonged parents’ protestThe year also saw large-scale layoffs and business losses, due to which many parents were unable to deposit their wards’ fee amid lockdown and demanded that the admission fee and hiked tuition fee be scrapped. Multiple parents’ associations remained at odds with the school administration for four months. The associations contended that several private schools were demanding that parents deposit fee and other charges during the lockdown despite the state government’s instructions to the contrary.Six show-cause noticesDespite directions from the education minister not to charge any fee during lockdown, the state education minister had to issue show-cause notices to six private schools. Later, the state education minister cancelled the no-objection certificates of three private schools for defying government instructions.School asked to close permanentlyAfter a private, unrecognised school, Gaurav Ghai Public School in Punjabi Bagh, Jawaddi, was found holding examinations despite the state government’s instructions, DEO elementary Rajinder Kaur ordered its permanent closure with immediate effect.Pre-schools shut downThe pandemic forced around 25 pre-schools across the city to shut shop, leaving teachers without a job. Facing an uncertain future and unable to meet fix expenses a number of playschools in Gurdev Nagar, South city, Pakhowal Road, Ghumar Mandi, Dugri and Civil Lines closed down.PSEB, SCERT goof upAround 10 students missed their Class 10 (open school) Punjabi examination due to Punjab School Education Board’s (PSEB) goof-up. The admit card issued to the students mentioned the examination time from 2pm to 5.15pm. However, the exam was conducted between 11am to 2.15pm at 20 examination centres across the district. In another mix-up, the SCERT uploaded the question paper for the National Talent Search Examination on their official website a day before the exam.ETT recruitment exam: 2 booked for personationTwo women were booked for cheating and personation after they attempted to appear for the elementary training teachers (ETT) recruitment exam using the same roll number. The accused were identified as Kiran Rani, a resident of Jalalbad, and Asha Rani of Faridkot. The incident was reported at Senior Secondary Residential School for Meritorious students, near Rose Garden, where the exam was being conducted for 301 candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/educational-institutes-learn-a-lesson-in-adaptation/story-BJvA1ec4IAFenLmsnNYxtJ.html
23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh declares 5-day winter break in govt schools from December 28||Taking a U-turn from its earlier decision to not have winter vacation in government schools this year, the UT education department has announced five-day break from December 28. Schools will reopen on January 2. A circular regarding this was sent out by the district education officer (DEO) on Wednesday. This comes as a relief to many teachers who were complaining that they had been coming to school and taking online classes even during the lockdown. UT Cadre of Education Employees’ Union president Swarn Singh Kamboj said they had requested the director school education to provide a break to them as well as students. While students up to Class 8 have been attending only online classes, limited classroom teaching had resumed for Classes 9 to 12 about three months back.Cold wave, fog likely in cityIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for cold wave conditions and moderate to dense fog in the city in the coming days.Cold wave conditions are likely to continue till December 26, after which cloudy weather can be expected. Light rain is expected in northern parts of Punjab but it is not yet clear whether Chandigarh will get any rain. However, with an increase in humidity, fog can be expected.Maximum temperature of the city went down from 22°C on Tuesday to 21.5°C on Wednesday, while minimum temperature dipped from 6.1°C to 5.7°C. In fact, minimum temperature continued to remain lower than that in Shimla (6°C).In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain around 19-20°C while minimum temperature will remain around 5°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-declares-5-day-winter-break-in-govt-schools-from-december-28/story-tjE09pLES3p564b6XBEfCI.html

23-12-2020||Mumbai||Night curfew dampens Mumbai’s Christmas, New Year eve plans||Mumbai’s Christmas eve and New Year’s eve celebrations will be severely hit this year due to the night curfew imposed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) amid the pandemic. The curfew will remain in force between 11 pm and 6 am till January 5. The development comes after several bars and restaurants in the city were caught flouting the Epidemic Diseases Act 1987, by not maintaining social distancing and closing down within government-issued timings. The night curfew was announced in Mumbai on Monday in line with the Maharashtra government’s decision amid concerns over the outbreak of a new strain of the coronavirus disease in the United Kingdom.Following this, restaurants, bars, pubs, eateries, and malls in the city can now remain open only up till 11 pm, even on December 25 and December 31. Gatherings of more than 5 people are not allowed at public places such as Marine Drive, Worli Seaface, Gateway of India, Bandra Bandstand, and other popular hangouts for families and youngsters from the city. Religious places of worship also received directives from the Mumbai Police on Wednesday, allowing no more than 50 people to gather at churches for midnight mass on Christmas eve and New Year’s eve. As per the directives, prayers cannot go on beyond 11 am to ensure night curfew is strictly followed, stated a circular from the Maharashtra government on Wednesday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said the decision was taken as a precautionary measure considering a mutation of Sar-Cov-2, the virus causing Covid-19, found in Britain, which is believed to spread faster than the previous strains. He said people will have to be more vigilant for the next 15 days.On Saturday, December 6, the BMC had raided three nightclubs in the city, after a tip-off that they were functioning overnight on that weekend, at overfull capacity, without adhering to rules such as social distancing or wearing of masks. Following this, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had written to the state government to impose night curfew in Mumbai. However, the decision was temporarily stalled.However, Chahal said on Monday while announcing night curfew, “Even on Sunday night (December 20), our teams visited some nightclubs and found violations. This is why the decision of night curfew had to be taken. This is not a normal new year and hence we cannot have normal celebrations like every year. The curfew is being imposed to ensure that such violations are not repeated.”Also read: After joining BJP, Suvendu Adhikari called ‘traitor’ in hometown by TMCRegarding restrictions on outings at public places on new year’s eve, Chahal told Hindustan Times on Wednesday, “Gatherings of more than 5 people will not be allowed at public places.”However, Mumbai police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of Police S Chaitanya told Hindustan Times on Wednesday, “For 31st night, there will be no exceptions. Only people who are allowed include staff from the essential services industry. Apart from this, curfew will be strictly implemented post 11 pm. Presently too, congregations of people are not allowed. There will be police patrolling to manage crowding, drunk driving, etc. Five and more people is just an indicator, but the point is crowd management. At public places, Mumbai police treats people gathered together as one big gathering, so police will ask people to leave.”For midnight prayers in churches on Christmas and new year’s eve, the government on Wednesday issued a circular directing religious places to hold prayers only till 11 pm, and not allow gatherings of more than 50 people at churches. Father Nizel Barret, spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Bombay said on Wednesday, “We received these instructions today. As per the earlier rules, a gathering of up to 200 people was allowed, till 11 pm. We had made all plans to adhere to these rules. After today’s instructions, we have hardly any time to prepare. We will have to find a way to allow only 50 people in the church for prayers.”However, restaurant owners associations have already presented their case to the municipal commissioner, requesting relaxation of timings on December 31. Gurbaxis Singh, president of hotel and restaurant owners’ association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “We had asked the BMC to relax timings even before curfew was imposed. Now we are following up. It is not logical to shut down at 11 pm, contrary to earlier timing of 11.30 pm. Moreover, on new year’s eve, this is very bad for business. Everyone wants to celebrate till midnight. If we are closing at 11 pm, no one will bother to come to the bars at all, and leave just short of midnight. They will opt for house parties, or will head out of the town.”Mumbaikars are opting to travel to other states to celebrate Christmas and new year this year. Shrikant Hande, 32, is travelling to Goa with his wife and friends to celebrate Christmas. “We were planning to go to Dubai this time as we travel to another country every year. But there are a lot of restrictions on international travel. So we planned to go to Goa, which is closer to home in case of an emergency.”Sanket Shingre, 27, travelled to Bir in Himachal Pradesh from Mumbai in the second week of December and will return in the first week of January. He said, “When we made the plans, the idea was to get away from routine as work from home due to lockdown had become very monotonous. At that time, the decision about night curfew was not taken. But we made a good decision to come out of Mumbai to celebrate the new year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/night-curfew-dampens-mumbai-s-christmas-new-year-eve-plans/story-1lthbulxxXdjKNajmwPwOK.html

The new strain is extremely infectious,” he said.The administrator also decided to keep apni mandis closed for now, particularly in view of the new risk. The decision will be reviewed in the first week of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-considering-night-curfew-ahead-of-new-year-s-eve/story-FxLhGvWBkOnV4iH7YttVUL.html
23-12-2020||City||Two Mohali cops arrested for loot bid at house in Sector 71||A day after two cops were booked for attempt to murder for allegedly barging into Sector 71 resident Naresh Kumar’s house and trying to rob him at gunpoint on December 20, the Mohali police on Wednesday arrested them. Their accomplice and mastermind has also been identified.Assistant sub-inspector Rashpreet Singh, who was posted at the Industrial Area police station, and constable Davinder Singh, posted at the Saneta police post, had committed the crime along with Vikas Sharma of Sambhalki village, Mohali.Vikas worked as a security guard at JTPL City, Kharar, where Naresh was the manager, said police. Vikas allegedly told the two cops that Naresh kept a lot of money and valuables at his house, and was driving the car used to flee after the crime. “We have arrested the cops and they will be produced in court on Thursday,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh. “They have been dismissed as they were found absent from duty during the time of loot and were also captured in CCTV footage recovered from the spot. The third accused has been identified and will be arrested soon.” In his complaint to police, Naresh Kumar stated that on December 20 around 9.30pm, the inverter of his house broke down. When his son Pranav came out of the drawing room to check the inverter, two unidentified men entered the house posing as DSPs of the excise department. They were in police uniform.One of them, later identified as ASI Rashpreet, pointed a pistol at him and asked him to hand over all gold and cash in the house. Meanwhile, they locked the door of the drawing room from inside. When Naresh became suspicious and asked for a search warrant and their identity cards, the duo allegedly panicked and started beating him up. Rashpreet hit him several times on the head with the butt of a pistol. Naresh read Davinder’s name on his badge when the constable tried to grab him by the arms. After the failed loot bid, they fled the spot in a car waiting outside. Naresh Kumar suffered injuries on his head and nose and was admitted to a private hospital in Mohali. A case was registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 458 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code besides under relevant sections of the Arms Act at the Mataur police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-mohali-cops-arrested-for-loot-bid-at-house-in-sector-71/story-LkDTN65venXAZInDu6n1qJ.html

23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Confusion marks Day 1 of waste segregation drive in Chandigarh||Chaos and confusion marked the first day of door-to-door collection of segregated waste that was kicked off by the Chandigarh municipal corporation on Wednesday. Even as MC officials claimed to have achieved 30-40% segregation on the first day, in most sectors, residents complained garbage couldn’t be collected. As there was no schedule shared by the MC, residents mostly remained unaware of the vehicles’ movement. In some sectors, both MC vehicles and private garbage collectors came, while in some localities, only private collectors turned up. After failing to make much headway in segregating solid waste at source in the past three years, the MC started the drive in Sectors 1-30 on Wednesday, while other areas will be covered in a phased manner in the next couple of weeks. As of now, the MC is using around 100 twin-bin garbage collection vehicles, and in the next phases, another 300 will be put into service. These will replace private cart-based garbage collection. However, unlike them, MC vehicles don’t pick up garbage from outside the houses, and people have to come up to them and drop the waste. Issues aplenty, complain residentsSupriya Goyal, treasurer, resident welfare association (RWA), Sector 28D, said: “The whole exercise was done in a most unprofessional manner. There was no prior information on when the vehicles would come. When they did arrive, they left in a hurry and we couldn’t hand over our garbage.”In some parts of Sector 22, the MC vehicle was accompanied with a couple of helpers. “Helpers picked up waste only if someone requested. They skipped the other houses where the occupants were not present,” said Vinod Vashisht, president, government houses society, Sector 22. Residents also questioned the timing of vehicles. “The vehicles came at an odd time when most people are at work,” said Pardeep Chopra, citizen welfare association, Sector 21. In some areas, the vehicles didn’t come at all, complained residents. “Though yesterday, a vehicle came to create awareness, today no vehicle turned up to pick up waste,” said RS Gill, president, RWA, Sector 8. At Modern Housing Complex, Sector 13, only existing private garbage collectors arrived, said Harshvardhan Pundir, a local. In some sectors, both turned up, but people preferred to hand over garbage to private collectors as they came up to the doorstep. Meanwhile, senior citizens and people living on upper floors complained of not getting enough time to reach the vehicles. MC chief holds review meetingUT administrator VP Singh Badnore, in a meeting held on Wednesday, directed MC commissioner KK Yadav to create awareness on the new garbage segregation arrangements. He said such practices have been successfully implemented in other smart cities and Chandigarh should not lag behind. Yadav also held a review meeting with senior MC officials in the evening. He said the vehicles will follow a tight schedule of 7am to 1pm. “We have directed the operators to drive slowly through the sectors,” he said. They will be given whistles from Thursday, which they are have to blow while passing in front of houses.The MC will also try to collect garbage from the doorsteps of elderly people and others who can’t come to the vehicles. “In some areas people were confused as existing garbage collectors also turned up. A group of garbage collectors also protested in Sector 7. The issues have been resolved,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/confusion-marks-day-1-of-waste-segregation-drive-in-chandigarh/story-XIWVj7yzAJk2OIKFBJmnSL.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||RTA cracks down on overloading, illegal mining||The regional transport authority (RTA) of Gurugram has started penalising truckers for overloading mined stones in their trucks and dumpers. In a new initiative, the RTA officials have started the practice of offloading the excess mining stone, which is beyond the sanctioned load, and suspending the licence of truck drivers for three months, besides issuing penalties. Officials said that they have started imposing a fine of Rs 80,000 per truck for overloading, over the last two months. Officials said that earlier, truckers were let go after being penalised for overloading. However, the RTA has now started taking stringent action as overloading often leads to accidents on the expressways around the city. Most of the trucks, from Rajasthan districts, Tauru and Nuh, reach Gurugram through Mahendragarh, Nuh and Faridabad, and most of them are laden with illegally mined stones and stone chips from stone crushers in Faridabad, said officials. Shatrujeet Kapur, the principal secretary of the transport department of Haryana, had recently conducted a meeting of all RTAs in the National Capital Region on overloading and directed them to take stringent action on the issue. In the last two months, the Gurugram RTA has issued fines amounting to around Rs 2.75 crore, the highest among Haryana districts. In November, the Gurugram RTA issued 133 challans for overloading and collected a fine of Rs 96.16 lakh, while 289 other challans, pertaining to other issues, were also issued in the same month and the department collected Rs 53.33 lakh. A total of Rs 1.49 crore was collected by the RTA in November. Similarly, in December, the RTA issued 136 challans and collected Rs 72.62 lakh for overloading, while 310 challans were issued and fines of Rs 49.98 lakh were issued for other offences, taking the monthly total to Rs 1.22 crore from fine. “For last two months, we have been acting against overloading aggressively and fines of around Rs 2.75 crore have been collected, which is highest for any district across the state,” said Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram. She said that besides levying financial penalties, drivers have also started facing strict action. Elaborating on the process, she said that fines for overloading have failed to act as a deterrent. “We have started penalising the truck owners and have started suspending the licence of truck drivers for three months. We are offloading the excess item at the spot and the transporter has to bring in another truck to carry those items. With the help of a gas cutter, we are cutting the extra body of the truck, as per the specification under Motor Vehicles Act,” said Yadav, adding that the objective is to discourage transporters and drivers from overloading and illegal mining. The police also said that illegal mining operations have been taking place in the Aravallis for over two decades. In November 2019, IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon, who is also the director general of mines and geology department of Haryana, had put together a special enforcement team to crack down on illegal mining in the Aravallis. The state was divided into two parts and two police officials were given charge of each. While the assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Rajesh Phogat has been given the charge of the Sonepat region, ACP Preet Pal Sangwan is in charge of curbing illegal mining in Gurugram and Nuh. The police said there are five villages in the Tauru belt that are under the scanner. The teams deployed in the area said families have trained women and children to surround police teams during raids to create an opportunity for illegal acts. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that locals, including women, block the road and lie down with children to stop police from entering the village. The police have deployed 25 teams in 14 districts for monitoring illegal mining activities in south Haryana. The state has collected a total fine of Rs 60 crore since December 2019 from truckers. A total of 3,500 vehicles, including tippers, trucks, tractor-trolleys and earthmovers, have been seized by the police between December 2019 and December 23, 2020. This number also includes 88 vehicles seized in December from Gurugram and 1,235 across South Haryana. Sangwan said that during the anti-mining operations, several police officers have been attacked by truck drivers ferrying illegal material and more than 50 police vehicles have been damaged. Over four dozen cases of attempted murder have been registered against such drivers over the last six months, said the police. The National Green Tribunal(NGT) in 2019 had ordered that all confiscated vehicles be released only after recovery of at least 50% of the showroom value of such vehicles. “Besides, the confiscated vehicle owner will also have to pay a royalty fee, the value of the mineral loaded on the vehicles, along with Rs 10,000 fine, for the vehicle to be released,” said Sangwan, adding that the state has also been suffering severe revenue losses because of the illegal mining activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rta-cracks-down-on-overloading-illegal-mining/story-5ra6ImkN5nDE8rzqs3EsDI.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||Lift-and-loot gangs target commuters on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||Lift-and-loot gangs have once again started resurfacing on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway despite the arrest of eight people in July. The police said, while earlier these gang members used to target office-goers after office hours but the new modus operandi is to offer lifts early morning when people are waiting for public transport. The police said the gangs have been targeting commuters on a 14-kilometre stretch between Shankar Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk, from where 12 incidents have been reported this year. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that young men find it easy to dupe commuters as they know that the condition of public transport is poor across the city and working people are still opting for private or shared cabs. “We have already busted six gangs this year and arrested 16 people. However, cases are still on the rise and, every week, at least three such cases are reported from different areas. Young and unemployed men from Nuh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have been arrested for robbing people after offering them lift. During investigation, they have revealed that they formed gangs inside the jail,” he said. The police said most of the cars used in crime are either stolen or robbed by them. They change the registration number plate to mislead police, and after committing crimes, change the car. The police said they have recovered CCTV footage from six spots and two of the suspects have been identified, who are history-sheeters. KK Rao, commissioner of police said that the expressway is popular among the commuters, who flag down private cabs, which charge them less money as compared to cabs. The suspects adapt new modus operandi after every few months to mislead the police and try to use different stretches but easy targets are available on expressway. “In the recent cases, the modus operandi was to offer a shared ride to men waiting at Iffco Chowk, Shankar Chowk and Signature Tower on NH48, mostly on their way to office in Delhi. Instead of going to Delhi, the gang takes a U-turn after Shankar Chowk and starts threatening the victim to hand over their belongings . They hardly drive for a kilometre before attacking the victim and rob them of cash and valuables,” he said. In five cases, the gangs members were cab drivers and were registered with cab aggregators. The police said with the amount they rob they invest in buying cars after making the down payment. On Tuesday, a Rohtak resident boarded a cab from Iffco Chowk for Faridabad around 8.30am. He said he was carrying ₹2.95 lakh to purchase a new car from Faridabad. “When I boarded swift Dzire, four men were already seated. After going ahead for a few kilometres, they started assaulting me and snatched my wallet, mobile phone and money. Later they pushed me out of the car near Mahipalpur flyover in Delhi and told me not to report the incident to police, said Naresh Kumar, the victim. A case under Section 392 (robbery) was registered at DLF Phase-2 polcie station on Tuesday, said the police. In October, a 52-year-old Satish Kumar, sub-postmaster of Chanakyapuri was assaulted and robbed of ₹27,000 after he boarded a cab from Iffco Chwok. Kumar said that the suspects were in their early twenties.The police have now deployed mufti-clad officers at different locations to nab the accused. “We have increased patrolling along the expressway. In the meantime, we urge people not to take shared rides,” said Rao. The police are yet to make an arrest in all the eight cases between July and December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lift-and-loot-gangs-target-commuters-on-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-tVUrC9vwnVXeTlHV4BvhGM.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||34 wanted persons held by city police this year, 328 arrests in all||At least 34 wanted persons, involved in crimes across Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, have been arrested this year by the Gurugram police. The police in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh had announced monetary rewards totalling Rs 40 lakh for their arrests, data released by Gurugram police on Wednesday revealed.According to police records, four “hardcore criminals” were arrested and seven were injured in police encounters this year. In all, 328 people were arrested this year, including for crimes such as snatching, carjacking and thefts. The police say these arrests resulted in the resolution of nearly four dozen cases of loot, robbery, dacoity, extortion, murder, and snatching.Gangsters such as Pawan Nehra, Rupender alias Nanha, Shahid alias Polo, Imran, Usman, Sombeer, Praveen alias Panna, Rohit alias Lambu, and Sonu alias Prabhat, who carried rewards from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 25,000 for their arrests, were arrested this year.The police have also begun extensive search operations to arrest Sube Singh, a former gang member associated with Kaushal, who is currently in Hisar jail.The police said that while they have been successful in arresting the kingpins of major gangs, many are still operating and have been involved in major crimes this year. “We have booked 350 history sheeters and arrested 34 gangsters this year. The major crackdown came after we arrested the elusive gangster Pawan Nehra. It was not an easy task,” Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao said.The police said that during the pandemic, they had started preparing a database on the gangsters and their relatives, which helped them trace their locations. The crime teams had also taken note of their hideouts and their mobile numbers were surveilled.“During the lockdown, wanted persons were arrested from their hideouts as well as during their visit of family members. We kept a close watch on their friends and relatives, where they tried to take shelter. We carried out operations based on tips and intelligence reports. We have arrested 350 criminals of 50 gangs and have solved over 455 cases. These criminals were wanted in connection with dozens of dacoity, murder, attempt to murder, extortion and robbery cases in the state,” Rao said.The police said they are currently identifying persons involved in petty and unorganised crimes like carjacking, vehicle lifting, house thefts and snatching in the city. The station house officers of 41 police stations and police posts across the city have been asked to take stern action against offenders and to keep a close vigil on those who have completed their jail sentences and are living in the areas under their jurisdictions.This year, the Gurugram police arrested 368 proclaimed offenders, 93 bail jumpers and one parole jumper.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that 2020 has been a fruitful year for the Gurugram police. There have been at least five incidents where police managed to arrest gangsters who were wanted for serious offences.“On October 6, the crime unit of Sector 39 had arrested three criminals after a shoot-out from Sohna and 14 days later, on October 20, the crime unit of Palam Vihar had arrested Sombeer alias Chand alias David, of Jind in Palam Vihar area. In November, four criminals who were wanted by the police were also arrested after an encounter, wherein a gangster, identified as Rohit alias Lambu, died during treatment. On December 7, four criminals were arrested after a long chase from Rajasthan border, in which another, identified as Mamman alias Manoj, suffered a gunshot injury and died undergoing treatment,” he said.While releasing the data, Rao said that in 2019, 136 cases of snatching causing hurt were reported and this number has decreased to 41 this year. The police said that there is a 70% decrease in snatchings and 29 of the 41 cases this year have been solved. Last year, 4,084 vehicle thefts were reported and this has decreased to 2,658 cases this year, of which 537 have been traced. Vehicle thefts reduced by 37%, said Rao.Last year, 1,252 cases of burglaries were reported and this year, the number has reduced to 787, of which 249 have been solved. Police said that during the pandemic, houses were locked and thieves took advantage of the situation. Despite this, there has been a dip of 37%, said Rao.The number of dacoity cases has also decreased by 35%, from 17 in 2019 to 11 this year, said police, adding that the number of murders has dipped from 103 in 2019 to 82 this year, of which 64 have been solved.Rao said seven gangs, consisting of 23 members, involved in murders were arrested and Rs 22 lakh recovered from them. “We have arrested 56 people of 24 gangs who were involved in vehicle lifting and Rs 67 was recovered from their possession. Around 22 people of nine gangs were arrested for snatching incidents and Rs 19 lakh recovered from their possession,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/34-wanted-persons-held-by-city-police-this-year-328-arrests-in-all/story-XOOX8qKVYLQq65m8h3Ra8L.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||Cabinet okays municipal body for Manesar||The Haryana cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod for constituting a civic body for Manesar, the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), with 29 villages to come under its ambit. The new corporation will cover an area of 124.32 square kilometres, according to the statement issued by the state administration.These 29 villages are among the 39 that were earlier proposed to be included under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). In a state cabinet meeting held under the chairmanship of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, it was decided that villages of Kasan, Khoh, Naharpur Kasan, Nawada, Fatehpur, Dhana, Baskulsa, Bas Haria, Kankrola, Bhangrola, Dhorka, Wazirpur, Badha and Sikanderpur Rampur will now be included under MCM.The MCM will also oversee the areas of Shikohpur, Nakhrola, Bar-gujjar, Naurangpur, Meoka, Hayatpur, Sehrawan, Nainwal, Kukrola, Jhund Sarai 1 and 2, Fazalwas, Gopalpur and Garhi Harsaru.As reported by HT earlier, these areas fall along the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway and include new Gurugram sectors, which have been developed in revenue estates of these villages. The MCM will cater to a population of over 300,000.Sunder Lal Yadav, sarpanch, Sikanderpur Barha, and the president of district sarpanch association, said, “Under the new corporation, the development of the area will be fast-paced. At least 29 villages will be within the limited jurisdiction of the MCM. Villages will get more attention now, with better utilisation of resources.”In November, Khattar had announced setting up a civic body for Manesar, which is an automobile manufacturing hub. In a meeting held on August 22, the MCG decided to bring its jurisdiction around 39 villages. However, residents of some of these villages protested this, as they preferred operating under the panchayat system.Residents of developing sectors beyond Kherki Daula have opposed their inclusion under the Manesar civic body. They want the government to set up a Greater Gurugram corporation, rather than clubbing them with Manesar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cabinet-okays-municipal-body-for-manesar/story-bORlSs1uqpSxll9TusEkXJ.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram more polluted than Manesar this winter||The neighbouring industrial township of Manesar, despite having a heavy presence of factories and other industries, has been recording cleaner air than Gurugram this winter, as per official data recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board in its daily air quality index (AQI) bulletins.The difference in air quality between the two cities has become more pronounced this month. While Gurugram has seen just two days of moderate air in December so far, Manesar has recorded seven days of moderate air and one day of satisfactory air, which Gurugram had none of. Manesar’s average daily AQI for December up to Wednesday comes to 239, indicating poor quality air, while the same for Gurugram comes to 279, also in the poor category, but a full 40 AQI points higher. Experts speculated that this discrepancy is due to favourable meteorology, which may be helping disperse pollutants away from Manesar and toward Gurugram, under the influence of prevailing northwesterly winds.These averages, however, do not capture the daily differences in air quality between the two cities. On any given day going back to October 1, Gurugram’s AQI is 30 to 50 points more than Manesar’s. In the past three months, there have only been 10 days when Manesar had worse air than Gurugam, as per the CPCB data. Moreover, on days when winds changed direction and began originating from the east, for instance between December 9 and 11, Manesar reports a higher AQI than Gurugram city. On December 9, Gurugram’s AQI was recorded at 296 (poor), while Manesar’s was 311 (very poor). On December 11, while Gurugram’s AQI was 256, Manesar’s was 288. Similarly, a change in wind direction was also observed on November 31 and December 1, and subsequently, Manesar had recorded worse air than Gurugram. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “There are multiple factors at play here, and understanding them may be able to help plan local strategies to mitigate air pollution in both locations. The pattern that we are seeing this winter is that Manesar is the least polluted on a majority of days, followed by Gurugram, then Delhi, and then Noida and Ghaziabad. It will take a dedicated study to provide evidence for this claim, but it’s very likely that northwesterly winds are transporting pollutants from the east to the west. Manesar and Gurugram are benefiting from their favourable positions.”Moreover, experts and officials pointed out that Manesar is a less dense urban agglomeration then Gurugram, allowing pollutants to be easily dispersed. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), also said that Manesar may be at an advantage due to its proximity to the Aravalli mountain range, which acts as a pollution sink.“During summer months, Manesar typically records higher AQIs than Gurugram due to presence of orange and red category industries, which are highly polluting. Then, in winter months, Gurugram becomes more polluted. A source apportionment study for the region has been in the pipeline for some time. Once completed, it will give us a clearer explanation for these differences,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-more-polluted-than-manesar-this-winter/story-JhfBG97LEiSmXWYELBf49N.html
23-12-2020||Gurugram||District admin to surveil 113 returnees from UK||The district health department will monitor 113 passengers who arrived in Gurugram from the United Kingdom over the last four weeks, to identify coronavirus cases and especially those infected with a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Increasing the surveillance measures, a senior health official said that contact tracing exercise has been initiated to quickly trace immediate contacts, who might have developed symptoms.On December 22, the Haryana director of general health services wrote a letter to the deputy commissioner and chief medical officer of the district, calling for enhanced surveillance, containment and other safety measures to tackle the phylogenetic cluster of SARS-CoV-2 variant in the district.Since Gurugram is in close proximity to the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi and has a substantial population that travels internationally, compared to other districts, the health department has been directed to quicken the pace the contact tracing exercise. The letter stated that any interjection of the SARS-CoV-2 variant virus through passengers with air travel history could pose a critical risk for pandemic management in Haryana.“There are at least 113 people who have travelled recently (to the UK) from November 25 to December 20. Our teams will contact them and collect samples if detected with symptoms,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“Considering the new strain of the virus, the samples of the suspected cases will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genomic sequencing through spike gene-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),” he said.Daily calls will be made to the 113 persons to monitor influenza symptoms, such as fever, cough and cold, over the last 28 days.According to the Central government guidelines, as a part of immediate steps, travellers who are found positive on arrival have to be sent for institutional quarantine or to isolation facilities set up by the district administration. Those who do not test positive will also be advised to isolate themselves at home for seven days and to be monitored medically.For surveillance and follow up measures, RT-PCR test would be administered after seven days of their arrival. In case if any person develops symptoms after seven days, they have to be tested through RT-PCR. If found positive, they would be tested between fifth and tenth day, as per the ICMR guidelines, using the RT-PCR kits.On December 21, India suspended all its flights to and fro from the UK between December 23 and December 31 to check the transmission of a new strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-admin-to-surveil-113-returnees-from-uk/story-r6pCvyS5aq9apGyQYWhOFP.html
23-12-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand assembly passes umbrella university bill which was returned by Guv for reconsideration||On the third day of the winter session of assembly, Uttarakhand assembly passed Uttarakhand University Bill, 2020, which was returned by the Governor for reconsideration earlier this month. The bill, aimed at governing all universities in the state under one umbrella law, was passed by the state assembly in September this year and later sent to the governor for her consent. However, she had returned it to the government on Saturday with some observations/points for reconsideration by the state government. The bill was, however, not included in the agenda of the House in the morning but was added during the meeting of the business advisory committee after lunch. An official of the education department, on the condition of anonymity, said, “As per the Governor’s observations, some of its points were reconsidered including one on the selection process of vice-chancellors. Now, with the change made, the process of selection will go through the government but its consent is not necessary.” Also read: Summit called off due to Covid, mutually agreed, underline India, Russia“She had also asked to keep the retirement age of vice-chancellors at 65 instead of 70 mentioned in the bill. It has, however, been kept 70 only without any change,” said the official. Parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said, “The House has passed six bills, including the Uttarakhand University Bill, 2020, with some changes as per the Governor’s observations while returning it to the government.” The new law is aimed at bringing all government and private universities of the state under one umbrella and all institutes under these universities will follow the same rules. The state has 11 government universities and 18 private universities which are all governed by their own rules, thus having different norms of functioning. It would replace the Uttar Pradesh University Act, 1973, which has been in force since Uttarakhand’s formation in 2000. The act was conceptualised last year in August by state higher education minister after the department received several complaints regarding high fee charged by private universities and other demands by such institutes. The new act aims to help remove the irregularities that are currently there in the governance of different universities of the state, paving a path for better educational standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-assembly-passes-umbrella-university-bill-which-was-returned-by-guv-for-reconsideration/story-nkSePr3IbLdlmOyZl8OXOL.html

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed by the XEN’s of both departments, informed cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who is also the MLA from Mohali. This is a matter of huge relief to the residents of Sohana, Kumbra, and those of other localities falling in Sector 66 to 69 and Sectors 76 to 80 who were paying relatively much higher user charges as levied by GMADA. Pertinently, GMADA charges Rs 10 per 1000 litres on average while the MC charges around Rs.1.80 for the same quantity of water. Hence, “This MoU will result in an annual saving to the tune of approximately Rs.7 to 8 crores for the residents of the said localities,” said Sidhu. ‘Mohali being developed as model city’He said that Mohali is being developed as Model City in terms of development. The developmental works in residential complexes, colonies, markets and parks are in full swing. Over Rs. 3.5 crore has been spent on the internal development of various residential societies. Works worth Rs 60 lakh are underway in the Housefed Apartment while another Rs 40 lakh has been approved for additional works. Similarly, funds for additional works at Joginder Vihar and Guru Teg Complex have also been approved, he said while adding that the state government is the first to initiate internal development of residential societies The minister further informed that open-air gyms are to come up in every big park of the city and a resolution has been passed by the civic body to commence setting up 20 open-air gyms in the city. He flagged off a tractor and eight water tankers with the capacity of 4000 litres each at the Municipal Bhawan in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-hands-over-water-supply-to-mohali-mc/story-Z9hTZXyPuNuMYdW0fuZZhJ.html

23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana civic body heads for choppy waters as garbage-lifting company hands its notice||At a time when the municipal corporation (MC) is struggling to meet the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT’s) solid waste management mandates, the civic body has found itself facing another unexpected quandary with the A2Z company, which was responsible for lifting and processing waste in the city, serving its termination notice. The company will continue to meet its obligations till February 4, after which the MC will be on its own. Come February, it will fall on the civic body to make alternate arrangements for door-to-door garbage collection for 30 of the city’s 95 wards, lift garbage from around 45 secondary dumping points and run the static compactors and the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant at the main dumping site.The fallout In August, the NGT’s monitoring committee directed the MC to submit a ₹10-lakh bank guarantee with the Punjab Pollution Control Board, which was to be encashed if the civic body failed to ensure door-to-door collection of waste and source segregation before November 30. The deadline has passed but the MC is yet to complete the projects. While the NGT is yet to take action against the civic body, the company’s decision has put the MC in hot water. This may impact Swachh Survekshan 2021 rankings, as the Union ministry’s inspections may take place in the initial months of 2021.However, at present, the civic body is not in a position to take up garbage lifting responsibilities. An MC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “On an average, around 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city on a day-to-day basis. The company has deployed over two dozen tippers for shifting the garbage from the secondary dumping sites to the main dump at Tajpur Road. However, the MC does not have the infrastructure to deal with solid waste and officials must think on their feet to find a solution to the predicament.” Delayed payments forced company’s hand Though the civic body has served multiple notices to the company for improper functioning, company officials said the MC too had failed to honour its part of the deal. A company official, who did not wish to be named, said, “One of the primary reasons for handing in the notice was the civic body’s delay in making monthly payments of around ₹1 crore, which is ‘tipping fee’ for transporting garbage to the main dump. No payments have been made since June.” “The civic body also failed to arrange a buyer for RDF is generated at the plant. It was us to process the entire waste generated in the city and process RDF, despite the paucity of shortage space. MC to explore legal optionsMC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the civic body was looking into the legal aspects of the situation. “If required, the MC will take care of solid waste management in the city. Further action will be taken after discussing the issue with mayor Balkar Sandhu,” said Sabharwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-civic-body-heads-for-choppy-waters-as-garbage-lifting-company-hands-its-notice/story-3GePDRrwTlDFsoR8biVp2N.html

The victim, Parminder Singh, swallowed pesticide tablets in a bid to end his life. He recorded the shocking incident on his phone and shared the recording with his friends and relatives. The recording has been widely shared since his death. A day after his death, police booked the landlord Harmel Singh, his son Parvinder Singh, his wife Narinderpal Kaur and an accomplice Pardeep Singh, all residents of the Jattana village, for abetment of suicide .The victim’s wife, Ranjit Kaur, said, “Three days ago (December 20) our landlord, Harmel, threw all our belongings out of our house. He was accompanied by a few men. Only our 16-year-old son was present when the house was forcibly vacated.” Collaborating her story, their neighbour, Gurdeep Singh, said, “When Parminder returned home, he was visibly shocked to find his belongings, valuables, and furniture scattered across the street.” Ranjit told the police that her husband then asked Harmel to return ₹5 lakh, which Parminder had given to the accused’s younger brother in 2018 for buying the house.Harmel told Parminder that his brother had died a year ago and he was unaware of any transaction that might have taken place between them, Ranjit said. Parminder then urged Harmel to either return the money or get the sale deed of the house registered in his name. However, Harmel refused to do either, she told the police, adding that Parminder was disturbed by Harmel’s refusal to honour the transaction. On the same day, Parminder consumed the tablets in a vacant room and sent the video to his family. Upon receiving the video, his family rushed him to the hospital where he succumbed on Tuesday. Station house officer (SHO) Sukhwinder Singh said all four accused had been booked and a search was on to arrest them. A case was registered under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused have been absconding since the incident.HELPLINESIf you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Widening of Ludhiana’s BRS Nagar Canal bridge: Taken by surprise, commuters fume over bottleneck||A day after the sudden barricading of the 500m stretch from Pakhowal Road Canal Bridge to Hero Bakery Chowk to facilitate construction of the rail over bridge (ROB) and road under bridge (RUB) caught commuters unawares, the municipal corporation and irrigation department kicked off a project to widen one of the two BRS Nagar Canal bridges on Wednesday, much to motorists’ dismay.A bottleneck has been created on the site with two-lane traffic diverted to a single bridge. Earlier, only one-way traffic was allowed on both bridges. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu flagged off the project and traffic snarls were witnessed on the site soon after. Ashu said the width of the bridge will be increased from the existing four metres to nine metres. The project, which is being undertaken under the Smart City Mission, will approximately cost ₹1.4 crore. Authorities say the bridge will be reconstructed within 50 days. A popular demand Residents have been clamouring for widening of the bridge since March, 2019, after four youngsters, including two siblings, were killed after their car plunged into the Sidhwan Canal after crashing into one of the railings of the bridge. The police had said the accident had taken place due to overspeeding. Nonetheless, residents demanded that the railing of the bridge, which is made of bricks, should be strengthened to stop vehicles from plunging into the canal in case of a mishap. ‘Unsound timing’While maintaining that the project was much needed in view of the increasing traffic congestion in the area, locals derided the timing of the undertaking. A commuter said, “The MC should have delayed the project as construction is already taking place on Pakhowal Road and Ferozepur Road. The flow of traffic has already been disrupted on Ferozepur Road due to the ongoing elevated road project and the closure of a 500m stretch on Pakhowal Road has also triggered traffic snarls in Sarabha Nagar and Model Town Extension area.” Punjab Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma said,”The civic body should have properly scheduled the construction projects as movement of traffic has already been hit on Ferozepur Road, Malhar Road, Pakhowal Road.”Meanwhile, Ashu urged the residents to take alternative routes and cooperate with authorities, saying once completed, the projects will ensure smooth movement of traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/widening-of-brs-nagar-canal-bridge-taken-by-surprise-commuters-fume-over-bottleneck/story-hfuwgreVOHzcwuBzhvNWRK.html
23-12-2020||Kolkata||After joining BJP, Suvendu Adhikari called ‘traitor’ in hometown by TMC||Four days after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah, former Bengal minister Suvendu Adhikari on Wednesday was branded a “traitor” and his family was targeted at the first Trinamool Congress (TMC) roadshow and rally at Kanthi, his hometown in Bengal’s East Midnapore district, since the defection. Before the rally, there was a clash between the BJP and the TMC workers in the district’s Ramnagar area. The rally was organised by Akhil Giri, TMC lawmaker from Ramnagar and a known detractor of Adhikari. Adhikari’s followers announced that he will hold a counter-rally at Kanthi on Thursday. Adhikari avoided the media. On Tuesday, Adhikari addressed his first rally as a BJP leader alongside party’s state president Dilip Ghosh in Burdwan district. Accusing the TMC of being involved in smuggling of cows, coal and sand, he said, “If the TMC returns to power it will start an illegal kidney trade as well.” The ruling party hit back on Wednesday on Adhikari’s own turf. Also read: Summit called off due to Covid, mutually agreed, underline India, Russia“Suvendu is no strongman in Bengal politics. He lost the first assembly and Lok Sabha polls. He won his first assembly election from Kanthi South in 2006 but only after his father, the incumbent, vacated the seat. He was given two important portfolios in the cabinet. What more did he want? He is a traitor. Kanthi is not the kingdom of any family,” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said at the rally.Roy even called Adhikari Mir Zafar, the general who betrayed Shiraj-ud-Daulah, Bengal’s last independent nawab who was defeated by the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The battle marked the launch of British rule in India. On December 19, Adhikari and six other TMC legislators, a TMC Lok Sabha member, three MLAs from the Left and Congress and at least 20 other district-level leaders of the ruling party joined the BJP at Shah’s rally in Midnapore town. This marked the biggest defection of elected TMC leaders in the run-up to the assembly polls due in about five months.For months, the dissident leaders had voiced their grievance against Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the party last year after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. “A few days ago, I organised a meeting where Abhishek and Kishor were present. Suvendu told Abhishek in front of me that he had nothing to say against Abhishek. After joining the BJP, Suvendu called him an extortionist. Who does he think he is?” Roy told the crowd. Though Suvendu Adhikari is the only member of his family to join the BJP, his father and two brothers were conspicuous by their absence at the rally. TMC workers who walked past their home in the heart of Kanthi town shouted slogans and called them traitors. Suvendu Adhikari represented East Midnapore’s Nandigram seat where a long land movement helped Mamata Banerjee oust the Left Front government in 2011. His resignation from the state assembly was accepted by the speaker on Monday. Adhikari’s father, Sisir Adhikari, is the eldest among the TMC’s Lok Sabha members and has been Mamata Banerjee’s close associate since the party’s birth in 1998. Sisir Adhikari and his elder son, Dibyendu, represent two Lok Sabha constituencies in East Midnapore. The youngest son of the family heads the civic body in Kanthi town. Scoffing at Wednesday’s rally, the state BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “How many people in that crowd were from Kanthi? The crowd was ferried from Nandigram.”Incidentally, no senior BJP leader is scheduled to attend Adhikari’s rally on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-joining-bjp-suvendu-adhikari-called-traitor-in-hometown-by-tmc/story-g2F8gvXOUPC9hJVUNvuwcP.html

Every section of the society wants to get rid of the existing government and wants to bring back the Congress in the state. The process of change will begin with local body elections,” he said.The former CM said farmers are agitating on the Delhi borders for nearly a month but instead of addressing their problem, the government is ignoring one of the biggest farmer movements in the history of the country. “Instead of fulfilling its responsibility regarding SYL, the BJP is only engaged in theatrics. The Hansi-Butana canal was built during the Congress government but the BJP did not take a single step to bring water in it. We built Dadupur Nalvi Canal but the BJP filled it up. The decision of the Supreme Court came in favour of Haryana four years ago but the state government did not take any action. The people of Haryana now understand both policy and intent of the BJP and this is why farmers, workers, traders and other segments will not fall for their tricks,” he added.Hooda, who came to seek votes for Congress president candidate for Rewari municipal council Vikram Yadav, said people remember the work carried out under his leadership. “New railway lines were laid in Rewari, hospitals, universities, mini secretariats were constructed. People know the difference because the BJP government has done nothing for people of Rewari,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-body-polls-will-decide-future-of-politics-in-haryana-hooda/story-61agVSvOp0Au7wEFMPD6PN.html

The cabinet approved gross contribution of ₹4,699 crore as the state government’s share towards the project cost. It also nominated administrative secretary, town and country planning department as nodal officer for signing of agreements and other related documents with NCRTC for implementation of the project.

Keeping in view balanced regional growth, the state has been divided into four categories blocks (industrially developed, intermediate development, industrially backward areas and industrially most backward areas) based on industrial development. This policy places a special emphasis on development of the MSME sector and their business growth. It envisages bringing up a paradigm shift from being a regulator to a facilitator of MSMEs. To reduce the cost of doing business in the state and enhance industry competitiveness , the policy offers an array of attractive fiscal incentives to MSME, large, mega and ultra-mega enterprises. “The Ultra-Mega and Mega and Cluster projects as defined under this policy will also be considered by Haryana Enterprises Promotion Board (HEPB) for special package of incentives,” said an official.

The coloniser will be allowed to provide additional 0.5 ECS parking space per dwelling unit, which will be optional, against which it can allot one car parking space for each dwelling unit. The coloniser will be allowed to recover not more than 5% of the cost of flat against such allotment of car parking space. In cases where licenses under AHP 2013 already stand granted and building plans stand approved without availing the optional 0.5 ECS per dwelling unit parking space, the colonisers will be required to submit the consent of at least two thirds of the allottees as per the rules.New MC for Manesar The state government has decided to constitute a new municipal corporation (MC) at Manesar in Gurugram district by including 29 villages adjoining it.

The cricketer-turned-politician will inaugurate the first such canteen in Gandhi Nagar on Thursday, followed by another in Ashok Nagar on the Republic Day, his office said.“I have always felt that everybody has the right to healthy and hygienic food irrespective of caste, creed, religion or financial condition. It is saddening to see the homeless and destitute not being able to get even two square meals a day,” Gambhir said.The MP has planned to open at least one ‘Jan Rasoi’ canteen in each of the 10 assembly constituencies in East Delhi.“The ‘Jan Rasoi’ at Gandhi Nagar, one of the biggest wholesale garment markets in the country, will be a full modern canteen which will provide lunch to those in need for just Re 1,” according to a statement from his office.It will have a capacity to seat 100 people at a time but due to the Covid-19 pandemic only 50 people will be allowed at present, it said.The lunch will comprise rice, lentils and vegetable curries.The project is being funded by Gautam Gambhir Foundation and the MP’s personal resources, and has no government support, the statement said.Some states run canteens which provide subsidised food to the needy but the national capital has no such facility where low priced good food is made available to people, Gambhir said.“During the lockdown too, we witnessed thousands of migrant labourers being forced to leave the city due to lack of food and other basic resources,” he said.The BJP MP said it was his vision that every person in Delhi gets healthy food and clean water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gautam-gambhir-s-jan-rasoi-to-serve-lunch-at-rs-1-in-east-delhi/story-KBIEKlWXXnQ8sDZMA14rHK.html
23-12-2020||Noida||Noida airport region drew Rs 7,617 crore in investments amid pandemic: Report||Not withstanding the Covid-19 pandemic, the region surrounding the upcoming Noida International Airport has got investments worth Rs 7,617 crore this ongoing fiscal including those from some “big ticket” Fortune 500 firms, a top government official said. From April till December, industrial plots were allotted to 911 companies which are expected to create 1.91 lakh jobs in this region in western Uttar Pradesh, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) CEO Arun Vir Singh told PTI in an interview. Singh, also the CEO of the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), cited the figures as he asserted that the mega greenfield project has triggered massive infrastructure development including road and rail connectivity in Uttar Pradesh’s Jewar region -- around 70 km from the national capital. Jewar, which falls along the Yamuna Expressway, would be connected to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and also have a metro link to Greater Noida besides the ambitious high-speed Delhi-Varanasi Bullet Train having a stoppage at the Noida airport, he said. “All this will be ready before the first flight takes off which is expected in December 2023 or January 2024,” Singh told PTI. He said the DPR (detailed project report) of the airport mentions a station for the stoppage of a bullet train that is proposed between Delhi and Varanasi, while a metro rail line is also approved for connectivity from Greater Noida to Jewar. “There will not be any separate direct metro line from Delhi airport to Noida airport,” he clarified. Besides the rail connectivity, he said, Jewar is being connected by road to Haryana’s Ballabhgarh, which falls on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. “The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has agreed for this 30-km road project and talks are underway between the state governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for acquisition of land on this route to connect Jewar and Ballabhgarh,” he said. “An interchange has already been approved on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and work will soon begin on that,” he added. He said the YEIDA, which manages development along the 165-km-long Yamuna Expressway, allotted 911 plots for industries from April till December this year despite the pandemic and the lockdown. “Altogether investments worth Rs 7,617 crore have been made in the region during this 8-9 month period. This has led to creation of 1.91 lakh jobs in the region. These include investments from some big ticket companies which feature in Fortune 500,” Singh said, but declined to name the companies which have made investments. He asserted that with the proposed infrastructure and connectivity this region, the Yamuna Expressway region will be among the best for investment in the country in times to come. “The airport at Jewar is going to be the biggest airport in India and the second biggest in Asia,” he said. “Our tag line says: ‘The future is here’ and we are working with the same belief and confidence under the guidance of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-airport-region-drew-rs-7-617-crore-in-investments-amid-pandemic-report/story-2lfUupS4RjX4mbY71CVySJ.html

23-12-2020||Pune||Kolse Patil: I’m under MVA government surveillance, but will hold Elgar Parishad||Former high court judge justice (retired) BG Kolse Patil has accused the state government led by Uddhav Thackeray of keeping a watch over him and his social activities while stressing that he will once again organise the Elgar Parishad this year ahead of the Bhima Koregaon anniversary on January 1, 2020. Kolse Patil said, “Wherever I go the state police follows me. They click my vehicle pictures. They come to my society and question my driver. They do it deliberately to tarnish my name as a bad man. Earlier, security was provided to me by the then Fadnavis government. Once the new government came to power, my security was withdrawn.” Patil further said that he was organising the Elgar Parishad at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch in Pune where the venue fees of Rs 40,000 have already been paid despite having no permission from the local authorities. “We have already booked the hall, paid the charges and sought permission from the police for holding the anti-caste meet. We will invite speakers who are progressive and speak against fascism. If the police don’t give us permission, then we will go to the high court,” Kolse Patil said. Earlier, the former high court judge had questioned the state government for withdrawing security in a Facebook post. Kolse Patil had written in a post, “Why are the police seen following me at my public meetings? Retired Supreme Court judge PB Sawant and retired justice Kolse Patil were the conveners of the first Elgar Parishad held on Dec 31, 2017. The next day, violence broke out in the village of Bhima Koregaon during the annual gathering of Dalits on the occasion of the bicentenary of the 1818 Battle of Koregaon Bhima. According to the charge sheet, Maoist forces were behind organizing the conclave and funded the meet. As many as fourteen academics and activists have been arrested from various parts of the country for suspected Maoist links in connection with the case which has been taken over by the NIA from Pune police. The police had in their charge sheet stated, “The speeches at the conclave, held on December 31 last year to mark the 200th anniversary of the Koregaon-Bhima battle, had fuelled the violence a day later.” Patil said “It was I who was instrumental in the defeat of the BJP government in the state before the formation of the present government. Whichever government comes to power, it is the RSS which rules the country. The new government and ministers are not aware of how the system works. We will keep spreading awareness of creating an equal society based on the principles of Chhatrapati Shahu-Phule and Ambedkar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/kolse-patil-i-m-under-mva-government-surveillance-but-will-hold-elgar-parishad/story-0MLYGNwCA5tb3m0i2AfPFJ.html

In an order, NHM director Chhavi Bhardwaj said, “Ziqitza Health Care Limited had been give the responsibility of operating Deendayal Mobile Hospital’s vehicles equipped with all the necessary medical services to provide emergency treatment to people residing in remote areas. But the health department has been receiving complaints against the mobile hospitals for a long time.”Also Read: MP govt tightens law against food, drug adulteration amid Interpol warning on fake Covid-19 vaccine“The company was asked to improve the facilities of the mobile hospitals several times but nothing happened. Now, serious irregularities have been found in the services. The state government has decided to stop the operations with immediate effect,” reads the order. According to an officer of the state health department, the mobile medical units were operating without doctors and staff nurses. Many hospitals were found unequipped with machines. During inspections, officers of the health department also found fake entries of villagers who never used the mobile hospital as patients. “The health department officials have been inspecting the services of mobile hospitals in every district in the past six months and found grievous irregularities. The health department sent a show-cause notice to the company in the first week of December and asked them to reply within a week. The decision of halting the services was taken on Monday after the health department officials didn’t find the reply satisfactory,” said the officer, requesting anonymity.Every month, National Health Mission paid Rs1.75 lakh for the operation of MMUs. Ziqitza Health Care Limited project head Jitendra Sharma, “We have received the order. The management is looking into the matter. If the health department finds some irregularities, we will improve them.” MP health department minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said, “The step was taken to improve the health facilities in MP. Now, mobile hospitals with better facilities will be introduced.” The opposition attacked the BJP-led state government for failing to provide health facilities effectively. MP Congress Committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “Instead of improving the facilities, the state government blamed the company and stopped an important facility. More than a company, the state government is responsible for irregularities due to a weak monitoring system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-government-halts-services-of-14-year-old-deendayal-mobile-hospital/story-fAp7F4J6hYvYpdrkD5XOzJ.html
23-12-2020||Pune||‘There has just been no real development in the past three years’||Why did you want to merge with the PMC? We had approached the court and filed a public litigation to include 34 fringe villages in PMC limits. After that, the state government had filed an affidavit in the Bombay high court that state will merge villages, step by step. In 2017, the state merged 11 villages in PMC limits. The reason was gram panchayats are not capable of providing basic facilities to the increasing population in villages. These villages are fully urbanised and the gram panchayats are helpless when it comes to development. What kind of facilities have you got from the PMC in the last three years? We were happy when we were included in the PMC. We thought, now we will get basic facilities. However, there is no substantial development in the last three years. We got two representatives for a huge 81 square km area. The water problem remains the same. There is little improvement with the roads.What are the reasons for the slow development? These villages haven’t got adequate representation in the PMC. At present, there are only two corporators who are representing the area. They have not got enough money for development. The corporation estimated Rs 2000 crore for development of these villages.

23-12-2020||Pune||Expanding Pune: Merger to what end? 11 villages live the reality||PUNE If the recent announcement of the merger of 23 areas – described in the government records as villages - into the Pune Municipal Corporation limits, has left local residents upbeat, they need to pause; and look at their surrounding neighbourhoods. Eleven areas were included in the Pune civic limits in 2017 with the hope that it will finally taste the fruits of development.Basic amenities continue to elude these 11 villages. The state of public amenities, according to locals in these villages, now a part of the PMC, has remained unsatisfactory even after three years.Villages like Kharadi, Ambegaon, Dhanori and Keshavnagar, which have been merged into Pune, have localities that don’t even have basic infrastructure, like a drainage system. Will the PMC be able to do justice to the 23 new areas that will be merged in the next few months? Especially given that the development of the 11 areas merged in 2017 remains only on paper. “We were hoping that the PMC will resolve our basic problems such as water, roads and drainage. However, nothing has changed. We are getting water every alternate day for only an hour,” says Satish Shirwale, a resident of Keshavnagar. According to Shirwale, while development hasn’t taken place, people have been forced to pay additional property tax post the inclusion into PMC. Located on the eastern part of Pune, Keshavnagar has population of 30,000. In 2019, PMC aimed to collect at least Rs 150 crore through property tax from the 11 areas, which has seen massive development given their proximity to city and relatively cheaper land prices. Another resident of Keshavnagar, Sheetal Kanoje, says the corporation had failed to develop amenities like roads and play grounds. “It is like living in a village within the city limits. For us, Pune’s city is converting into a smart city and we still live in a village lacking basic infrastructure.” Two years after the merger of these areas, PMC conducted a bypoll, when two corporators were elected to represent this large area with a population, as per the 2011 census, of 2.78 lakh, which has now reached four lakh. These areas cover approximately 81 sq kms.The corporators claimed that with inadequate funds, development in these areas has become difficult, while the state government has not even started a development plan for these areas. Ashwini Pokale, corporator of Dhayari, part of the 11 merged villages said, “There are a lot of basic problems that remain the same after three years of the merger. We have not seen development. There are no good roads, water supply, drainage or garbage collection. In the city area, PMC spends around Rs 10-15 crore per year in small wards. The corporation spent around Rs 25 crore in the big areas of the 11 merged villages, but the funds are little when the total area is considered. They did repair existing roads in some villages.” While the PMC has sanctioned Rs 100 crore in 2019 in its annual budget for the merged villages, the civic body has not yet been able to spend it to carry out basic development like roads, water, garbage, street lights and healthcare. Abhishek V Barve, a resident of Blue Springs Society, Ambegaon Khurd, said, “For the last three years, the corporation has given excuses that they don’t have enough money for development. The corporation is charging property tax which is more than the gram panchayat taxes. We are ready to pay taxes, but we want basic facilities. However, we are not getting it yet.” Located on the southern part of Pune, Ambegaon has grown exponentially with multiple real estate projects. It is also adjacent to the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, which attracts heavy traffic. Recently, the central public works department undertook the widening of the Katraj-Navale bridge which passes through Ambegaon. Residents like Mangesh Joshi, an engineer, said the road widening will help decongest traffic, though issues of garbage and sanitation need to be addressed in Ambegaon, where he recently purchased a flat. Ambegaon was just another village on the outskirts of Pune’s city limits until 1999, when it became one of the few villages to be incorporated within the Pune municipal limits. Seventy-five per cent of this area was incorporated then, and the remaining part, which was still under the gram panchayat, was merged in 2017. Ambegaon has mostly developed as a residential hub for the middle class who wish to move in to larger spaces at affordable rates. Ganesh Dhore, another corporator representing Phursungi, says, “Corporation is collecting taxes for the last three years. However, they have not provided the service that we want. Most of the villages receive water through tankers. In some parts of the village there is alternate-day water supply. Garbage collection and disposal is another big problem. Corporation has repaired some main roads. One village gets hardly Rs 2 crore for development. In this year, due to Covid-19, a tender of only Rs 70 lakh has been floated so far.” Namdev Gavali, a resident of Lohegaon says, “We are still living in a village. We are not part of Pune city as we are lack basic facilities. Pune is becoming a smart city, and we are struggling to get water. We are live in an apartment, but face garbage collection and drainage problems. We haven’t seen any significant change in our life after merging with the PMC.” Lohegaon, like other areas merged in 2017, enjoys an urban-rural mix; the benefits of urbanisation and mountains on the outskirts as a boundary, with a highway passing through the area. Thus, developers and builders from Pune and Mumbai have strategically built large residential complexes offering a variety of choices from simple, to lavish homes. The 2017 mergerThe decision to merge 11 areas was part of a 2014 notification issued by state government to originally include 34 areas in the PMC. Accordingly, the state facilitated the merger of 11 areas in 2017, expanding Pune. Now the state has given the nod for 23 more areas to be included in PMC limits. Still waiting for PMC’s development“We are still living in a village. We are not part of Pune city as we lack basic facilities. Pune is slowly becoming a smart city, and we are struggling to get water. We live in an apartment, but face garbage and drainage problems.” Namdev Gavali, Lohegaon“In last three years, we are paying only property tax to PMC. We are still waiting for basic facilities like water, road and drainage. We have to get water from private tankers. We heard that PMC has decided to implement a 24x7 water supply project, but, I don’t know when we will get water.” Vijay Jadhav, Undri“The corporation had failed to develop amenities like roads and play grounds. It is like living in a village within the city limits. For us, Pune’s city is converting into a smart city and we still live in a village lacking basic infrastructure.” Sheetal KanojeKeshavnagar“Corporation is collecting taxes for the last three years.

The Haryana government has already declared the Faridabad City Transport Service Limited to act as the state transport undertaking within the jurisdiction of the Faridabad Metropolitan Development Authority. The BJP-JJP coalition government on Wednesday approved the proposal of the department to declare the authority as RTA to specify the routes/areas for the grant of stage carriage permits. It will also issue a time table, working hours of the crew and parking places in respect of the city bus service to be operated by Faridabad City Transport Service Limited. The development authority will act as the RTA exclusively for the Faridabad City Transport Service Limited in respect of the operation of its city bus services in Faridabad. “This decision will lead to coordinated transport services in Faridabad,” an official spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/faridabad-metropolitan-authority-to-be-rta-for-city-bus-services/story-HwyHTplcKLpWm1VulJ2fLO.html
23-12-2020||Lucknow||Those who don’t want to see farmers happy, misleading them: UP CM||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the continuation of farmers’ protests despite the government’s attempts to clear their apprehensions on the new agri laws shows cultivators are being “provoked and misled” by the Opposition. “It is being said repeatedly said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) will not be abolished but farmers are still getting misled on this. It is being said again and again that the ‘mandis’ will not end. The prime minister has said mandis are being connected with technology, but farmers are being misled on this as well. What kind of politics is this?” Adityanath said. Addressing a program organised on the 118th birth anniversary of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, the chief minister said, “In order to bring prosperity to farmers, the government has made extensive reforms and brought the new farm laws. But those who did not like progress and development of the country and happiness on the face of the farmers are misleading and provoking them.” Taking a dig at the Opposition, he said, “These (opposition parties) will not allow things to be done in the interest of farmers. The government is working in a dedicated way for the farmers and after Independence, no government at the Centre, except the one led by the BJP, has brought so many schemes in the interest of farmers.” The chief minister alleged that people who do politics in the name of farmers become silent on their issues when they come to power. “In former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh’s area, Ramala sugar mill was awaiting revival for the last 30 years. I thank the Minister of Sugarcane, who arranged for the daily crushing of 50,000 quintals of sugarcane last year under the expansion of the mill,” he said. Adityanath said the central and state governments are working with full commitment for the interests of farmers. “The government’s commitment is clearly visible on every occasion. In UP, about 16.5 per cent of the country’s population lives, but due to the hard work of farmers, this state contributes 21 per cent to the total food production of the country,” he said. He said, “We already have four agricultural universities. Recently, a central agricultural university was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jhansi.  Presently, 89 Krishi Vigyan Kendras are working in the state with a resolve to double the income of farmers with the help of new concepts and new techniques.”      Earlier in the day, the chief minister garlanded a statue of Chaudhary Charan Singh and paid tribute to him. He also felicitated many progressive farmers and provided tractors to some of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/those-who-don-t-want-to-see-farmers-happy-misleading-them-up-cm/story-SBquCzq7B8FRfgK8OpIpUI.html
23-12-2020||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Pune- the hero with a thousand faces||There is no great agony of holding an untold tale of glorious times inside you! Our very own city of Pune holds that fascinating personal story within it.In my capacity as an indologist and historian, I appoint myself as its biographer and take on the task of “sutradhara”, thus, narrating this story through a series of write-ups. Beyond academic studies, technical reports, analytical information, town planning maps and cultural festivals, there is so much more to our collective dwelling place we call home, the dearest Pune. Through this column, I urge to you to wear your detective hat and embark on this journey of discovery of Pune.The history of Pune can be traced back to prehistoric times when first man/woman might have set foot on this land and made it home. Throughout the course of history, Pune has been growing, changing and has been influenced by nature, various rules, cultural processes, development ideas and socio-economic factors. It would not be wrong to say that Pune is not a monolith. There are many “Punes” residing in the present Pune city. Every stone in the corner, pit dug for new construction, monument raised, and bridge built, areas developed and erased, have a bearing of how the city is shaped. What we lack in text, documentation or oral history, is fulfilled by the presence of historical artefacts and heritage structures. These physical aspects in the form of caves, forts, building, temples, wadas, and monuments bear living, yet silent testimony, to the history of the city. We are quite fortunate to find these scattered signs and symbols in our neighbourhood, which point to a distant past or bring forth an interesting fact. This is not just about physical manifestations, but even ideas, reforms, movements, wars, historical and cultural events, have a bearing as to how the city operates today. Pune has a rich history of documenting history and some of the important movements of nationalistic history writing were born in Pune. Through studying contributions of important research institutions working in faculties of Archaeology, History, Indology, Anthropology, Ecology and multidisciplinary sciences, we can put together a far more complete and colourful picture of Pune. So, the protagonist or the hero of our story is Pune. And as famous mythology professor, Joseph Cambell, may put it, it is a hero with thousand faces and multiple identities. The landscape of Pune was occupied way back over few thousands year ago, but the first name Pune has been referred to (afaik!) in a copperplate grant of Rashtrakuta (the dynasty associated with excavation of world famous Kailas at Ellora) king Krishna I, dated to October 16, 758. Pune is referred to “Punya” and a district like headquarter (vishaya) presiding over few thousand villages. We shall see more about it in due course, but the take away is the root and word “Punya” (ṇ and not n- as an ardent Punkar would point out!) which translates to sacred. In subsequent references in other copperplates, Pune has been called Punak-vishaya. In early medieval Pune, it is being referred as Punyeshwar after the temple of Punyeshwar. A 15th century disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (the famous saint from Bengal), Gurudas, describes it as Punyanagar and praises the knowledge and scholarship of the pathshalas (learning centre for Sanskrit scriptures) of Pune. It was renamed for a brief period between 1703-1707 to Persian Muhiyabad by Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb after his own name, Muhi-ud-Din, to commemorate his grandson, Muhi-us- Sunnat according to some scholars. It was medieval Kasbe Pune of the 17th century where Kasba meant a settlement of artisans. It was rechristened “Poona” and “Poonah” under British rule. In cultural context, it is always called as Punyanagar, Punya-kshetra or Punyanagari. Over the years, it has also amassed many epithets such as “Pensioners’ Paradise”, “ Cycle city”, “Oxford of the East”, “Vidyeche Maherghar” (the maiden knowledge hub) , cultural capital of Maharashtra, “Educational hub”, “ IT City”, “Automobile City”, “City of Trees and Hills”, and so on. Each of the above represents the peculiar yet special aspect of Pune’s identity. If you read newspapers (which you are right now!), you might have come across some such as these - “City of Traffic” , “ City of Two-Wheelers” , “Most Polluted City”, “City of Accidents”, all with distinct negative connotations. The recent uncontrolled urbanised development in the city has huge role to play here. But, as we change for better and live up to the name of the “original” smart city, we need to take stock and look back to trace how much our city has lived through. So, welcome everyone on this exciting and yet humbling joy ride we undertake - ‘The Pune Saga’! Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

It will also be known as the Purvanchal office of the Samajwadi Party. The foundation laying ceremony of the camp office will take place after Makar Sankrati on January 14. SP’s Azamgarh district unit president Hawaldar Yadav said whenever Akhilesh visited Azamgarh, a large number of party workers came to see him. Due to space crunch at circuit house or wherever he stayed, it was inconvenient for party workers to meet him. Therefore, the Azamgarh unit of the party recently held a meeting and decided to build an office for the national president in Azamgarh. “A group of people, including diehard supporters and workers of the party, have come forward to donate around one acre of the land in Anwarganj for the proposed office of the SP national president,” said Hawaldar Yadav.

23-12-2020||Lucknow||Noida, Ghaziabad among 5 UP cities with worst air quality in country||While the mercury drops, Uttar Pradesh continues to reel under bad air quality. Five cities of the state top the pollution chart of the country, as per the data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Tuesday. Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad in west UP recorded the worst air quality in the country with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 458. Kanpur in central UP recorded an AQI of 452, while Greater Noida, Meerut and Noida recorded AQIs of 450, 446 and 437 respectively.The state capital of Lucknow recorded an AQI of 412. An AQI above 401 is considered to be severe which not only affects healthy people but severely harms those with pre-existing breathing issues, children and the elderly, as per the CPCB.The AQI of UP cities has recorded a spike since last week.Particulate pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10, along with vehicular and industrial emissions, comprise major pollutants that contribute to higher AQIs. According to experts, cold weather also leads to higher AQIs.Also Read: Air Quality Commission directs switching over of all industries in Delhi to PNGThe Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board has largely been ineffective in controlling the spike in air pollution, experts said.Though the board has issued directions to districts and other government bodies suggesting ways to improve the air quality, the measures have failed to show results.

23-12-2020||Bhopal||MP govt plans Sanskrit only play schools to promote language and tradition||From the next academic session, every district in Madhya Pradesh will have a playschool, where mode of education would be Sanskrit, state education minister said on Tuesday.MP school education department is going to introduce first of its kind playschools, being developed on the concept of a chain of Chinese playschool, where students of class LKG and UKG will be taught speaking, etiquettes, shlokas and names of different objects in Sanskrit language only. “Instead of LKG and UKG, the classes will be known as Arun and Uday. A government school in every district is being developed for teaching Sanskrit to students. Sanskrit is the mother of all languages. Learning Sanskrit will open the minds of students. It will promote both language and Indian tradition and culture,” said school education department minister, Inder Singh Parmar. The minister said the MP State Open School Education Board (MPSOSEB) and Yoga guru Ramdev’s Maharishi Patanjali Sanskrit Sansthan will take care of the syllabus, infrastructure and appointments at the playschools. “The schools are being developed in a way that working parents can leave their 3-4 years old kids at the school at 9 AM and can take them back in the evening. Teachers with knowledge of both Sanskrit and child psychology will be appointed by the government,” said an official of the school education department, who did not wish to be named. Raising a doubt on the viability of this project and the future of the students, educationist, Pankaj Prajapati said, “I have serious doubts about the viability of this project. Why will parents send their kids to a Sanskrit school if they don’t want to see their kids working as priests or lecturers of Sanskrit?,” he asked. “It is good to promote and teach additional languages but to teach only one language- Sanskrit-- used by priests only to perform Hindu rituals, sounds insensible. How will these kids interact with their parents because most of the people don’t know Sanskrit,” said Prajapati. Also Read: MP govt tightens law against food, drug adulteration amid Interpol warning on fake Covid-19 vaccineMaharishi Patanjali Sanskrit Sansthan Director PR Tiwari, who proposed this project to the department, said that the perception of Sanskrit as the language of the priests was part of the problem.“This is the problem with people that they associate Sanskrit with priesthood only. Sanskrit is the mother of all languages because a large number of body parts including the palate, tongue, teeth, lips and nose are in use while speaking Sanskrit. It is not merely a language but a skill, to develop a good sense of speaking,” Tiwari said. “If kids start talking in Sanskrit, it will be very easy for them to learn other languages including French, Spanish, Mandarin and others. In Arun and Uday classes, we will teach everything only in Sanskrit. More than writing, we will prefer speaking in Sanskrit. The languages including Hindi and English will be introduced to these kids in class 1,” he added. The state government has also announced to develop one locality in every district as a Sanskrit colony, where sign boards, nameplate and other things will be written in the Sanskrit language. MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has spoken about promoting Sanskrit on several occasions. In 2017, he announced making Sanskrit a compulsory subject in all schools from class 1 to 12 but the school education department failed to introduce Sanskrit in the primary schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-govt-plans-sanskrit-only-play-schools-to-promote-language-and-tradition/story-jekU1jXzwKmZtV2CW4YF7J.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||At 15.8 degrees Celsius, Mumbai records lowest temperature of the season so far||As temperature in the city dropped further, there was a nip in the air on Wednesday morning. Setting the record for the lowest temperature this season, the Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a temperature of 15.8 degrees Celsius.While the temperature at Santacruz was 2.2 degrees below normal, the Colaba station recorded a minimum temperature of 19.6 degrees Celsius, barely 1.6 degrees above normal. KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD, said that this was the lowest temperature recorded at both stations this season. “This is the second consecutive day when temperatures dropped. It is slightly more windy today,” he said. The lowest minimum temperature recorded in December 2019 was 16.4 degrees Celsius. The year before that, lowest minimum temperatures had dropped to 14.4 degrees Celsius. Also Read: Most cities in northwest India record ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ airTemperatures are likely to remain low for the next couple of days, according to IMD. Meanwhile, with winter conditions persisting, air quality has deteriorated further.As opposed to an air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator-- reading of 183 (moderate) on Tuesday, Wednesday recorded an AQI reading of 200. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. The AQI in Navi Mumbai was recorded at 341, which falls under the very poor category. Bandra Kurla Complex recorded an AQI of 337. Experts from SAFAR said that poor air quality in the winter season is a routine phenomenon and can be attributed to the change in wind directions. “As wind starts flowing from the land instead of the sea, pollution levels increase because the air coming from the land is more polluted,” said a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-15-8-degrees-celsius-mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-so-far/story-9LLBdXa0uvCTkvSLlzbd9H.html

Speaking over the phone, Brijendra Singh said the farmers are demanding a written assurance on the continuation of minimum support price (MSP) and agriculture produce market committee (APMC), and the Union government is ready for amendments. “Repealing the laws is not a solution because farmers have not seen the impact of these laws yet, so they can’t say if it will be positive or negative. Home minister Amit Shah has clearly said the government is ready to propose amendments related to fee structure in notified APMCs and stricter provisions to safeguard farmers’ land rights,” he said.Speaking about the MSP system, he said, “It is good for farmers having large landholdings. But for farmers owning four-to-five acres, it is difficult to save money even after selling crops on MSP. Our government will have to make a system so that farmers can sell their produce with value addition.”On farmers’ demand to bring a law on the MSP, Brijendra Singh said it would be very difficult for the government to purchase all crops on MSP.When asked to comment on his father’s decision to support the farmers, Brijendra said he shared his father’s viewpoint as both are farmers.“My father has retired from electoral politics and he is doing what his soul and mind directs him,” he said.Brijendra also slammed the khap bodies for their decision to socially boycott BJP-JJP leaders who are supporting the new farm laws. “We know about the vested interests of the persons issuing such orders. Khaps should only work for social change, they should not indulge in politics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/repealing-laws-not-a-solution-but-govt-ready-for-amendments-hisar-mp/story-RLNH7HUoACJ1GcyqkbfzTP.html

On Tuesday, the state government put passengers coming from South Africa on the watchlist, apart from Europe and Middle East, who will be put in mandatory institutional quarantine facilities for 14 days.City and district administrations have been asked to keep Covid-19 facilities ready and ramp up testing. District collectors have been given powers to impose night curfew to curb revelries, considering the end of the year. They, however, have to take prior permission from the state government. It has also issued an alert to all airports and seaports about the possible threat of the strain’s spread.Thackeray also directed the state administration to make wearing of masks mandatory and penalise those violating the rule. The directives were issued in a meeting called to review precautionary measures, considering a mutation of Sars-Cov-2, the virus causing Covid-19, found in Britain, believed to spread faster than previous strains.Meanwhile, Maharashtra crossed the 1.9 million mark for Covid-19 cases on Tuesday. Its tally stood at 1,902,458. The toll reached 48,876 as 75 casualties were reported. Of them, 42 were in the past 48 hours, 16 were in the last week and the remaining 17 deaths were from the period of before last week, the health officials said.As the state is recording fewer cases, it is taking more days to complete 100,000 cases. From 1.8 million to 1.9 million cases, it took only 26 days, a significant increase from the eight days to go from 1.4 million to 1.5 million, showed state data.“In the backdrop of discovery of a mutant virus, we cannot take the risk of being negligent. It is found that the mutant is spreading much faster than previous strains. Considering this, the state administration will have to be more vigilant. You will have to do more hard work. Ensure adequate supply of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Develop isolation and quarantine facilities and be prepared keeping in mind the fast spreading variant,” the chief minister directed the officials in a meeting attended by all the divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners, police officials and senior officials from various departments.He asked the state task-force to study if there is any genetic mutation and change in Covid treatment protocol, considering the mutant virus. He also asked local bodies to contact those having comorbidities in their jurisdiction and ask them to take all the necessary precautions.The chief minister further directed to coordinate with other states such as Delhi and others to ensure that any international travellers entering Maharashtra from any other state can be traced.“Masks are playing a significant role in protecting a person from Covid-19 infection, be it the old strain or the new mutant. Hence, wearing of masks should be made mandatory and those found not violating the protocol should be penalised,” Thackeray said.Maharashtra has been maintaining a low number of Covid-19 cases for almost two months. It has been 18 consecutive days since the state is reporting fewer than 5,000 cases.The active cases in the state have further reduced to 58,376 and its percentage against the total number of patients reached 3.06% till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-puts-maharashtra-officials-on-maximum-alert-against-new-virus-strain/story-xt1WIK6vulaLPznggNuYUI.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai-based NGO asks Maharashtra govt to act against environmental violators||Vanashakti, a city-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) has highlighted the need to prioritise and properly register first information reports (FIRs) against those violating the Environment Protection Act (EPA) in a letter it has sent to the principal secretary (environment), divisional commissioner and all collectors. According to the NGO, authorities are getting FIRs registered by lower rank officials, which are subsequently quashed at magistrate courts because they are legally invalid. Vanashakti has appealed that only designated officers should register cases. In its letter, Vanashakti has said that according to EPA, a collector is empowered to register an FIR and under section 19 of the Act, further sub-delegation is not permitted. Other than a collector, those authorised to register FIRs according to the EPA are the head of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB); regional officer of MPCB; secretary of the environment department; and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Yet this practice continues year after year and day after day. None of these FIRs stand the test of law,” wrote Vanashakti in its letter, adding that these invalid FIRs end up indirectly enabling those violating EPA.A recent example is the case from last month in which an area circle officer filed an FIR in Kalwa Police station related to Kharigaon toll plaza region, following a complaint of dumping on wetlands, coastal regulations zone (CRZ) and mangroves area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/green-violations-mumbai-based-ngo-approaches-state/story-rMKMAptfVhyP9xzrKxzm0H.html
23-12-2020||City||Protesting farmers show black flags to Haryana CM in Ambala||Farmers and activists affiliated to the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Charuni) protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws on Tuesday waved black flags, shouted slogans and allegedly blocked Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s cavalcade near Maharaja Agrasen Chowk in Ambala. BKU leaders, however, condemned the incident and disassociated itself from the incident. Senior BKU leader Harkesh Singh Mohri claimed that ‘miscreants’ or ‘outsiders’ were involved in the incident and that the union’s protest was cut to maintain peace. “We had planned to oppose all events of the CM today, but due to this, we decided to end our protests to maintain calm,” he said.Khattar had come to Ambala to address public meetings in support of party’s mayoral and ward candidates for the upcoming civic bodies polls. Later, addressing a rally, the CM said, “Elections are going on and everyone has the freedom to express themselves, but a handful of people say that they won’t allow the chief minister of the state to talk. This is shameful. We have restrained ourselves, we have allowed their gatherings, but we will not use force. All the opposition parties here including Congress, Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) and Haryana Janchetna Party (HJP) – are involved in such activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-farmers-show-black-flags-to-haryana-cm-in-ambala/story-P2Va0NHnr56GAjDpJZtlFO.html
23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana puts in place its Covid-19 vaccine rollout plan||Haryana health department will set up a state-level Covid-19 vaccine store in Kurukshetra and four regional stores in Hisar, Gurugram, Kurukshetra and Rohtak as the state gears up for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in a phased manner starting from Health Care Workers (HCWs). The department has also identified 22 district-level vaccine stores and 659 cold chain points, according to Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (ACS) health. To ensure that the vaccine reaches every district, the health department has arranged 22 vans (insulated) for transportation across the state. The health department has uploaded the data of nearly two lakh HCWs from both private and government sectors on CoWIN portal, apart from identifying 1,800 vaccination session sites and mapping more than 5,000 vaccinators for the process of administering the vaccine. Arora said the Haryana government has meticulously prepared the vaccine rollout plan and is all set to introduce it. He stated that the platform of existing universal immunisation programme of state with enhanced capacity is being used for Covid-19 vaccine. The Covid-19 vaccine introduction will span over a year with multiple groups being included sequentially starting from HCWs. The vaccination will be done at fixed session sites, mapping of session sites are in progress, he added. “As per the Government of India guidelines, the vaccination will be done on election model with the involvement of other departments,” said Arora. On the availability of cold storages, he said the state has sufficient cold chain space to meet out additional requirement for Covid-19 vaccine. Arora said prior experiences of managing huge campaigns like Measles-Rubella (MR) have been an asset and will help the department in formulating practical plans. All districts have been instructed to create additional dry space for storing logistics and majority of the districts have already created extra space for the same, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-puts-in-place-its-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-plan/story-rKevXM04Dv93CVdiipNUvJ.html

23-12-2020||City||Pandemic reduces Gita Mahotsav into an online event||The raging pandemic has reduced Haryana government’s International Gita Mahotsav to a mere online show this year. Unlike previous years when the celebrations used to carry on throughout the month, this year, the annual extravaganza has been limited to a week’s time and only few programmes, such as International Gita Webinar, online Gita Path, among others are being held. Every year lakhs of devotees converge on to the Brahma Sarovar, where several rituals, including lighting of diyas and chanting of mantras, are carried out during Gita Mahotsav; but this time, gatherings have been prohibited.For the benefit of devotees, the Kurukshetra Development Board, which organises the event, has made arrangements for livestreaming of key ceremonies, but the response to this has so far been poor.An official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We are livestreaming key events this year, but there don’t seem to be many takers. Only about 600 people watched the ceremony through our Facebook page on Tuesday. Our official YouTube channel has only 300 subscribers, of which only 15 people watched the evening Maha-aarti, said Praveen Kumar, a Kurukshetra-based trader, said people are not interested in religious festivities. “The Saras craft mela is the actual crowd-puller of the event. As this is not being held, the response has remained dismal this time,” said Kumar. Madan Mohan Chhabra, honorary member secretary of the Kurukshetra Development Board, said, “Yes all the programmes are being streamed online due to Covid19 restrictions.” Chhabra, however, skipped the question about the poor online response from people.The Gita Mahotsav gained attention with the Manohar Lal Khattar-led Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state spending crores of rupees every year to promote the teachings of Bhagwad Gita worldwide. Programmes used to be organised in foreign countries, and dignitaries from various parts of the country and abroad used to visit the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-reduces-gita-mahotsav-into-an-online-event/story-1Du6DOZ6TkAXbY2TSGNsBJ.html

The Mumbai crime branch unearthed the conspiracy and learnt that Jaya had given a contract of ₹45 lakh to her friend Suhas Roge, a member of Arun Gawli gang, to kill her husband to control the Multi-crore Matka (gambling) business. Roge then gave the contract to Borivli resident Harish Mandvikar to execute the plan. Mumbai crime branch arrested Suresh Bhagat’s wife Jaya Bhagat, her son Hitesh, Harish Mandvikar and others. The session court convicted six people including Jaya and Mandvikar to life imprisonments in the Matka King Suresh Bhagat murder case in 2017.

Home minister Narottam Mishra disclosed the information on the state government’s decision after the state cabinet meeting held virtually and chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday. Briefing journalists about the state government’s decisions, the home minister said, “The government is committed to checking adulteration effectively. Chief minister is monitoring the government’s action against adulteration. We have two to three regions in the state where adulteration in food and milk is reported (regularly).” Also read: India, Japan sign deal to boost cooperation between steel industriesThe home minister said, “There has been an Interpol warning on fake Covid-19 vaccine. In Gwalior, two to three cases of (adulteration in) plasma were reported recently. We will not allow anyone to play with lives of people. That’s why the government has decided to enhance the quantum of punishment from 3 years to life imprisonment.”Similarly, the state cabinet approved a proposal from the law department to award five years of imprisonment to those found guilty for selling food, medicines, beverages beyond their expiry date. Notably, in the first week of December, the Interpol warned law enforcement agencies across the globe that organised criminal networks could try to advertise and sell fake Covid-19 vaccines physically and on the internet.In an ‘Orange’ notice issued to all 194 member countries, the Lyon-based international police cooperation body warned agencies to prepare for potential criminal activity concerning “the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 and flu vaccines”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-govt-tightens-law-against-food-drug-adulteration-amid-interpol-warning-on-fake-covid-19-vaccine/story-3QM6h2BV7fQ1wTXp3B2APO.html

23-12-2020||Mumbai||At 16°C, Mumbai records lowest temp of season||The city on Tuesday recorded season’s lowest temperature. The suburbs experienced a cooler winter morning as the Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees below normal. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. Temperatures are likely to remain low for the next couple of days, according to a forecast by the IMD. This is the lowest minimum temperature recorded this winter following a mercury drop on December 7 when minimum temperature dipped to 17.4 degrees Celsius. The temperature recorded on Tuesday was also lower than the minimum temperature of 16.4 degrees Celsius recorded last year during winter. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was 32.3 degrees Celsius, 0.2 degrees above normal and at Colaba was 30.2 degrees Celsius, 1.5 degrees below normal. Read more: Air quality dips in Mumbai as cold wave continues in northern IndiaKS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD, said that the short spell of winter in Mumbai was finally here. “It is a routine weather phenomenon as temperatures usually drop during this time of the year. There is a chill in the breeze,” said Hosalikar. While air quality had improved slightly on Monday, it deteriorated on Tuesday as temperatures dropped and the city breathed moderate quality of air. The air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator- of 183 (moderate). The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. The AQI in Navi Mumbai was recorded at 331, which falls under the very poor category. Bandra Kurla Complex had the worst air quality with the AQI measuring 336. Experts from SAFAR said that poor air quality in the winter season is a routine phenomenon and can be attributed to the change in wind directions. “As wind starts flowing from the land instead of the sea, pollution levels increase because the air coming from the land is more polluted,” said a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-16-c-mumbai-records-lowest-temp-of-season/story-9Bw6dUDiYJ8GNVYhCy7JHP.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds Maharashtra government’s scrapping of regional reservation in medical admissions||In a landmark order, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has held that the Amended Rules-2020 implemented by the state on September 7, which did away with regional reservations in Maharashtra for admissions to undergraduate courses in medical studies, is valid. The court observed that after the introduction of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), which is based on the concept of one nation, one examination, and aims at providing admissions to students on merit only, regional reservations were a contradiction, and hence the state decision is valid. The bench also noted that while regional reservations were the need as per a Supreme Court (SC) judgement in 1986, with development and advancement, regional reservations would be counter-productive. A division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing petitions filed by eight students aspiring to pursue medical education, was informed that the September 9 decision of the government to set aside regional reservations was not valid as it was announced after the admission process started, and should be set aside.The regional reservation condition was introduced by the previous government in 2016 wherein medical colleges in a particular region had to reserve seats in the ratio of 70:30, wherein 70% of seats would be reserved for students from the region, while the remaining 30% could be open for admission to students from other parts of the state and outside the state as well. The condition was introduced mainly to benefit students from the Marathwada and Vidarbha region.While canvassing their challenge to the Rules which were amended on September 9, the advocates for the petitioner students submitted that as the admission brochure had mentioned 70:30 reservation, amending the rule in between would cause serious loss to the aspiring students. The ​advocates also submitted that the decision to amend the rule was not taken following due legislative process. They also submitted that while other reservations were still in force, amending the rules to simply discontinue the 70:30 reservation was a volte foce fine by the state which had whole-heartedly supported regional reservation in 2016.However, senior advocate and special counsel for the state Anil Anturkar opposed the claims of the petitioners and submitted that the amendment was introduced before this year’s NEET exams, which is the only standard accepted by all authorities for admission to medical and dental courses. Anturkar further submitted that the state’s decisions in 2016 and 2020 are based on the situation existing at the relevant time. He also submitted that a similar decision for government colleges was taken earlier and the same was being implemented for private colleges. Intervenors in the petition concurred with Anturkar’s submissions and said that the 70:30 rule was detrimental to the backward students from the Marathwada and Vidarbha region.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that there was no perversity in the state’s decision. “The Amendment Rules-2020 do not appear to be against constitutional mandate nor [do they] override the stipulation under any statute. The purpose of Amendment Rules-2020 was to end regional merit and the state merit is given priority. The person getting better marks would get precedence in admission to the medical courses. Such consideration does not appear to be deficient of intelligible object,” said justice Gangapurwala in the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-maharashtra-government-s-scrapping-of-regional-reservation-in-medical-admissions/story-55N6L9kGOsHm9vdFR24RPL.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Ground realty check: More FSI to create more homes in Mumbai Metropolitan Region?||Even as the state recently introduced the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR) to change the face of the real estate sector in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it may not be so easy, considering the massive slowdown, claim experts. What it means The UDCPR promotes uniform development regulations across the state and grants liberal Floor Space Index (FSI) which could translate into massive construction largesse for builders. Through the new rules, the state government expects the supply of homes, especially affordable ones, to increase significantly, leading to reduction in prices of houses. The Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI), the association of builders, even went on to announce that the move was a gamechanger in the realty sector as they will now double the construction of affordable houses – from 5 lakh units currently in construction to 10 lakh. “Lakhs of people will now own a house,” said Deepak Garodia, president, MCHI-CREDAI. These units are in the range of ₹4,000-₹5000 per square feet. Current scenario One of the reasons for unveiling the UDCPR was to reduce the pressure on Mumbai and boost the realty market in places like Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli and Raigad region, where the realty rates are lower compared to Mumbai. However, realty experts have debunked this claim. Construction of houses in far-off suburbs will ease the pressure only if people get the infrastructure to move there, they say. “FSI hike in just a concept of real estate and mass housing will not make much headway till the corresponding infrastructure is not developed. People will not be incentivised to purchase houses till mass transport in these areas is improved,” said Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm. He gave an example of the Metro projects saying there is still no clarity on them in areas beyond the Mumbai region. Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, dismissed any possibility of mass housing projects in the current market, when the unsold inventory pile-up, with the builders in the MMR, excluding Mumbai, is approximately1.82 lakh houses. “Builders are facing monetary crises and will not buy land nor undertake projects till they exhaust their current inventory,” said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras. However, the prices may reduce. “As we get more area, we will able to construct more, which will give us more leverage to reduce prices,” said Rajesh Prajapati, director, Prajapati Group. Real estate expert Ajay Chaturvedi said builders never pass on the benefits to the buyers. “The history of Mumbai realty market has shown that despite a periodic hike in FSI, the prices have only increased and never decreased,” said Chaturvedi. He also blamed the current insecure job market in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic for the state of the market. “The recent lockdown has resulted in massive job losses, especially among the middle and labour class, and they are not in the position to buy these low-cost houses. They are, after all, the target buyers,” said Chaturvedi. Buyers, too, are reluctant to go to far-off places. Vaibhav Khamkar, who works as a driver in a private firm in Parel travels five km for work from his Wadala home. “I prefer living in my Wadala slum than staying in an apartment in far-off places like Karjat or Shahpur. I will spend hours crushed in packed trains and even my family life will be disrupted,” said Khamkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ground-realty-check-more-fsi-to-create-more-homes-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-NHgTGMYiut6yYIWsIXRytJ.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Make teachers, students a priority for Covid-19 vaccine: Maharashtra teachers||Teachers across the state have requested the Maharashtra government to prioritise them for the vaccine drive against Covid-19 that is likely to start soon in the country.Over the last few days, several representations have been made by teachers and educational bodies, requesting the government to vaccinate teachers and students. “In several parts of the state, schools have reopened in the last few months. Since many students do not have access to the internet and mobile phones, they would want to attend physical school. We thus request the government to add teachers and students to the list of beneficiaries for the vaccine,” said Anil Bornare of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) teachers’ cell.Earlier this month, the Early Childhood Association, a body of preschools in the country, had also urged the government to vaccinate school teachers and preschool educators.An official from the state education department said, “The decision about vaccination will be made by the Central and state government, and we cannot comment on it.”On December 14, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) urged governments worldwide to prioritise teachers in the vaccination process. “UNICEF is calling for teachers to be prioritised to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, once frontline health personnel and high-risk populations are vaccinated. This will help protect teachers from the virus, allow them to teach in person, and ultimately keep schools open,” read its official release.On November 23, nearly 15,000 schools across various parts of Maharashtra reopened for students. Schools in cities like Mumbai and Pune, however, remain closed for students at least until December 31, as per the decision of the local civic bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/make-teachers-students-a-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-maharashtra-teachers/story-RJVRngO5vt2Wdgj0eorVPI.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Petition in Delhi HC to block Libgen, Sci-Hub||Three global academic publishing powerhouses have approached the Delhi high court claiming copyright infringement against online repositories that provide free access to paywalled research, in what may become a significant intellectual property rights case in India. Elsevier, which published the Lancet and Cell journals among 2,500 others, Wiley, which publishes 1,700 journals, and the American Chemical Society, one of the world’s largest scientific societies that also publishes the prestigious Journal of the American Chemical Society, have filed the petition. The petitioners have asked the court to order the blocking of Sci Hub, which stores nearly 84 million articles and papers, and Libgen, which claims to host nearly 80 million pieces of research. Both of the sites are widely used in India by students and researchers to access and download paywalled research. The petitioners have also sought a direction to various internet service providers, the department of telecom and the ministry of electronics and information technology to issue orders to block Sci Hub and Libgen. “The defendant websites actively encourage viewing/downloading of original literary works for which the plaintiffs have exclusive rights. Therefore, the defendant websites are liable for contributory infringement of copyright,” the petition read. No date for hearing has been set by the high court yet. Sci Hub and Libgen have lost similar cases in a number of other countries, such as the US. This case, if it goes forward, can present an important question of not just piracy but also access, said experts. “Many smaller educational institutions, independent researchers, and activists - especially in developing countries such as India - cannot afford access to expensive journals because top-tier research is often behind high paywalls. In this situation, sites such as Libgen and Sci hub have been beneficial. Simply banning such sites will not solve the problem of piracy. A fairer and more equitable system of academic publishing and access needs to be set up before such actions are taken,” said Vidya Subramanian, a researcher at Harvard University and a post-doctoral fellow at IIT Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/petition-in-delhi-hc-to-block-libgen-sci-hub/story-17M94CYb38MWbm2NgP6IXN.html

It’s good that MMRTA officials took note of this,” said social activist Gaurang Damani.AL Quadros, leader of the city’s largest taximen’s union – Mumbai Taximen’s Union – has expressed disappointment over this postponement. “Taxi drivers are suffering as there has been no fare hike in the last five years, while the corresponding costs like CNG (compressed natural gas) prices and vehicle maintenance have increased substantially,” he said.Another drivers’ association, Shiv Vahutak Sanghatana chief Sharif Deshmukh said that drivers suffered great hardships during the lockdown. “All drivers are in loss and cannot sustain themselves. A major portion of their income goes on paying off their loans,” said Deshmukh.However, Mumbai Autorickshaw Union leader Shashank Rao said that instead of a fare hike, a financial package needs to be given to the drivers. “This is not the right time to burden the commuters. Instead, the government should offer financial help to the drivers and waive off their loans,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-commuters-relieved-as-fare-hike-of-taxis-autorickshaws-postponed-union-seeks-government-aid/story-X0D633SVgJpnGkjrQgYGxK.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses bail to Mumbai-based producer booked for raping actress||The Bombay high court last week rejected the anticipatory bail plea of film producer and director Sudeep Saha, who has been booked by Santacruz police for allegedly raping and blackmailing a Hindi and Bhojpuri actress and also filming her intimate moments with another producer, using a spy camera.Santacruz police had booked Saha on July 22, based on a complaint lodged by the actress. She said she was in touch with Saha over phone and WhatsApp, as he had offered to cast her in his movies.She alleged that in July 2016, he called her at a hotel on Juhu Tara Road under the pretext of giving her a role and sexually assaulted her. Thereafter, she alleged, he continued a physical relationship with her on the false promise of marriage. In December 2017, he got a song picturised on her and released it on an electronic platform.She said thereafter, there were frequent quarrels between them and during the period, Saha showed her their intimate pictures. She claimed that after she realised that he was already married, she started maintaining distance from him, but he threatened to make the photographs public and coerced her to continue the relationship till May 2019.In between, she and her mother had purchased two separate flats from Saha, and she had started residing at the flat. She added that between December 2019 and January 2020, she signed a contract for five films with a producer from Kolkata, but Saha was unhappy with that and had threatened that producer.In April 2020, the complainant was shocked to receive photographs from the Kolkata producer’s wife, capturing the complainant’s intimate moments with the producer at her Mumbai flat. Thereafter, she took a search of the flat and found a spy camera installed in the electric boards of her bedroom and hall.In this backdrop, Saha had sought anticipatory bail contending that the FIR itself made it amply clear that it was a case of a consensual relationship. He sought the protection of pre-arrest bail, claiming he had cooperated with the investigation and already deposited his mobile phone and laptop with the investigating agency. Thus, he claimed, his custodial interrogation was not necessary.Justice Sarang Kotwal, however, refused to accept the producer/director’s claim. The judge said initially, it could have been a consensual relationship, but subsequent consent obtained under coercion, was no consent in the law and therefore, the offence of rape was made out against Saha.Justice Kotwal was more annoyed with Saha’s conduct in recording private, intimate moments of the complainant without her knowledge.“The matter of spy camera is a cause for concern,” said justice Kotwal. “Even before installing a spy camera in Deep Tower, her private moments were captured on video. There is no explanation as to why the spy camera was installed in Deep Tower without knowledge of the informant. The recording was sent to the wife of the other (Kolkata-based) producer. That producer was also terrorised. The conduct of the applicant (Saha) is dangerous to the first informant,” said the court while rejecting the pre-arrest bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-bail-to-mumbai-based-producer-booked-for-raping-actress/story-1tgcQuWwra98hfqweZYkCL.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Pratap Sarnaik-Topsgrup case: MMRDA denies allegations of irregularities in security contracts||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has termed as baseless the claim of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik got kickbacks from Rahul Nanda, chairman and founder of Topsgrup security services provider in awarding security contracts by MMRDA.MMRDA said the allegation of irregularities in providing 500 security guards by TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) to the authority was baseless. The authority said it had never had the strength of 500 security guards at any given time in three shifts in a day.MMRDA revealed this in its response to the questions of the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police, which is conducting a parallel investigation into the complaint against Rahul Nanda made by his company’s former vice-chairman Ramesh Iyer.MMRDA’s letter of December 17 to deputy commissioners of police (DCP) EOW stated that there was no financial misconduct on its part while awarding contracts to the company for security services and making payment to the guards. All these works were done through a tendering process per the rules.The letter stated that between 2013 and 2020, many companies had participated in the tender process. Six companies were recognised in the tender process, and TGSSL was one of them. TGSSL was appointed for providing manpower to guard MMRDA’s estate and properties by following due process of law.“Time-to-time inspection had been made to inspect the total strength deployed at respective sites. There is a set mechanism in place for inspection of the sites to verify attendance, losses/damages, encroachment, etc. The security guards who had shown absent till the last day have been fined,” MMRDA’s letter stated.ED had arrested Sarnaik’s close associate Amit Chandole and TGSSL managing director M Shashidharan, alleging that Topsgrup had obtained contracts from MMRDA in collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means. These illegal manoeuvres aimed to get undue benefit by inflating bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Sarnaik used to get 50% of the profit earned of the said contract through Chandole, ED had claimed in its remand application.It added that in 2014, a contract was signed by TGSSL with MMRDA under which 350 to 500 guards were to be deployed at MMRDA sites monthly. Out of the same, only 70% of guards were deployed. However, the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract and the wage details were submitted to MMRDA for 100% of the contract vałue.EOW is probing cross complaints of Nanda and Iyer. Nanda has alleged that Iyer and other employees siphoned off the company’s money, while Iyer claimed that Nanda, through his company, indulged in massive misconduct and financial irregularities worth ₹175 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pratap-sarnaik-topsgrup-case-mmrda-denies-allegations-of-irregularities-in-security-contracts/story-j4CqJgYdkzc9nPQTMSr2JO.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Reconsider plea of twin sisters for NORI certificates: Bombay HC orders Centre||Bombay high court last week directed the Union health and family welfare ministry to reconsider plea of twin sisters, both MBBS, seeking No Obligation to Return to India (NORI) certificates to enable them to settle down in the United States of America and pursue careers in research.Though the Centre has stopped issuing NORI certificates to doctors, to stem brain drain, the division bench of justices Nitin Jamdar and Milind Jadhav directed the Union ministry to examine the request of the twin sisters, Avani and Aditi Vaishnav, given their wish to pursue careers in research in the US and not to practice medicine.Both of them had moved HC after the ministry of education rejected their applications for NOC to get NORI certificate in June 2020, primarily because of the Union health and family welfare ministry’s policy of not issuing NORI certificates to doctors.Their petitions state that both the petitioners have completed their MBBS courses from a private medical college in Navi Mumbai and have also completed their one-year internship in 2017. Their entire family has applied for family immigration to the US and their parents and sister have already received their green cards in August / September 2019.Their counsels pointed out to HC that the twin sisters had sought review of the education ministry’s decision on the ground that both of them were already engaged in temporary research assignments in the UD and wanted to pursue careers in research, and neither of them wishes to practice as doctors. But, the review was dismissed without considering the fact.Advocate Rajshekhar Govilkar, who appeared for the central ministry, opposed the petition on the ground that the central government has as a matter of policy decided to stop issuing NORI certificates to doctors.HC, however, found force in the submissions advanced on behalf of the twin sisters, especially the December 2016 decision of the HC relied on them in Dr Sunil Noothi’s case, arising out of similar circumstances.The bench noted that in Dr Noothi’s case HC has held that the policy decision of not issuingNORI certificate to any doctor to stem the brain drain of doctors and to cope up with the acute shortage of doctors in India, cannot be applied to a medical graduate who does not wish to practice medicine.“It is obvious that even if he resides in India, he is not going to render his services to the citizens of India as a doctor because of his inclination in research work,” HC had observed in Dr Noothi’s case.Noticing that the HC has in the December 2016 judgment made a clear distinction between the medical practitioner and a research scholar, the bench headed by justice Jamdar directed Union health and family welfare ministry to reconsider the case of the twin sisters in terms of the December 2016 HC judgment and take a fresh decision on their plea by January 20, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reconsider-plea-of-twin-sisters-for-nori-certificates-bombay-hc-orders-centre/story-T0eP1w0HESazGOBjdqmdwJ.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||New Covid-19 variant: Maharashtra government imposes stricter rules for those travelling from Europe to Mumbai||Passengers coming from Europe, Middle-East, South Africa, as well as through flights that have halts in Europe, will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine after landing in Mumbai, according to a standard operating protocol (SOP) issued by the Maharashtra government on Tuesday, amid reports of the new strain of new coronavirus. Besides, they should test negative in RT-PCR test before discharge from the quarantine. Those who are found symptomatic will be shifted to a Covid hospital of the Mumbai civic body. No passenger will be allowed home quarantine. South Africa was added to the list on Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon, a total of 590 passengers had arrived in three flights from the United Kingdom and none of them were found to be symptomatic, said civic officials. “All passengers will be screened for presence of symptoms and if found symptomatic, shall be subjected to RT-PCR testing with all precautions. Symptomatic passengers shall be sent to identified hospitals in the city and get admitted and should be treated accordingly. All other passengers shall undergo 14 days of mandatory paid institutional quarantine on arrival. These passengers shall not be allowed outside the designated quarantine facility before 14 days, in any condition,” states the SOP that will be applicable for passengers and staff of flights arriving from Europe, Middle-East countries and South Africa in Maharashtra. The order issued by the chief secretary has directed the airport authority to develop dedicated facilities for disembarkment, screening and immigration of these passengers at a distance from other flights. It has cautioned the authorities to prevent passengers coming from the above mentioned places mixing with other passengers at the airports. Similar instructions have been given for staff of the airlines ferrying passengers from these countries. Officials said the state took the decision considering sudden emergence of a fast-spreading variant of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom, which is believed to be up to 70% more transmissible than the original strain is a cause of concern. It has been reported that a distinct phylogenetic cluster of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected. The state has directed municipal corporations concerned to make separate arrangements for carrying the passengers to the institutional quarantine facilities. Besides Mumbai airport, which has a significant number of travellers coming from Europe and Middle East, Pune and Nagpur airports in the state also have flights from these places. The state government has also instructed the authorities concerned that the screening and quarantine of passengers should be done aptly without raising any panic, or any differential behaviour towards passengers. It has asked to take utmost care towards increasing the awareness of the passengers and the airport staff to the new threat. The psychological aspect of the situation should be managed very diligently so as to improve the compliance of the staff and passengers towards following the guidelines, states the order. It has asked to identify a separate area at the far end of the airport terminal for receiving flights from countries in Europe, the Middle-East and South Africa. The area should have adequate air-bridges so as to receive the flights in a staggered manner, to avoid overcrowding. It should have adequate separate, immigration, luggage and customs centers along with a separate set up of APHO for screening and testing of these passengers and airline staff. The staff of the aircraft should be kept in an isolated area following the necessary preventive measures. They should not be allowed to enter the terminal, states the order. The flow of passengers in the airport premises should be such that they should not in any way get mixed with the passengers coming from other flights or other staff, the state government directed. It has also asked the airline staff to ensure that the passengers disembarking from the above-mentioned lights are wearing a proper fitted mask, and have sanitised the visible part of their hands thoroughly. In case any passenger is not wearing a mask, it should be provided to them, it added. The state has further directed the civic bodies for daily monitoring of the passengers at the institutional quarantine facilities through Aarogya Setu app or by a health team. In case any passenger develops symptoms of Covid-19, he or she should be shifted to a specially designated hospital for treating the new strain of virus. Also, if any passenger tests positive on RT-PCR, he or she should be considered to be infected with the new strain and should be immediately shifted to the designated hospital for further management. The state government has also issued an alert to all seaports about the possible threat of the spread of new strain of coronavirus. 590 people arrive from UK In order to accommodate foreign passengers at institutional quarantine, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is planning to arrange 20,000 rooms in city’s private hotels by this week. By Tuesday afternoon, a total of 590 passengers had arrived in three flights from the United Kingdom. More than 300 passengers have been shifted to the private hotels and the data of the rest is being updated by the BMC. None of the passengers have been found to be symptomatic. The last flight of UK passengers, with about 250 passengers, will arrive in Mumbai by Tuesday midnight. Senior civic officials said that no Covid test will be conducted on arrival, but on the fifth to seventh day while they are at the hotels. “A private agency will be arranged for Covid testing and the cost for the tests will be borne by the passengers,” an official said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Our plan is to arrange nearly 20,000 rooms in hotels across the city. A team of civic officials is already working for that. Just like earlier, we will partner with the hotels and not take over them for quarantining passengers. Both luxury and budget hotels will be available as options and the cost of the stay will be borne by the passengers.” More than 4000 rooms have been arranged by the BMC so far. As per BMC’s protocols, all symptomatic passengers from UK will be shifted to Seven Hills Hospital at Andheri and the ones from Europe and Middle-East countries will be shifted to GT Hospital at Fort directly from the airport. Passengers that don’t show any symptoms will be quarantined at hotels. The passport of the passengers will be deposited at the hotels and can be retrieved when they are discharged from the quarantine. The state government also issued a notification empowering district collectors to impose night curfew if they feel it necessary to contain the epidemic. It means districts getting more cases may be imposed with night curfew. However, the district collectors will have to take prior permission from chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. The state government on Monday declared a seven-hour night curfew from December 22 for the next 15 days. The night curfew will be imposed in major cities (municipal corporation areas) across the state. It has also clarified that night curfew means a gathering of more than five people will be prohibited between 11pm and 6am till January 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-covid-19-variant-maharashtra-government-imposes-stricter-rules-for-those-travelling-from-europe-to-mumbai/story-vkib7SQLToSrNXhNfZSnJI.html

23-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt starts tracking, testing all flyers into the Capital from the UK since November 25||The Delhi government on Tuesday said it has started tracing passengers who arrived in the national capital from the United Kingdom since November 25, amid fears of the spread of a new and more infectious strain of Covid-19 that has been detected in the UK. The government has also started door-to-door tracking of passengers who returned from the UK. The government had earlier decided to track and test all arrivals in Delhi from the UK over the past two weeks, an order that was tweaked late in the evening based on the central government’s guidelines. All these arrivals will be tested using the gold standard reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method by district surveillance teams. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain told reporters that nearly 7,000 passengers flew into the city from the UK in the last two weeks.But, senior officials later said the number of passengers who actually reside in Delhi would be much lower. A health official said separate isolation wards for the UK returnees who test positive, as per the latest Central government SOP, is being built in at least three Covid-19 facilities - the Sardar Patel Covid Centre and hospital in Chhatarpur, Lok Nayak Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital .Passengers will also be given the option of paid quarantine facility. Senior officials in the New Delhi district administration said Aloft hotel in Aerocity is going to be notified as the paid institutional isolation facility for the UK returnees who want to opt for it. “In the last two weeks, about 6,000 to 7,000 people landed at the Delhi airport from the UK. This includes passengers who travelled to other places like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh or Haryana after landing in Delhi. Our teams have started a door-to-door survey to check on fliers who are residing in Delhi. They are being requested to self isolate themselves in their homes for seven days,” he said. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev said as of now the exact number of passengers who are still residing in the Capital after arriving from the UK since November 25 is not known because the addresses and phone numbers are still being sent by the airport authorities, which is relayed to the districts immediately. “The revenue department has been compiling this information from the civil aviation ministry and the immigration authorities. The lists have been territorially segregated district-wise and allocated to survey teams of the districts area-wise for surveillance and testing/tracking,” he said.Jain said during the house-to-house survey, passengers are being asked about their health and the visiting medical teams check for Covid-19 like symptoms.“Unlike usual Covid-19 cases, where an asymptomatic or mild patients are allowed to get treated under home isolation, if a UK returnee tests positive then s/he will have to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine. All samples of those who test positive will also be sent for genome sequencing. If the result of that comes as per the new strain then the person will continue to be under institutional quarantine for 14 days until he/she tests negative,” said a senior government official. A member from one of over 700 surveillance teams in the city said the east district so far has identified 24 passengers who arrived from the UK and are residing in the district. “But contact tracing is very difficult. Some phone numbers are invalid. Some addresses are given of Delhi but the person has moved out of the city. There are only 24 passengers we found who are actually staying in east district. They are being tested and checked for symptoms,” said the official. Health minister Satyendar Jain, urged everyone to wear a mask when stepping out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-starts-tracking-testing-all-flyers-into-the-capital-from-the-uk-since-november-25/story-9hUu6c9u7l7xKf2tx99suI.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Trio on motorbike booked for two gunpoint robberies within 15 minutes in east Delhi||Three persons on a motorbike robbed two persons — a journalist and a chartered accountant from Nepal — of their mobile phones, cash and other belongings at gunpoint within 15 minutes of one another and a distance of 400 metres in east Delhi’s Shakarpur after Monday midnight, the police said.The chartered accountant received stitches on his forehead after being allegedly attacked with the butt of the gun by the robbers. The 27-year-old journalist, who works with the multimedia team of a news agency, suffered bruises to his hands as he fell after allegedly being pushed by one of the robbers, according to a colleague of the journalist, a reporter who covered the two robberies on behalf of the news agency.The deputy commissioner of police (east), Jasmeet Singh, said that two separate cases of robbery were registered against unknown persons at the Shakarpur police station. “We have formed teams to identify and nab the suspects. They will be caught soon,” said DCP Singh.The first robbery took place around midnight, when the chartered accountant, who is from Nepal, identified by his first name Tribhuwan, had gone to meet a relative. He lives in a rented home at Shakarpur.According to the reporter who covered the issue, Tribhuwan was returning to his flat when three men on a bike waylaid him and asked him to part with his belongings at gunpoint. “Tribhuwan told me that he resisted the robbery attempt and he was attacked with the butt of the gun, causing multiple injuries to his forehead. The robbers took away his mobile phone and a bag containing Rs 1,000 cash and credit cards,” said the reporter.Nearly 15 minutes later, the same set of robbers waylaid the journalist while he was walking to his flat after being dropped by the office cab. The journalist told his colleague that as he saw the robbers taking out a gun, he tried to run. “One of the robbers pushed him, because of which he fell to the ground and suffered minor injuries. The robbers robbed him of his mobile phone and the bag containing his office ID card.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath condoled the death of five people and directed the officials in Agra to reach the spot to supervise relief work. “The accident took place in wee hours of Tuesday at about 4.30am when the car moving towards Noida collided with a container coming from opposite side and caught fire. Those inside the car could not move out and were charred to death,” said Babloo Kumar, the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Agra. Officials said that a fire brigade was called to the spot immediately, but it was too late to save the people in the car. The driver of the container fled the site on foot, following the collision. According to police, it was tough to identify the bodies as they were badly burnt and their faces were unrecognisable. Later, the identities of the five were established as Murli Manohar Saroj (35), of Alamganj in Lucknow, his wife Seema Devi (32), cousin Manju Devi (30) and mother-in-law Sirtaj (58). The driver, Sandeep of Unnao, was also killed in the incident.

23-12-2020||Delhi||Govt threatens action against officers not following protocol on live WhatsApp location||The women and child development department of the Delhi government in a recent order said that several of its officers were found to be “reluctant” in complying with a protocol that requires them to share live WhatsApp locations in a group to register their attendance and field visits.In an order, issued on December 17, the department has also threatened to take action against erring officials, including penalising for “insubordination”, and entrusted a deputy secretary-rank officer with the responsibility of preparing a weekly list of erring officers from this Friday, said a senior government official.On October 15, Delhi’s women and child development (WCD) minister Rajendra Pal Gautam had issued directions that required officers in the department to register daily attendance by sending WhatsApp locations in a particular group – after coming to office in the morning and leaving office in the evening. The same protocol was also to be followed for field visits.Senior officials said that the directions were issued in the light of complaints regarding absence of officials from public offices and skipping field visits. The government has plans to implement the same protocol across several departments in 2021 to increase efficiency, said the official quoted above.On December 17, the government had issued another order which flagged “reluctance” by officials and “non-compliance” of the directions issued by the minister on October 15. It further threatened to take action against erring officials including action for “insubordination”.“Some of the district officers have shown reluctance in sending live location on the WhatsApp group. The secretary (department of WCD) has taken a serious view in the matter and also shown displeasure at the non-compliance of the directions issued by the minister,” said the December 17 order that HT has seen.It further said, “Hence, all district officers are directed to post their daily arrival and departure attendance through live location as well as field visits location, failing which it would be assumed that the officer is not attending to his or her duty, and further action would be initiated against them for insubordination.”Action against insubordination can include measures such as temporary suspensions and transfers, said a government official.Gautam said, “This is an initiative which is aimed at boosting efficiency in public officers, starting with those under the WCD department. We need cooperation in this regard from officials of all ranks without any compromise. Action will be taken in case of non-compliance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-threatens-action-against-officers-not-following-protocol-on-live-whatsapp-location/story-70KG538mLRGR1sAjfvjNLI.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Dedicated corridor, mandatory Covid tests for all fliers from the UK at IGI||Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport has set up a dedicated corridor for the movement of passengers arriving from the United Kingdom, after the government made it mandatory for such travellers to undergo an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 at the airport. To ensure that the passengers from the United Kingdom are segregated from others on their arrival, their immigration clearance, baggage collection and customs clearance has been expedited and is being completed under supervision. Only five, of the total 470 passengers from the United Kingdom who arrived at Delhi airport since Monday, have so far tested positive and have been sent to hospitals. The rest have been advised seven days home quarantine, officials said. India, on Monday, had suspended all flights to and from the United Kingdom (UK) between December 23 and December 31 in order to stop the arrival of a new strain of Sars-Cov-2 that spreads faster. The government mandated all passengers who arrive from the UK on Monday and Tuesday, to take an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 at the airport, with only those who test negative being allowed to go home. While two incoming flights landed at the Delhi airport on Monday night and early Tuesday morning , two more arrived late on Tuesday. The flights that arrived on Monday night and Tuesday morning were Air India’s AI 162 and British Airways BA143, respectively, both from Heathrow airport in London. Doctor Gauri Agarwal, founder and director of Genestrings diagnostics, that is conducting the RT-PCR tests at the Delhi airport, confirmed that only five passengers had tested positive. “The testing was completed around 5pm on Tuesday. None of the rest tested positive or showed any symptoms. They were all advised a seven-day home quarantine,” she said. Agarwal added that it took them 4-5 hours to get the reports. “Meanwhile, the passengers were sent to the lounge. A guitarist was there to entertain them and they were served with chocolates and refreshments. Genestrings Diagnostics has already been conducting RT-PCR tests of passengers but for Tuesday we had to double our staff strength. There are two more flights scheduled for Tuesday – one carrying 240 passengers while another has 274 passengers on board,” she added. The passengers were charged a total of Rs 3,400, that included Rs 800, the standard charge for an RT-PCR test in Delhi. The rest was lounge charges. DEDICATED CORRIDOR AT THE AIRPORT Airport officials said that as soon as the passengers entered the terminal after crossing the aerobridge, they were divided into batches of 20-25 and were escorted through a dedicated corridor by the Central Industrial Security Force personnel in PPE kits. Sachin Badshah, deputy inspector general (IGI Airport), CISF, said a separate corridor has been set up for the passengers arriving from the UK so that there could be adequate social distancing with other passengers at the airport. “The dedicated corridor helps expedite the immigration clearance, baggage collection and customs clearance for these passenger who are then escorted by our men to their designated waiting area where they wait for their turn to be tested,” Badhsah said. The designated waiting area is a lounge that has been set up specially to accommodate these passengers inside Terminal 3 by airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd). An official from the airport said seating arrangements have been made keeping social distancing in mind with basic facilities of washroom, drinking water available for the passengers. From here the passengers are moved to the testing facility built in the multi-level car parking building right in front of T3. Outside the terminal, the Delhi police teams were also present. Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said police personnel ensure that no passenger manages to leave the airport premises without getting tested. “We ensured adequate deployment to make sure that everyone is mandatorily tested as per the government’s order and that there are no law and order problems,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dedicated-corridor-mandatory-covid-tests-for-all-fliers-from-the-uk-at-igi/story-lXtgtuIAredgU4IJM1j6oJ.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Govt to create surveillance site for testing vaccines||The Delhi government, in collaboration with the department of biotechnology, is creating a 52,000 -strong surveillance site in north-east Delhi’s Gokulpuri area. This would be Delhi’s first surveillance site that can be used for community-level vaccine trials, surveillance of emerging diseases, or predicting outbreaks. “The department of biotechnology is currently in talks to see whether the trial of an upcoming Covid-19 vaccine can be conducted in the surveillance site, once we have collected enough data over the next few months,” said Dr Pragya Sharma, head of the department of community medicine at MAMC. The trial site will encompass households in Gokalpuri, Sanjay Colony, Ganga Vihar, and Gokulpuri village. The department of biotechnology has developed at least 11 such vaccine trial sites across the country. Such trial sites allow the researchers to study the number of infections at a community level after being administered a vaccine. Currently, many of the vaccine trials being conducted are hospital-based, where the volunteers are asked to register with a particular site to participate in the trial. Over the next three years, researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College will collect demographic data of each and every person living in the area, including details like how many people live in a house, their health condition, and their economic situation, among others. All the details collected will be mapped on a satellite image of the area, along with detailed information. The project is headed by community medicine expert Dr Nandini Sharma, who is currently the head of the medical college. “The map will have a complete health profile of people in that region. This is very helpful for detecting any novel outbreaks, like Covid-19, if there is a sudden increase in atypical symptoms. Or, detecting an outbreak early on, if the doctors in the area start seeing an unusual increase in say for example diarrhoea. Currently, our department is collecting the baseline data. However, a site like this will be a resource for health researchers forever,” said Dr Sharma. The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a video address at the inauguration said that it was a great step being taken for the health care of the people in the area. Dr Nandini Sharma addressed the people of the area and requested them to provide accurate data to the volunteers who come to their houses. 82,000 tests, 939 fresh cases, positivity rate 1.14%Delhi on Tuesday conducted over 82,000 tests for coronavirus disease, in which 939 people tested positive, as per the daily health bulletin. The new cases remained below the 1,000-mark for two days in a row. Fewer than 1,000 cases a day was last reported 127 days ago on August 17. The city has since seen two surges in cases in September and in November, with the November spike being the worst when 8,593 cases were reported in a single day. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – dropped to 1.14% on Wednesday, which is the lowest since the Delhi government started giving daily data on the number of cases and tests since April beginning. So far, the lowest positivity rate was 1.16% recorded on April 6. With fewer tests, the positivity rate wasn’t consistent then, with a daily positivity rate of 8.84% being recorded the very next day. The current decline, however, has been sustained. Delhi has reported a positivity rate of less than 2% for eight days now and below 5% for 20 days. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for over two weeks. The city also reported 25 deaths due to the infection, taking the city’s total toll to 10,329.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-to-create-surveillance-site-for-testing-vaccines/story-5Z1ODjQkN406m8UTX0uSmO.html

He should ask the government officials to immediately release Rs 13,000 crore due funds to the MCDs,” he said.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation said that the Delhi government is “wilfully” not releasing the dues to make corporations “financially crippled” so that it could neither do any development work for the citizens nor can pay salaries of employees on time.“We will continue this fight till the Delhi government releases the funds. The AAP is playing politics by not releasing the funds of the corporations so that they can take advantage of it in the upcoming corporation elections,” Prakash said.But senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said that the BJP-ruled MCD has not placed their claim of Rs 13,000 crores in front of the court, while on the other side the Kejriwal government through an affidavit has clearly mentioned that it has released all requisite funds for civic bodies till December 31.“A recent court order regarding the clearance of the pending salary of MCD employees has no mention of this imaginary Rs 13,000 crores which the BJP claims that the AAP government has to pay to the MCDs. To defame the Kejriwal government and to divert the attention from the Rs 2,500 crore scam of the MCD, the BJP is lying to people and blaming the government. The BJP must immediately stop such dirty politics and release the salaries of employees,” Pathak said.Pathak also said that on Tuesday nearly 20,000 AAP volunteers conducted “Padyatra (march)” in all 272 wards against scam of Rs 2500 crore in municipalities.He said that AAP workers met the people in all 272 wards and told them about the “misappropriation of Rs 2,500 crores” in the BJP-ruled MCD. “We are visiting every house to expose the BJP and its misdeeds in front of the people of Delhi. We told them about how the BJP-ruled MCDs has completely ruined Delhi and how the BJP has made the MCDs bankrupt,” Pathak said.The Delhi unit of the BJP has refuted allegations of the Rs 2500 crore scam. The north civic body’s mayor Jai Prakash had denied the allegations and called it a diversionary tactics by the AAP instead of paying the dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcd-funds-tussle-bjp-stages-protest-aap-holds-padyatra/story-bYi74LpJvaUP9YPKO1nz6L.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality dips further, touches ‘severe’ zone||Delhi’s air quality took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, dropping into the ‘severe’ category, with the Met department predicting that pollution levels will stay high in the coming days due to slow winds and low morning temperatures.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday was 418 as of 4pm, down sharply from 332 (very poor) on Monday. Before this, Delhi’s air had touched the severe zone on December 5, when the overall AQI was 404. Pollution levels showed a steady Tuesday morning onwards, when the average hourly AQI deteriorated from 352 at 7am to 377 at noon, before it crossed the 400 mark later in the day. At 7pm, the average AQI touched 426, with many monitoring stations clocking pollution levels above 450. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research division, said winds had calmed down completely for a few hours on Tuesday morning. Apart from this, he said, the air got worse due to a weather phenomenon called ‘inversion’, because of which pollution-carrying air dropped closer to the surface. “Around noon, we observed that because of inversion, the pollution that was floating higher up in the air suddenly dropped and settled closer to the ground. This was the primary reason behind this severe drop in the air quality,” Soni said. IMD scientists also attributed the spike in pollution levels to low wind speeds and the increase in moisture levels in the air, after a western disturbance passed by on Sunday. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the average wind speed on Tuesday was 6kmph — not strong enough to disperse pollutants. “The wind speeds have been low and there is an increase in moisture in the air, which is also holding the pollution particles down closer to the ground,” Srivastava said. He also warned that the forecast does not show any significant improvement in the wind speed till December 26, which means that pollution levels are also expected to be on a rise. The temperature is also forecast to fall and reach around 4 degree Celsius in the next two days, IMD said. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official recording for the city, was 5.3 degree Celsius, three below normal. The maximum temperature was 23.9°C. Meanwhile, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Tuesday observed that the industrial sector is one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region, as it directed all industries in the Capital to switch over to Piped Natural Gas (PNG). The commission reviewed the progress of switching over of industries operating in Delhi to PNG during a meeting attended by representatives of the state government, Gail, and Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL). The commission, headed by former Delhi chief secretary MM Kutty, directed IGL to ensure PNG supply to all identified industries in Delhi by January 31, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality/story-PyUuJ9mi2DN9RL1dr2p0sJ.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Satyendar Jain says MCDs not providing their expenditure details to govt||Delhi urban development Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said the three municipal corporations (MCDs) “have denied” to share “any details” on their incomes and expenditures with the Delhi government. “The three MCDs have been asked to give details regarding all their income and expenditure of last one month, but all the three MCDs have not responded to the same. The people of Delhi need to know the details regarding the public exchequer and where has it been spent as they are the taxpayers,” Jain said in a statement on Tuesday. The demand by the state urban development department to furnish the revenue and expenditures of the MCDs comes at a time when the mayors of the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled civic bodies have been demanding Rs 13,000 crore as “payable dues” from the Delhi government. However, the Delhi government has repeatedly denied the allegation and has stated that all dues have been paid to the civic corporations. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has even asked the BJP rules MCDs to take legal recourse if they feel the Delhi government actually owes them Rs 13,000 crore. “We asked them about their finances. But the MCDs are just refusing to provide any details on the same. This is a clear indication that the BJP-led MCD is trying to hide their accounts due to some misappropriation. It is the right of the people to know the details regarding their money and the MCDs must be transparent with the public exchequer,” Jain said.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “We have been giving all the details to the committees of the Vidhan Sabha. This is a lie that we denied giving any details to the government. They don’t want to give our dues of Rs 13,000 crore and are hence levelling new allegations daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/satyendar-jain-says-mcds-not-providing-their-expenditure-details-to-govt/story-J5Vi8VtMgN53MNDS31oc4I.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Govt to decide on reserving 80% beds in pvt hospitals today||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi High Court that a discussion on a new strain of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) was taken up in a recent meeting on deciding if reservation of 80% beds for Covid patients should continue in the city’s hospitals. The government further told the court that due to the current evolving situation of a new Covid-19 strain, the government order of reserving the beds would be reviewed on December 23.In an affidavit filed by advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, has said that the new strain of the virus had been discussed in the meeting on December 21 and a committee has been constituted to look for the formulation of a graded strategy of de-escalation.It said that the expert committee — comprising Dr VK Paul, Dr Randeep Guleria, Dr Nivedita from ICMR and Dr SK Singh, director of NCDC — was closely monitoring the present developments .“Therefore, the expert committee suggested that a committee may be constituted to look into the graded strategy of de-escalation, keeping in view, the current evolving situation and keeping the required regional balance of availability to Covid Care,” the minutes of the meeting read.“Accordingly, a committee has been formed to submit their recommendations within two days, on the basis of which the government order dated September 12 will be reviewed,” the affidavit read.The affidavit was filed in a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers, through advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, which had challenged the September 12 decision of the Delhi government to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. This order was stayed by the high court on September 22 by a single judge bench.Later, on October 9, a division bench of the court took up an appeal by the Delhi government, but refused to vacate the stay while adjourning the matter to November 27. The AAP government then approached the Supreme Court against the two orders. But the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the HC order and asked the government to seek relief from the high court.On November 12, a division bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad vacated the stay considering the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city at that time.On the last date, the Delhi government had told the court that more than 80% of the ICU beds in the 33 private hospitals were occupied and sought 10 more days to review the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-govt-to-decide-on-reserving-80-beds-in-pvt-hospitals-today/story-pLuCIgsZ4crPIeMAIs2QKO.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks home department to withdraw all lockdown cases against labourers||State home minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said the government has issued directions to withdraw all FIRs and complaints registered against migrant labourers for alleged violation of lockdown norms.“As per the directions of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, necessary instructions (have been) issued to (the) home department to withdraw all FIRs/complaints lodged during lockdown against migrant labourers,” Jain tweeted.Jain’s office however could not immediately provide data on the number of FIRs and complaints registered against migrant labourers during lockdown.A senior official in the home department said the FIRs and complaints relate to several cases registered during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown — implemented on March 25 — which witnessed several instances of people getting booked not only for violation of social distancing norms but also for stepping outdoors for activities not enlisted as “essential” in the government’s then-applicable Covid-19 guidelines.The first few days of the lockdown witnessed massive crowds in Anand Vihar and Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, largely comprising migrant labourers and their families, looking for buses to head to their villages and towns, with train services suspended. While several of them managed to get into packed buses, others decided to walk hundreds of miles. Thousands of migrants were also lodged by the government in temporary shelters set up in schools and eventually sent home through special trains in a phased manner.“There are cases and complaints concerning migrant labourers stopped by enforcement agencies at Anand Vihar, in city borders and important junctions, and in localities across Delhi when they were found to have left for their hometowns and villages in large groups. There are also several instances of FIRs and complaints registered after confrontation between enforcement agencies and migrants spotted on roads and public spaces looking out for food,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.“The government can withdraw the pending complaints on their own, but to quash FIRs, they shall have to move court. We have already sought legal help on the matter,” said the senior government official.“Delhi Police have been sympathetic and considerate towards the migrant labourers. Elaborate stay and food arrangements were made for the migrant labourers during the lockdown period, when they were facing employment problems. Arrangements were also made at Anand Vihar for their smooth passage to return home without any law and order issue. Delhi Police have been dealing sensitively with the cases registered against them during the lockdown period,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Anil Mittal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-asks-home-department-to-withdraw-all-lockdown-cases-against-labourers/story-5x7FcrFKBAThK7h5754koL.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers block Delhi-Meerut expressway in protest against UP govt for stopping their counterparts||Farmers protesting against the three farm laws for the past 27 days blocked all carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border for nearly 10 hours on Tuesday, in a protest against the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly stopping farmers from marching towards the border.Around 5pm, the farmers cleared one carriageway, allowing vehicles to move from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.The border blockade disrupted vehicular movement between Delhi and Ghaziabad, as traffic snarls spilt to other border points and connecting roads in Delhi as well as Uttar Pradesh.As the farmers blocked the border around 7am without prior notice, motorists travelling to Ghaziabad from Delhi through the expressway during the morning rush hour were stuck.At 7.37am, the Delhi Traffic Police used its Twitter handle to update the public about the closure of the carriageways at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border. Delhi Police’s public relation officer, Anil Mittal, said that the carriageway leading to Ghaziabad was closed for traffic, as farmers blocked the roads at the UP Gate border.The carriageway leading to Delhi from Ghaziabad has already been closed for the last few days due to the farmers’ protest. “Traffic was diverted from Nizamuddin Khatta, Akshardham, and Ghazipur Chowk for onwards journey towards Ghaziabad via Anand Vihar, Apsara and Bhopura borders,” said Mittal.It was the second time since Monday afternoon that the expressway was completely blocked by the farmers. The nearly hour-long blockade on Monday was cleared after the officials of the UP administration assured the farmers that nobody would be stopped from going towards the borders.Rajveer Singh Jadhon, the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (UP unit), said that the UP government has been harassing farmers in the state and those coming from Uttarakhand, by stopping their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles in different places.Jadhon said that despite assurances, nearly 35 trolleys and 50 four-wheelers ferrying farmers were stopped at Rampur and Pilibhit on Monday night. “The police personnel misbehaved with the farmers and forced them to return. We blocked the UP Gate border with our tractors to express our protest against the UP administration and demand the release of farmers. We cleared one carriageway for vehicles going to Ghaziabad after the farmers were allowed to move towards Delhi,” said Jadhon.The border remained closed between 7am and 5pm on Tuesday, following which the carriageway going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi was opened after a meeting between farmer leaders and officials of the UP administration, who assured that the farmers, who had been stopped at Rampur, Pilibhit and Bilaspur, were allowed to move towards the UP Gate border.Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range), of the Uttar Pradesh police, said, “The carriageway was vacated by the protesters and we have assured that all their issues will be taken up. They were demanding that their vehicles must not be stopped from approaching the UP Gate from other areas in UP. But we have to take up checks to ascertain that no anti-social element gets in. We discussed with other officers and got the issue resolved. The carriageway was vacated around 5pm.”The Singhu and Tikri borders, where thousands of farmers are protesting, continued to remain shut while one carriageway of the Delhi-Noida link road at the Chilla border is open for vehicles entering Delhi from Noida. Motorists going to Noida are being diverted to other borders such as Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Kalindi Kunj, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli and Dallupura.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-block-delhi-meerut-expressway-in-protest-against-up-govt-for-stopping-their-counterparts/story-P8T5m8uonmmizIM8BqbadN.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Forest dept pulls up municipal agency over synthetic tracks at Nehru Park||The Delhi forest department has sent a notice to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for constructing a 22-metre synthetic jogging track at Nehru Park, which is identified as a deemed forest by the forest department. Senior forest department officers who did not wish to be named said that the unauthorised construction will have to be removed failing which they would take legal action. Deputy conservator of forests (south division), Amit Anand, issued a notice to the NDMC on December 17 stating that Nehru Park is a deemed forest, which means that any non-forest activity, such as construction is not permitted and also in violation of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). The order has also cited a 1997 Supreme Court judgment that prohibits such activity in a deemed forest. The notice was issued following a complaint filed by environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari on December 7, bringing the forest department’s attention to the violation. HT has seen a copy of the notice.NDMC, as a pilot project, created a 22-metre long synthetic jogging track in the park around seven months back. However, early this month the municipality started work on adding another 2.5 kms of this track citing “positive response from the public”. The work on this was underway and has been stopped after the civic agency received the notice. The notice issued to the NDMC read, “...Nehru Park is located within a ‘deemed forest’ and any non-forest activity, means the breaking up or clearing of any forest land or portion thereof for any purpose other than re-afforestation, is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act.” “...the NDMC is directed to furnish within 60 days of receiving the notice, why a complaint should not be filed in court,” the notice added. In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acre having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches of along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,”is considered a deemed forest. Any construction activities in such area requires permissions from the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under FCA. Such work also requires the usual permissions under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. Nehru Park, which is located in the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, was inaugurated in February, 1965 by then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, and is spread across 80 acres. A senior forest department of the official said that it is mandated under the FCA act that the erring agency be given time to respond to the official notice. However, along with an official response, NDMC will also have to remove the tracks that have already been laid out. “Any activity that will disturb the ecology of a marked deemed forest is prohibited. Permissions need to be taken from the Centre and forest department for it. It is high time land-owning agencies such as NDMC are held responsible for their actions,” the official said. However, a senior NDMC official explained that the jogging track was constructed for the benefit of scores of walkers and joggers who visit the park through the day. The municipality had been receiving complaints of users getting hurt on the uneven surface of the park’s older albeit natural track. BM Mishra, secretary NDMC said the ecology of the park was not hampered in any way during the construction of these tracks. “Nehru Park is popular among walkers and many senior citizens come to walk here. There are stones, uneven surface and dusty patches in the existing track, which not only create problems for walkers, but also contribute to dust pollution in the area. By creating a synthetic track, we have tried to provide a better walking and jogging facility for users without disturbing any greenery in the park. We will examine the forest department notice and respond accordingly,” Mishra said.Environment lawyer, Aditya Prasad, said government agencies consider the environmental aspects before undertaking infrastructure development. “Nature blindness is a serious phenomenon and it is spreading like wildfire. It is appalling that despite Delhi experiencing such high pollution levels for the most part of the year, government agencies do not understand the importance of protecting trees. Destruction of trees in an urban context has a direct and proportional impact on air pollution. I wonder if the next generation will be able to forgive this apathy,” Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/forest-dept-pulls-up-municipal-agency-over-synthetic-tracks-at-nehru-park/story-l7dti5utnKpVoqhcBpKmSK.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Ex-Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan claims being assaulted inside Mandoli prison||Former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan — who has been arrested in connection to the north-east Delhi riots and charged with the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — on Tuesday told a city court that she was assaulted by inmates at Mandoli Jail. Besides, Jahan, a few other accused also alleged that they are being discriminated and harassed.Jahan told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that this is the second incident within one month when she had been assaulted and she was under immense stress due to the continuous physical and verbal harassment.“ In the morning today at 6:30 am, they (the inmates) beat me up and abused me verbally. One of the inmates even slit her hand so that I am punished based on a false complaint. I have given a written complaint also. They keep calling me a terrorist,” she alleged.The former Congress leader claimed that she has been facing harassment in jail for the past four months and had requested that she be shifted to Tihar, but the request was denied due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Appearing for Jahan, her counsel, advocate Pradeep Teotia, contended that previously too she had been beaten up, following which one of the inmates was shifted to another jail.Following this, ASJ Rawat directed the jail authorities to take immediate steps to ensure Jahan’s security and ensure that she was not harassed further. The judge also sought a detailed report from the prison authorities on Wednesday detailing the steps that have been taken and to mention if shifting Jahan to another jail was required.During the proceedings, the Assistant Superintendent of Mandoli jail confirmed the incident and said that necessary steps have been taken.To this the judge told the jail official, “She (Jahan) seems to be in a state of utter fear. Please talk to her immediately and understand the situation. File a detailed report about the steps taken to allay her.”It also directed the prison authorities to produce her before the court on Wednesday through video conferencing.Advocate Rizwan, appearing for suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, claimed that most of the accused in the north east Delhi riots cases were facing discrimination in prison, either by the inmates or the jail authorities.He further alleged that the accused have been the accused have been declared as “terrorists” before conclusion of the trial.

23-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up committee to decide on de-escalating Covid-19 facilities||With hospital beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients turning vacant, the Delhi government has set-up a four-member committee to make recommendations for de-escalating the services. The four-member committee includes the special secretary (health) Udit Prakash Rai, director general of health services Nutan Mundeja, Dr Suneet Kaur from the National Centre of Disease Control, and the head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, professor Anant Mohan. Delhi has over 18,700 beds earmarked for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19), of which 5,100 beds are intensive care unit (ICU) beds, with and without ventilators. At present, only 15.2% of the total beds and 26.1% of the ICU beds are occupied, as per data on the government’s Delhi Corona app.The committee has been asked to submit its recommendations by Wednesday evening. Despite the government scaling up the number of ICU beds, the occupancy had reached over 86% in November, when Delhi saw its third and highest surge in the number of cases. The committee has been asked to study the current trends in admission and discharge of Covid-19 patients to make recommendations on whether the number of ICU beds should be de-escalated at this point. The terms of reference for the committee state, “...the de-escalation recommendations strike a harmonious balance between regional and locational access across all categories of hospitals and the need to have buffer capacity for patients from neighbouring states.” The recommendations would pave the way for freeing up ICU beds in private hospitals for services other than Covid-19. In November, when the number of Covid-19 cases was on the rise, 75 private hospitals in the city were asked to reserve 80% of their ICU beds for treating Covid-19 patients. The Delhi government had issued the order to 33 large private hospitals on September 12, during the previous surge in cases. However, the decision was challenged in the high court and a stay was issued. The stay was then vacated when the cases started rising in November and the Delhi government subsequently asked 42 other hospitals to also reserve 80% of ICU beds. “There is a hearing of the petition in the court tomorrow. Unnecessarily, the Covid-19 beds are lying vacant. The occupancy is hardly about 40%, whereas the non-Covid beds are running full and many surgeries and complex procedures were being delayed for the want of ICU beds,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general, Association of Healthcare Providers (India), who had challenged the Delhi government order earlier. Besides, de-escalation will also bring respite to the students from Maulana Azad Medical College and University College of Medical Sciences, as their training has been hit due to the lack of regular patients. The Delhi government had converted the associated Lok Nayak Hospital and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital into Covid-only facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-up-committee-to-decide-on-de-escalating-covid-19-facilities/story-VRAXkgZjZhE92PkxH2Ml0M.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||A surprising outcome at Singhu: Farmers pick up cooking skills||Before joining the ongoing farmers’ agitation at Delhi’s Singhu border on November 27, Hardeep Singh, a farmer from Salana village in Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib district, did not know any cooking. Today, the 32-year-old is a part of a 20-member team cooking meals twice a day for hundreds at the spot.“My uncle has some experience because of the langars (community kitchens) we organise back home. We follow his lead here. In three weeks, I have learnt how to make vegetable curries and dal (lentils) of different kinds,” he said. “Back home, it was the women in our family who cooked, while we worked the fields. They could not join us here due to inadequate facilities. So we had to make our own meals.”Singh doesn’t claim to have mastered the art though.“Our focus is not on ensuring taste. We are here to fight for our rights and are happy eating whatever we make,” he said.Singh’s langar is among the many small ones that have come up at the site. The groups source ingredients from their villages and as such they exist only till their stock lasts after which they’d go back home to return with more. They usually serve around 100 people at a time.The cooks’ day begins at 6 am when the air is still very chilly. The morning meal is usually various Indian breads with chickpea curry; for lunch they’ll have rice with dal and seasonal vegetables; dinner will likely see rotis accompanied by what was made for lunch with yet another batch of freshly-cooked curries. There are also larger langars organised by various trusts and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which serve over 1,000 people round the clock. On why they didn’t eat from these langars instead, 23-year-old Karnal farmer Manpreet Singh, who is part of another small langar group, said: “Many underprivileged people also eat at those langars. If we too join them, maybe they won’t have enough food. Isn’t it then better to cook multiple langars?”Manpreet, however, hasn’t told his family what he has been doing, which, at the moment, was kneading dough for more than 300 rotis. “If I tell them, they might ask me to do it for them back at home as well,” he said, sheepishly. “I am still learning how to make proper dough.”Gurpal Singh, 47, a farmer from Bhandal Bet village in Punjab’s Kapurthala district, whose group cooks for around 70 people, said, “Whenever we video call our family while preparing the meals, they get excited. My wife is happy that I have learnt how to cook. Now I can help out when she is sick or has to spend some time at our relatives’ place.”Gurpal said that many farmers among them called their wives and mothers for recipes or observed other groups preparing the meals. “Initially, we messed up the rotis. But with practice, we have gotten good at it. Now we make all kinds of stuffed parathas (fried flatbreads) including potato, cauliflower, fenugreek leaves, and other vegetables.” His friend Jaspal Singh, 38, said, “My nine-year-old daughter is most excited about it and wants me to make them for her when I return.”Kuldeep Singh, a 35-year-old farmer from Usmanpur in Punjab’s SBS Nagar district, said that some of the farmers also had a practice of cooking during the agitation that had been going on in Punjab since the three farm laws were passed in September.“We have a team of about 50 people who make food throughout the day. We have divided the roles according to the capabilities that we have managed to gauge in these past few months. Almost 90% of these farmers did not know how to cook before the agitation and have only picked it up now,” said Singh, a member of Kirti Kisaan Union, which feeds more than 1,000 people every day at their langar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-surprising-outcome-at-singhu-farmers-pick-up-cooking-skills/story-TkoyMOOHBMGapgucATIC4M.html
23-12-2020||Delhi||Tamil Nadu farmers lend support to Singhu protesters, say ready to join agitation||A delegation of Tamil Nadu Farmers Protection Association said on Tuesday that hundreds of farmers from Tamil Nadu were ready to join the protest at Delhi’s borders if the government did not roll back the three farm laws. The leaders said that hundreds of farmers from the south Indian state have planned to drive to Delhi in tractors by next week, educating people about the lapses and harms of the new farm bill on their way to join the movement in Delhi.The 12-member delegation from Coimbatore that had come to visit the farmer groups who have been camping at Singhu border since November 27, said the farmers’ demands are legitimate and the central government cannot turn a deaf ear towards them.Nalla Gounder, coordinator of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Protection Association, said there were protests against the bill in Tamil Nadu also in small groups.“Since the protest in Delhi by our farmer brothers from Haryana and Punjab is growing stronger, we want to add to the number and boost their morale. I am myself a farmer and we are well aware of the harms of the new bill. We support the demand for it to be repealed. If the government continues to act deaf towards our demands, hundreds of farmers from Tamil Nadu are ready to fuel the ongoing protest,” Gounder said.The coordinator said 200 farmers had booked train tickets to come to Delhi but they were stopped by the state government. “12 of us have come today by air and we ensure more our men will join in days to come,” he said.Easan, another farmer leader who had come to Delhi from Tirupur in Tamil Nadu, said at least 100 tractors are ready to start moving towards Delhi by next week. “On our way to the Capital by road we will spread awareness about the farm laws. Each tractor will have at least 10-12 farmers,” Easan said.Welcoming the support, Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharita Kisan Union, Ludhiana said they were delighted to see farmers from other states coming out in support. “A major protest against the bill was also organized today in Maharashtra. They even contacted us and assured us of their physical presence if need be. We are delighted to have witnessed such a massive response to our movement that will benefit farmers in the India regardless of which state they come from,” Lakhowal said.The farmers’ agitation overall remained peaceful on Tuesday as it entered its 27th day. The farmers at the Singhu border spent their day mostly delivering speeches from the central stage, raising anti-farm law slogans, singing songs, raising banners, cooking and distributing langars.Senior police officers also said that their deployment at the border remained as usual. “The protest remained peaceful on Tuesday with no untoward incident reported from any part of the Delhi’s borders where the farmers have been camping since last month. We maintained our deployment of the security personnel and the situation is being closely monitored,” said a senior police officer from Singhu border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tamil-nadu-farmers-lend-support-to-singhu-protesters-say-ready-to-join-agitation/story-NJO5ZquA9ixxYpDRxqMcWP.html
23-12-2020||Pune||Police invokes night curfew in Pune||A day after the state government imposed a night curfew in Maharashtra, Pune police issued its curfew orders for 15 days starting Tuesday night.Curfew will be in force from December 22, 2020 to January 5, 2021.Officials from the district administration said they are working on a plan to adhere to the government guidelines in areas adjoining the city limits given that latest order applies to municipal limits. According to the order signed by Ravindra Shisve, Joint Commissioner of Pune police, the movement of people on the city streets, under curfew orders, will be restricted between 11pm and 6am. The order was originally issued on Tuesday, two days before Christmas eve and over a week before New Year’s Eve, in order to prevent crowding during the season in view of possible spread of the Covid infection. “As part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid, state government has extended the lockdown until December 31 based on the amended notification issued on November 27… With reference to Monday’s order, additional restrictions have been imposed in the municipal Limits across the state,” Shisve stated in his order. Essential services which were exempt during the earlier lockdown days, will continue to be exempted from the curfew during the next two weeks as well, as per the order. For everyone else, action under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code will be initiated if found violating the curfew. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said the administration will ensure that there is no crowding even in areas outside the municipal Limits. The original order by the state government is applicable to municipal corporations. However, considering the possibility that revellers may attend parties outside municipal limits, administration is taking appropriate steps, said Deshmukh. “We have considered all these aspects and necessary steps will be taken. We also discussed this issue today with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/police-invokes-night-curfew-in-pune/story-cEZ2MstEwrMsmqdUeztdxH.html
23-12-2020||Pune||Pune sees season’s coldest day at 8.1 degrees Celsius||The city’s night temperature dipped to 8.1 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, making it season’s coolest day so far. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), Pune noted the air quality index (AQI) of Pune as moderate on Tuesday. Safar officials said that if the temperature continues to drop and the wind is calmer, AQI may worsen. They said that the pollution levels may remain moderate in the coming few days. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), the night temperature drop is likely till December 27. “We have forecasted a moderate air quality on Tuesday for the city. The lead pollutant was PM 2.5 (refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, about 3% the diameter of a human hair). The forecast for Pune remains moderate air quality for the next few days. The air pollutants are trapped which continues to show higher than usual AQI in Pune,” said Safar officials. “If the wind speed decreases further with a consistent drop in temperature, there is a likely possibility that the air pollution in the city may increase. But the present conditions in wind speed and decreasing temperature will prevail in the next few days which will keep the air quality to moderate,” said Safar officials. Cold weather to continue IMD has forecasted that the day and night temperature in the city will remain below normal in the coming few days. On Tuesday, the night temperature was 2.7 degrees Celsius less than normal. That is, the expected temperature on Tuesday was 10.8 degree Celsius, but it was reported to be 8.1 degrees resulting in icy cold nights in the city. The day temperature on Tuesday was reported to be 27.6 degrees Celsius. This was 1.1 degrees less than normal. The expected temperature for Tuesday was 28.8 degrees Celsius. The lowest minimum temperature in the state was at Parbhani in Marathwada at 7.3 degrees Celsius. “Parts of Vidarbha may witness cold wave on December 24 and December 25. The night temperature in Pune will not be more than 11 degrees Celsius this week. Whereas the day temperature will also remain 29 degrees Celsius or less,” said IMD.

23-12-2020||Pune||Pune hoteliers miffed at night curfew timings; want it to start at midnight||After the state government, on Monday, announced a night curfew from December 22 onwards, the hoteliers’ association is upset with the decision. “Already our business was down for more than six months and had somewhat started gaining momentum. And suddenly yesterday, this order came, of a night curfew from 11 pm to 6 am. This will certainly affect our business by 15 per cent. So far, we were able to recover by 40 per cent of pre-Covid business. Now, it will again go down and especially during Christmas and the year-end time, when mostly people are out till late celebrating,” said Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association. “Now our demand is that if they want to have night curfew it’s fine, but at least change the timings. It should start from 12 midnight, to 6 am, so atleast we can do some business. We are now going to send our demand letter to the chief minister, Pune city municipal commissioner and Pune police commissioner. Already, we close our hotels by 11.30 pm daily, as per government norms, and it takes half- an-hour to wind up the things and customers take time to reach home,” Shetty added.Meanwhile, the Hotel and Restaurants Association of Western India, had last week demanded an extension of hotel timings till 1.30 am. “The hotel and restaurants business has started to gain some business, but going forward, extension of time is needed. Customers usually come after 9 pm for dinner and closing down immediately in the next couple of hours is not serving any purpose. Also, if time is extended, then social distancing will be improved as people will come in at different timings,” said association president Sherry Bhatia. On other hand, traders in Pune are not complaining. Fatechand Ranka, president, Federation of Traders Association of Pune (FTAP) said, “There is not such impact on traders and shop owners in Pune due to night curfew. All our shops close down by 9 pm. There won’t be any problem for us.”Bhushan Mane, owner of a restaurant on Sinhagad road said, “I started a month back and was looking forward to doing good business during Christmas and the year end. I had purchased more goods and hired four people extra looking at the response which we get during the night time. Now if we have to close early by 10pm or 10.30pm, it takes half hour to clean and wind up, so there won’t be any business. State government has to rethink this decision and start the curfew at 12 midnight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-hoteliers-miffed-at-night-curfew-timings-want-it-to-start-at-midnight/story-4M0hwtGpV7cVJytrC8uGaP.html
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s night curfew at cities to begin today: All you need to know||Maharashtra has announced that a seven-hour night curfew would be put in place across all cities and municipal corporation areas in the state. The curfew from 11pm to 6am is being imposed from Tuesday, December 22, 2020, for 15 days until January 5, 2021.What caused the curfew?A high-level meeting called by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray decided to implement the night curfew across cities in the state. Two main reasons have been stated by the government for the move.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said that occurrences of violation of social distancing norms have been observed in Mumbai. To avoid an increase in Covid-19 cases during the oncoming new year celebrations because of these violations, the curfew has been put in place. “This is not a normal new year which is why we cannot have normal celebrations. The curfew is being imposed to ensure that such violations are not repeated,” he said.ALSO WATCH | New Covid strain: Passengers in Mumbai from UK sent to institutional quarantine Also, the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in the UK after the outbreak of a new mutation of coronavirus has also caused concerns globally. The Maharashtra government has said that the move is a precautionary measure and has also asked the people to remain vigilant for the next 15 days.What are the new rules?Chahal explained the difference between a total lockdown and a night curfew as “ While in a lockdown, individuals cannot step out of their homes. In a curfew, more than 5 people cannot assemble outside during the specified hours. So, offices that function overnight or something like dairy transportation can still operate. Taxis, cars and auto-rickshaws will also run just like before.”Also read: Mumbai civic body prepares blueprint for Covid-19 vaccine driveHere are new changes implemented due to the night curfew:• All cities and municipal corporation areas will be under night curfew for 7 hours from 11pm to 6am starting from December 22, 2020, until January 5, 2021.• More than five people can not assemble outside during the curfew. However, offices, taxis, car and auto-rickshaws are allowed to operate in the night following the existing norms.• All travellers arriving at Mumbai airport from European countries and the Middle East would be placed under institutional quarantine.• The travellers are allowed to leave for their homes upon completion of the quarantine period. Also, RT-PCR Covid-19 test for these travellers would be taken on the fifth or the seventh day.• People from other countries apart from Europe and the Middle East would be prescribed a home quarantine.• Temporary institutional quarantine facilities near airports and hotels would be arranged by the municipal commissioners.• Air travel between India and the UK was suspended on Monday and all flights that are already scheduled to arrive would carry nearly 1,000 passengers, who would be transported to 2000 hotel rooms arranged for them.

23-12-2020||World||Pak-linked groups in Canada seek probe into Baloch activist’s mysterious death in Toronto||Several Canadian civil society groups with roots in Pakistan have sought a “thorough investigation” into what they have described as the “murder” of 37-year-old Karima Baloch, whose corpse was found by Toronto police this week after she had gone missing.Toronto police have already said it was a “non-criminal death”. In a tweet, they reiterated that “no foul play is suspected” and that they have “updated the family” in this regard.However, in an open letter, a group of organisations has urged the Canadian government “to undertake immediate and thorough investigation, bring the perpetrators to justice, and take just, diplomatic and political course of action in case any foreign country or group were found to be involved in the brutal murder of this human rights activist”.Canada’s permanent representative to the UN, Bob Rae, has expressed grief over Karima’s sudden demise, tweeting, “I had the honour and pleasure of meeting Karima Baloch to discuss the human rights situation affecting many of her friends and family. I am deeply saddened to learn of her death, and express my deepest condolences to her family and her community.”No evidence has yet emerged or been offered by investigators on whether indeed she was murdered. However, the statement asserted “that given the threats to her life by Pakistani authorities because of her political activism, a much thorough investigation” into the incident was warranted.The organisations issuing the statement include Baloch National Movement, Balochistan National Party - Canada, World Sindhi Congress - Canada, Pashtun Council Canada, and PTM Committee Canada. They represent dissident groups agitating against Islamabad.With regard to their demand for a thorough investigation, the signatories also said that “any lack of concrete action to this end might jeopardise the global image that Canada has”.They added that this episode “reminded” them of the death of Sajid Husain, a Baloch journalist forced into exile in Sweden “after covering violence, crime and a simmering insurgency in Pakistan”. He was found dead on April 23, 2019 in north of Stockholm, after remaining missing for more than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-linked-groups-in-canada-seek-probe-into-baloch-activist-s-mysterious-death-in-toronto/story-fogfHMf3tKA3tqwCjQFHrJ.html
23-12-2020||World||Cotton futures rise with Chinese purchases pacing US exports||Cotton futures climbed on signs of firm demand for supplies from the US, the world’s top exporter. Most soft commodities advanced as a weaker dollar boosted the appeal of assets priced in the greenback.In the week ended Dec. 17, US export sales of upland cotton more than tripled from a year earlier, government data showed. China has boosted purchases to meet commitments under a trade deal, while its economy rebounds.The US Department of Agriculture cut its forecast for the domestic crop several times after adverse weather, including drought and hurricanes, eroded supply prospects. Futures have jumped 57% from the lowest in a decade on April 1. A surge in soybean and corn prices signals cotton acreage may ebb next year, Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director for Plexus Cotton Ltd., said in a report.“Export demand has held strong despite stay-at-home orders and weaker economies around the world,” Jack Scoville a vice president at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in an email. “Traders now hope for even more demand later” as coronavirus vaccines are distributed and consumer demand recovers, he said.Cotton for March delivery rose 1.3% to 75.79 cents a pound at 12:34 p.m. on ICE Futures US in New York. Last week, the price reached 77.41 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since April 2019.Brazil, the second-largest exporter, faces a smaller harvest and higher domestic demand, while Pakistan, a major importer, is boosting purchases after a drop in production.Raw sugar, arabica coffee and cocoa climbed in New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cotton-futures-rise-with-chinese-purchases-pacing-us-exports/story-xBGwG7Cu9N6fzkCiPqtzXM.html
23-12-2020||World||‘Highly concerning’: UK identifies new South African coronavirus variant, tightens lockdown||Two cases of another new strain of Covid-19 linked to South Africa have been identified in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed here on Wednesday. Like the UK variant identified earlier, the new variant of the novel coronavirus is also driving a massive resurgence of the disease in South Africa, with experts warning the country is probably facing a much larger second wave. “Both [cases of the new variant] are contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks,” Hancock said, addressing a briefing from 10 Downing Street. “This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK,” he said.The minister confirmed immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa and the government’s urgent message being for anyone who has been in South Africa or been in contact with someone linked with the country in the last fortnight to immediately quarantine.Analysis on the new mutation and its trajectory in the UK is meanwhile being analysed by scientific experts at Porton Down, the country’s specialist laboratory in south west England.As a result, even more parts of the UK are set to be put under the strictest level of lockdown after ministers held talks earlier on Wednesday following the UK registering 36,804 positive coronavirus cases, the largest daily number of infections recorded at any time during the pandemic. Millions more in the east and south-east England will be placed into the Tier 4 highest alert level from December 26, celebrated as Boxing Day the day after Christmas, as the new UK variant of coronavirus continues to show high transmissibility.The minister also revealed that the Oxford University vaccine being produced by AstraZeneca has submitted its full data package for regulatory approval, even as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine rollout continues. “I know how hard 2020 has been for everybody… But we mustn’t give up now we know that we can control this virus we know we can get through this together… I know from the bottom of my heart, that there are brighter skies ahead,” he said.The briefing comes as the new variant identified in the UK last week, named VUI-202012/01 and with much higher transmissibility, led to several countries including India cutting off transport links with the UK in an effort to try and contain its spread outside Britain.The backlog of lorries built up on the UK border with France have now begun to gradually clear up after an agreement was reached.France agreed to lift its ban on UK arrivals on the condition of a negative coronavirus test. However, there have been reports of scuffles on the UK-France border as truckers face days ahead before the nearly 1,500 lorries can start moving towards their destinations.During what is an annual festive and holiday period in the UK with Christmas and New Year, millions in the country have had their plans to meet friends and family scuppered after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson abandoned a planned five-day “Christmas bubble” after scientists confirmed the new Covid-19 variant was spreading more rapidly.Under the revised rules, only people living in tiers one to three are permitted to socialise in a bubble of three households on December 25 for Christmas Day. Those in Tier 4 areas must only celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubble. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. The Opposition Labour Party has accused Johnson of having “always been behind the Covid curve” and urged him to move quickly. “If the scientific advice is tougher restrictions, don’t sit on it for weeks like you did last time, don’t dither, don’t delay – because that has disastrous consequences, take the action that is needed now to save lives,” said Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to Johnson to say his party will back any government moves to tighten restrictions if that is what scientists recommend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-concerning-uk-identifies-new-south-african-coronavirus-variant-tightens-lockdown/story-55ZimkpCdUhShBq132OD3N.html
23-12-2020||World||UK, EU on the brink of ‘historic’ post-Brexit trade accord||The U.K. and European Union are on the brink of sealing a historic post-Brexit trade accord, with officials hopeful a deal could be struck as soon as Wednesday.Negotiators from the two sides are in the very final phases of the talks, officials said. Discussions are still continuing on fisheries, the biggest obstacle to an accord. It’s still possible, one official cautioned, that the deal could fall apart.Sterling advanced by as much as 1.6% to $1.3571, the biggest intraday gain in more than a week. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was poised for the biggest gain since March.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have intervened personally in recent days, holding several phone conversations in a last-ditch bid to reach an agreement before the U.K. leaves the single market at the end of the month.If they can pull off an accord, it would draw a line under almost five years of often tempestuous negotiations since the U.K. voted to withdraw from the EU in 2016 and lay the foundations for Britain to trade and collaborate with the bloc going forward. Hundreds of trucks backed up around the southern English port of Dover earlier this week had offered a sobering reminder of the potential consequences of ending Britain’s transition period on Dec. 31 without a deal.Read More: Isolated U.K. Seeks to Reopen Trade Route After Days of ChaosNegotiations resumed early on Wednesday in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, with discussions focused on what access EU boats will have to British waters, and what rights the EU will have to impose retaliatory tariffs should the U.K. limit that access in the future.Both sides have made an agreement on fishing a precondition for any wider deal over their future relationship, even if the 650 million euros ($790 million) of fish European boats catch in U.K. waters each year is a fraction of the 512 billion euros of goods traded annually between Britain and the EU.Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, told a meeting of ambassadors from the 27 EU member states Tuesday that there had been progress in the talks, and a deal could be signed before Christmas -- if the British are prepared to compromise further on fishing, according to diplomats briefed on the discussions. The talks could continue beyond Christmas, or fail completely, he told the private meeting.Senior EU officials said the decision lies with Johnson, while people familiar with the British side said the onus was on the Europeans to move.Diplomats in the EU’s working group have discussed how a potential agreement could be put into effect by Jan. 1 even though there isn’t enough time for formal ratification by the EU Parliament. While such procedural preparations aren’t in themselves proof a deal has been reached, they signal that the bloc is preparing for one.If an agreement is struck, the commission will publish the draft unofficial text and send it to member states and the European Parliament, according to a diplomat briefed on the preparations. EU government envoys in Brussels will have two days to discuss and approve the draft, according to the plan. Then a written procedure for the signing of the free trade agreement will follow, so that it can be published in the official journal of the European Union by Dec. 31.(Updates with pound in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-on-the-brink-of-historic-post-brexit-trade-accord/story-H4TbdHkbnQC2BdUdPfWcXN.html
23-12-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson imposes ‘strictest’ Covid-19 curbs in several more areas||Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher regulations across a swath of England in an effort to stamp down on the mutant strain of coronavirus that’s spreading quickly across the country.Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, most of Hampshire and the remainder of Essex will now face the strictest rules under the government’s 4-tier system, from 00:01 a.m. on Dec. 26, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Wednesday in a press conference.They join London and southeast England, meaning non-essential shops will have to close and socializing is further curtailed.The new variant “is spreading at a dangerous rate,” said Hancock, putting the rise in cases in the past week at 57%. “The direction is clear and in many cases quite stark.”The government is struggling to bring the virus back under control after the new mutant strain began spreading rapidly in London and surrounding areas. After an England-wide lockdown last month halted growth in infections, the virus has since started spreading exponentially again, risking overwhelming the National Health Service as cases tick upwards.The new coronavirus variant, which emerged in southeast England in September, has alarmed scientists and governments around the world because early analysis suggests it may be as much as 70% more transmissible than other circulating strains. Countries including France temporarily suspended travel from the U.K. in response.Hancock also said that two new cases of an even more transmissible variant originating in South Africa have so far been detected in the U.K. He told people who have recently returned form South Africa to go into quarantine.(Updates with locations moved up a tier in table.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-imposes-strictest-covid-19-curbs-in-several-more-areas/story-jyLWESXGNvm9BpE3CpA1mL.html

In a Twitter post, Estonia’s Defence Ministry called the move “important & highly appreciated news”Washington has provided military assistance before to the three Baltic nations, which are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. However, the Estonian ministry said this was the first time the aid is being allocated through a dedicated program, the Baltic Security Initiative.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are former Soviet republics which joined NATO in 2004. All three countries border Russia.“The decision by the US Congress demonstrates that our strongest ally is committed to the defence of our region and understands the security challenges here,” Estonian Defence Minister Juri Luik said in a statement.He said the measure confirmed that “the United States sees Estonia and the Baltic states as trustworthy allies who take their commitment to defence seriously” by investing into their national defence capabilities and contributing to NATO operations.The Defence Ministry noted that the US has maintained an active military presence in the Baltic region this year and Estonia’s military held multiple joint exercises with the US Army, Air Force, and Navy.From late September to early November, the US Cyber Command held a joint operation with Estonia to help the nation search out and block potential cyber-threats from Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-grants-169m-in-military-aid-to-baltic-nations-for-2021/story-Rj2lmJUiYm3BySKi96QNdL.html
23-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 relief bill has new law providing for up to 10 years in prison for illegal streaming||A piece of legislation has been added to the much-awaited Covid-19 stimulus bill, passed by the US Congress after months of negotiation, that severely punishes streamers who pirate large amounts of copyrighted content. Earlier this month, Senator Thom Tillis, chairman of the senate judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property, introduced the ‘Protecting Lawful Streaming Act’ which provides for up to 10 years of imprisonment in case of multiple violations. However, the law doesn’t target casual internet users who use illegal streaming services or “access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.” Tillis’ office had stated that it “would apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services.” The bill has been co-sponsored by five Democratic and four Republican senators.“The shift toward streaming content online has resulted in criminal streaming services illegally distributing copyrighted material that costs the US economy nearly $30 billion every year, and discourages the production of creative content that Americans enjoy,” Tillis had said in a statement.Also Read | Trump threatens to torpedo Covid relief with new demandsThe Republican senator highlighted that the legislation is narrowly targeted to punish criminal organisations, adding that no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution. He said the bipartisan legislation also has support from two groups including Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group.In a separate statement, Public Knowledge said that although there is no need for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement, the bill is “narrowly tailored” and avoids criminalising casual internet users who may click on a link, or upload a file. Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, stated that the law also does not criminalise streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams.“We appreciate Senator Tillis’ decision to release the text of his proposal, and his leadership in bringing in consumer groups to the table, listening to our concerns, and working to prevent risk to end users and legitimate streamers and streaming platforms,” Rose added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-relief-bill-has-new-law-providing-for-up-to-10-years-in-prison-for-illegal-streaming/story-xFFgQUKIk586Nt3JTkyNiI.html
23-12-2020||World||Pakistan Democratic Movement holds rally in Mardan despite govt restrictions||Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an 11-party alliance, held a rally in Mardan on Wednesday despite a ban imposed by the district administration amid the COVID-19.The district administration had decided not to allow the opposition leaders to hold the public procession given the rising numbers of coronavirus infections across the country, according to Geo News.Responding to the PDM’s call for protest, Mardan deputy commissioner warned that action will be taken against the protesters.The protesters, led by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz, and senior PPP leader Yousuf Raza Gilani, gathered at Gaju Baba Khan flyover, Geo News reported.Awami National Party Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Aftab Sherpao of the Qaumi Watan Party, and other opposition leaders are scheduled to address the rally.This comes after the PDM demanded Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government to quit by January 31 or face intensified movements by opposition parties such as a long march to Islamabad.“The meeting in Mardan would be followed by another public meeting in Larkana on December 27 on the eve of the death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto,” The News International quoted Mian Iftikhar Hussain, PDM spokesman, as saying.The PDM decided to focus on smaller cities for the public meeting. The protest will be held in Bahawalpur on December 30, Malakand on January 3, 2021, Bannu on January 6, Khuzdar on January 9, Loralai on January 13, Tharparkar on January 16, Faisalabad on January 18, Sargodha on January 23, and Sialkot on January 27.In the past months, Khan has stepped up his efforts to silence the voice of the PDM, along with thousands of people, who criticised the government.

23-12-2020||World||Britain approves use of Covid-19 self-test kit||Britain on Wednesday approved using a Covid-19 self-test kit endorsed by its state-run health service to detect asymptomatic cases, as it mulls further restrictions to stem the spread of a highly infectious variant of the virus.The government has said it wants to start mass testing people as part of its strategy for tracking and tracing infections with cases spiking and as it battles the new variant.It had launched a mass-testing pilot scheme in the northwest city of Liverpool in November, offering everyone tests whether or not they had symptoms, in an attempt to find a new way to use testing to limit the spread of the coronavirus.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that the kit uses an antigen lateral flow test (antigen LFT), which can give results in 30 minutes.Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a “world-beating” national test-and-trace system earlier this year, whereby people with symptoms get tested and the contacts of positive cases are asked to self-isolate.But the broader NHS Test and Trace system has been heavily criticised following a series of high-profile failures since its launch earlier this year, and government ministers have conceded it has not performed as well as they had hoped.Britain also began testing truckers for Covid-19 on Wednesday as Paris and London agreed that drivers carrying a negative test result could board ferries for Calais after much of the world shut its borders to Britain to contain the new mutated variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-approves-use-of-covid-19-self-test-kit/story-LavJfUF4Vz3uJbLKgXVO9M.html

It has not been possible to reach him for comment.Speaking earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung, said 170 of the woman’s contacts had tested negative for the virus, while three others are awaiting results.Taiwan has reported a total of 777 cases - mostly imported - and seven deaths. Around 130 people remain in hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-s-eva-air-sacks-pilot-blamed-for-rare-local-covid-19-case/story-nIxanGXGPafkUd4MwWOg8O.html

23-12-2020||World||Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led faction of NCP elects him as new parliamentary leader of Nepal||Nepal Communist Party’s (NCP) executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ was on Wednesday elected as the ruling party’s new parliamentary leader, replacing Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli.The 66-year-old leader’s nomination was proposed by senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, who was earlier named as one of the two chairmen of the party, at a parliamentary party meeting of the Prachanda-led faction at the Parliament Building in New Baneshwar, My Republica reported.Oli, 68, was removed from the post of party’s chairman on Tuesday by a central committee meeting of the Prachanda-led faction, which also decided to take disciplinary action against him for dissolving the House of Representatives unconstitutionally.Prachanda said that his first priority would be to restore the dissolved House of Representatives and form a new government.“I will unify all the democratic forces and political parties to keep the hard-won political system and parliament lively and functioning,” he said.He thanked lawmakers for electing him as the parliamentary leader and said that he has been handed over a huge responsibility during this challenging time.Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court forwarded all the writ petitions against Prime Minister Oli’s move to dissolve Parliament to a Constitutional bench.Chief Justice Cholendra SJB Rana’s single bench passed the order after a preliminary hearing on the 12 different writ petitions filed against the dissolution of the House of Representatives, the paper reported.The Constitutional bench will start the hearing on Friday. The bench is led by Chief Justice Rana and will have four other justices who will be picked by him.Although the petitioners demanded an interim order against the decision, the apex court has refused to issue any such order.Meanwhile, leaders of the Prachanda-led faction have told the Election Commission (EC) that they hold a two-thirds majority in the party and therefore they must be granted official recognition by the election body, the paper said.“We are here with the proof that we are the only legitimate Nepal Communist Party,” Leela Mani Pokharel, a standing committee member of the party, was quoted as saying by the paper.Pokharel said that their faction has a majority with official signatures of 315 central committee members of the party.To get official recognition from the EC, the faction should have majority members, full details and their signatures along with copies of citizenships.Nepal on Sunday plunged into a political crisis after Prime Minister Oli got President Bidya Devi Bhandari to dissolve Parliament, a controversial move amidst a prolonged tussle for power between him and former premier Prachanda within the ruling dispensation. The move came after the intra-party feud reached climax in the ruling party which has been witnessing months long tussle between two factions, one led by Oli and another led by Prachanda. The ruling party has now been virtually divided more than two years after it was formed following the merger of CPN-UML led by Oli and CPN-Maoist Centre led by Prachanda in May 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pushpa-kamal-dahal-led-faction-of-ncp-elects-him-as-new-parliamentary-leader-of-nepal/story-5ZVY2ctxT2Qh0uOBbD87jI.html

Bohai Sea is a westward, inner extension of Yellow Sea.In a separate instance, at least 16 more Indian seafarers have not been allowed to leave their ship MV Anastasia, stranded off Caofeidian port in the same province.Beijing has not allowed them to get off the vessel in the backdrop of increasing imported Covid-19 infections in the country, putting the physical and mental health of the sailors at risk.There’s been no report of any Covid-19 case on the ship in the past six months on Jag Anand.But that hasn’t stopped the Chinese port authorities from implementing strict anti-epidemic protocols, preventing the sailors from disembarking.“China has explicit stipulations on the epidemic control measures and quarantine of seafarers at ports,” said Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, at a regular ministry briefing on Wednesday when asked about the condition of the Indian sailors aboard Jag Anand.“The local authorities of China have been in close communication with the Indian side and replied to their requests in a timely manner. We also provide necessary facilitation and assistance while meeting certain quarantine and epidemic prevention requirements,” Zhao said.The ship sailed from the port of Gladstone in Australia on May 26 - carrying Australian coal - and reached Jingtang port in China on June 13.Since that day, the ship has been anchored 2-3km away from the port.HT had reported in November that while the local port authorities have not allowed “crew change” - whereby a ship’s crew can disembark and head back to their country of origin - it has been communicated to them that anyone needing treatment could be allowed to come ashore temporarily for medical attention.A news report by India’s ANI in November had said the 23 Indian crew members on board were seeking help from the Indian government to return home. Some are suffering from health issues and the ship is running short of medicines, the report said.However, that’s not the only merchant navy ship on which Indian sailors have been stranded for months.At least 16 Indians are stuck on MV Anastasia off the Caofeidian port in Hebei province.“Onboard the Anastasia are 18 seafarers - 16 of them Indian, one Russian and one Filipino - forced to work at sea for far longer that their current anchorage, with crew clocking up to 20 months as ports refuse to let them disembark for fear of spreading contagion,” a report in The Sydney Morning Herald said Tuesday, adding that at least four them were on “suicide watch”.An estimated 1,500 seafarers are stranded in Chinese harbours, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-indian-sailors-remain-stuck-on-stranded-ships-at-chinese-ports/story-6xarQxJww09AJ8RdZpenLN.html

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) stated that a traveller on Singapore Airlines flight 637 used AOKpass, a digitally authenticated medical records, “to officially present a negative Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction” digital test result upon arrival at Changi Airport’s immigration counters.“This was the first time an immigration authority has used a blockchain based, digitally verifiable health certificate,” the statement read.According to the ICC, Singapore has become the first country to use a digital health certificate to verify the Covid-19 status of inbound travellers. All travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia will now be able to use ICC AOKpass at Changi Airport to digitally authenticate their Covid-19 test results. They will also be able to authenticate other necessary health credentials during immigration checks.Also Read | Covid-19: All you need to know about global QR code proposed by ChinaICC secretary-general John W.H. Denton AO opined that the chaos at UK ports, triggered by movement restrictions due to the new coronavirus variant, demonstrated the need for pre-travel testing. Denton AO said in a statement that the AOKpass app, following months of pilot tests, has now reached the necessary level of maturity to receive a “sovereign endorsement.” “Deploying standardised testing and verification systems are, simply put, the only way governments can safeguard cross-border commerce while the spread of the virus remains highly unpredictable,” he added.Dr Chester Drum, a co-founder of AOKpass, said in a statement that the use of blockchain technology is a critical step in combating the challenges of forged tests and medical records. He stressed that there is an urgent need for a common framework in certifying, authenticating and securing the results of a Covid-19 test.“In addition, users must trust that their data privacy is managed well, with no risk of personal data leaks,” Drum added.Chinese President Xi Jinping has also been pushing for a Covid-19 tracking system by using QR codes, as a part of “global mechanism” to ease international travel during coronavirus pandemic. During a virtual G20 summit in November, Xi had proposed a mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates in the form of “internationally accepted QR codes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singaporean-citizen-first-to-use-digital-covid-19-health-certificate-to-cross-international-border/story-HInDE4bqz6hjoY4YqfRAuK.html

23-12-2020||World||Global virus rules for Christmas: Tough, mild or none at all||In Peru, you can’t drive your car on Christmas. In Lebanon, you can go to a nightclub, but you can’t dance. In South Africa, roadblocks instead of beach parties will mark this year’s festive season.How many people can you share a Christmas meal with? France recommends no more than six, in Chile it’s 15, and in Brazil it’s as many as you want. Meanwhile, Italy’s mind-boggling, color-coded holiday virus rules change almost every day for the next two weeks.Countries around the world are trying to find the right formulas to keep their people safe for Christmas, especially as new virus variants prompt renewed travel bans and fuel resurgent infections, hospitalizations and deaths at the end of an already devastating year.Here’s a look at some of the restrictions around the world for the holiday season: BRITAIN It was meant to be a time when families across the UK could enjoy something like a normal Christmas despite the pandemic. Authorities planned to relax restrictions, allowing up to three households to mix in the days around Dec. 25.The emergence of a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus changed that.The four nations of the U.K. – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – are all in various states of shutdown and have ditched their Christmas plans. No indoor mixing of households is allowed in London and southeast England.Instead of Christmas joy, a sense of dread and isolation is looming. Dozens of countries have limited flights from Britain, and daily new infections are running at record highs. Hospitals across the U.K., which has Europe’s second-highest virus-related death toll at over 68,000, are heading towards capacity at a time of year when other illnesses abound.BRAZIL In Brazil, Christmas 2020 will look much like normal – even though the country has been among the world’s hardest-hit by the pandemic and new Covid-19 infections are now on track to match the peak of the first surge.Many beaches and restaurants in Rio de Janeiro were packed last weekend, despite a city measure forbidding drivers to park along the shore.No national restrictions have been imposed ahead of Christmas, though the governor of São Paulo ordered that only essential services such as public transport, supermarkets and pharmacies remain open around Christmas and New Year’s Eve.Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador have also called off their Dec. 31 firework displays.SOUTH AFRICA  South Africa is targeting beaches and booze as it imposes new restrictions for the Christmas season amid resurgent infections.Alcohol can only be sold Monday through Thursday, and a nighttime curfew is in place. Beaches — major tourist attractions this time of year — will be closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.The government is urging people to avoid crowded Christmas celebrations, but indoor gatherings of up to 100 people are still allowed; outdoors up to 250 people can congregate.Police are setting up roadblocks to slow a second surge of infections that authorities and scientists say is being fueled by another variant of the virus, one distinct from the variant affecting England. Some countries are banning flights from South Africa, where the weekly infections and deaths have doubled over the past two weeks.LEBANON  Unlike much of the world, Lebanon eased restrictions during the holidays, hoping to inject foreign currency into a tanking economy. Tens of thousands of Lebanese expats have arrived home for the holidays, leading to fears of an inevitable surge in infections.Last week, the Interior Ministry allowed nightclubs to reopen — but said dancing will be prohibited. That triggered a debate on social media about what constitutes dancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-virus-rules-for-christmas-tough-mild-or-none-at-all/story-lblZ4cU4bh1VMNr9fChd3K.html

Daily infections hit a record 2,234 on December 10, with cases erupting at facilities of companies including Top Glove Corp. and Karex Bhd., the world’s biggest producer of condoms.The government has already secured 12.8 million doses from Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE in a deal signed last month, and on Tuesday it announced an agreement to buy 6.4 million doses directly from Astrazeneca.Malaysia has negotiated with Pfizer the option to boost its purchases to cover another 20% of its population, and is in talks with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Khairy said.“I won’t rule out the possibility that we will increase our orders slightly,” he said. “Johnson & Johnson is also a single shot. We like single shot, for obvious reasons. So we are still looking at that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-double-astrazeneca-vaccine-order-through-covax-deal/story-9rvx2euV6thOJvb6SbDLeL.html
23-12-2020||World||Russia sees nothing good in ties with ‘hostile’ US under Biden||Russia expects nothing good in relations with a “deeply hostile” US under the incoming administration of Joe Biden and has no plans to make unilateral concessions to improve ties, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.“We are heading from bad to worse,” Ryabkov said in an interview with the Interfax news service published Wednesday. “The next US president has been left with a bad legacy and it will take a long time for him to sort this out.”Moscow hasn’t initiated any contacts with Biden’s transition team “and we are not going to do this,” said Ryabkov, who oversees Russia-US relations. “In the end, it’s up to the Americans to decide what, when and how to make our bilateral relations.”His comments come as Washington has blamed Moscow for a massive cyber-attack that hit a wide range of government departments and Fortune 500 companies. Russia has denied responsibility. While U.S. President Donald Trump has played down the breach even as his own senior officials accuse Russia, Biden has pledged to respond once he takes office next month.Ryabkov dismissed the controversy, saying Russia registers hacking attempts from US and other foreign sources “every day” and “we don’t make a fuss about it.”Russia’s hopes for a transformation of ties when Trump was elected in 2016 were sunk by the scandal that erupted over contacts between his transition team and Russian officials before the president took office.With the Biden adminstration, Russia may adopt an approach of engaging only in “selective dialogue” in areas of mutual interest, Ryabkov said.“We definitely don’t expect anything good,” Ryabkov said. It would be strange to expect better ties “from people who, many of them, have spent their careers engaging in Russophobia and throwing mud at my country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-nothing-good-in-ties-with-hostile-us-under-biden/story-dB48eg3JmhPfWfvLAAQnRJ.html
23-12-2020||World||China seeks guarantees before loaning $6 billion for Pakistan rail project||China has sought additional guarantees before sanctioning a $6-billion loan for the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway line project in Pakistan, due to the country’s weakening financial position, according to a media report on Wednesday.China has also proposed a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project, going against Islamabad’s wishes of ‘cheapest lending’.The issue of additional guarantees was raised during the third joint ML-1 Financing Committee Meeting held ten days ago (December 13), The Express Tribune newspaper reported, quoting official documents.A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said China raised the additional guarantees issue during the meeting but did not make it part of the draft of minutes shared with Pakistan.The draft minutes have not yet been signed by both the countries.The ML-1 project includes dualisation and upgrading of the 1,872-km railway track from Peshawar to Karachi and is a major milestone for the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The official said China raised the additional guarantees issue to get clarity over Pakistan’s financial condition after it applied for debt relief from the G-20 countries, which is only meant for the world’s poorest nations.The third round of financial negotiations gave further clarity on the Chinese position on $6 billion lending for the $6.8 billion strategically important ML-1 project of Pakistan Railways, sources in the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.As part of debt relief from G-20 countries, Pakistan cannot secure expensive commercial loans, except those allowed under the International Monetary Fund and World Bank framework.The Chinese authorities have proposed that “keeping in view the financial situation in Pakistan so also the conditions laid down by the G-20 regulations for debt suspension, the government of Pakistan may provide additional guarantee mechanism for the loan other than sovereign loan for the ML-1 project”, according to officials privy to the negotiations.It was surprising for us when China raised the issue of additional guarantees during the meeting, another senior Pakistani official who was part of the meeting said.In August this year, the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the strategically important ML-1 project worth USD 6.8 billion.The ECNEC meeting had continued for hardly 20 minutes, leaving many critical issues about financing and technical details unresolved.Both the sides have reached broad-based consensus on the technical parameters, including bidding documents, according to deliberations that took place in the joint bilateral third financial and seventh technical committee of ML-1 project.But an early start of construction work on what the official described as “strategically important project” is unlikely after China linked the civil works with prior finalisation of financing mechanism of the single-largest project of the CPEC.Unlike Pakistan’s expectations of getting the $6 billion loan at 1% interest rate, China has proposed a mix of commercial and concessional lending, the sources said.China maintained that the lending will be both a combination of commercial and concessional loans, according to sources.The Economic Affairs Ministry had proposed a 1% rate while the Ministry of Railways was inclined to take the mix of commercial and concessional rate, subject to the condition that the average rate may remain lower than 2.38%, sources said.However, Pakistan was expecting that due to the strategic nature of the project, China would accept its request for 1% interest rate and a grace period of 10 years for repayment of the loan.China has offered to finance 85% of the project cost with payback period of 15 years to 20 years in biannual tranches. Sources said the Chinese had offered a five years grace period. Pakistan has asked for up to 90% of financing and was ready to accept a 20 years repayment period, subject to the condition that the grace period should be 10 years.“The Chinese side proposed that negotiations for financing must be only to the extent of package-1 consisting of $2.434 billion and the negotiation for remaining two packages will be undertaken during the implementation phase of package-I,” according to the official documents.Pakistani authorities pressed for negotiation for the total project cost of the ML-1. China has also offered financing in Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB).According to the ML-1 framework agreement, the project will be executed in the engineering, procurement and construction mode by Chinese contractors. Under the CPEC framework, ML-1 is the only strategic project being finalised as part of the initial $46 billion deal.Sources said that Pakistan’s desire to start work on the package-1 from January 2021 would remain unfulfilled due to delay in finalisation of financing details.Pakistan had planned to complete the package-I from January 2021 to December 2024 and will cover the construction of a 527-km track between Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Lahore, according to the paper.The CPEC is part of China’s One Belt, One Road initiative, a global infrastructure development strategy to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organizations. India has expressed concern over the projects as a portion of the CPEC runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, violating Indian sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-guarantees-before-loaning-6-billion-for-pakistan-rail-project/story-ulBksG1G25TGpw8307CLPI.html

Many Baloch political activists in order to avoid persecution escape from Balochistan and are compelled to seek asylum in European countries; journalists and human rights activists are among these asylum seekers. Shaukat cited the example of the murder of Sajid Hussain, a Baloch journalist exiled in Sweden.Equating the Pakistani establishment with Nazi Germany, he said that as it failed in its propaganda during World War II and paid the heaviest price, the same way Pak Army will pay for its sins.Slamming its Army, he said that Pakistan is the only country in the world made due to its army whereas in general, the army protects its nation.Reminding them of their atrocities in Bangladesh, he said that mistreatment of citizens leads to fragmentation of the country.

23-12-2020||World||Australian writer detained in China sends defiant Christmas message||An Australian writer detained in Beijing on spying allegations has told his readers to “pursue democracy, rule of law and freedom” in a Christmas message from prison that said 300 interrogations had not yielded any evidence.Pro-democracy blogger Yang Hengjun, who is facing trial on espionage charges that he denies, has been unable to receive visits from his wife or family since he was arrested in January 2019 after he arrived at Guangzhou airport from New York. Yang said in his message that after “torture, more than 300 interrogations and a lot of verbal abuse, I am now in a place of deeper retrospective and introspective meditation”, according to his former teacher, Feng Chongyi, who is based in Sydney. Feng also confirmed the authenticity of the message to Reuters.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was a country with the rule of law and the case was being handled independently by judicial bodies.“All of Yang Hengjun’s lawful rights have been fully guaranteed, and there is no so-called torture or abuse,” he told reporters. Yang, 55, had revealed in a 2011 letter to Feng that he had previously worked for China’s state security agency for a decade in Hong Kong and Washington, and left the service before moving to Australia in 1999. He later wrote spy novels that were published in Taiwan, and amassed a large online following in China as a democracy blogger, before moving to New York.He had denied revealing any state secrets in his novels during an earlier, brief detention in 2011 on suspicion of involvement in the Jasmine Revolution democracy protests.Australian diplomats visited Yang on Dec. 17, one of the few visits permitted by Chinese authorities this year.Yang’s trial, which had been due to proceed by January, has been delayed by three months.In the message, Yang said he was “waiting for court”, and still had “some confidence in the court”. “Whether or not they judge me guilty will say a lot about whether the court is governed by rule of law or by pure absolute power,” he said in the message.“I have strong faith in humanity, in righteousness, justice and God.”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last year it was “absolutely untrue” Yang had acted as a spy for Australia.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in October that Yang’s treatment in detention, with no family visits and limited legal representation, was not compatible with international norms. Diplomatic relations between major trading partners Australia and China have worsened this year after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and Beijing imposed a series of trade reprisals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-writer-detained-in-china-sends-defiant-christmas-message/story-naiCFWGn2jxcLnpMQt4gUL.html
23-12-2020||World||Trudeau shuts out China again by rejecting Arctic gold deal||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government rejected a plan by China’s Shandong Gold Mining Co. to acquire a gold miner that operates in the Canadian Arctic, potentially inflaming a diplomatic feud.TMAC Resources Inc. owns the Hope Bay gold mine in the northern territory of Nunavut, an operation that includes a port and air strips. Shandong, an acquisitive state-backed metal producer, agreed to buy the Toronto-based company for about $150 million in May. In October, TMAC received notice the government had ordered a national security review.The Canadian miner said late Monday an order had been issued under the Investment Canada Act for Shandong not to proceed with the takeover. Shandong confirmed the rejection in a statement Tuesday, citing a decision made for the “purpose of safeguarding national security.”Officials in Trudeau’s office declined to comment on the move, which comes amid badly frayed ties between Canada and China over the 2018 arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive on a US extradition request.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that Canada “should provide an open and non discriminatory business environment for all companies operating in Canada, including the Chinese ones.”The Chinese embassy in Ottawa sees any politicization of economic co-operation as wrong, a spokesperson said by email late Tuesday, calling on the Canadian government to foster a fair market for all foreign investors.A spokesperson for the Canadian industry ministry said she was restricted in explaining why the Shandong deal was rejected, citing confidentiality provisions of the investment act. “Canada remains open to investments that create jobs, growth, access to global trade and value chains, and long-term prosperity for Canadians, while protecting Canada’s national security interests,” Sophy Lambert-Racine said by email Tuesday.TMAC plunged as much as 19%, the most intraday since March, and was down 11% to C$1.16 as of 12:05 p.m. in Toronto. The shares have declined 70% this year.Security observers have said a sale could be a threat to Canada because it would give China greater access to the Northwest Passage and is close to Canadian early warning radar facilities in the Arctic.The Trudeau government’s rejection of the deal might not be the end of the story, according to Stephanie Carvin, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and former government intelligence analyst.“The issue when dealing with state-owned and state-championed enterprises is that when you say no to them, China finds other ways to circumvent the rule of law,” she said by phone Tuesday. “If you say no once, it doesn’t mean they won’t try again in some way.”The decision -- and Beijing’s reaction to it -- will be watched closely by other Arctic nations, Carvin said, flagging that Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had meetings with his Nordic counterparts recently. “Canada is not the only country struggling to deal with China in the north. Denmark is particularly concerned,” she said, citing Beijing’s infrastructure investments in Greenland.Canada-China relations soured sharply two years ago, when police detained Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport. She has been confined to the Pacific coast city since then, fighting extradition. In the days after her arrest, China jailed two Canadians on espionage charges and halted billions of dollars in agricultural imports.Even before the Huawei case flared, China was warning of an investment chill in Canada after Trudeau’s government rejected a takeover of Toronto-based construction giant Aecon Group Inc., citing national security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-shuts-out-china-again-by-rejecting-arctic-gold-deal/story-ZHfKpcwlh0wkmUU3tCBd0J.html
23-12-2020||World||America denies China expelled US Navy warship near Spratly Islands||China falsely claimed that it expelled an American warship from the South China Sea (SCS) on Tuesday, the US Navy has said, adding that Beijing’s statement was an effort to assert its illegitimate claims in the maritime region.China on Tuesday said its military had “expelled” a US Navy guided-missile destroyer sailing near the Nansha Islands – also known as Spratly Islands - in the South China Sea in a fresh escalation of tensions between the two countries.Beijing said the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) southern theatre command deployed ships and aircraft to warn US destroyer USS John S. McCain as it sailed through disputed waters of the South China Sea.“The PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) statement about this mission is false. USS John S. McCain was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory,” Lieutenant Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement.“The PRC’s statement is the latest in a long string of PRC actions to misrepresent lawful US maritime operations and assert its excessive and illegitimate maritime claims at the expense of its southeast Asian neighbours in the SCS,” Keiley added.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours, including the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia, besides Vietnam and Taiwan.It is understood that the PLA did contact the US destroyer over “bridge-to-bridge” radio, asking for the American ship to leave; a PLA destroyer also shadowed it during the operation.However, the US Navy spokesperson said that its ship conducted its operation and left “on our timeline’’ and was not “expelled”.“USS John S. McCain conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued to conduct normal operations in international waters. The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea as a principle,” Keiley said.“The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS John S. McCain did here,” Keiley added. “The PRC’s behaviour stands in contrast to the United States’ adherence to international law and our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”On November 24, the same US destroyer was caught in a similar incident with the Russian navy. Moscow had said at that time one of its warships caught and chased off the USS McCain operating “illegally” in its territorial waters in the Sea of Japan.The US Navy had denied wrongdoing, accusing Moscow of making excessive maritime claims.In April, China had scrambled aircraft and deployed ships to track and expel a frontline US warship from near another Beijing-controlled region called Paracel Islands - also known as Xisha Islands in China and Hoang Sa Archipelago in Vietnam - in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-denies-china-expelled-us-navy-warship-near-spratly-islands/story-nUt9p30cOyfnH0IAOCn3CK.html
23-12-2020||World||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai released on bail||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai was granted bail on Wednesday, nearly three weeks after he was remanded in custody over fraud and national security-related charges.Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy in Hong Kong, was charged with fraud on December 3 for allegedly violating the lease terms for office space for his media company, Next Digital. He was later charged again on December 12 under the national security law, on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security.Lai appeared in court Wednesday and was granted bail by the High Court. He had been kept behind bars since December 3.He is among a recent string of pro-democracy activists and supporters arrested by Hong Kong police in recent months, prompting concerns that Hong Kong is cracking down on dissent following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on the semi-autonomous Chinese territory in June.Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque. Serious offenders of the law could face life imprisonment.Earlier this month, Hong Kong sentenced prominent pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow to jail for their roles in an anti-government protest outside police headquarters last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-released-on-bail/story-9zKPq1Z8RVDigJM2YV45DP.html

23-12-2020||World||Hawaii volcano erupts after two years, forms lava lake||Lava was rising more than 3 feet (1 meter) per hour in the deep crater of a Hawaii volcano that began erupting over the weekend after a two-year break, scientists said Tuesday.Kilauea volcano within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was gushing molten rock from at least two vents inside its summit crater, the US Geological Survey said. A lava lake has formed, rising about 440 feet (134 meters) from the bottom of the crater.Since the eruption began Sunday night, Kilauea has spewed some 2 billion gallons of lava (10 million cubic meters), enough to cover 33 acres (13 hectares). The lava has been contained inside the deep crater.It isn’t threatening to get close to people or cover property, like when Kilauea erupted from vents in the middle of a residential neighborhood in 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes.Still, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has warned residents to beware of potentially high levels of volcanic gas, rockfalls and explosions.When erupting, Kilauea tends to spew large volumes of sulfur dioxide, which forms volcanic smog, or vog, when it mixes with oxygen, sunlight and other gases in the air. The state Department of Health warned residents to reduce their outdoor activities if they encounter volcanic smog conditions.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes, having erupted some 50 times in the last century. Between 1983 and 2018, it erupted almost continuously. It had a lava lake in its crater for the last decade of that eruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hawaii-volcano-erupts-after-two-years-forms-lava-lake/story-vyaPcaxvO7c504OXenpkjL.html
23-12-2020||World||Joe Biden calls cyber attack grave risk to national security||The recent cyber security breach against the US companies constitutes a grave risk to the national security, President-elect Joe Biden has said, alleging that the Trump administration failed to prevent it.Recently, the US officials said that multiple federal agencies were targeted in a sophisticated, months-long cyber security attack. The massive breach, which is termed as one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks in the US, is being blamed on Russia.Commenting on the breach, Biden described it as a major challenge which his administration will confront on a bipartisan basis.“There’s still so much we don’t know including the full scope of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused, but we know this much, this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security who carefully planned and carefully orchestrated,” Biden told reporters at a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday.The cyber attack was carried out by using sophisticated cyber tools, and the attacker succeeded in catching the federal government off guard and unprepared, he said.“Foreign actors have been working on this breach since last -- late last year, at least last year setting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our world-class tech sector and from private businesses and from the United States government agencies,” Biden said.“The truth is this, the Trump administration failed to prioritise cybersecurity, it did that from eliminating or downgrading cyber coordinators in both the White House and at the State Department, the firing of director of Cyber, Space, and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump’s irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack.“Enough is enough. In an age when so much of our lives are conducted online, cyber-attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership at the highest levels,” he said.This cannot be let go unanswered, Biden said, adding that means making clear and publicly who was responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account.Initial indications, including from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, suggest that Russia is responsible for this breach, he said.“It certainly Russia’s long history of reckless, destructive cyber activities, but the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution. This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch when he wasn’t watching. It is still his responsibility as president to defend American interest for the next four weeks but rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will,” Biden said.Noting that he is disappointed by Trump’s response, Biden said he was pleased to see leaders in both parties in Congress speak out loudly and clearly on this attack.“Again, I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate particularly for speaking out. It’s a sign, a sign that with a new administration, we can confront these threats on a bipartisan basis with a united front here at home. That should be encouraging to the American people and a warning to our adversaries,” he said.Responding to a question, Biden said that the damage done remains to be determined.“We have to look at very closely the nature of the breaches, how extensive they are, and what damage has been done. And thirdly, there’s going to be a necessity as (former) president (Barack) Obama and I and our administration talked about, we need international rules of the road on cyber security.“We have to bring along our allies and our friends so we hold everyone accountable if it breaches any of these basic fundamental rules,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-cyber-attack-grave-risk-to-national-security/story-Lkw9o9OHNKH1PjBPZGRx0H.html
23-12-2020||World||Dubai prepares to offer free Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine shots||Dubai plans to start a free vaccination campaign from Wednesday using the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.“Extensive vaccination campaign against Covid-19 kicks off in Dubai on Wednesday,” the city’s media office tweeted. “Vaccination will use Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine and is free of charge.”Pfizer and BioNTech have said their vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the illness. The United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, has been conducting trials on China’s state-backed coronavirus vaccine and earlier this month said the shot protected 86% of people against Covid-19.Dubai, the Middle East’s business hub, locked down the city for about a month earlier this year to halt the spread of the virus. Its flagship Emirates airline grounded passenger flights and the Expo 2020 exhibition scheduled to start in October was delayed by a year. Flights have since resumed operations.The UAE diagnosed over 195,000 people with the virus since the start of the outbreak. The Gulf nation reported more than a thousand cases a day for the past two months after they dropped to as low as 164 in August. The country has a case-fatality rate of 0.3%, among the lowest globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-prepares-to-offer-free-pfizer-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine-shots/story-11QSOHdn4SF4vJ44txdQsO.html
23-12-2020||World||Vaccine makers preparing for mutant coronavirus strains||Drugmakers who designed the first Covid-19 vaccine to gain clearance from Western regulators say they could reset the shot to counter a new strain within just six weeks, if needed.BioNTech SE Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he’s confident that the inoculation his company developed with Pfizer Inc. will work just fine against the fast-spreading coronavirus variant that’s raising alarms in the UK and beyond. If the current shot fails to be adequately protective, though, the company could tweak it by updating small bits of genetic information called messenger RNA that their vaccine uses.“The beauty of the messenger RNA technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine, which completely mimics this new mutation,” Sahin said at a press conference Tuesday morning. Moderna Inc. meanwhile indicated that it thought its vaccine would still shield people from the virus and that it was running tests to confirm.Authorities ranging from the European Medicines Agency to the UK government have said there’s no evidence to suggest that the strain, called B.1.1.7, is likely to evade coronavirus vaccines. Most Covid shots target the spike protein that the virus uses to enter cells, and only small changes have been detected in new versions, according to Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger.Full Immunogenicity“All the currently identified strains, including B.1.1.7, only carry sporadic point mutations in the spike protein that are believed to be unlikely to disrupt the full spectrum of their immunogenicity,” Risinger said in a note.Moderna sank 9% in New York, Pfizer fell 1.7%, and BioNTech’s American depositary receipts dropped 5.5%. Moderna has risen more than six-fold since the beginning of the year, while BioNTech’s ADRs have almost tripled.Countries around the world are restricting travel to and from the UK because of concerns about the variant, which officials have said may be up to 70% more transmissible than others. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put London into lockdown, citing the threat of the strain.UK authorities have said that while the variant is widespread in London and southeast England, there’s no reason to believe it causes more serious disease than earlier versions. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the US Covid vaccine and drug acceleration program, said there’s no hard evidence that it’s more transmissible.Still, drugmakers are conducting tests to determine how well their shots will defend against new strains. AstraZeneca Plc, the University of Oxford’s partner, said in a statement that it’s investigating the impact of the mutation, and the company doesn’t believe it will hurt its shot’s effectiveness. BioNTech said its tests will take about two weeks. Paris-based Sanofi said it will test its experimental vaccine’s efficacy against any new variant that emerges.Constant TestingModerna has tested its vaccine against previous strains and expects that it “would be protective against the variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus recently described in the UK,” according to an emailed statement. “We will be performing additional tests of the vaccine in the coming weeks to confirm this expectation.”German biotech CureVac NV said it’s constantly testing its experimental Covid-19 shot against different mutations. While it doesn’t think its product will be less effective against the UK. variant, it also could come up with a new version within six weeks, the company said in an emailed statement.If companies like BioNTech do need to need to update their vaccines, the most likely scenario is regulators would approve newer versions rather quickly -- without another round of large-scale clinical trials, according to Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmaco-epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The messenger RNA platform from BioNTech -- along with another one from Moderna -- has already proved itself to be largely safe, and the review would be analogous to that of annual flu vaccines, he said.It’s likely that Covid shots will be redesigned in the future to keep them highly effective against new viral strains, Evans said.Staying in Tune“To me it’s like a motorcar -- I tune the engine to get better performance, but in terms of its overall safety, that makes very little difference,” Evans said. “We know that these mRNA vaccines are pretty safe.”For updates, developers would probably only need to show that their products are raising a comparable immune response, something that could probably be done with fewer than 100 human volunteers, said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.“That alone would be enough to allow the new evolution of the vaccine to be licensed,” Openshaw said. “I see absolutely no reason that any regulator would insist that they would have to go right back to square one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-makers-preparing-for-mutant-coronavirus-strains/story-5hzznv2QTwl63FD7AnJeAL.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump grants full pardon to two convicted in Russia probe||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday granted full pardons to two more persons convicted in the 2016 Russia poll meddling case. The move came at a time when he faced renewed criticism for not standing up to Moscow, this time over a sweeping hacking of government and private sector computer systems. Trump granted full pardons to George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to his 2016 campaign, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch attorney. Papadopoulos served 16 days in jail and Van der Zwaan 30 days.Both had pleaded guilty to lying about their contacts with people that the FBI suspected of being Russian spies. Both were among first convictions obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference.Trump had earlier pardoned his National Security Adviser Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to lying in the same Russia investigation and then backtracked. Also, he had commuted the jail sentence of Roger Stone, a longtime ally, for lying to congress in relation to the Russia probe.The new pardons were announced just hours after President-elect Joe Biden slammed the incumbent for not speaking out against Russia for the recent, large-scale hacking effort that has been described by experts as the worst ever.“It certainly fits Russia’s long history of reckless disruptive cyber activities, but the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch when he wasn’t watching. It’s still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks.”Trump, who has been seen to be reluctant to criticise Russia, has suggested that the hacking could be the handiwork of China, disagreeing with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and attorney general William Barr, who have both pointed to Russian involvement.The US president granted full pardon to 13 others and commuted the jail sentences of five. Among those pardoned were three Republican members of the House of Representatives - Chris Collins, who was convicted for insider trading; Duncan Hunter, who was convicted for misusing campaign funds; and Steve Stockman, who was convicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. Trump also granted presidential pardons to four government contractors for a controversial security firm Blackwater, who were convicted for a 2007 massacre in Baghdad that had left more than 12 people dead. One of the four men was serving a life sentence, while the other three were in for 30 years each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-grants-full-pardon-to-two-convicted-in-russia-probe/story-EWE48xudD1sLZdUs0EtQ4N.html
23-12-2020||World||EU vows ‘final push’ in UK trade talks but fish rift threatens deal||The European Union is making a “final push” to strike a Brexit trade deal with Britain, although there are still deep rifts over fishing rights, the bloc’s chief negotiator said on Tuesday.Britain will complete its departure from the EU on December 31 when its current free trade arrangements expire. The two sides have been struggling for months to define a new relationship covering everything from trade to transport and energy.The much-delayed final stages of the already tortuous negotiations now coincide with a fresh crisis after EU members and other countries suspended most travel to and from Britain to curb a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus.“We are really in a crucial moment. We are giving it a final push,” said the negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he arrived to update the bloc’s 27 national envoys on Brexit.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said he believed negotiators were more likely than not to strike a deal, but that talks may go beyond December 25.Barnier told the closed-door gathering that the UK’s latest offer on sharing out the fish catch from British waters from 2021 was “totally unacceptable”, according to EU diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Barnier is walking a tightrope between London and Paris,” said one diplomat in Brussels, a reference to the small but politically prominent fishing community in northern France that would be affected by any reduction of the EU catch.A senior diplomat who took part in the meeting with Barnier said the EU’s latest offer on fish was its final one, and added that there was still concern around regulating production standards and state aid to ensure corporate fair play.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit in a 2016 referendum, arguing that it would restore Britain’s sovereignty, has repeatedly said it must control its waters and who fishes there. EU officials and diplomats said the bloc could be willing to cut the value of its fish catch in British waters by around 25%, while Britain was demanding a 30-35% cut.But the sources said the length of the fisheries transition regime was also an obstacle, as was the question of EU retaliation if London excludes its vessels from British waters afterwards - something that Britain says is excessive.The UK wants to gradually curb EU access to its fishing waters over three years, while the bloc is proposing six years, to give its fishing industry longer to adjust.While EU sources said an agreement was getting closer, they warned it might not come in time.“The EU will not close its door to the UK, and remains ready to negotiate even beyond the 1st of January,” said a third EU diplomat. With London refusing to request an extension of Britain’s transition out of the EU beyond the end of this year, that would mean a dramatic rupture in trading ties in just nine days’ time. Around $900 million in annual trade is at risk if Britain, the world’s sixth biggest economy, and the EU - a trading bloc of 450 million consumers - fail to craft a new accord.Calls between Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the executive European Commission, which is negotiating with Britain on behalf of the member states, will take place as needed, EU officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-final-push-in-uk-trade-talks-but-fish-rift-threatens-deal/story-cIBlA3btjSHzfhDaoe7YTI.html
23-12-2020||World||Lawmakers urge US govt to further tighten restrictions on China’s SMIC||Two key Republican lawmakers on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to strengthen new rules adopted Friday aimed at preventing China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC from getting access to advanced US technology.Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Michael McCaul said the Entity List designation by the US Commerce Department was not strict enough and should be rewritten to close “dangerous loopholes that would allow nearly all sales to SMIC to continue without restriction and support the (Chinese Communist Party’s) stated goal of military preeminence.” The letter said they were concerned that without changes the rules would be “utterly ineffective in addressing this growing national security threat.”The Commerce Department declined to comment, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday the designation was a “necessary measure to ensure that China, through its national champion SMIC, is not able to leverage US technologies to enable indigenous advanced technology levels to support its destabilizing military activities.”The lawmakers are concerned because the restrictions apply only to technology “uniquely” required to produce semiconductors at 10 nanometers and below. The administration “seems to be allowing SMIC access to nearly all semiconductor manufacturing equipment,” they wrote.The lawmakers said they were concerned the new rules were “done for show and parochial commercial interests at the expense of US national security.”SMIC said Sunday that being put on a US trade blacklist would pose a significant adverse impact to its research and development in its 10-nanometer and more advanced chip technology, but said it did not expect the US decision to have a major negative impact on its short-term operations and finances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-urge-us-govt-to-further-tighten-restrictions-on-china-s-smic/story-Q4oRN4Fti4IEmRhF27nwCL.html
23-12-2020||World||Trump threatens to torpedo Covid relief with new demands||President Donald Trump late Tuesday threatened to torpedo Congress’ massive Covid-19 relief package in the midst of a raging pandemic and deep economic uncertainty, suddenly demanding changes fellow Republicans have opposed.Trump assailed the bipartisan $900 billion package in a video he tweeted out Tuesday night and suggested he may not sign the legislation. He called on lawmakers to increase direct payments for most Americans from $600 to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples.Railing against a range of provisions in the bill, including for foreign aid, he told lawmakers to “get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill.”Trump did not specifically vow to veto the bill, and there may be enough support for legislation in Congress to override him if he does. But if Trump were to upend the sprawling legislation, the consequences would be severe, including no federal aid to struggling Americans and small businesses, and no additional resources to help with vaccine distribution. In addition, because lawmakers linked the pandemic relief bill to an overarching funding measure, the government would shut down on December 29.The relief package was part of a hard-fought compromise bill that includes $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September and contains other end-of-session priorities such as money for cash-starved transit systems, an increase in food stamp benefits and about $4 billion to help other nations provide a Covid-19 vaccine for their people.Lawmakers spent months in a stalemate over pandemic relief funds, even as Covid-19 cases soared across the country. Democrats had pushed for higher payments to Americans, but compromised with Republicans to allow a deal to proceed.Following Trump’s interjection, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi all but dared Trump’s Republican allies in Congress to meet the president’s demand for far higher payments.“At last, the President has agreed to $2,000. Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!,” Pelosi said in a tweet. An aide said she would put the proposal forward Thursday for a vote.Republicans have been reluctant to spend more on pandemic relief and only agreed to the big year-end package as time dwindled for a final deal. And Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said that “Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open,” and Congress would step up for more aid after.Trump’s call for changes to the legislation will test his sway with a Republican Party he has held tight control of throughout his presidency. Several Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have begun to gingerly break with Trump and acknowledge his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, a step Trump has refused to take. McConnell has also warned Republicans against disputing the election on January 6, when Congress must formally affirm the results.Shortly after castigating the relief bill, Trump challenged McConnell and Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican who has also said any effort to overturn Biden’s victory would be futile. Trump said he would back a primary challenge to Thune when he is up for re-election in 2022.Trump’s threats to hold up the pandemic legislation could also complicate matters for Republicans in Georgia, where two runoff races to determine control of the Senate will be held in January. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have been running as ardent supporters of Trump and will now face questions about whether they will back his call for more money for Americans.Jon Ossoff, Perdue’s Democratic opponent, tweeted simply on Tuesday night: “$2,000 checks now.”The relief package was brought forward Monday afternoon and sped through the House and Senate in a matter of hours as lawmakers worked to close the books on the year. While many lawmakers complained about being given so little time to read the bill, they overwhelmingly voted for it as local businesses and constituents seek economic relief from the pandemicThe Senate cleared the huge relief package by a 92-6 vote after the House approved it by another lopsided vote, 359-53. Those votes totals would be enough to override a veto should Trump decide to take that step.After months of partisanship and politicking about pandemic relief, the logjam broke after Biden urged his party to accept a compromise with top Republicans that is smaller than many Democrats would have liked.The relief bill Trump is criticizing would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction.Earlier in the day, Biden applauded lawmakers for their work. He described the package as far from perfect, “but it does provide vital relief at a critical time.”He also said more relief would be needed in the months ahead. “We have our first hint and glimpse of bipartisanship,” Biden said. “In this election, the American people made it clear they want us to reach across the aisle and work together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-to-torpedo-covid-relief-with-new-demands/story-KFik497Or1T31tfmJ3iXhI.html
23-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases surge as hospitals overwhelmed before holidays||Americans were warned again on Tuesday not to travel for Christmas as the latest Covid-19 surge left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick and political leaders imposed restrictions to try to curb new infections, making for a grim holiday season.A new, even more contagious variant of the coronavirus quickly spreading across Britain caused more fear in Americans already weary from nine months of the pandemic and prompted talks among top US officials to ban travel from the United KingdomThe new coronavirus variant has emerged as the United States grapples with a nationwide spike in infections that added more than a million new cases in just six days, according to a Reuters tally, a total of more than 18 million since the pandemic began.In California, an epicenter of the latest surge, intensive care unit (ICU) beds were scarce and hospitals said they lacked enough doctors and nurses to care for patients.“The whole California ICU capacity has been going down. We are all struggling,” said Dr. Imran Mohammed of Sutter Roseville Medical Center, north of Sacramento. “We really don’t want to see more than this. We will be challenged to see further ICU patients and we will have no place eventually.”Many U.S. states and cities have imposed lockdowns and business closures to try to get a handle on a wave of illness driven by last month’s Thanksgiving gatherings.Political leaders have asked Americans to stay home for the upcoming holidays to prevent a surge upon the surge threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems, a request that many have defied.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday that the altered coronavirus had not yet been detected in the United States.US Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which received US emergency use authorizations this month, should work against the new variant. Moderna Inc and BioNTech SE, which worked with Pfizer Inc to develop its vaccine, are scrambling to test their shots against the new virus mutations, but expressed confidence in them.“Scientifically it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine can also deal with this virus variant,” BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told reporters.More than 600,000 Americans had received their first Covid-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the CDC.The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials. Americans in “non-essential” jobs have been told they would likely wait months for their turn.Azar and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, received the Moderna shot on live television on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden was inoculated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in front of cameras on Monday.The White House coronavirus task force has no plans to restrict travel from the UK, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.But Michael Osterholm, one of Biden’s pandemic advisors, said all options needed to be considered, suggesting that the U.S. government could mandate a 14-day quarantine for visitors from the UK.Washington Governor Jay Inslee has ordered a 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving from the UK, South Africa or other “countries with circulation of a new, potentially more contagious Covid-19 variation.”New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he asked airlines to add his state to a list of 120 countries that require Covid-19 screening for incoming air travelers.“The United States should say the same thing that New York said. Say that people need to test before they come from the UK,” Cuomo said on a Tuesday call with reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-surge-as-hospitals-overwhelmed-before-holidays/story-MqwYfTgdOFtG1lnGsxagrL.html
23-12-2020||World||US loses one life every 33 seconds to Covid-19 in deadliest week so far||In the United States last week, someone died from Covid-19 every 33 seconds.The disease claimed more than 18,000 lives in the seven days ended Dec. 20, up 6.7% from the prior week to hit another record high, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports.Despite pleas by health officials not to travel during the end-year holiday season, 3.2 million people were screened at US airports on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Health officials are worried that a surge in infections from holiday gatherings could overwhelm hospitals, some of which are already at capacity after Thanksgiving celebrations. And while the country has begun to administer two new vaccines, it may be months before the inoculations put a dent in the coronavirus outbreak.The number of new Covid-19 cases last week fell 1% to nearly 1.5 million. Tennessee, California and Rhode Island had the highest per capita new cases in the country, according to the Reuters analysis. In terms of deaths per capita, Iowa, South Dakota and Rhode Island were the hardest hit.Across the United States, 11.3% of tests came back positive for the virus, down from 12% the prior week, according to data from the volunteer-run Covid Tracking Project. Out of 50 states, 31 had a positive test rate of 10% or higher. The highest rates were in Iowa and Idaho at over 40%. The World Health Organization considers positive test rates above 5% concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-loses-one-life-every-33-seconds-to-covid-19-in-deadliest-week-so-far/story-Zr0RrGTwA9FZCmMPeVzfQN.html
23-12-2020||World||Biden hopes virus deal is glimpse of deal-making to come||For President-elect Joe Biden, Washington’s year-end burst of deal-making brought renewed hope for a productive, successful first 100 days in office.The city’s fever broke, at least momentarily, as longtime combatants finally forged a Covid-19 relief deal that carried with it dozens of smaller bills, offering proof that Capitol Hill’s damaged systems and norms can still produce meaningful legislation — at least when backed up against the wall.Most of Biden’s 36 years in the Senate came in an era when Washington functioned far better. As president he will be seeking to restore at least the veneer of good faith and bipartisanship that defined those times and cast aside the divisions of the tea party era and four years of President Donald Trump.Just as lawmakers celebrated their success, Trump on Tuesday night demanded changes to the bill — boosting direct payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000 — and suggested he might not sign it. The bill passed by veto-proof margins, but if Trump were to succeed in killing the bill, resuscitating the measure would likely be job No. 1 in a Biden-led Washington. In prior will-he-or-won’t-he high-wire acts, Trump has signed big spending bills, but it’s anybody’s guess now.In that context, the year-end deal — powered by the imperative to deliver pandemic relief to a struggling nation — is a good omen. At the end, it featured good-faith negotiation among Capitol Hill’s skilled but battling leaders as well as a productive role for moderates and pragmatists in both parties whose efforts are often brushed aside.“We have our first hint and glimpse of bipartisanship,” Biden said Tuesday. “In this election, the American people made it clear they want us to reach across the aisle and work together.”The demand for bipartisanship is a common refrain that often comes as a throwaway line from Washington pols who have little experience in delivering it. But Biden has made it the centerpiece of his transition message — and he has a track record in the Senate and in the Obama administration of following through.He also has no choice. The election delivered Democrats the narrowest House majority of the modern age and a narrowly divided Senate that demands bipartisanship, even if Democrats win control of a 50-50 chamber after next month’s twin Georgia runoff elections.Biden said there is much more work to do and spoke optimistically of lawmakers coming together again in January or February to pass another package — and the template for success is there.There are few measures of success greater than a big, bipartisan vote. By that metric, the 5,593-page, end-of-session behemoth — combining a $900 billion Covid-19 relief deal, a $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill, and dozens of late-session add-ons — was a smash hit. The 92-6 Senate vote and a pair of lopsided House tallies on the final bill came after months of indecision and deadlock were replaced with frenzied deal-cutting and compromise.Yet there are those in Biden’s party deeply skeptical that bipartisanship can take root in such a starkly polarized country. Republicans are certain to feel the pull of their far-right flank in the coming era, shifting the party to a debt-and-deficits focus that may well be incompatible with much of Biden’s agenda.And then there’s the Capitol itself. The pain-inducing process that led to the final virus package offered almost daily lessons in Congress’ capacity for dysfunction and wheel-spinning. And enormous power remains concentrated in the hands of only a few leaders.Top Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be a critical power broker during Biden’s first two years in office, credited Biden with getting Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to accept a bill that was smaller than those she rejected in the summer and fall.“The new president was helpful in suggesting that we ought to go ahead now and I think that may have had an impact on the speaker,” McConnell told reporters Monday.Biden and McConnell have a long relationship and worked out several deals on taxes and spending during President Barack Obama’s first term. The polarization of the parties and the scorched-earth politics of the past decade won’t make that success easy to replicate, but Biden is all-in.“They know I level with them,” Biden said of Republicans. “They know I never mislead. They know I tell them the truth, and they know I don’t go out of my way to try to embarrass.”Bipartisanship and deals with McConnell were hardly the message voiced by most Democrats during a campaign in which liberals schemed to get rid of the Senate filibuster to power through their agenda.But when Pelosi pulled back from demands for more than $2 trillion in Covid-19 relief earlier this month, there was little public backlash from arch progressives. Instead, Democrat after Democrat issued praise for the legislation even though it offered less direct aid to struggling people than they wanted.The optimistic take is that Covid-19 relief, with its near-universal support in Congress, amounts to training wheels for a post-Trump Washington to find its way. While topics like immigration and taxes may be too tough to tackle, there’s genuine hope in areas like infrastructure.Pelosi is Biden’s most powerful asset but she will have her hands full managing the smallest House majority of modern times. Her caucus increasingly tilts to the left and it sustained deep losses in swing districts and Trump country in the fall. But there’s no sense, it seems, in catering to the left under the looming balance of power — and a mid-term election in 2022 that will determine whether Biden’s Democrats lose control of the House.Pelosi and McConnell have a strained relationship, but when their interests align and when they work in tandem, they are an unstoppable force. The pending new agreement started out as one to work out the annual appropriations bills. It quickly became clear that momentum could be sustained as senior lawmakers were given opportunities to find agreement on taxes, education, energy, and appropriations.The skill is there. Finding the will and the way is the challenge.Democratic lobbyist Steve Elmendorf said Biden and his team are going to be highly engaged and that gives him reason for optimism.“These people are obviously dysfunctional and have some challenging relationships,” he said of Trump and his team and allies. “The fact that it took so long to get them in a room is everybody’s fault. Well, Joe Biden’s not going to let that happen.”Washington, however, rarely rewards those who suspend their cynicism. Democrats who give grudging respect to McConnell say the best hope for bipartisanship may be his desire to do what’s best for the GOP’s hopes to hold the Senate — just as they detect the politics of the Georgia runoff races as a reason for McConnell’s flexibility now on pandemic relief.“We’re accustomed to each other but he’s got a pretty big job,” McConnell said of Biden. “So we’ll see how that works out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hopes-virus-deal-is-glimpse-of-deal-making-to-come/story-IoylDaAi1yVSl5oYxr04qI.html

Bhutan is yet to record a Covid-19 fatality.While only designated shops within the zones and essential services will be available, all schools, institutions, offices and business establishments should remain closed.Similarly, movement of individuals with the card within the zones and delivery of essentials will start in Thimphu tomorrow, as it completes the third day of lockdown. However, zone relaxation will not apply to houses under isolation, the statement noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-pm-announces-7-day-nationwide-lockdown-amid-new-covid-19-cases/story-ZfEAnV4yi6a4U6URJaSpwO.html
23-12-2020||World||Pfizer close in on deal to supply additional vaccine doses to US||Pfizer Inc. is moving closer to finalizing a deal to supply the US government with as many as 100 million more doses of the drugmaker’s coronavirus vaccine, according to a person familiar with the matter.Such a pact could expand the number of shots available to the government as it ramps up its immunization drive in the coming year. While talks were continuing on Tuesday evening, a deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are private.The deal would involve the US government using its authority to help prioritize Pfizer’s orders with suppliers of various components needed to make the vaccine. An agreement could still be delayed, according to the person.Operation Warp Speed, the US vaccine-development program, initially agreed in July to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s two-dose regimen, which the New York drugmaker developed with German partner BioNTech SE. The $1.95 billion contract came with an option to buy 500 million more doses.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was expected to be one of a half dozen the US would deploy to immunize its population. But some competing vaccines that the government had been relying on to fill out its lineup are taking longer than expected to develop, raising questions about how quickly the US could reach herd immunity and begin to return to some semblance of normalcy.The two sides have been inching toward a deal after finding themselves at odds over reports that the government declined an offer earlier this year from Pfizer to buy more doses, and that Pfizer would need to fulfill commitments to other countries before it could get more shots to the US.The U.S. effort to stock up isn’t limited to Pfizer. Earlier this month, the US exercised an option to buy 100 million additional vaccine doses from Moderna Inc., doubling the number it has on order from that company to 200 million. Moderna’s vaccine is also a two-shot regimen, but it doesn’t have to be stored at the same ultra cold temperatures as the Pfizer shot.Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said in an interview with Bloomberg last week that Pfizer had asked the US to exercise the Defense Production Act in order to get additional equipment and materials so it could scale up quickly and deliver more doses in the second quarter of 2021.The US vaccine distribution effort has been gaining steam since Pfizer’s shot gained its emergency clearance earlier this month and Moderna’s was authorized last week. This week, 7.9 million vaccine doses are expected to be shipped in the US, including 2 million Pfizer shots and 5.9 million from Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-close-in-on-deal-to-supply-additional-vaccine-doses-to-us/story-ivr7d5j1S46XowsggeUPdP.html
23-12-2020||World||Chinese ambassador steps up as Nepal’s communist party stares at a split||Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi on Tuesday evening met Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari at the presidential palace Shital Niwas, people familiar with the matter said. The hour-long meeting comes two days after the President signed off on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recommendation to dissolve parliament, a precursor to the split in Nepal’s communist party that the Chinese leadership had been trying to avert.The Nepal Communist Party was formed less than three years ago with the merger of PM Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre. The power tussle between PM Oli and Prachanda intensified over the last several months after Prachanda accused the prime minister of violating their power-sharing pact.Chinese envoy Hou had been able to convince the two sides to patch up on previous occasions this year but has been less than successful over the last few months, particularly after Beijing indicated that it wasn’t averse to a change of prime minister if it keeps the communist party intact.There was no official word about the Chinese envoy’s discussions with the President on Tuesday. One version swirling in Kathmandu’s political circles was that Tuesday’s meeting was to discuss supply of Covid vaccines. But this version is viewed suspiciously.Also Read | Nepal PM Oli seeks control of communist party, rivals ‘sack’ him as party bossWhen a controversy had erupted in July this year around ambassador Hou Yanqi’s meetings with President Bhandari and other political leaders including PM Oli and his rivals, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Zhang Si had told the Kathmandu Post that China did not wish to see the Nepal Communist Party in trouble and wished that leaders would resolve their differences and stay united. “The embassy keeps good relationships with Nepali leaders and is ready to exchange views on issues of common interest at any convenient time,” Zhang had said.Tuesday’s meeting coincided with PM Oli and the rival faction led by former prime ministers Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal fighting to consolidate their control over the communist party.The Prachanda-led faction, which has majority support in most key party bodies such as the standing committee and the central committee, announced that the party had decided to replace PM Oli as the NCP’s co-chairman with Madhav Nepal.Also Read | Nepal’s unconstitutional turnPM Oli, on the other hand, insisted that party meetings convened without his approval were illegitimate. At a meeting that he had called a few hours earlier, PM Oli had inducted his loyalists into the communist party’s central committee to shore up his support within the crucial body.It isn’t clear if ambassador Hou will be meeting PM Oli as well. But their last meeting in November didn’t go too well after it became clear that Beijing was indifferent to his continuation in the government.Prime Minister Oli is believed to have indicated to ambassador Hou that he is capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries. This approach also fitted well with PM Oli’s efforts to reclaim the nationalist agenda that was the mainstay of his campaign that led to the NCP’s win in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-meets-president-as-nepal-s-communist-party-is-headed-for-a-split/story-foF1MunNgzorJHVNRtmuRL.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump must blame Russia for cyber attack on US, says Joe Biden||President-elect Joe Biden said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence that a massive cyber attack against the United States is under control and warned that the breach will not go unanswered once he takes office on Jan. 20.Biden, the Democratic former vice president, said President Donald Trump needs to squarely place blame for the hack on Russia - something he has yet to do even though both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr have accused Moscow.Trump has floated the idea on Twitter that China might be responsible for the hacking spree. Uncovered last week, it breached at least half a dozen US government agencies and left thousands of American companies exposed.“It is a grave risk and it continues,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “I see no evidence that it’s under control. I see none. Heard of none. Department won’t even brief us on many things. So I know of nothing that suggests it’s under control.”Biden faulted Trump for stripping US defenses against cyber attacks, saying: “This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch, when he wasn’t watching.”Responding to the cyber attack is among a host of issues Biden faces when he starts work in the Oval Office. After defeating Trump in a November election, he also must fight the coronavirus pandemic and work with Congress to battle the economic damage from Covid-19 lockdowns.Biden said on Tuesday his administration will put forward another Covid-19 relief package next year, including a new round of stimulus payments, after Congress passed an $892 billion relief package this week.The next Covid relief bill should address vaccine distribution, unemployment, a moratorium on evictions for people who cannot pay their mortgages, and PPE and other supplies to businesses, he said.HOW TO RESPONDBiden said his administration will take meaningful steps to respond to the cyber breach.The incoming White House chief of staff said on Sunday that Biden’s response to the hacking campaign would go beyond sanctions. Ron Klain said Biden was mapping out ways to degrade the capacity of foreign actors to engage in cyber attacks against the United States.Options being mulled by the Biden administration to punish Moscow for its alleged role include financial penalties and retaliatory hacks on Russian infrastructure, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.The Kremlin denies any role in the hacking.“The question of the damage done remains to be determined. We have to look at, very closely, the nature of the breaches, how extensive they are, and what damage has been done,” Biden said.As Biden closes in on his final selections for his Cabinet, he will introduce his pick for US Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, at an event in Delaware on Wednesday, his transition team said.Cardona is a veteran teacher and school administrator, a choice that would align with a pledge Biden made during his presidential campaign to appoint a teacher as education secretary.Biden has not yet nominated an attorney general or director of the Central Intelligence Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-must-blame-russia-for-cyber-attack-on-us-says-joe-biden/story-nyieqkmgzqOhnHlg19524M.html

But an uptick in travel to and from the region this spring and early summer have heightened infection risk.An Army press officer said the first Covid-19 cases had been reported in mid-December, when two soldiers fell ill.The Magallanes region, one of the closest populated areas to Antarctica and take-off point for many boats and planes headed to the continent, is among the hardest-hit in Chile.Much of the area, blasted by cold winds off the ocean, mountains and glaciers, has been under quarantine restrictions for months.Chile’s Navy reported it too had detected three cases of Covid-19 among 208 crew members of a ship that had sailed in the Antarctic region between Nov. 27 and Dec. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-reaches-end-of-earth-as-first-outbreak-hits-antarctica/story-Zry0h6Qqpglcu6nVzO6IUP.html

23-12-2020||World||Reversing Trump border policies will take months, says Joe Biden||President-elect Joe Biden says it will take months to roll back some of President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration, tempering expectations he generated during his campaign and one that may rile advocates pushing for speedy action on the issue.His Tuesday comments echo those made by two of his top foreign policy advisers in an interview with Spanish wire service EFE on Monday hitting the brakes on rolling back Trump’s restrictive asylum policies. Susan Rice, Biden’s incoming domestic policy adviser, and Jake Sullivan, his pick for national security adviser, as well as Biden himself, warned that moving too quickly could create a new crisis at the border.Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware Wednesday, Biden said he’s already started discussing the issues with the Mexican president and “our friends in Latin America” and that “the timeline is to do it so that we in fact make it better not worse.”“The last thing we need is to say we’re going to stop immediately, the access to asylum, the way it’s being run now, and then end up with 2 million people on our border,” Biden said.He noted that more funding is needed for more asylum judges to process claims, and promised that while he will work to loosen Trump’s asylum restrictions, “it’s going to take probably the next six months to put that in place.”His comments come as interceptions along the border have increased in recent months. US authorities encountered migrants at the border with Mexico more than 70,000 times in October and in November, four times April’s tally. Some experts predict the surge could increase in the early months of Biden’s presidency, as a response to the damage wrought by the two hurricanes that have pummeled Central America and the economic fallout from the pandemic, as well as expectations of a more humane approach to immigration from the Biden Administration.Sullivan and Rice both said in their interview with EFE that Biden will take executive action where possible to address issues with the immigration system, and emphasized plans to provide humanitarian aid and help bolster Latin American economies to try to address the root cause of the influx of immigrants to the US.Biden “will work to promptly undo” Trump’s deals with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that let the US transfer asylum seekers to those countries, and will “follow through” on his commitment to end a Trump-era program that returns undocumented border crossers to Mexico to await their legal proceedings, Sullivan said. On his campaign website, Biden promised to end the agreement with Mexico, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, within the first 100 days of his presidency.But Sullivan emphasized that many of those reforms will take time.He cautioned that “increasing processing capacity and changing policy at the border will take time,” and warned those considering fleeing for the US to wait, predicting it will take “months” for the Biden Administration to fully implement their plans with respect to Latin America.“Given the pandemic and the large number of migrants already waiting in northern Mexico, now is not the time to undertake the dangerous trip to the United States,” he said. It will take months until we are able to fully implement our plans.”Rice said that “processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off.”“Our priority is to reopen asylum processing at the border consistent with the capacity to do so safely and to protect public health, especially in the context of Covid-19. This effort will begin immediately but it will take months to develop the capacity that we will need to reopen fully,” she said.But Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, expressed concerns about the pace of change during a conference call with reporters Tuesday and said there should be no “public-health rationale” to maintain extraordinary powers to immediately expel people from the United States without an opportunity to seek asylum.Rice was noncommittal about when Biden would withdraw that authority, which Trump introduced in March on grounds that it would contain the coronavirus even though reporting by The Associated Press and others has found that government scientists saw no evidence for it.Still, other pro-immigrant advocates said Tuesday that while they understood it would take time to untangle some of Trump’s changes at the border, they underscored a sense of urgency. They hailed Biden’s emphasis on working with Mexico and Central America on joint solutions.“The Biden administration’s work to end cruelty must start immediately,” said Linda Rivas, executive director and managing attorney of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas. “Human rights and dignity must take center stage.”Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said it was a “matter of life and death,” with many asylum-seekers waiting in extremely violent Mexican border cities for their cases to be heard in the United States.She said in a conference call with reporters that she was concerned about how many asylum-seekers will be allowed in by Biden “but we are here, ready, determined that the process works for all those that are impacted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reversing-trump-border-policies-will-take-months-says-joe-biden/story-h1x6vZXSbN26XAjCbA9AxK.html
23-12-2020||World||Feds sue Walmart over role in opioid crisis||The Justice Department sued Walmart on Tuesday, accusing it of fueling the nation’s opioid crisis by pressuring its pharmacies to fill even potentially suspicious prescriptions for the powerful painkillers.The civil complaint filed points to the role Walmart’s pharmacies may have played in the crisis by filling opioid prescriptions and Walmart’s own responsibility for the allegedly illegal distribution of controlled substances to the pharmacies at the height of the opioid crisis. Walmart operates more than 5,000 pharmacies in its stores around the country.The Justice Department alleges Walmart violated federal law by selling thousands of prescriptions for controlled substances that its pharmacists “knew were invalid,” said Jeffrey Clark, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s civil division.Federal law required Walmart to spot suspicious orders for controlled substances and report those to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but prosecutors charge the company didn’t do that.“Walmart knew that its distribution centers were using an inadequate system for detecting and reporting suspicious orders,” said Jason Dunn, the U.S. attorney in Colorado. “For years, Walmart reported virtually no suspicious orders at all. In other words, Walmart’s pharmacies ordered opioids in a way that went essentially unmonitored and unregulated.”The 160-page suit alleges that Walmart made it difficult for its pharmacists to follow the rules, putting “enormous pressure” on them to fill a high volume of prescriptions as fast as possible, while at the same time denying them the authority to categorically refuse to fill prescriptions issued by prescribers the pharmacists knew were continually issuing invalid invalid prescriptions.The suit highlighted alleged problems in Walmart’s compliance department, which oversaw the dispensing nationwide of controlled substance prescriptions. In particular, even after Walmart pharmacists informed the compliance unit about “pill-mill” prescribers whose practices raised egregious red flags, Walmart allegedly continued to fill invalid prescriptions issued by those prescribers, according to the suit. The suit said that only later did Walmart allow pharmacists to do blanket refusals for these suspect practices.Walmart fought back in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, saying that the Justice Department’s investigation is “tainted by historical ethics violations.” It said the “lawsuit invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies and cherry-picked documents taken out of context.”Walmart noted it always empowered its pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions, and said they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions. Walmart also noted it sent the Drug Enforcement Administration tens of thousands of investigative leads, and it blocked thousands of questionable doctors from having their opioid prescriptions filled at its pharmacies.In a corporate blog post published late Tuesday, Walmart argued that many health regulators, medical groups, doctors and patients criticize the company for going too far in refusing to fill opioid prescriptions. Some even say Walmart is improperly interfering in the doctor-patient relationship, the company said.AP reported the news of the lawsuit ahead of the Justice Department’s public announcement, citing a person who could not discuss the matter publicly before the announced move. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Walmart filed its own preemptive suit against the Justice Department, Attorney General William Barr and the Drug Enforcement Administration nearly two months ago.In its lawsuit, Walmart said the Justice Department’s investigation — launched in 2016 — had identified hundreds of doctors who wrote problematic prescriptions that Walmart’s pharmacists should not have filled. But the lawsuit charged that nearly 70% of the doctors still have active registrations with the DEA.“Blaming pharmacists for not second-guessing the very doctors the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved to prescribe opioids is a transparent attempt to shift blame from DEA’s well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place,” the company said in its statement.Walmart’s lawsuit alleged the government was blaming it for the lack of regulatory and enforcement policies to stem the crisis. The company is asking a federal judge to declare that the government’s suit has no basis to seek civil damages. That suit remains ongoing.The initial investigation was the subject of a ProPublica story published in March. ProPublica reported that Joe Brown, then US attorney for the Eastern District of Texas office, spent years pursuing a criminal case against Walmart for its opioid prescription practices, only to have it stymied after the retail giant’s lawyers appealed to senior officials in the Justice Department.Two months later, Brown resigned. He didn’t give a reason for his departure except to say he would be “pursuing opportunities in the private and public sectors.” Brown went into private practice in the Dallas area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feds-sue-walmart-over-role-in-opioid-crisis/story-RrcoHbtbqaY6xVy497IKSP.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump pardons 15, including Republican allies||President Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned 15 people, including Republicans who were strong and early supporters, a 2016 campaign official ensnared in the Russia probe and former government contractors convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad.Trump also commuted the sentences of five others. While it is not unusual for presidents to grant clemency on their way out the door, Trump has made clear that he has no qualms about intervening in the cases of friends and allies whom he believes have been treated unfairly. Despite speculation, though, not on the list were members of Trump’s own family, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the president himself.The pardons included former Republican Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York. Trump also commuted the sentence of former Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas and pardoned a current state representative, Phil Lyman of Utah, who led an ATV protest through restricted native lands.Collins, the first member of Congress to endorse Trump to be president, was sentenced to two years and two months in federal prison after admitting he helped his son and others dodge $800,000 in stock market losses when he learned that a drug trial by a small pharmaceutical company had failed.Hunter was sentenced to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing campaign funds and spending the money on everything from outings with friends to his daughter’s birthday party.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the pardons for Hunter and Collins were granted after “the request of many members of Congress.” She noted that Hunter served the nation in the US Marines and saw combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan.In the group announced Tuesday night were four former government contractors convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad that left more a dozen Iraqi civilians dead and caused an international uproar over the use of private security guards in a war zone.Supporters of Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard, the former contractors at Blackwater Worldwide, had lobbied for pardons, arguing that the men had been excessively punished in an investigation and prosecution they said was tainted by problems and withheld exculpatory evidence. All four were serving lengthy prison sentences.The pardons reflected Trump’s apparent willingness to give the benefit of doubt to American servicemembers and contractors when it comes to acts of violence in warzones against civilians. Last November, for instance, he pardoned a former US Army commando who was set to stand trial next year in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker and a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans.Trump also announced pardons for allies ensnared in the Russia investigation. One was for George Papadopoulos, his 2016 campaign adviser whose conversation unwittingly helped trigger the Russia investigation that shadowed Trump’s presidency for nearly two years. He also pardoned Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who was sentenced to 30 days in prison for lying to investigators during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos are the third and fourth Russia investigation defendants granted clemency. By pardoning them, Trump once again took aim at Mueller’s probe and pushed a broader effort to undo the results of the investigation that yielded criminal charges against a half-dozen associates.The pardons drew criticism from top Democrats. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the president was abusing his power.“Trump is doling out pardons, not on the basis of repentance, restitution or the interests of justice, but to reward his friends and political allies, to protect those who lie to cover up him, to shelter those guilty of killing civilians, and to undermine an investigation that uncovered massive wrongdoing,” Schiff said.Last month, Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and months earlier commuted the sentence of another associate, Roger Stone, days before he was to report to prison.Trump has granted about 2% of requested pardons in his single term in office, and had done 27 before Tuesday’s announcement. By comparison, Barack Obama granted 212 or 6%, and George W. Bush granted about 7%, or 189. George H. W. Bush, another one-term president, granted 10% of requests.Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman was serving as a county commissioner in 2014 when he led a protest of about 50 ATV riders in a canyon home to Native American cliff dwellings that officials closed to motorized traffic. The ride occurred amid a sputtering movement in the West pushing back against federal control of large swaths of land and came in the wake of an armed confrontation Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy had with Bureau of Land Management over grazing fees.Lyman spent 10 days in prison and was ordered to pay nearly $96,000 in restitution. The Trump administration in 2017 lifted a ban on motorized vehicles in parts of the canyon but left restrictions in place through other areas where Lyman led his ride.Two former US Border Patrol agents were also pardoned, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, convicted of shooting and wounding a Mexican drug smuggler near El Paso, Texas, in 2005.Others on the list included a Pittsburgh dentist who pleaded guilty to health care fraud, two women convicted of drug crimes, and Alfred Lee Crum, now 89, who pleaded guilty in 1952 when he was 19 to helping his wife’s uncle illegally distill moonshine.Crum served three years of probation and paid a $250 fine. The White House said Crum has maintained a clean record and a strong marriage for nearly 70 years, attended the same church for 60 years, raised four children, and regularly participated in charity fundraising events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pardons-15-including-republican-allies/story-lJsjrB4UlSWEaxdYzoQYAL.html
23-12-2020||World||US negotiating for millions more Covid vaccine doses from Pfizer||The US government is negotiating with Pfizer to acquire tens of millions of additional vaccine doses in exchange for helping the pharmaceutical giant gain better access to manufacturing supplies.A person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the deal is under discussion but has not been finalized. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations.Pfizer’s vaccine was the first to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration and initial shipments went to states last week. It has now been joined by a vaccine from Moderna, which was developed in closer cooperation with scientists from the National Institutes of Health.A law dating back to the Korean War gives the government authority to direct private companies to produce critical goods in times of national emergency. Called the Defense Production Act, it could be used to help Pfizer secure supplies ranging from needed chemicals to vials to containers and materials to keep its vaccine super-cold. The person who spoke to the AP about the negotiations described using the defense law as an option under consideration.Moderna’s vaccine was developed in close collaboration with the government’s own effort, which is called Operation Warp Speed. It was designed to have millions of vaccine doses ready and available to ship once a shot received FDA approval.Pfizer has a contract to supply the government with 100 million doses of its vaccine under Operation Warp Speed, but government officials have said it’s more of an arms-length relationship with the company and they don’t have as much visibility into its operations.Having tens of millions more doses from Pfizer would help the US keep up the pace of vaccinations through the winter and into the spring, moving the nation closer to the goal of vaccinating all Americans.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week that the government was negotiating with Pfizer for more doses, but details provided Tuesday about the company’s desire for better access to supplies are new.Earlier, US officials had said they were discussing the purchase of another 100 million doses of Pfizer vaccine for delivery as early as the middle of next year. Those details and timing may have changed.Pfizer said in a statement that “we continue to work collaboratively with the US government to get doses of our Covid-19 vaccine to as many Americans as possible. The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the US government.”The vaccine from Pfizer and German pharmaceutical BioNTech immediately raised hopes of taming a pandemic that has killed nearly 320,000 people in the US and hobbled much of the national economy. Health care workers and nursing home residents topped the list as local TV stations across the country began broadcasting scenes of the first vaccinations. Some polls show skepticism about getting vaccinated may be easing.After early failures with testing, Trump administration officials are hoping to write a very different ending with vaccines. Operation Warp Speed has financed the development, manufacture and distribution of millions of doses, with the goal of providing a free vaccine to any American who wants one.Operation Warp Speed is on track to have about 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of this month, of which about 20 million would be allocated for first vaccinations. Distribution of those doses would span into the first week of January. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots to be fully effective.The New York Times first reported the new details of negotiations between Pfizer and the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-negotiating-for-millions-more-covid-vaccine-doses-from-pfizer/story-lvdWTEEnKZjosmNUWJyviM.html
23-12-2020||World||Donald Trump voices concern about US trade deficit in call with Vietnam PM||US President Donald Trump raised concern about his country’s trade deficit with Vietnam in a phone call on Tuesday with its Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the White House said.The United States last week named Vietnam a currency manipulator, a move that trade experts said could pave the way for Trump to impose tariffs on Vietnamese goods before he leaves office in January.“President Trump raised concerns regarding the trade deficit and urged Prime Minister Phuc to take bold steps to ensure fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and Vietnam,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.US companies imported about $65 billion worth of goods from Vietnam in the first 10 months of 2020, compared with $66.6 billion for all of 2019.The United States is Vietnam’s largest export market, accounting for over a quarter of its total export revenue in the first 11 months of this year. Its key exports to the United States include garments, electronics and wooden products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-voices-concern-about-vietnam-s-trade-deficit-in-call-with-pm/story-1VyNHVurYGpkIWrAeEDihI.html
23-12-2020||World||Israel to hold snap election, with Netanyahu facing new challenges||Israel will hold a snap election in March after parliament failed on Tuesday to meet a deadline to pass a budget, triggering a ballot presenting new challenges for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Campaigning in Israel’s fourth parliamentary election in two years gets underway with Netanyahu facing public anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and while he is engaged in a corruption trial, the first against an Israeli prime minister.Israel’s longest-serving leader will also have to contend with a new rival from the right, Gideon Saar, a defector from Netanyahu’s Likud party. An opinion poll on Israel’s Kan public TV on Tuesday showed Saar drawing even with the prime minister.Netanyahu, who has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and the current defence minister, centrist politician Benny Gantz, established a unity government in May after three inconclusive elections held since April 2019.But they have been locked in a dispute over passage of a national budget, key to implementing a deal in which Gantz was to have taken over from Netanyahu in November 2021. A new election means that “rotation” will never happen.Some political analysts said Netanyahu had hoped to use the budget dispute to force an election that would get him out of the power-sharing deal with Gantz. But they said he had preferred a ballot in May or June, when a vaccination campaign now underway could bring him more voters.“If an election is forced upon us, I promise you that we will win,” Netanyahu said in a televised speech on Tuesday, blaming Gantz - who has plunged in the polls - for the early ballot.“Netanyahu is taking us to an election for the sole purpose of not going to jail,” Gantz wrote on Twitter, alleging that Netanyahu hoped for a new government to promote legislation quashing legal proceedings against him.Netanyahu will remain prime minister until a new government is formed after the March election. Now 71, he first served in the post from 1996 to 1999 and has held the office since 2009.In his TV address, and effectively kicking off his campaign, Netanyahu said he had arranged for millions of doses of coronavirus vaccine to be delivered to Israel. He also hailed US-brokered diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with President Donald Trump, who made a number of pro-Israel moves during the previous elections. But with US President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, Netanyahu will lose a major campaign asset, said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-hold-snap-election-with-netanyahu-facing-new-challenges/story-LwKRHkBgANpz8VxWTwRzwI.html
23-12-2020||World||France reopens border with UK after paralyzing busiest port||Critical trade and transportation links between the UK and continental Europe are to resume after France agreed to end a suspension that crippled Britain’s busiest port at a time of high political drama over Brexit.European Union citizens and residents able to show negative Covid-19 tests will be able to travel from the UK, according to French Prime Minister Jean Castex. The objective is now to have freight traffic moving by Wednesday morning, a French official said.France cut off shipments from Dover in southeast England on Sunday because of concern over a faster-spreading variant of Covid-19 that prompted the UK government to lock down London and surrounding areas.What followed was two days of cross-Channel political bartering over the reopening of routes just as negotiations with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal intensified. With less than 10 days to go before a transition period ends on Dec. 31, the upheaval gave a snapshot of the potential pain Britain’s closest continental neighbor can unleash.The UK found itself effectively isolated as more than 40 countries restricted flights, including many EU members.Almost 3,000 trucks have been stuck in southeast England, threatening a deficit of some fresh food items in British supermarkets. German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it would airlift fresh produce to the UK on Wednesday to ease any potential shortages.Testing TalksBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to try to find a solution and both sides had promised to resolve the border issue within hours. Instead, the impasse dragged on over a disagreement on how to ensure truck drivers were not carrying the new coronavirus strain into France.The French side was pushing for haulers to take PCR tests, which give a result in between 24 and 48 hours, two people familiar with the matter said. The UK preferred lateral flow tests that are less accurate, but take only about 15 minutes -- so could ease the blockage faster.The British military and National Health Service will establish multiple testing sites in Kent, the county where Dover is located, Sky News reported.The new travel restrictions will apply until at least Jan. 6, the French government said. The British side asked to publish any announcement late in the day to avoid too many trucks driving to Kent, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Truckers shouldn’t, and it’s important, gather at departure points in Kent to avoid saturating the system we’re putting into place,” Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, French junior transport minister, told BFM TV.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps echoed that request in a statement on Tuesday evening. “This protocol will see the French border reopen to those traveling for urgent reasons, provided they have a certified negative Covid test,” Shapps said. “We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports.”Isolating BritainEU ambassadors meeting in Brussels agreed to continue monitoring the epidemiological situation closely and the EU’s crisis response unit is ready to meet if necessary in the coming days, EU diplomats said. The envoys stressed the importance of maintaining the flow of freight into and out of the UKDoug Bannister, chief executive of the Port of Dover, said earlier that the backlog of cargo could be quickly cleared once France reopens its border. After a security-related shutdown was lifted in September, 4,500 trucks boarded ferries in just 12 hours, he said.“Glad it’s finally been reopened,” said Duncan Buchanan, policy director of the Road Haulage Association, which represents UK trucking firms. “It was an unsustainable position to blockade the UK like that. Testing is a waste of time, but if you have to, you have to.”Earlier on Tuesday, the European Commission called on member states to reopen critical trade and passenger transport links to the UK while discouraging non-essential travel.Non-essential travel between the UKand the EU is set to be temporarily restricted anyway from Jan. 1, when Britain leaves the continent’s customs union. As a so-called third country, the UK will be subject to Covid-related restrictions.With 2021 looming, the broader contours of Britain’s future relationship with the EU are still being thrashed out by negotiating teams holed up in Brussels trying to finalize a trade deal.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Britain and the EU are giving negotiations on a trade deal “a final push,” while officials on both sides talked of a possible agreement as soon as Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-reopens-border-with-uk-after-paralyzing-busiest-port/story-z4E5J5Qm3X87DckNUQIsOO.html
23-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Pfizer, Moderna testing vaccines on new strain||Pfizer and Moderna are testing their Covid-19 vaccines against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that has emerged in Britain, CNN reported on Tuesday.Moderna expects immunity from its vaccine to protect against the variant and is performing more tests in the coming weeks to confirm, the company said in a statement to CNN. Pfizer, meanwhile, said it is “generating data” on how well blood samples from people immunised with its vaccine “may be able to neutralise the new strain from the UK,” according to the report.Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.The discovery of the new coronavirus strain sowed a fresh wave of panic in a pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people and infected more than 77.15 million worldwide. BioNTech: Covid vaccine for new strain in 6 weeks The co-founder of BioNTech said on Tuesday it was “highly likely” that its vaccine against the coronavirus works against the mutated strain detected in Britain, but it could also adapt the vaccine if necessary in six weeks. “It is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine also can deal with the new virus variant,” said Ugur Sahin. But if needed, “the beauty of the messenger technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation. We could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks”.The World Health Organization (WHO), which has said the situation is not “out of control”, will convene a meeting of members to discuss strategies to counter the new strain, its European office said on Tuesday. It did not give a date yet.Meanwhile, at least five countries suspended flights from South Africa after a new and different coronavirus variant was discovered in the country. Germany, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia have announced a ban on flights from the southern African nation.The Vatican said on Tuesday that Pope Francis will deliver his Christmas Day message indoors due to restrictions even as two cardinals close to the pontiff have tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-moderna-testing-vaccines-on-new-strain/story-9l8hg7Li4J9L5FsEx7JxFO.html
23-12-2020||India||Bengal BJP issues show-cause notices to key state leaders for ‘anti-party’ remarks||Two important state-level leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bengal unit and two district leaders have been served show-cause notices by the party for violating discipline and making “derogatory and anti-party statements” before the media last week. Their offence can lead to summary expulsion, said the notice. The leaders have been asked to reply within a week. The accused leaders include BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu and president of the state Mahila Morcha (women’s front) Agnimitra Paul. Though the notice dated December 22 does not say what statements were made, leaders in the party as well as those who have been accused told HT that they publicly opposed induction of certain leaders from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) at the West Midnapore district rally of Union home minister Amit Shah on December 19. The most prominent among the defectors is Suvendu Adhikari who resigned from the cabinet last month. Paul and Basu, for example, said on December 18 that they did not want Jitendra Tiwari, the TMC legislator from Pandabeswar in West Burdwan district and the outgoing mayor of Asansol town to join the BJP. Incidentally, Union minister of state Babul Supriyo, the Lok Sabha MP from Asansol, also expressed his reservations about Tiwari. The BJP distanced itself from Supriyo’s statement. Tiwari, however, backed out at the last minute and returned to the ruling party on the night of December 18 even after resigning from all posts. Before making the U-turn he even attended a closed-door meeting with Adhikari and the other dissidents. “As per Article 25D of the constitution of the BJP such action should result in your immediate expulsion,” says the letter sent to Basu, Paul, president of the Alipurduar district unit, Ganga Prashad Sharma and president of the Nagrakata area unit in Jalpaiguri district, Santosh Hati. Adhikari and six other TMC legislators, a TMC Lok Sabha member, three MLAs from the Left and Congress and at least 20 other district-level leaders of the ruling party joined the BJP at Shah’s rally in Midnapore town. This marked the biggest defection of elected TMC leaders in the run-up to the assembly polls due in about five months. “Nobody is above the discipline of the party. They have been warned and asked to reply to the notice,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. Induction of workers and leaders from the TMC is a bone of contention in BJP units in several districts and there have been unruly incidents in the recent past. Ghosh, however, argued that there is rivalry between old BJP members and those who joined recently. “Paul is not an old member. She joined the BJP less than two years ago. These theories are baseless,” said Ghosh. On Wednesday, Lakshmi Soren, a BJP leader from Gazole in Malda district, resigned from the party and joined the TMC in protest against the induction of the TMC’s Gazole legislator Dipali Biswas. Biswas won the seat in 2016 as a CPI (M) candidate but later joined the TMC. She is still a sitting legislator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-issues-show-cause-notices-to-key-state-leaders-for-anti-party-remarks/story-jApS3Thuxvv1JKqg4ViaNM.html
23-12-2020||India||AIMPLB members, Sunni Central Waqf Board officials spat over legality of Ayodhya’s upcoming mosque||With two AIMPLB members terming the proposed construction of a grand mosque in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village as against the Waqf Act and Shariat laws, the Sunni Central Waqf Board on Wednesday asserted that the upcoming shrine is perfectly legal. All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Zafaryab Jilani on Wednesday said the proposed mosque in Ayodhya following last year’s Supreme Court verdict is against the Waqf Act and “illegal” under the Shariat laws. “According to the Waqf Act, mosques or land of mosques cannot be bartered. The proposed mosque in Ayodhya violates this Act. It violates the Shariat law as the Waqf Act is based on the Shariat,” said Jilani, who was also the convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee. Countering Jilani’s allegation that the land for the upcoming mosque in Dhannipur village was given to Muslims in exchange of the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya, Sunni Central Waqf Board (SCWB) chairman Zufar Farooqi told PTI that it is not a bartered piece of land. He pointed out that the land in Dhannipur village was allotted to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board in pursuance of the Supreme Court order and to take its possession the Waqf Board had to pay stamp duty. “The Waqf Board has paid a stamp duty of Rs 9,29,400 to take possession of this land,” he said. He also said “the land is the property of the Waqf Board but it itself is not a ‘Waqf”. Elaborating the concepts of Waqf and Waqf Board, the SCBA chairman said Waqf comprises a property denoted in name of Allah by a believer in Islam working for charitable purposes. Thus only a believer of Islam can create Waqf, he said, adding Waqf Board is not an individual and it cannot create any Waqf on its own. “The Supreme Court has not accepted Babri Masjid as Waqf, if it had accepted the land as Waqf, we would have won the case but the court clearly said the donation is not valid,” Farooqi said. He added that five acres of land given to the Waqf Board is not in the lieu of the Babri Masjid land but as a “restitution” or relief by the apex court. “There is no shifting of the then Babri Masjid as the Babri Masjid premises was given to Hindu party by the Supreme Court order last year. The Dhannipur land was given in ownership to Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board by same apex court order and it is not a Waqf land,” he explained. Farooqi is also the chairman of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which had unveiled in its Lucknow office on Saturday the blueprint of the mosque and a hospital to be built on a five-acre plot of land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village. Athar Hussain, the secretary of a trust formed to build the mosque in Ayodhya, however, refuted Jillani’s allegations, asserting that everyone interprets the Shariat in his own way. When the land has been allotted under the directive of the Supreme Court, it cannot be illegal, he said. “The power for interpretation of Shariya does not lie in the hands of some limited people. The mosque is the place for offering namaz. So what is wrong if we are building a mosque?” asked Hussain. Countering Jilani’s allegations, Hussain also accused him of spreading misinformation. “Jilani Sahab is such a competent lawyer. If we are violating any Act like the Central Waqf Act, why does he not challenge it in a court of law and get our supposedly illegal acts stopped?” he asked. “If he is not doing so, he is simply spreading misinformation and doing what is against the Shariat and teachings of Quran,” he asserted. Another executive member of AIMPLB SQR Ilyas too earlier termed the upcoming mosque as only of symbolic value, while accusing the Sunni Central Waqf Board of working under the government pressure. “We have rejected the proposal to accept the land for the mosque at any other place. We lost the title suit and so we don’t need land for a mosque,” he said. “The Muslims have rejected this land at Dhannipur given in compensation. The mosque being built by the trust constituted by the Sunni Central Waqf Board is just a symbolic one,” he said. The issue was first raised by MP Asaduddin Owaisi at a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s executive committee held on October 13. All the members were of the view that the exchange of land for the mosque was not permissible under the Waqf Act and in turn “illegal” under the Shariat law. The Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed structure was demolished in December 1992 by “kar sevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built by demolishing an ancient Ram temple. After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. On the directive of the apex court, the Uttar Pradesh government allotted the five-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimplb-members-sunni-central-waqf-board-officials-spat-over-legality-of-ayodhya-s-upcoming-mosque/story-3WPcOYzYmcvZOvolzheS6L.html
23-12-2020||India||SC students to get scholarship money directly||The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday decided to give a big push to efforts to ensure that Scheduled Caste (SC) students receive ample opportunity to pursue higher education by increasing the budget of a key scholarship scheme fivefold.The Centre also decided that the scheme would be made simpler and funds would be put directly into students’ bank accounts.Union minister for social justice and empowerment Thaawar Chand Gehlot said the Centre’s share of the cost of the scheme vis-a-vis that of the states had also been increased. The Centre will pay 60% of the scholarship amount while the states would bear 40% of the cost, he said at a press conference. According to a person aware of the developments, the Centre’s contribution at present is around 11% under a committed liability scheme.The CCEA has approved major and transformatory changes in the centrally sponsored Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for students belonging to Scheduled Castes to benefit at least 40 million SC students in the next five years so that they can successfully complete their higher education, an official statement said.“Today’s Cabinet decision on post-matric scholarship will ensure greater educational access to youngsters belonging to SC communities. Ensuring top quality and affordable education to our youth is an important focus area for our Government,” PM Modi tweeted.The Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for Scheduled Castes allows students to pursue any post-matric course starting from Class 11 and onwards.The cabinet has approved a total investment of Rs 59,048 crore, of which the Centre would contribute Rs 35, 534 crore, or 60%, with the states providing the rest. The central assistance was around Rs 1,100 crore annually during 2017-18 to 2019-20.The central government is committed to giving a big push to this effort so that the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education of SC students would reach the national standard within five years, the statement said. The GER ratio for SC students is around 20% while the national average is 27%.The focus of the scheme would be on enrolling the poorest students, timely payments, comprehensive accountability, continuous monitoring and total transparency. A campaign will be launched to enrol the students, from the poorest households passing the 10th standard in the higher education courses of their choice, it added.According to government estimates, 13.6 million students currently not pursuing higher education would be able to do so in the next five years because of the revamped scheme.The scheme will be run on an online platform with robust cyber security measures that would assure transparency, accountability, efficiency, and timely delivery of the assistance without any delays, the statement said.Social justice secretary R Subrahmanyam said nearly two-thirds of SC students in higher education will benefit from the scheme.Social activist Beena Pallical said the support is a lifeline for students from weaker sections. “We really welcome the move to strengthen the scheme and increase the funds and making the scheme robust,” she said.Eminent educationists and former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said: “If the target of 50% GER envisaged in NEP 2020 is to be achieved, huge investments shall be required to encourage socially backward classes for higher education. At present, the GER is around 27%, and for SCs and STs, it is 20% & 15%, respectively. The Union government increasing the budget for Post Matric scholarships over 550% shall certainly help.”Merger of film media unitsThe Union Cabinet approved the merger of four government film media units with the NFDC with an aim of converging activities and resources and better coordination to ensure synergy and efficiency in achieving the mandate of the bodies.An official statement said the Films Division, the Directorate of Film Festivals, the National Film Archives of India and the Children’s Film Society, India will be merged with the National Film Development Corporation Limited by expanding the memorandum of articles of association of the NFDC, which will then carry out all the activities performed by the four organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-students-to-get-scholarship-directly-in-accounts/story-dhe7an6lODDfIxfSdRlJFO.html
23-12-2020||India||First tigress tranquilized, radio-collared for translocation to Rajaji Tiger Reserve||After years of waiting, the Uttarakhand forest department on Wednesday tranquilized the first tigress in the state in the Corbett landscape, for translocating it to the Rajaji Tiger Reserve. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department said, “The first tigress in Uttarakhand was tranquilized in the buffer area of Corbett Tiger Reserve on Wednesday. The tigress will be shifted to Rajaji Tiger Reserve on Thursday as part of the project to increase the density of the big cat there.” The project for translocation of tigers to the western part of Rajaji was approved by the central government in 2016. Last September, a team from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) visited Rajaji to conduct reconnaissance for the translocation exercise and had suggested a soft release of a pair of tigers in the reserve’s western side. In a soft release, tigers are released in a large enclosed area where they are kept for a few days to check if the animals have any diseases before being completely released in the wild. A total of five tigers, including two females, will be translocated to Rajaji Tiger Reserve. . Rajaji Tiger Reserve at present has around 37 tigers with only two tigresses in its western part, which is spread over 570 sq km. The reserve has a carrying capacity of 83 tigers, revealed a recent survey conducted by the state forest department. The eastern and the western part of the reserve are divided by a busy traffic corridor making it difficult for the tigers to migrate between the two parts. On Wednesday, director of Corbett wrote to the Garhwal Motor Owners Union Limited stating conditions ahead of starting a bus service between Pakhro-Morghatti-Kalagarh-Ramnagar. Rahul, director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, who uses his first name, in the letter, wrote that this bus service will continue till further orders with only one-way traffic on any single day. The conditions further state that buses will not run during heavy monsoon, fare will be charged only at Pakhro and Dhela gates, from the point of view of wildlife conservation two forest officers will be allowed to travel daily free of cost. The bus will not be allowed to ply before sunrise and after sunset. During forest fire season, bus drivers will be held responsible if any passenger throws any combustible item outside the bus like match sticks and that bus staff will help the forest department by reporting about fire incidents. The bus will not stop anywhere while crossing the tiger reserve area and no one will be allowed to de-board. The conditions also state that wildlife will have the first right to cross roads and if they are hurt in the process then action will be taken under relevant sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-tigress-tranquilized-radio-collared-for-translocation-to-rajaji-tiger-reserve/story-jaikhRF3heNudusv6xBP0L.html

23-12-2020||India||‘Judges’ hallmark to become keener on justice, not merely on law’: CJI||Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde on Wednesday said every great institution and judges’ hallmark is to become keener on Justice and not merely on law. CJI Bobde inaugurated an e-Sewa Kendra at the High Court of Tripura this afternoon and said telecommunication technology has revolutionized people’s access to justice delivery system from courts.The Supreme Court came up with the e-Sewa Kendra concept under its project on e-courts. These kendras have been useful during the Covid-19 pandemic for people to access justice delivery system as the lower courts were shut down during the period. These centres are located at the entry gate of courts and other legal institutions. Praising Tripura for its role in accomodating people who came from erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, and for giving talents like Sachin Dev Burman, Rahul Dev Burman, the chief justice of India said that though the state is lacking in resources, history of the state show that resources are not primary part in human life. Citing Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple, the CJI said the Archbishop used to visit lawyers in courts and said he wasn’t knowledgeable about the law, as he was more invested in justice.Also read: Summit called off due to Covid, mutually agreed, underline India, RussiaOn a similar note, CJI Bobde appealed judges to become more driven towards justice and said, “It’s the hallmark of every great institution and judges that they are keener on justice and not merely on law”.Saying that the e-kendra could make justice ‘technology-dependent’, he said that e-Sewa kendras strive to eliminate these problems and make courts more accessible for common people. Referring to an ancient British adage about legal aid services, the CJI said accessing justice was perceived similar to entering a rich hotel, which was open to all but not accessible for service. “It is this meaninglessness of such words which the e-kendra seeks to eliminate and to alleviate the problems,” he said, adding that these technological access points would henceforth bring legal aid closer to people, especially from humble backgrounds. Among dignitaries who joined the event today, Chief Justice of the Tripura High Court Akil Kureshi, Justice Subhashish Talapatra, Justice SG Chatterjee, Odisha Lokayukta Justice Ajit Singh, and others were seen sharing the dais.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judges-hallmark-to-become-keener-on-justice-not-merely-on-law-cji/story-qPVRr0spZrARErrfrsQrUP.html
23-12-2020||India||Congress demands Karnataka CM’s resignation over corruption allegations||The Congress on Wednesday demanded the removal of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa over the allegations of corruption against him. Addressing a virtual news conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the Karnataka High Court judgment had rejected CM yediyurappa’s plea to quash FIRs filed against him over an alleged illegal de-notification of land in Bellandur area of Bengaluru city. “Karnataka and corruption go hand in hand. The silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda is mysterious,” he said. “The arch of immunity accorded to Yediyurappa is shocking,” Singhvi said. “We demand his resignation or he should be removed by the Governor. The BJP should free him from all the posts,” he added. On October 11, he said the Congress had given the example of contractors and people talking of corruption in the matter of an apartment. The Karnataka High Court, in its 20-page judgment, said the case against the chief minister cannot be quashed, added Singhvi. “But do you feel that any action will be taken against him? No. Because the BJP ruling at the Centre and in the state is indulging in politics of shamelessness,” Singhvi said. “Don’t listen to us, but don’t give homilies on corruption to the whole world and keep eloquently silent at all levels when Yediyurappa and Karnataka and corruption intersect and come to the public domain. Have some shame, some political shame and do not practice the politics of deception by providing a special constitutional arc of immunity to your chief minister,” he said. Singhvi urged the Prime Minister to take action against Yediyurappa. “The whole country is waiting for the Prime Minister to perform his Rajdharma, his constitutional dharma. We will not hesitate to keep on reminding him of his constitutional dharma,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-demands-karnataka-cm-s-resignation-over-corruption-allegations/story-Tas7HRMC4Elg7X2AHkPv9H.html

BTP state president Velaram Ghoghra said, “We supported the ruling government during the political crisis and Rajya Sabha polls but they betrayed us in the Zila Pramukh elections. Congress joined hands with BJP to prevent BTP from forming the board in Dungarpur Zila Parishad; therefore, we have announced the withdrawal of support.” He said during the crisis, a 17-point memorandum was submitted but despite the assurances, it was not fulfilled. The Congress MLA levelled allegations of acceptance of a bribe of Rs 10 crore by BTP MLAs to defame them.He also alleged that the Congress party’s local leadership neglected the party. Ghoghra said that intimation about withdrawing support had been forwarded to the Governor, Chief Minister and assembly speaker. In the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, Congress has 105 MLAs, BJP-71, RLP-3, CPI (M)-2, BTP-2, RLD-1, and 13 legislators are independents and 3 seats are vacant. Commenting on the development, Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the entire incident of BTP will be analysed and if there is any misunderstanding it will be cleared. “We believe in giving respect to all and everyone will be taken together for the development of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/btp-withdraws-support-from-ruling-congress-govt-in-rajasthan/story-hFuvXEosQBIsOV1ZuvNy2N.html

23-12-2020||India||Folk singer who hosted Amit Shah’s lunch in Bengal caught in BJP-TMC tug of war||Days after Union home minster Amit Shah had lunch at his humble home at Bolpur in Bengal’s Birbhum district, folk singer Basudeb Das Baul has been caught in a tug of war between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Shah, who was on a two-day tour of Bengal, took a chopper ride to Bolpur on December 20 to visit Visva Bharati, the state’s only Central university set up by Rabindranath Tagore and also lead a BJP rally. In between, the two programmes, Shah had home-cooked lunch at the singer’s home and also enjoyed his music. On Tuesday evening, Das was spotted at the office of the TMC district president Anubrata Mondal. Das complained before the local media that he was not given an opportunity to talk to Shah and seek a job or higher education facilities for his daughter. “After Shah left, nobody from the BJP bothered to talk to me although they came to me with the request to host the lunch. I did all the shopping. They only bought the sweets served that day,” said Das. “I am under no pressure from the TMC. I came to Mondal voluntarily,” he added. “I have told the education cell of our party to ensure that the singer’s daughter gets admission to the bachelor of education course. Shah’s visit to his home was nothing but a drama,” said Mondal. The BJP jumped into the fray without wasting time. Anupam Hazra, who was the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Bolpur before joining the BJP in 2019, posted a note on social media along with his photograph with Das. “How come nobody bothered to inquire about this family in 10 years? After Shah visited their home, everybody is suddenly showing concern,” said Hazra who accompanied Shah on Sunday. Das is the third person in Bengal who got caught in political crossfire for playing host to Shah. On November 5, Shah had lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the tribal community at Chaturdihi village in Bankura district. “Had amazing Bengali food at Shri Vivishan Hansda ji’s home in Chaturdihi village. No words can express their warmth and hospitality,” Shah tweeted. A day later, chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged in public that the food was cooked by a Brahmin brought from outside. She also alleged during the same speech that the food was brought from a “five-star hotel”. Leaders from the TMC and the BJP, as well as officers from the district administration, called on Hansda with the offer to get the best treatment for his teenage daughter Rachana who is suffering from diabetes. TMC leaders also claimed that Hansda, a marginal farmer, had always been a party supporter but the tribal man claimed to be an apolitical person with no connection with either of the parties. “I am not part of any organization. If anyone takes pity and offers to help I will accept it but it should not be part of politics,” Hansda said last month. TMC’s top leaders even accused Shah of playing caste politics. “Reality behind @AmitShah Ji’s token meals - he used ST Community & the concerned family as political tool & didn’t even bother to speak to them for a moment. Mr Home Minister, did you come here only for a photo-op? #BengalAsksAmitShah,” tweeted Abhishek Banerjee, TMC Lok Sabha MP and nephew of Mamata Banerjee. Significantly, when Shah was having lunch at Hansda’s home, the TMC government made a surprise move at Naxalbari in Darjeeling district. Gita Mahali, the poor tribal woman who played host to Shah and cooked lunch for him during a similar visit in April 2017, was appointed as special home guard at Naxalbari police station. She was given an appointment letter. Ranjan Sarkar, the TMC district president said the government came forward as the BJP did nothing for the Mahalis in three years. The chief minister also announced that the government will form separate organizations to look after the welfare of backward caste communities. Referring to Shah’s visit to the folk singer’s home in Bolpur, education minister Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday said, “Shah heard his song but did not listen to his maan ki baat. Only Mamata Banerjee is concerned about the people of Bengal,” said Chatterjee. Maan Ki Baat (spoken from the heart) is a popular radio show through which Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation. The folk singer said he will be present at the TMC roadshow that the chief minister will lead in Bolpur town on December 29. It will start from the Dakbungalow Road intersection from where Shah’s roadshow was flagged off on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/folk-singer-who-hosted-amit-shah-s-lunch-in-bengal-caught-in-bjp-tmc-tug-of-war/story-5bVe2UItb8WxFj1Xlb4ybL.html
23-12-2020||India||These states have imposed night curfew and other measures to check Covid-19 spread||After a new strain of coronavirus was discovered in the United Kingdom, countries all over the world started imposing travel restrictions. Some Indian states took an added precaution by announcing a night curfew. With Christmas and New Year coming up, these states have taken this extra precaution to ensure social distancing norms are followed and the spread of Covid-19 remains checked. Maharashtra was one of the first states to impose a night curfew once the new strain was discovered. Iqbal Singh Chahal, the commissioner of Mumbai’s civic body BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “This is not a normal new year which is why we cannot have normal celebrations. The curfew is being imposed to ensure that such violations are not repeated”. Chahal further explained the difference between a total lockdown and a night curfew: “While in a lockdown, individuals cannot step out of their homes, in a curfew, more than 5 people cannot assemble outside during the specified hours. So, offices that function overnight or something like dairy transportation can still operate. Taxis, cars and auto-rickshaws will also run just like before.”The states where night curfew is being strictly imposed includes:-Karnataka: The state government in Karnataka amended the night curfew timings in the state on Wednesday. The revised curfew will now be imposed from Thursday till January 1 from 11 pm-5 am, the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. Movement of people is prohibited unless for essential activities. Earlier in the day, chief minister B S Yediyurappa had announced that the curfew would be imposed from Wednesday night till January 2 adding that all activities would go on as usual from 6am-10pm but cautioning against venturing out after 10 pm.Maharashtra: The Maharashtra government has imposed a seven-hour night curfew for 15 days from December 22 to January 5, in all major cities between 11 pm and 6 am to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. However, offices, taxis, private cars, and auto-rickshaws are allowed to operate in the night following the existing norms. Gujarat: Ahmedabad administration had imposed night curfew in the city from 9 pm to 6 am in November until further notice. Ahmedabad is the only city in Gujarat where such a curfew has been imposed, amid a sudden spike in new cases during the festive season. Ahmedabad’s night curfew is the only one not imposed in response to the new strain of coronavirus. Himachal Pradesh: The Jai Ram Thakur government has decided to impose night curfew in Shimla, Mandi, Kangra and Kullu districts. The curbs will remain in place from 10 pm to 6 am till January 5, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said. The state government had decided to impose night curfew from November 23.Punjab: Chief minister Amarinder Singh on December 11 ordered an extension of the night curfew imposed in all cities and towns till January 1, 2021. Additional restrictions were imposed on gatherings, a total of 100 people can get together for indoor festivities and 250 individuals for outdoor ones, during non-curfew hours in the state. The government had earlier imposed a night curfew from December 1 to December 15.Manipur: The Manipur government has imposed a night curfew in the state from 6pm to 4am starting from the end of November till the end of this year to control the spread of coronavirus. The government has also restricted ceremonial gatherings to 20 people or less.Rajasthan: The Rajasthan government on Wednesday imposed a night curfew on December 31 in all cities with a population of over one lakh, reported PTI. Restrictions will remain in place from 8 pm on December 31 to 6 am on January 1, bursting of fire crackers on New Year’s eve have also been banned by the government.

23-12-2020||India||Summit called off due to Covid, mutually agreed, underline India, Russia||India and Russia on Wednesday dismissed a report that their annual summit wasn’t held this year for the first time in two decades because of purported differences over the Indo-Pacific and Quad, with both sides saying the meet was called off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov created a buzz in diplomatic circles by saying recently that Western powers were using an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies”. Russian diplomats subsequently clarified that Moscow understands India’s inclusive vision of the Indo-Pacific based on international law, but has concerns about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – a grouping that brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US – since it could jeopardise regional cooperation. Responding to the report on the purported reason for the India-Russia Summit not being held this year, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a brief statement: “The India-Russia Annual Summit did not take place in 2020 because of the Covid pandemic. This was a mutually agreed decision between the two governments. “Any imputation otherwise is false and misleading. Spreading false stories on important relationships is particularly irresponsible.” A statement issued by the Russian embassy quoted ambassador Nikolay Kudashev as saying that the summit was postponed “due to epidemiological reasons”. The envoy described the report as “far from reality” and said the “special and privileged strategic partnership” with India is “progressing well despite Covid-19”. “Staying in close touch with our Indian friends to work out new dates for the summit, postponed due to epidemiological reasons. We are confident that it will be held in the near future, while Russian-Indian relations will continue its further development,” Kudashev said. During a media briefing on Monday, Kudashev had said the pandemic “did not stop our bilateral engagements, although it eventually affected the schedule of our contacts, including the annual bilateral summit”. The envoy had said Russia now expects the summit “to be held in 2021 along with other important high-level events, including civil and defence inter-governmental commissions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/summit-called-off-due-to-covid-mutually-agreed-underline-india-russia/story-jMFrODfhHH8KNIZeNzKCaP.html
23-12-2020||India||Centre should listen to the voice of people of J-K: Omar Abdullah||The Centre should listen to the people’s voice against the abrogation of Article 370 since it has itself termed the DDC polls as a victory of democracy, National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah said on Wednesday. Addressing party workers at NC headquarters Nawa-i-Subah, he said the people have made clear their view by supporting the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) in the District Development Council polls.The NC leader also said he does not foresee assembly elections in the union territory anytime soon because of the poll results. The seven-party PAGD swept the maiden DDC polls by winning 110 seats out of 276 for which results were declared, while the BJP emerged as the single largest party by getting 74 seats after securing the biggest vote share in Jammu and Kashmir.“If you really say that democracy has won, then you will have to listen to the voices of the people, and the people of Jammu and Kashmir have said it with a huge majority that they do not accept (the decisions of) August 5, 2019,” Abdullah said.The Centre abrogated Article 370 – which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir – and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two union territories on August 5 last year. “We also accept it (that democracy has won). When did we say that we do not trust democracy? It is another thing that you do not trust us. We have been saying this from day one that we will fight for our rights but not unlawfully or unconstitutionally. We are not for disturbing the atmosphere in this state, but to make it better,” Abdullah said.Omar said the results of the DDC elections have proved that the BJP will not be able to “bury” the NC. “The next elections in J-K are very far because of the defeat of the BJP in this election. I do not think they will have the assembly elections here anytime sooner. If they believed in democracy, they would have sounded the bugle of the assembly elections,” he said.Referring to the alliance with other mainstream parties for seeking the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state, Abdullah said the PAGD was formed in “very difficult” circumstances and “its aim was not power”.He said the party rendered many sacrifices for the alliance and many of his colleagues were not happy with the seat-sharing arrangement.“We could have many more seats had we not contested in the alliance. But, for achieving a bigger goal, small or big sacrifices have to be made… It was our duty to keep aside our differences and to come on a single platform for our identity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-listen-to-the-voice-of-people-of-j-k-omar-abdullah/story-kIBI3wWT3L9LfuEH1dWVoL.html

23-12-2020||India||Army chief General Naravane reviews troop preparedness in forward areas along LAC||Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane on Wednesday visited areas in eastern Ladakh, including the south bank of Pangong Lake, and reviewed the preparedness of troops at the forefront of a nearly eight-month standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Naravane, who reached the forward areas at 8.30 am, visited troops of XIV Corps, popularly known as the “Fire and Fury Corps” and part of the Udhampur-based Northern Command. Besides making a first-hand assessment of the situation on the disputed border, he inspected accommodation created for the frontline troops to cope with the harsh winter. Among the areas visited by Naravane was Rechin La, one of the regions on the south bank of Pangong Lake where Indian troops occupied strategic heights in an operation during August 29-30 to pre-empt moves by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC. Lt Gen PGK Menon, who took over as commander of the Leh-based XIV Corps in October, and senior army officers received the army chief at a forward airbase. “General MM Naravane #COAS visited forward areas of #FireandFury Corps including Rechin La and undertook a first-hand assessment of the situation along the LAC,” the army said in a string of tweets. Naravane was briefed by Menon and other local commanders on the operational preparedness of the forces. Naravane carried out an inspection of the accommodation for troops on the forward line of defences at Rechin La, and appreciated efforts made by the formation to make troops comfortable along the LAC. He also visited forward base Tara and appreciated the “high morale and state of readiness” while interacting with local commanders and troops. During these interactions, the army chief exhorted troops deployed in forward areas to “continue working with same zeal and enthusiasm”. He also distributed sweets and cakes to the troops ahead of Christmas before returning to New Delhi in the evening. India and China held their latest round of diplomatic talks on the standoff along the LAC on December 18, after a gap of more than two months, though there were no signs of an immediate breakthrough. Following the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, the two sides agreed to hold another meeting of senior army commanders in order to work towards complete disengagement and de-escalation at all friction points along the LAC in line with existing agreements and protocols. India mobilised close to 50,000 troops in mountainous forward areas in eastern Ladakh, who have now dug in for the winter in sub-zero temperatures. China has arrayed a similar number of forces on its side of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-general-naravane-reviews-troop-preparedness-in-forward-areas-along-lac/story-lHeFk34gWewZnZFgHZznpJ.html

Before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind, Gandhi will also lead a protest against the three farm laws enacted in September.Congress MP K Suresh said that the demonstration will begin at 10:45 am from Vijay Chowk.“Rahul Gandhi along with Opposition leaders met President and submitted the memorandum to resolve farmers’ issue. But there was no action from the President and the government. Rahul Gandhi will lead demonstration tomorrow at 10:45 am from Vijay Chowk to Rashtrapati Bhavan with Congress MPs,” news agency ANI quoted Suresh as saying.“After that, he and other senior leaders will meet the President of India and submit a memorandum containing 2 crore signatures for his intervention to resolve the farmers’ agitation,” he added. Gandhi earlier undertook a tractor rally across Punjab and Haryana as part of the campaign against the laws.The Congress launched a nationwide campaign in September for collecting appeals of farmers, farm labourers, and other stakeholders addressed to President Kovind for repealing the laws.Hundreds of farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers so far but no breakthrough has been achieved.On December 8, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had held a meeting with the 13 representatives of farm unions. However, a day later, farmer leaders rejected a proposal sent by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-to-hold-protest-meet-president-on-thursday-with-20-million-signatures-against-farm-laws/story-NZfMX54YDuat4vwWovCoXP.html
23-12-2020||India||Farmer unions say they are ready for talks if govt comes up with a concrete proposal||Protesting farmer unions on Wednesday held a press conference at the Delhi-Singhu border asking the government not to repeat the promise of amendments to the new farm laws that have been already rejected but to come up with a concrete proposal in writing so further rounds of talks can be scheduled. “We have already told home minister Amit Shah that protesting farmers will not accept amendments,” national president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, Shiv Kumar Kakka said.Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, who was also present at the press conference, said that the government’s new letter is an attempt to defame the farmers’ movement. “United Farmers Front today has written a letter to the government. It states that the government should not question the letter written by the United Farmers’ Front previously as it was a unanimous decision. Govt’s new letter is a fresh attempt to defame farmers’ association” Yadav stated. The union was referring to the recent proposal sent by the Centre to the farmers’ unions, in which it offered to hold a fresh round of talks at a date and time of the unions’ choosing. Till now, five rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides. While the Centre has reiterated that the laws won’t be scrapped and has instead proposed amendments, the unions have been adamant on a total repeal since the first day of protests. Pointing to the Union agriculture minister’s meeting on Monday with a five member delegation, under the banner of the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti (HMKS), who are in favour of the new farm laws, Yadav remarked that it is a concerted attempt at breaking the farmers’ movement. “The government is constantly holding talks with so-called Farmers’ leaders & organisations, who’re not associated with our movement at all. This is an attempt to break our movement. The Government is dealing with protesting farmers, the way it deals with its opposition.” Yadav stated. As the farmers’ protest entered its 28th day, Yadav announced that the protesting farmers’ union is ready for talks with the government and are waiting for the Centre to approach the farmers’ with clear intentions and open mind. All India Kisan Sabha leader Hannan Molla claimed the government wanted to tire the farmers out so that the protest would end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-say-they-are-ready-for-talks-if-govt-comes-up-with-a-concrete-proposal/story-bUqESFyIQzDgK24VVPMEJM.html

The police have formed five teams to nab the miscreants. Daleep Singh Kunwar, senior superintendent of police (SSP), US Nagar, said, “It is yet to be clear whether the spot where the incident took place is in Uttar Pradesh or in Uttarakhand, but we have formed five teams to scan the CCTV footage to nab the miscreants.” Kunwar said Sachin Sharma, a resident of Balwant Enclave colony works in a Radiant cash management company. “He was on his way to the bank to deposit the cash and cheques at about 12.30 pm. When he was near the railway station, three bike-borne miscreants stopped him at gunpoint and fled after snatching the bag,” he said. The SSP said Sharma alerted the police and they rushed to the spot and collected the necessary information about the incident. “According to Sharma, the bag contained Rs 5.35-lakh cash and cheques worth Rs 23 lakh,” he said. Police scanned the CCTV installed on the route and spotted three bike-borne miscreants as per the detail provided by Sharma. “Teams have moved to UP and some places of US Nagar. The police are waiting for a complaint from the victim to register the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-bike-borne-men-rob-rs-5-3-lakh-from-uttarakhand-s-us-nagar/story-tBdnIpELaT54MNalAXnlqI.html
23-12-2020||India||India submits 9-point plan for WHO reforms||India has proposed a nine-point plan for reforms of the World Health Organization (WHO), including changes in mechanisms to monitor health emergencies that can cross borders and giving the head of the UN body greater power to declare an international public health emergency. The proposals, which have been formally conveyed to UN and WHO authorities, also include changes and improvements in the body’s funding and governance, transparency in use of funds, and a greater role for the world body in ensuring fair, affordable and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines. The Indian government has repeatedly raised the need to reform WHO at multilateral forums such as the G20 and BRICS this year, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised the body for not reflecting contemporary realities. India’s calls for WHO reforms, especially after the body’s initial handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, have been backed by countries around the world. The Indian government’s proposals, contained in the document “Approach on WHO reforms”, call for devising “objective criteria with clear parameters” for declaring a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The WHO director general currently has to convene a committee of experts, the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee, to declare an international emergency. India has proposed the WHO chief should be empowered to declare a PHEIC if there is “broad agreement, though not a consensus” within the emergency committee. “The emphasis must be on transparency and promptness in the declaration process,” the document stated. The Indian recommendation is relevant in view of WHO’s regulations which state the emergency committee gives advice on declaration of a PHEIC when there is “inconsistency in the assessment of the event” between the WHO chief and the affected country – something that revelations have pointed to in the case of Covid-19. The Indian government pointed out that most of the financing for WHO’s programmes comes from extra-budgetary contributions earmarked for specific issues. Since WHO has little flexibility in using these funds, voluntary contributions should be “unearmarked to ensure that the WHO has necessary flexibility for its usage in areas where they are required the most”, it recommended. WHO’s regular budget should also be increased so that core activities “are financed from it, without putting an overwhelming financial burden on developing countries”, it said. Noting that member states have little say in selection of WHO’s activities, expenditure and concurrent monitoring, the Indian government called for effective involvement of all countries in budget implementation and spending. “Strong and robust financial accountability frameworks” should be created, a “significant amount of transparency with respect to data reporting and disbursement of funds” should be established, and the efficiency of funding mechanisms such as the WHO Solidarity Response Fund should be strengthened, it said. With Covid-19 having exposed gaps in implementing the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR), which defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling health emergencies that can cross borders, India called for strengthening capacities in countries found to be deficient and for enhancing international cooperation. Calling for a global framework for managing infectious diseases and pandemics, including capacities such as testing and surveillance systems, the document highlighted the “need to establish a system facilitating pan-world surveillance by leveraging innovating ICT tools”. The Indian government said it is important for member states to have a greater say in the functioning of WHO and pointed out the two policy-making organs –World Health Assembly and Executive Board – are only playing a “peripheral role”. With most of the work in WHO being done by technical committees of independent experts, there is also a need to review the functioning of these panels. “The pandemic laid bare various gaps in the preparedness of healthcare systems across the globe, which could have been reviewed and strengthened in a timely manner,” the document said. The Indian government also called for efforts to “ensure fair, affordable and equitable access to all tools for combating [the] Covid-19 pandemic and, therefore, the need to build a framework for their allocation”. WHO’s work in this direction should be supported, and Covid-19 vaccines are a “global public good and TRIPS waiver as proposed by India and South Africa would go a long way in effective international and national response” to the pandemic, it said. It also pointed out that “as a reflection of vaccine nationalism, some developed countries have been signing bilateral agreements with vaccine manufacturers, leaving very little space for developing countries to get fair, affordable and equitable access” to vaccines. In May, India was elected to WHO’s Executive Board and will chair the body during 2020-21, putting it in a position to suggest key reforms to the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-submits-9-point-plan-for-who-reforms/story-FVboitfg5k408Pf4CM9BTN.html

He has been arrested for allegedly hatching a criminal conspiracy to revive Sikh militancy in India for a separate state of Khalistan.A resident of the Ajnala town in Amritsar, Nijjar left for Cyprus on October 19, 2017, a release issued by the NIA stated, adding that his transit custody shall be obtained and he will be taken to Mumbai for further investigation.The NIA had registered a case on January 10 last year against Nijjar and another accused Harpal Singh under Section 3 &25 of the Arms Act, 1959; Sections 37 & 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 and Section 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.Further investigations by the NIA revealed that Nijjar, Singh and a third accused Moin Khan had orchestrated a criminal conspiracy to revive Sikh militancy for the ultimate objective of forming a separate state of Khalistan.The trio through social media platforms used to post images and videos of the 1984 Operation Blue Star and Jagtar Singh Hawara - a convict in the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.“Pro-Khalistani posts related to a proscribed outfit named Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) were also put up to motivate like-minded Sikh youths and others to join the Khalistani movement,” the NIA release added. The agency had earlier filed a chargesheet against the three of them in a special NIA court on May 23, 2019.This arrest comes almost a week after the NIA had sentenced and convicted a Tamil Nadu-based engineer Mohamed Naser Packeer for seven years of rigorous imprisonment in an Islamic State (ISIS) conspiracy case. Naser, who is a certified ethical hacker from Chennai, was working as a Web developer and graphic designer in Dubai in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-khalistani-terrorist-at-delhi-airport-upon-his-deportation/story-giLM6gQ53c6BXdUBlCAKVK.html

Prasad asserted that the Gupkar alliance, a coalition of opposition parties in Jammu and Kashmir, was only formed cause the parties could never have fought the BJP single-handedly.“People are calling this a victory of the Gupkar alliance but if you see the numbers, BJP has garnered more votes than NC, PDP and Congress combined,” Prasad said. “BJP has 4,87,364 votes, while NC got 2,82,514, PDP got 57,789 and Congress got 1,39,382 votes.”Prasad also added that the voting percentage in areas such Shopian, Bandipura and Pulwama has increased since the 2019 Lok Sabha election, dismissing that the people were unhappy with the union government’s decision to strip J&K’s special status.Also read: Agriculture minister says hopeful farm unions will discuss govt’s request“The people of Kashmir have delivered a resounding slap to extremists, terrorists and their patrons,” Prasad said. “The defeat of Gupkar Alliance from the area of Burhan Wani is important for additional reasons.

Today the Gupkar Aliance’s defeat from that area shows the change of wave in J&K,” he added.Prasad also said that the people of Kashmir have seen development after years, restoring their faith in democracy. “The people have rejected those who rule and instead chosen those who work,” Prasad said.The Union minister also hailed the victory of 52 independent candidates, of which he said many are supporters of the BJP. “Democracy is turning its pages in Jammu and Kashmir. Instead of throwing stones, people are now exercising their franchise using ballot papers,” he said.“People make a habit of disparaging the prime minister and questioning his popularity,” Prasad said. “But from Ladakh to Telangana, Rajasthan to Assam and Bihar, people have elected Narendra Modi as their leader.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resounding-slap-for-extremists-terrorists-rs-prasad-on-j-k-ddc-poll-results/story-l1hzcTZU1bIKrRHpcv1Z8O.html

23-12-2020||India||Rules to stop coronavirus variant stoke chaos at Indian airports||Passengers flying into India’s biggest airports on Wednesday complained of long waits and confusion as authorities sought to impose rules to try to stop the spread of a new more transmissible variant of the coronavirus.Like many countries, India has suspended flights from Britain, where cases have soared because of the variant.People arriving from Britain before the ban came into force on Wednesday were being tested, including Kamini Saraswat whose plane landed in New Delhi just before midnight.Despite pre-booking a test, her turn came nine hours after arrival and she told Reuters she was still stuck at the airport waiting for the result.“There is no clear communication,” said Saraswat, 28. “There is no social distancing.”Cellphone footage taken by Saraswat, shared with Reuters, showed long lines of passengers and crowds packed together around desks to get themselves tested.India’s hardest-hit state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital Mumbai, has taken additional measures, quarantining most passengers arriving from Europe and the Middle East for a week. Many European and Middle Eastern countries have also suspended flights from Britain, but act as transit hubs for the big airlines flying into India.Ishwari Gaurav Naik, who arrived in Mumbai from Dubai at around 2 a.m. on Wednesday, said she had to wait more than six hours before authorities sent her and three family members to a quarantine facility.“There was huge chaos there,” Naik said from her temporary accommodation at a school. “Nobody knows anything. There is no coordination between staff.”Delhi and Mumbai airport officials declined to comment, and local officials in both cities and India’s federal health ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. Federal authorities have said that all required measures will be undertaken but have given few details of how the extra checks will be staffed.India’s plan to track down and screen all arrivals from Britain since Nov. 25 is also getting stretched.Immigration officials are tasked to provide the details of all travellers from Britain since then. They will be then contacted by state and district health officials.A 54-year-old British citizen who flew into Mumbai on Monday morning said he was yet to receive either the result of his airport coronavirus test or any follow-up calls.“The intention may be very good, but it is all down to the execution,” he said, declining to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-to-stop-coronavirus-variant-stoke-chaos-at-indian-airports/story-r88zfGFkHSjY0fc3QTEEmN.html

He said there was no need to convene the House unnecessarily,” Muraleedharan said while speaking to news agency ANI.The Piarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government wanted to convene the special session against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September, but governor Khan declined their request.Apart from the state government, Congress and other opposition parties in Kerala also supported the move to introduce a resolution against the farm laws. Muraleedharan told ANI that passing a resolution amounts to wasting public money, adding it will have no effect because when Parliament passes a law, it is applicable in the entire country. I feel Governor's point is justifiable because convening Assembly session to pass the resolution amounts to wasting public money.

Abdullah said the numbers show that the BJP is not even “fully Jammu based” party.“I congratulate them (BJP) for their 3 seats (in Kashmir) but what about our 35 seats in Jammu. Admit that we’ve pan J&K presence. BJP keeps calling us Kashmir based party. If we are Kashmir based with 35 seats in Jammu, then they are not even fully Jammu based,” news agency ANI quoted Abdullah as saying.According to latest set of results, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), led by the National Conference, bagged 112 seats in the first-ever elections to the 288 DDCs while BJP emerged as the single-largest party winning 75 seats. The counting of votes is still underway.Out of 140 seats in Jammu region’s 10 districts, the BJP has won 71 that include eight in Doda, 11 in Jammu, 13 in Kathua, three in Kishtwar, two in Rajouri, three in Ramban, seven in Reasi, 13 in Samba and 11 in Udhampur district.The National Conference, meanwhile, has won 25 seats - one in Doda, one in Jammu’s Dansal, six in Kishtwar, two in Poonch, five in Rajouri, six in Ramban, three in Reasi and one in Samba district.In a tweet earlier in the day, Abdullah had said, “It’s amusing to see the desperation of the BJP propaganda wallas. Yesterday it was about 3 seats in the valley & today it’s about being the single largest party. They aren’t even embarrassed about making comparisons with @jknc which contested far fewer seats due to an alliance.”The PAGD comprises of seven parties - National Conference (NC), People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Hakeem Mohammad Yaseen Shah’s Jammu and Kashmir People Democratic Front (PDF), Communist Party of India (Marxist), Javid Mustafa’s Jammu and Kashmir People Movement (JKPM), Sajjad Lone’s Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference (JKPC) and Muzaffar Shah’s Awami National Conference.While NC leader Farooq Abdullah was chosen as president of the PAGD, Mehbooba Mufti was picked to play the role of the vice-president.

23-12-2020||India||Ayodhya mosque against Waqf Act, illegal under Shariyat law: AIMPLB||All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Zafaryab Jilani said on Wednesday said the mosque which is planned to come up in Ayodhya following last year’s Supreme Court verdict was against the Waqf Act and “illegal” under the Shariat laws.Athar Hussain, the secretary of a trust formed to build the mosque in Ayodhya, however, said everyone interprets the Shariat in their own way and when the land has been allotted under the directive of the Supreme Court, it cannot be illegal.The blueprint of the mosque and a hospital to be built on a five-acre land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village was unveiled on Saturday at the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) office in Lucknow.The IICF has been formed by the Uttar Pradesh State Sunni Central Waqf Board to construct the mosque and other utilities on the plot.“According to the Waqf Act, mosques or land of mosques cannot be bartered. The proposed mosque in Ayodhya violates the Act. It violates the Shariat law as the Waqf Act is based on the Shariat,” said Jilani, who was also the convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee.Another executive member of AIMPLB SQR Ilyas said, “We have rejected the proposal to accept land for the mosque at any other place. We lost the title suit and so we don’t need a land for a mosque.” He alleged that the Sunni Central Waqf Board was working under the pressure of the government.“The Muslims have, however, rejected this land at Dhannipur given in compensation. The mosque being built by the trust constituted by the Sunni Central Waqf Board is just a symbolic one.” The issue was raised by MP MP Asaduddin Owaisi at a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s executive committee was held on October 13. All the members were of the view that the exchange of land for the mosque was not permissible under the Waqf Act and in turn “illegal” under the Shariat law.“The power for interpretation of Shariya does not lie in the hands of some limited people. The mosque is the place for offering namaz. So what is wrong if we are building a mosque?” posed Hussain.The Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed structure was demolished in December 1992 by “kar sevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built by demolishing an ancient Ram temple.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.On the directive of the apex court, the Uttar Pradesh government allotted the five-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-mosque-against-waqf-act-illegal-under-shariyat-law-aimplb/story-0QrFb4aJkLrQA8HwjzkceJ.html

23-12-2020||India||‘Befitting reply to Mehbooba Mufti’: Anurag Thakur’s jibe after Jammu and Kashmir DDC election results||With Gupkar Alliance getting a clear majority in many of the districts in Jammu and Kashmir District Development Council election and the BJP emerging as the single largest party, both the alliance of the regional parties of J&K and the BJP attempted to project the verdict in their favour. BJP’s DDC polls in-charge Anurag Thakur said the election results are a befitting reply to Mehbooba Mufti who had refused to unfurl the Tricolour. “Independent candidates have polled more votes than the Congress and the PDP. The same Mehbooba Mufti who’d refused to unfurl the Tricolour has got a befitting reply today,” Anurag Thakur said.Mehbooba Mufti’s tricolour comment stoked a major controversy as she had said she will hoist the tricolour only when the state flag of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir will be allowed. This was the first-ever poll in Jammu and Kashmir after it was turned into a union territory. To contest this election, the local parties of Jammu and Kashmir came together and formed Gupkar Alliance, which is near the majority mark. The alliance has won 110 seats but the BJP has emerged as the single-largest party by getting 75 seats and the maximum vote share in Jammu and Kashmir. “The trust which the J&K people have put in Modiji, the support which they’ve shown to his policies and to his work to strengthen the democratic principles, are the reasons why BJP has got 3 seats in the Kashmir Valley,” Anurag Thakur said.Here is where the parties stand as of now:The results of four constituencies - one each in Bandipora and Kupwara districts of north Kashmir and Poonch and Rajouri districts in Jammu region - were still awaited.Out of the 276 seats for which results have been declared so far, Independent candidates have won 49, ahead of Congress (26) and Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP (27). But PDP is part of the winning alliance. Omar Abdullah, on the other hand, questioned how BJP could be the single largest party while the National Conference did not contest from many seats because of the alliance. Countering BJP’s ‘victory of democracy’ claim, Omar Abdullah said had BJP believed in democracy, they would have announced Assembly elections by now. “With this defeat, I don’t think BJP government will conduct Assembly elections here anytime soon. They would have announced the polls by now had they believed in democracy. So, we have time to strengthen our party,” he said.“We must also accept that there are some weaknesses in our organisation in some areas. We were expecting to win the election at some seats but could not,” he added.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/befitting-reply-to-mehbooba-mufti-anurag-thakur-s-jibe-after-jammu-and-kashmir-ddc-election-results/story-1ZyE9aa3E5PquYS3j9h3RI.html

It seems to be a fall out of levy (extortion) demanded by Maoists,” said a police official, adding that an FIR was filed against the extremists with the Khaira police station.Police said around 20 Maoists arrived at the site searching for an official of the company. When they did not find him, police added, they assaulted those working there, asking them to stop the work. Police sources said that the ultras had demanded levy from the bridge construction company and were regularly threatening them for the last two weeks. “When the company finally declined to pay the levy, the rebels attacked the construction site and destroyed the equipment,” the source said.One of the injured labourers, Nandlal, told police that a dozen-odd men raided their site to know how they could start the construction work without taking ‘permission’ from them.Jamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal confirmed the incident and said that raids are on against the suspects. Three empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. SHO of Khaira police station CP Yadav said three employees - Raj Kumar Pandit, Prayag Sao and Ganesh Das - were injured and referred to a primary health centre. Yadav refused to comment if the Moaists attacked the construction site to demand extortion money or to register their presence.Earlier on December 16, Andhra Pradesh-based Gaytri private limited construction company received a levy demand call of Rs 32.5 crore from suspected Maoists. The company is involved in the project funded by Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDC) for improvement and upgrading and strengthening 54-km stretch of Kadirganj- Khaira Road (SH-82) that connects Jamui and Nawada districts, considered a Maoist hotbed. A case has been filed with Khaira police in the district on the basis of the statement of administrative manager Sudhir Kumar Shandilya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-attack-bridge-construction-site-in-bihar-rough-up-workers-police/story-ZHuPvChHqi9tDJamHjkYUI.html

Earlier, main accused Thomas Kotoor informed the court that he was undergoing treatment for cancer and pleaded for lesser punishment. Sister Sephy also sought commutation but the prosecution opposed their contention saying they deserved no sympathy. The murder of 19-year-old Sister Abhaya was initially dismissed as a suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was murder. In 2009, the CBI charge-sheeted Kottoor and Sefi. But the case witnessed many twists and turns and a flurry of petitions which delayed the trial inordinately. According to the CBI charge-sheet, on the day of her death, Abhaya got up early to study and went to the kitchen to wash her face. The charge-sheet surmised that she witnessed some sexual activity involving the two priests and nun and was killed because they feared she may disclose what she had witnessed.She was first attacked with an axe and later dumped in the well, the CBI claimed. Although the case created a sensation in Kerala, the church stood by the accused, saying the accused were innocent.“I am the happiest man today. Both got what they deserved. It is time for the church to do an introspection whether they should shield people like them or not,” said activist Jomon Puthanpurackkal, who took up the case and fought a long legal battle. Former CBI deputy superintendent of police Verghese P Thomas, who first investigated the case and later opted for voluntary retirement after he allegedly came under pressure to write off the death as a suicide, expressed his satisfaction at the verdict. Although most witnesses had turned hostile during the trial, the court said a few prosecution witnesses had been convincing. Interestingly one of the main witnesses in the case was a small-time robber, Raju. He was on the premises of the convent for stealing areca nuts when the incident took place. He reportedly told CBI officers that he saw two priests and a nun at the convent around the time of Abhaya’s death. He later said he was promised many things to own up to the crime and change his statement but he stuck to his testimony.Many movies were made based on the theme of the sensational case. The poor parents of Abhaya who valiantly fought for justice died during the long years of legal battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sister-abhaya-murder-kerala-priest-nun-get-life-imprisonment/story-nyiOYBzQM0ywboYzJkDSGK.html

23-12-2020||India||No public interest in disclosing names of electoral bond buyers, says CIC||The Central Information Commission (CIC), India’s transparency watchdog, has said no public interest is involved in disclosing the names of buyers of electoral bonds while reiterating the argument that such information cannot be shared under the Right to Information (RTI) Act as it is held in a “fiduciary” capacity -- a move that reflects a change in position from an order it issued in January. “There appears to be no larger public interest overriding the right to privacy of the donors and donees (recipients) concerned,” information commissioner Suresh Chandra said in an order issued on December 21.In January, another bench of the CIC said in an unrelated case that the electoral bonds process should be more transparent and the names of those buying them should be declared.Maharashtra-based RTI applicant Vihar Durve had sought details from State Bank of India (SBI) of those who bought electoral bonds from the bank and donated them to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, and the Left parties, from domestic branches of the bank between 2017 and 2018.The electoral bond scheme allows citizens and corporate entities to buy monetary instruments from SBI and donate them to political parties, which can redeem them for money. Citizen groups have for long argued that in the interest of transparency, the identity of such donors must be disclosed.Also Read: ADR seeks urgent hearing on electoral bonds case in Supreme CourtAfter being dissatisfied with the reply of SBI’s public information officer, who refused to provide the names of the donors on grounds that it was third-party information that cannot be shared, Durve filed an appeal with the bank’s First Appellate Authority (FAA).FAA also ruled that the information related to electoral bonds issued to political parties was held by SBI in a fiduciary capacity and that the names of the donors could not be disclosed because they fell in the bracket of “third party information”.Section 8 of the RTI Act prohibits sharing of third-party information without written consent of the third party. However, the section also says that the information can be shared if the information officer is convinced that it would serve “larger public interest”.Durve, in his petition, contended that declaring the names of the donors will serve the larger public interest of ensuring transparency in the funding of political parties. He also said that electoral bonds were an opaque way of funding with citizens not knowing who, especially e corporate entities, were donating money to the parties.“Citizens need to know which companies are funding which party to infer whether they (corporate) are influencing policy making,” Durve said.The applicant filed an appeal with the CIC in September 2018. On December 21, 2020, CIC upheld SBI’s stand, holding that “disclosure of names of donors and the donees may be in contravention of provisions contained in section 8 (1) (e) (j) of the RTI Act.”The section exempts a public authority from giving citizens’ information available with it in fiduciary relationship, if a competent authority is satisfied it would not serve larger public interest. According to the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), political parties have received a total of 12,452 electoral bonds worth Rs 6,210.39 crore until January this year, from January 2017. The BJP received about 60% of the total funding through electoral bonds and Congress about 31.5%.ADR also said the funding received through electoral bonds was more than the money generated through the sale of coupons, vouchers or cash donations for the BJP. ADR in October filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking an early hearing of its petition demanding scrapping of the electoral bonds. saying it was in violation of various transparency regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-public-interest-in-disclosing-names-of-electoral-bond-buyers-says-cic/story-ooeZmLT8p8tl5g5ahTqLBN.html

Third accused Sister Sephy too has been sentenced to life imprisonment in the case that goes back to 1992.Both accused Thomas Kotoor and Sister Sefi were found guilty of murder (Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code), Section 449 (house trespassing to commit a crime) and Section 201 (destroying evidence) and other sections of the IPC. In 1992, 19-year-old Sister Abhaya, a plus-two student, was found dead in the well of the Pious X Convent in Kottayam. The case was initially dismissed as a suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was murder. In 2009, the CBI charge-sheeted Catholic priest Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy in the case. In 1993, the case went to the CBI after a human rights activist took the matter to the court. In its first report in 1996, the CBI said it was a suicide case but a year after it said in its second report that it was a homicide. In 2008, the CBI submitted its third report charging two Catholic priests, Father Thomas Kottoor and Father Jose Poothrukayil, and a nun, Sister Sephy with murder, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy and other charges. According to the charge sheet, Abhaya was killed because she was witness to some alleged immoral activity involving two priests and a nun. She was attacked with an axe before being dumped in the well, the central agency claimed.In 2009, all three of them were granted bail. The trial of the came began in 2019 after 27 years. One of the main witnesses in the case was a small-time robber, Raju. He was on the premises of the convent for stealing areca nuts when the incident took place. He reportedly told CBI officers that he saw two priests and a nun at the convent around the time of Abhaya’s death. He later said he was promised many things to own up to the crime and change his statement but he stuck to his testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhaya-murder-case-father-thomas-kotoor-gets-double-life-term-after-28-years/story-HCw7l8vBazKi4CarLsAr2I.html

As per the advisory, the event will held with 50% audience. While for participants, negative certificate for Covid-19 is mandatory. Jallikattu is a custom practiced where cattle stock are worshipped, during the Pongal festival, primarily in Tamil Nadu. It is a sport where a bull is let loose among a crowd of people. The participants are supposed to take control of the bull by holding its hump for as long as they can.The festival is celebrated on Mattu Pongal, the third day of the harvest festival. The bull species called Bos indicus, or humped cattle, is specifically bred for Jallikatu. The bulls that do well at the event are used latter for breeding.Over the years, the festival has faced major criticism from several animal welfare groups who have described Jallikattu as “barbaric.” But political parties and people of the state have insisted that it is part of Tamil Nadu’s tradition and culture. The move comes ahead of Tamil Nadu going to assembly polls in early 2021. Earlier this week, the government banned New Year celebrations on beaches, roads, hotels and resorts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-government-permits-jallikattu-amid-covid-19-negative-certificate-mandatory-not-more-than-50-spectators-allowed/story-WFNrYPU9J4mSGlDbQRtRGL.html

23-12-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths in India largely due to patients reporting late at hospital: Govt||Fewer patients are dying in India due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as compared to other countries, and deaths happen largely because patients are reaching hospital late, say experts in the government.The country’s deaths per million population due to Covid-19 currently stand at 106, and the global figures show that 216 patients are dying of Covid-19 per million population in comparison.“The deaths are low in number and our analysis shows that most of the positive cases, who are serious, come to a hospital late; when their condition has fairly deteriorated. It is important to get tested and seek medical aid in time to avoid complications,” said Dr VK Paul, in Tuesday’s media briefing on Covid-19 update.India’s disease trajectory shows there has been a constant decline in both the number of new deaths and new cases reported daily.Also Read: India records 23,950 new infections in 24 hours, 22% rise from yesterday“In India we are seeing 7,300 cases per million population currently and global figures show 9,600 cases getting reported per million population. Ttat goes on to show that the country has managed to control the disease quite well,” said Rajesh Bhushan, union health secretary.The comparison of past seven days’ data on Covid-19 cases per million showed that average daily new cases had declined from about 46,000 between November 4 and 10 to about 24,000 in the week between December 16 and 22.On Monday, India had reported less than 20,000 new cases after almost 173 days, and health ministry attributes the steady decline in numbers and deaths to sustained efforts at the ground level both from the central and state governments.“Teams of experts were sent to states that were reporting a higher caseload to assist governments in managing the condition on ground. Experts would look for areas that needed special focus and drafted mitigation plans accordingly. All that has worked in bringing the numbers down overall, and the result is here for all to see,” said a senior health ministry official.“Having said that, there is absolutely no reason to drop our guards yet as there have been multiple waves of the disease already. The surveillance and other measures will continue along with people observing Covid-appropriate behaviour, which is absolutely necessary in curtailing the transmission rate,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-in-india-largely-due-to-patients-reporting-late-at-hospital-govt/story-lx6A9cVW7jej0TQiwWqDrO.html

23-12-2020||India||Karnataka minister accused of seeking Rs 1cr bribe alleges conspiracy||A day after it belatedly came to light that a complaint has been lodged with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office (PMO) against Karnataka excise minister H Nagesh, accused of seeking a bribe of Rs one crore for a transfer, the minister said he was being targeted for being a Dalit.In a letter written to the PMO, Sneha, the daughter of L N Mohan Kumar, the joint commissioner of excise department in Ballari, has alleged that the minister, through intermediaries, demanded a sum of Rs one crore for Kumar’s transfer to Bengaluru.Sneha, in the letter to the PMO, said that her father was suffering due to ill-health and sought a transfer to Bengaluru, which had a vacancy in an equivalent position, for good medical treatment. However, the minister, through two aides-- Manjunath and Harsha-- demanded a sum of Rs one crore to sanction the transfer. She also said that in spite of bringing the issue to the notice of deputy CM Ashwath Narayan, no action was taken against the minister.Responding to the letter written to the PMO, excise minister Nagesh claimed that Mohan Kumar had lost his mental balance and was making all kinds of false allegations. He also claimed that Sneha was a habitual complainant against authorities. “I completely deny these charges as they are baseless and false. I am being targeted because I am a Dalit,” the minister said on Tuesday.Nagesh also said that he would file a defamation case against Kumar and his family members for allegedly making baseless charges. “I also have information that Kumar may have lost his mental balance. I believe this is nothing but a political conspiracy to finish off a scheduled caste leader,” he said.Also Read: Karnataka sees around 79% voting in first phase of gram panchayat pollsThe official in question is said to have been forced to go on leave, though HT could not independently verify the same. Efforts to reach Kumar on his mobile were also unsuccessful.

Do you have it in you to remove him from Cabinet or is the PM @narendramodi’s slogan of “Na Khaunga, Na Khanedunga” just another of his many jhumlas.”Nagesh was one of the two independent candidates who got elected in the May 2018 assembly polls. He initially joined hands with the Congress and the JDS and was made the minister for small scale industries in the H D Kumaraswamy led coalition government.

The rules also provide for penalties for power distribution firms in case they do not maintain mandated standards of services.“The Ministry of Power has promulgated rules laying down the rights of consumers... These Rules emanate from the conviction that the power systems exist to serve the consumers and the consumers have rights,” the ministry said in a statement on Monday when the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules were notified.“ Distribution Companies across the country are monopolies – whether government or private – and the consumer has no alternative - therefore it was necessary that the consumers’ rights be laid down in Rules and a system for enforcement of these rights be put in place.”Also Read: India plans to allow relinquished coal-fired plants to sell powerThe statement said implementation of the rules shall ensure that new electricity connections, refunds, and other services are given in a time-bound manner.

It noted that several proceedings were adjourned sine die on account of stays granted by trial courts or high courts and this has badly hit the trials.Also Read: Exit deals don’t negate right to compensation: Supreme Court orderIn a circular on Tuesday, the CVC said, “In respect of those cases, where stay was granted by a trial court more than six months ago and also in cases based on Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) investigation, which have been kept in abeyance due to court orders, the issues may be examined in light of the aforementioned judgement of the SC [Supreme Court].”It said appropriate and immediate steps may also be taken, in consultation with the organisation’s counsels/legal branch, to ensure that the stays are vacated within six months.People familiar with the matter said several high-profile accused usually avoid trials in corruption, money laundering and other cases by availing stays for a longer period from the lower or the high courts. “This period is also often used by the accused to tamper with the evidence or threaten the witnesses. Any stay should not exceed six months as stated by the SC [Supreme Court].

23-12-2020||India||New textile policy likely to be focussed on boosting domestic industry||The government is coming up with a new textile policy that promises to boost the domestic industry, promote cultivation, processing and branding of organic cotton, and to set up hubs to manufacture machinery with the help of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), officials familiar with the matter said.“In keeping with the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat [to make India a self-reliant nation], the idea is to increase the domestic production of several components in the sector to make India a global textile player,” said a textile ministry official on the condition of anonymity. “We import nearly 75% of machinery for the textile sector. The aim is to change that and manufacture the machinery indigenously.”News agency Press Trust of India on December 2 quoted textile secretary Ravi Capoor citing a Niti Aayog-led study that found Rs 13,000 crore worth machinery was being imported for the industry. The study highlighted that India has reached nowhere in terms of technology up-gradation except in the spinning segment.Also Read: ‘RE: Think, Act, Create’ launches The ReFashion HubOfficials said seven mega textile hubs are expected to be set up across the country as per the policy. End-to-end production, from raw material to export of the finished product, would be available at these hubs. A mega textile park spread over 1,000 hectares of land will boost the growth of integrated textiles.Officials said a textile research institute will be set up in Coimbatore under the policy. “A draft of the policy is likely to be floated for public feedback soon,” said a second official.Officials said the policy seeks a structural shift to make India a man-made fibre (MMF) rather than a cotton-driven industry. HT on December 9 reported the Union textile ministry was considering over Rs 10,000 crore production linked incentive scheme to encourage the industry. The ministry has identified 50 key sectors such as sanitary napkins and winterwear for the scheme with a five-year gestation period. It has removed the anti-dumping duty on purified terephthalic acid and acrylic fibre to boost the MMF sector. “The next step is to remove it from viscose fibre,” the second official said. “The world is moving towards MMF, we need to embrace that as well.”Officials said the proposed policy also seeks to boost handcart and handloom sectors. “The move will take the industry forward and not let it be primarily subsidiary oriented,” the second official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-textile-policy-likely-to-be-focussed-on-boosting-domestic-industry/story-J70lYm1PpvtRWQFqYG71BO.html

Subramanian in 2013 had filed a writ petition in the Delhi high court challenging the illegal grant of license to Air Asia India which is a joint venture with Tata Sons. According to Subramanian, his hearing was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the next date is in January 2021.The letter written by Subramanian on December 14 not only mentioned his writ petition but also the first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 28, 2018.

23-12-2020||India||In Bengal, if you are with BJP, you lose: Saugata Roy||Home minister Amit Shah has just concluded a two-day visit to West Bengal where 10 politicians defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including seven legislators from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The BJP is expecting major gains in the upcoming assembly elections, buoyed by the induction of its latest heavyweight recruit from TMC, former minister Suvendu Adhikari. Adhikari was one of the key members of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s team. HT spoke to former union minister and MP Saugata Roy about what impact he expects Adhikari’s exit to have on TMC. Roy told HT’s Sunetra Choudhury that Adhikari was pressured by cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate, but the Muslim vote will be an insurmountable factor for the BJP.We just saw Amit Shah concluding what seems to be a successful trip to Bengal, Would you agree that BJP’s influence in Bengal is growing?Not at all. I do not think that the BJP’s influence is growing. There is no proof on the ground of the same. Amit Shah has gone, they spent crores of rupees and in one of these programmes, they got lots of people but they are all outsiders. I do not think that a large number of people will join the BJP. They said so but only six TMC MLAs joined, no deluge, no nothing. So what is it? Amit Shah had two rallies; Mamata, if she goes, will hold a rally double the size. So how does it prove that BJP’s influence is growing?One of the instances that is being cited is that Suvendu Adhikari was one of Mamata Banerjee’s key people who led the whole Nandigram protest.No, no, he didn’t lead. Suvendu was a youngster at the time. He had just become an MLA. He played a role, his father also played a role. He didn’t lead the Nandigram protest, he is not a Nandigram local. He is from a place which is about 100 km away from Nandigram. But Suvendu had some relevance as a popular leader. Having gone to BJP, he will lose the Muslim support base. Nandigram itself is 40% Muslim.But isn’t this talk about the Muslim base what the BJP is banking on? What will they use to polarise the vote?In Bengal, 30% people are Muslim. Any leader who doesn’t command any support, they don’t realise that without the Muslims, they will be hard-pressed. BJP can’t get that percentage of votes and will be at a disadvantage. So you’re saying that BJP’s usual strategy won’t work in Bengal because of simple arithmetic?No, it doesn’t work. Apart from other political factors, if you are with BJP, you lose volume. But we saw seven people joining and they said by the time elections are here, we will see many other people crossing over. Isn’t that a matter of concern?Not yet. We have 218 MLAs and I don’t think that the number defecting from Trinamool will be large. Some of the people that have gone with Suvendu, they are such non-entities that they would not have a got a nomination this time. Even if they got, they would lose. Why did Suvendu Adhikari really leave?Suvendu is very ambitious He wants to be chief minister or at least deputy chief minister. He wanted that assurance in TMC and we couldn’t give him that. Allurement too. The BJP is capable of offering financial allurements and Suvendu has some problem with ED cases. So all these taken together, BJP put some pressure on him and offered him something. But ultimately, it will not be fulfilled. BJP will not make anybody who is not from RSS {Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh} background chief minister or deputy chief minister. In Assam, they didn’t make Himanta Biswa Sarma the chief minister. In Tripura, they brought in Biplab Deb, a non-entity, because he had an RSS background.What happened at your meeting with Suvendu Adhikari on December 1?Suvendu was playing a game. He had several rounds of talks with me, then we had a final meeting in which Abhishek (Banerjee), Sudip (Bandhopadhyay) and Prashant Kishor were also present....{then} we spoke to Mamata. We made Suvendu speak to her. Mamata told him “Suvendu, you work in the party, what’s the problem?’’ He said “No, Didi, I will be with you.’’ So, I said that to the press. Suvendu had said that he’ll say everything on the 6th of December. ..Then next day, he sent me a WhatsApp {message} that said “since you have leaked it to the press, we can’t work with you.’’ But his deal with BJP was already finalised. We knew that. He took that as an excuse. Then he went out himself trying to gather MLAs, but he couldn’t get that many.One of the charges that he and the BJP have made is that they see dynastic politics in TMC. That there has been a lot of attention paid to Abhishek Banerjee {Mamata Banerjee’s nephew}?No, no, how can Suvendu talk of dynastic politics?. His father and brother are MPs. He was MLA and minister. His younger brother is the chairman of a municipality. it does not suit him to talk of dynastic politics. And Mamata or anybody else from TMC has not said that Abhishek will be chief minister. He is not the CM candidate. So you are building up a mythical opposition to Abhishek.Is there resentment among party insiders against Prashant Kishor and his style of working?Prashant Kishor doesn’t decide anything, he advises strategy. He is doing a good job and suggesting good programmes to the party. BJP has gone from a handful of seats to 18 in the Lok Sabha from Bengal and now Prashant Kishor says that it won’t cross double figures. Isn’t that by itself a huge jump and how is TMC countering that?By being active. TMC is not sitting idle and we have reached out to people. I will hold a meeting in Suvendu’s hometown tomorrow {Wednesday} and Mamata is travelling and attracting huge crowds. We can’t sit idle in our offices and pontificate, we have to go to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-if-you-are-with-bjp-you-lose-saugata-roy/story-rq7L3Z5SYQwU9eVMPtHu5H.html
23-12-2020||India||Most cities in northwest India record ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ air||Most cities and towns in northwest India recorded "very poor" to "severe" air quality on Wednesday due to a drop in wind speed which has slowed the dispersion of pollutants.The air quality index (AQI) of Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Meerut, Noida is in "severe" category with a reading of above 400.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi under ministry of earth sciences (MoES), “Surface winds are likely to remain light and ventilation will be poor resulting in deterioration in air quality.” The ventilation index on Wednesday is likely to be only 2,500 m2/s on Wednesday and 3,000 m2/s on Thursday. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.Also Read: Delhi’s air quality continues to be ‘severe’There was respite from the biting cold for a couple of days but minimum temperatures are again likely to fall by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius over northwest India and central India during the next three days.India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its bulletin said "cold wave" conditions are likely to set in over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh on December 22 with "cold wave to severe cold wave" conditions predicted over the same region on December 23 and 24."Cold wave to severe cold wave" conditions are also likely over some pockets of Odisha, east Uttar Pradesh, Gangetic West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Telangana on December 22 and 23; over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 22."Cold day" conditions are likely over some pockets of Bihar during the next three days and over east Uttar Pradesh during the next two days. Moderate to dense fog is likely in the morning hours at isolated pockets over Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on December 23, and dense to very dense fog in the morning hours at isolated pockets over the same region during December 24 to 26.Dense fog is also likely over northern parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam and Meghalaya during the next three days and over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next two days. Ground frost conditions are very likely over some pockets of Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab during the next three days and over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, East Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during the next two days.“The cloud cover has moved away and the western disturbance has also passed. There are clear skies now so there will be radiational cooling. The minimum temperature is likely to be around 4 degrees Celsius in Delhi for the next two days. A mild western disturbance will affect the western Himalayas around December 24 but will have no impact in the plains. Another WD around December 26 is likely to bring light rain to Delhi on December 27. We are also expecting moderate to dense fog in Delhi and other parts of N-W India for next two days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The minimum temperature in Delhi on Tuesday was 5.3 degrees Celsius, three degree below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northwest-central-india-records-very-poor-to-severe-air/story-pbsTLcEn6vO6b1sNCZHX2O.html
23-12-2020||India||May even approach Rahul Gandhi for Ram temple donation: VHP||Donations would be sought from every Hindu in the country for construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya and even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi may be approached for the same, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai, said on Tuesday. Rai, who is also the vice-president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), said the campaign to collect funds would commence from Makar Sankranti (January 14) next year and continue till Maghi Purnima (February 27). “Extensive preparations are being made for undertaking the world’s largest non-governmental and public participatory campaign for collecting funds. Donations will be taken from every Hindu in the country. In 16,000 villages of Kashi region, workers will visit every house,” he said while talking to reporters at Prayagraj. When asked if donations will also be taken from Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi, Rai said: “We have not fixed any boundary lines and we will go to everyone and workers could even approach him.” Showing cheques of donation, he said donations of Rs 2 lakh have been given by followers of other religions also, so there were no limitations. He said residents in 16,000 villages of Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Robertsganj, Pratapgarh, Varanasi, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Amethi, Kaushambi and Sultanpur of Kashi kshetra will be approached for donations during this campaign. Donors can purchase coupons valuing Rs 10, 100 and 1000 bearing pictures of the proposed Ram temple and even government workers can personally offer donations, however, government’s money will not be taken in this fund collection initiative in any way, said Rai. He added that receipts will be given to those who donate more than Rs 1000. For the fund collection campaign, teams of three workers each are being formed, he added.

He also claimed that ‘taadi’ has immunity power and a drop of it is purer than the water of the Ganga river.  Addressing a party programme in Rasra area of the district on Monday, Rajbhar said, “If people consume ‘taadi’ in huge quantities, then they will not get infected by Covid-19. In the Rajbhar community, the upbringing of children is done by making them drink ‘taadi’,” he said, citing no medical evidence.Hitting out at former Uttar Pradesh Cabinet minister and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, he said, “Some people are trying to realise their vested interests by misleading people of the Rajbhar community. One should stay alert of these people. People of the community have got respect in the BSP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consuming-farm-liqour-taadi-can-prevent-from-catching-covid-19-bsp-s-up-unit-chief/story-3CeITVQ2AKksnf9vyY5zfL.html
23-12-2020||India||New Covid strain not detected in samples tested in India, says ICMR-NARI director||Mutant strain of coronavirus found in the United Kingdom was not seen in the samples tested from various parts of India, Dr Samiran Panda, director of ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) said on Tuesday. Speaking to ANI, Dr Panda said, “We have tested samples collected from the various parts of the country and haven’t seen the mutant strain found in the UK. We shouldn’t think that this will definitely come to India.”“The transmission and severity of the disease are not known. This particular finding needs to be seen in scientific light and also in the right perspective. We need to be watchful as Covid-19 is a new phenomenon and was unknown to the immune system. The virus changes under immunological pressure for survival and due to proliferation as well,” he explained.Dr Panda said that whether the new strain of the virus will cause a serious public health threat is unclear as of now. “We are keeping tracking of the viral genome that is circulating within the country. Over the last six-seven months, the viral genome studies that have taken place involving over 2,000 samples that have not identified this mutation.”He said that India is not a country where all the states are behaving homogeneously. Some of the states are witnessing an upsurge of infection. Behavioural intervention which are the key prevention measures for breaking the chain of virus transmission should be strengthened, irrespective of the new mutant coming to India or not.Panda said that seven-eleven sub-types of coronavirus are already known but not each one that is identified needs to be seen with panic.“It is time for us to remain watchful but not to panic. We need to keep a track of human being infected. Many are asymptomatic but those symptomatic, are they recovering well and continue to recover? The fatality rate is remaining low? If all the clinical indications like the severity of the disease, fatality rate are remaining low, we don’t need to panic at all but we need to be watchful that the scientists are coming across,” he told ANI.Any vaccine against virus works by stimulating the immune response against different components of the virus. It is premature to think that the efforts to develop a vaccine is going to fall apart. There isn’t enough scientific evidence to say that the vaccine is going to fail, he said.“We are having our surveillance. There have been a large number of the sample tested and we haven’t seen mutants. But this does not mean that we can let our guards down, it will be disastrous,” Dr Panda concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-strain-not-detected-in-samples-tested-in-india-says-icmr-nari-director/story-plBZ4r0kLidDEHnP9v4BSM.html
23-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest day 28: Decision on further talks with Centre today, Kisan Diwas to be observed through fast, agitation, gherao||On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address some farmers virtually, which will coincide with the 30th day of the ongoing protest Dilli Chalo by the farmers, started from November 26. Before that, a decision on the next round of talks with the Centre is likely as the Centre has already invited them and now it’s on the protesters to fix a date. On Wednesday, on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, farmers will skip a meal protesting against the three agriculture laws, recently passed by Parliament.Here are the latest updates of farmers’ protest:1. About 32 farmer union leaders will meet on Wednesday to decide the next course of action — pertaining to further talks with the government. The Union agriculture minister on Sunday wrote a letter to the leaders and asked them to fix a convenient date for the next round of talks. The leaders met on Tuesday but the date will be finalised today.2. On the occasion of Kisan Diwas 2020, which is observed on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, farmers are all set to intensify their protests. Farmers will skip lunch as a symbolic protest to the three farm laws. The Congress will hold a statewide protest across Uttar Pradesh.3. The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and its associate unions said they will observe December 23 as “Skip Lunch” day to express solidarity with the farmers.4. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday met a few farmers’ groups from Delhi and Haryana who are supporting the news laws.5. Farmers camping at UP Gate on Delhi-Ghaziabad border on Tuesday blocked all 14 lanes of the National Highway 9 for eight hours.6. From December 25 to 27, farmers will halt toll collection in Haryana. Farmers have also decided to band plates during PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat on December 27.7. Kerala state government called a special assembly session on Wednesday to discuss and pass a resolution against the farm laws. But governor Arif Mohammed Khan did not give approval for the session. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was “regrettable”.8. The protesting farmers are strengthening their presence on social media. A social media cell of the farmers’ collective has been set up, headed by Majha Kisan Committee vice president Baljeet Singh Sandhu, which will host a webinar on Thursday where senior farmers’ leaders will address all queries. The zoom webinar will be open for 10,000 people. 9. Seeking President Ram Nath Kovind’s intervention for withdrawal of the three farm laws, the Congress said a memorandum signed by two crore farmers would be handed over to him on December 24 by a party delegation, led by Rahul Gandhi.10. Harpreet Singh, a farmer from Punjab, objected to Punjab BJP using his photo on its Facebook page to accompany a post which says minimum support price will continue. Harpreet said he is sitting with the protesters at Singhu border and his photo was used without his permission.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-day-28-decision-on-further-talks-with-centre-today-kisan-diwas-to-be-observed-through-fast-agitation-gherao/story-34o2nFAydNFNvvHRwVfijP.html
23-12-2020||India||Air Quality Commission directs switching over of all industries in Delhi to PNG||The Commission of Air Quality Management on Tuesday stressed the need to switching over of all industries in Delhi NCR to Piped Natural Gas (PNG) while adding that the industrial sector is one of the major contributors to air pollution here.The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas reviewed the progress of switching over of industries operating in Delhi to PNG during a meeting, which was attended by representatives of the city government, the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and the Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL).According to the statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, about 1,644 of industrial units spread across 50 industrial areas here had been identified to switch over to PNG. Though a sizable number of industries are using PNG, the Commission stressed the need to switch over to PNG by all identified industries in Delhi. The IGL, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the Delhi government were also asked to work in close coordination with the industrial units so as to target the completion of infrastructure work and switch over to PNG by January 31, 2021. DPCC was also directed to inspect and identify the industries using unapproved fuels and to take stringent penal action in case of non-compliance, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-commission-directs-switching-over-of-all-industries-in-delhi-to-png/story-ZRbxSeiLjchLGrBhKmdtKK.html
23-12-2020||India||Serum Institute submits more data for emergency use licence||The Serum Institute of India (SII), which is manufacturing and testing the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in India, has submitted new data to regulators for its application for an emergency use licence, officials aware of the process said on Tuesday, adding that a meeting will now be called this week to assess the information.The meeting will also review data for the vaccine candidate by Pfizer, which too applied for emergency approval but sought more time when the last meeting was held on December 9. The applications are being assessed by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)’s Subject Expert Committee (SEC), which had sought more data from SII in its last meeting on December 9, and gave Pfizer time till it was ready.“The company (SII) yesterday (Monday) submitted the additional data that was asked by the subject experts. They have submitted both preliminary data from the trials in India, and the updated UK immunogenicity data. Pfizer is also ready with its data and has sought for a fresh date,” said a senior government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be named.Earlier in the day, Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, confirmed that one of the companies got back with the additional data but did not name SII. Experts at CDSCO are currently reviewing the data before they convene the meeting of SEC. A similar review is also underway at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. It is the trial in the UK and Brazil from where Oxford-AstraZeneca determined the vaccine may be 62%-90% effective. During the last meeting, SEC indicated it may wait till MHRA’s assessment was complete and it had decided on whether to clear the vaccine in UK before the data presented by SII was reviewed. The official quoted above said that may not necessarily need to be. “Since both the regulators have the data, it is now a matter of who will review it first. There is always a possibility that India regulator may grant the necessary approvals if it is satisfied with the data that has been submitted,” the official said. While SII did not comment, a source close to the company confirmed they had submitted all the relevant data. In addition, Bharat Biotech also sought an approval. The SEC asked the company to present efficacy data, which is likely to take longer to derive since its late stage trials began in mid-November. Bharat Biotech is yet to reply, the person quoted above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-submits-more-data-for-emergency-use-licence/story-b4at1OnzLo3RVzHmT76NkK.html
23-12-2020||India||Amid rumblings in Congress, dissenters stress on need for hands-on chief||When seven of the 23 senior Congress politicians who called for a sweeping organisational overhaul in August met party president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday, they offered several suggestions to revive the 135-year-old political party. Key among the suggestions was the role of the president who, they said, should be hands-on and lead from the front.Termed an icebreaker, this was the first in-person interaction amid the Covid-19 pandemic between representatives of the group of dissenters and Sonia Gandhi and other party leaders. Hindustan Times spoke to several of the 20-odd attendees on the kind of changes the group wanted in the party. Individual members of the group who spoke by turn put forward their views as did and some other attendees such as former finance minister P Chidambaram. Many of the changes suggested in the All India Congress Committee (AICC) were put forward by Chidambaram, who didn’t reply to queries from HT. “There should be people who sit in the office daily and be available for meetings and not the kind of ghost town that it (Congress headquarters) is now,’’ one of the group of seven dissenters who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity. “We wanted a President to work within a revived intra-party institution.’’Uncertainty over leadership has weakened the Congress and demoralised its workers, the controversial letter written by 23 leaders to Sonia Gandhi on August 7 said, warning the high command of the erosion of its support base with the desertion of functionaries across states, and calling for an overhaul of the party organisation and a “visible” leadership.The letter also sought introspection of the reasons behind the party’s “steady decline,” and appealed to the Congress leadership to take the initiative for the formation of a “national coalition of democratic and secular forces” against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Of the 23 signatories to the letter, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, his deputy in the House Anand Sharma, former union ministers Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor, former chief ministers of Haryana and Maharashtra Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan and the head of the party’s legal department Vivek Tankha attended the meeting. The institutions that the letter writers referred to at Saturday’s party meeting were both existing ones and some new ones they want created. For instance, they suggested the appointment of one, two or even more working presidents who would help the party president function more effectively. This proposal has done the rounds for years now especially around the time Rahul Gandhi was to take over as party president, which he did in December 2017, only to give up the post in May 2019 after the Congress’s debacle in the general elections, paving the ground for Sonia Gandhi to become interim party chief. The concept of a working president has been revived with greater vigour since then.The only precedent of a working president in the Congress dates back to the Rajiv Gadhi era. Because he was Prime Minister and also the Congress president, he chose veteran Kamalapati Tripathi as working president and Arjun Singh became party vice-president.“The idea is to have a more consultative management of the party,’’ said another key leader. To this end, the letter writers also suggested that the Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs be empowered to do more. They pointed out that at the moment, PCC chiefs were reporting to general secretaries who were “de facto kings.’The letter writers, especially Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, also proposed restarting the Parliamentary board of the Party. This is a body that still finds mention in Article 25 , clause A of the party’s constitution. The clause says the body will be headed by the party president and will have nine other members, one of whom will be the leader of the party in Parliament.“People confuse the function of the board. The constitution says that its purpose is to regulate and coordinate the parliamentary activities of Congress’ legislatures,’’ said the second leader cited above. The August letter writers suggested that the Parliamentary board meet regularly so that it can take a coordinated view of current issues. When this was suggested, however, Sonia Gandhi pointed out that the body had been scrapped by PV Narasimha Rao when he was party president in 1992. Party insiders said Rao’s was a nuanced move.”`During the plenary session at Tirupati (in 1992), Arjun Singh, Jitendra Prasad and others formed a syndicate and won elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC). Since they would now have a say over the members of the Parliamentary board, Rao said that there wasn’t a point in having a board . A day later, they were made to issue a resolution that empowered the Congress president (Rao) to reconstitute all bodies,” one old-time Congressman said.Finally, a suggestion was made to hold elections to choose members of the CWC, the highest decision making body of the party. The last time elections took place to the CWC were under Sitaram Kesri in 1997. In the last plenary session of the Congress, Ghulam Nabi Azad moved a resolution that junked elections to the CWC in favour of members’ nomination by the Congress president. The CWC’s term expires in 2022 and the letter writers want the a switch-back to the system of elections by then.One of the changes suggested at Saturday’s meeting was immediately accepted. Former minister Manish Tiwari proposed “chintan shivirs”, or introspection meetings; its acceptance was announced by the Congress’s Pawan Bansal. Tiwari didn’t respond to queries from HT. Now the letter writers are waiting for the party to move on their other suggestions. They include one for the party to articulate a clear ideological view. For instance, HIndustan Times learns, Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor said he didn’t agree with the soft Hindutva approach being espoused by some party members in the north. Some of the August letter writers are optimistic that the leadership will accept their proposals for reform, but others are sceptical. “They are just going through the motions. Why else would they have a press conference a day before to announce 99% want Rahul Gandhi to return,’’ said one of signatories, requesting anonymity.Another signatory said he and other signatories didn’t have any problem with Rahul Gandhi becoming the Congress president through an election process. He warned that he and the others would resist any move to “impose a proxy” on the party. There are others among the dissenters who feel that the Gandhis did make an attempt at rapprochement .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rumblings-in-congress-dissenters-stress-on-need-for-hands-on-chief/story-VrLkHsIM7JgtNS1zhXPnJO.html
23-12-2020||India||Delhiwale: What lies beneath...||Nothing here but silence. And the two graves at the centre. This is the windowless crypt of Rahim’s tomb, in central Delhi’s Nizamuddin East. What the visitors see up there in the breezy principal tomb chamber, directly under the gumbad (dome), are the empty gravestones, the cenotaphs. But here in the underground lie the original graves of Mughal-era poet and nobleman Rahim, and of Mah Banu, his wife, in whose memory the building was conceived. The 16th century mausoleum was undergoing years-long restoration, led by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, that finished last week. Truth be told, the building has always been cloaked in melancholic beauty. But it was in a derelict state. The interiors were dark, musty, and smelt of bat shit.Now, decades of grime have been removed to uncover the original surface of the monument’s walls. The patterns have been reclaimed, the authentic designs cleaned up, or restored where they were found missing. Geometric patterns, symbols and religious calligraphy are again visible. The ceiling in the cenotaph is showing a clear view of its floral patterns.You will cherish all this delicate artistry but unfortunately, you won’t be able to experience the underground crypt. This part of the mausoleum isn’t accessible to visitors, though this reporter did manage an exclusive access.This evening... oh well, it doesn’t seem like evening in the vault, or like any other time of the day really. In this world of the permanently dead, there seems to be no connection to the outside. The place would be terrifying in the darkness but the lighting—two lamps currently on—has turned the whole chamber into an arresting work of minimalism.The lamps have lit up parts of the walls, leaving out some parts in patterns of darkness. Until some years ago this crypt was a network of cracks, discloses Rajpal Singh, chief engineer, Aga Khan Trust for Culture. “Our work started here with underpinning foundations and stitching the cracks—some over a foot wide.” The crypt has a passage, the so-called parikrama, turning around the graves. Walking along it is like wading through spaces dappled in sudden eclipses and auroras. Niches scooped into the walls appear to be shadows within shadows. In some places, the blurry line on the floor separating light from darkness flickers like a time zone limit, gradually drawing day and night apart, as it sometimes can be seen from airplane windows.But the couple’s graves are entirely soaked in light. Up there, in the main tomb chamber, as you’ll Instagram in real time the stunning walls and splendid dome, remember that a much sparse but equally haunting exquisiteness exists directly underneath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-what-lies-beneath/story-Dupw76tZMNBR84XiMOf4KP.html
23-12-2020||India||NIA probing Khalistani funding for protests against India overseas||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case to investigate alleged funding of Khalistani terrorist groups abroad for organising on-ground campaigns, and demonstrations outside Indian missions in the UK, the US, Canada, Germany and other countries, people familiar with the development said.According to the case registered last week, Khalistani elements based in India are also receiving funds through non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the people added, requesting anonymity.The agency has named as accused US-based Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, UK- based Paramjit Singh Pamma and Canada resident Hardeep Singh Nijjar who, under the banner of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), are collecting funds for a rebellion against the Indian government, according to the first information report (FIR).NIA has, for the first time, given the addresses of the three: Pannun (167-05, Powel Boulevard, Unit-22 White Stone, New York), Pamma (41, Bowden Road, Smethwick, UK) and Nijjar (8193, 143-A Street, Surrey BC, Canada and 1418, 142 Street, 72 Avenue, BC Canada).The people familiar with the development cited above said the fresh FIR will empower NIA to investigate SFJ’s activities in various countries. If required, an NIA team may even visit these countries soon to probe the source of funding of the Khalistani groups.This is NIA’s second FIR for conducting an investigation abroad after an amendment to the NIA Act last year that empowered the agency to probe terror activities against Indians and Indian interests overseas. Earlier this year, the agency filed a case to investigate a terror attack on a gurdwara in Kabul on March 25 in which 27 Sikh devotees, including an Indian, were killed.According to the latest FIR, “as part of the conspiracy, huge funds are being collected abroad for on-ground campaign and propaganda against government of India including staging demonstrations outside Indian missions in the US, the UK, Germany, Canada and so forth. These campaigns are being spearheaded by designated terrorists Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Paramjit Singh Pamma, Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others”. HT has reviewed a copy of the FIR.“It has also been learnt that large amounts so collected are being sent through NGOs to pro-Khalistani elements in India, to undertake terrorist acts and to strike terror in the people of India,” the FIR said. It added: “SFJ leadership has planned large scale disruptive activities to damage government and private property and also disrupt supplies and essential services to the life of community of India”.For this, the agency said, SFJ and other pro-Khalistani elements, through an incessant social media campaign and otherwise, are radicalising and recruiting impressionable young people to campaign for and carry out terrorist acts for the creation of a separate nation of Khalistan.Earlier this month, the central agency filed a charge-sheet against Pannun, Nijjar and Pamma along with 13 others in a separate 2019 case to investigate SFJ’s role in India.SFJ has been banned by the ministry of home affairs (MHA;) properties of Pannun, Nijjar and Pamma in India have been ordered to be seized.Intelligence agencies have alerted the government that Pakistan is actively supporting their activities and providing them funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probing-khalistani-funding-for-protests-against-india-overseas/story-jWvN7ynH1iUBg6C9JEBQYI.html
23-12-2020||India||Delhi suffered most loss due to air pollution: Study||Among Indian states, Delhi suffered the highest per-capita economic loss because of premature deaths and illnesses caused by air pollution last year, followed by Haryana, according to a study published on Tuesday by the science journal The Lancet, which highlighted the price being extracted from the nation by bad air.The study said India was bearing massive losses to its economy and productivity because of the health impact of air pollution. National GDP suffered a loss of 1.36% because of air pollution last year, it said. In comparison, the total health expenditure in India is only 3.8% of GDP. In 2019, 1.67 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of the total deaths.Delhi’s per-capita state gross domestic product (GDP) loss in 2019 was to the tune of $62 and neighbouring Haryana suffered a per capita GDP loss of $53.8, said the report titled “Health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2019”. The highest loss to overall state GDP was recorded by Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populated state, at 2.15% followed by Bihar at 1.95% and Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan at 1.7% each. These are states with a relatively low per-capita state GDP.GDP per capita measures the sum of marketed goods and services produced within a territory, averaged across everyone who lives within it.Delhi has ranked consistently among the world’s most populated cities in global surveys in recent years because of emissions from automobiles and power plants, as well as construction dust and cooking with solid fuels. The problem worsens during the winter months, when the capital gets shrouded by thick, smoky haze because of post-harvest farm fires lit by cultivators in states such as Punjab and Haryana to clear their fields of stubble. The Capital suffered an overall economic loss to the tune of 1.08% of state GDP last year because of both outdoor and indoor pollution and around 1.06% for outdoor pollution alone. The comparative figures of loss due to outdoor air pollution for UP and Punjab are 1.34% and 1.22%, respectively.Between 1990 and 2019, the death rate per 100,000 population has increased by 115.3% in India because of exposure to high outdoor air pollution. The death rate because of exposure to household air pollution has decreased by 64.2%because of a decline in the use of solid fuels. The death rate due to exposure to ground level ozone increased by 115% during the 29-year period.It estimated that economic loss caused by premature deaths due to air pollution in India last year was $28.8 billion and from morbidity due to air pollution was $8 billion. Of the total economic loss of $36.8 billion, 36.6% was from lung diseases, which included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (21.1%), lower respiratory infections (14.2%), and lung cancer (1.2%), The rest was from ischaemic heart disease (24.9%), stroke (14.1%), diabetes (8.4%), neonatal disorders (13.3%), and cataract (2.7%).“The most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) globally is tobacco smoking; more than 90% of COPD cases are liked to smoking. But in India one of the main causes of COPD is air pollution, particularly indoor air pollution,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. “PM 2.5 emissions can go up to 30,000 micrograms per cubic metres when food is being cooked with solid fuels in a closed kitchen.”“When it comes to the health impacts of outdoor pollution, it is important to understand what are the pollution particles made of – it being emitted from burning of rubber, kerosene or diesel etc. For example, diesel emissions are carcinogenic because they consist of polyaromatic hydrocarbons which have a role in development of lung cancer. A majority of deaths caused by air pollution is due to COPD,” he added.The economic impact of air pollution was estimated by the authors based on output per worker. The output per worker in each state in 2019 was calculated as the labour share of GDP multiplied by GDP in 2018-19, divided by the number of people who were employed.“Air pollution has the potential to impede accumulation of future human capital by reducing children’s survival, undermining their health, and reducing their ability to benefit from education. The cost savings resulting from the prevention of productivity losses attributable to air pollution would contribute to the formation of new human capital,” the study said. It cited the example of the US where every dollar invested in the control of air pollution since 1970 is estimated to have yielded an economic benefit of $30. “The economic impact of this health loss due to lost productivity is huge at 1.4% of the country’s GDP in 2019, besides a roughly estimated expenditure of 0.4% of GDP on treatment of air pollution related diseases. The health and economic impact of air pollution is highest in the less developed states of India, an inequity that should be addressed,” said Prof Lalit Dandona, director of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, national chair of population health at the Indian Council of Medical Research and senior author of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-suffered-most-loss-due-to-air-pollution-study/story-ZNVLIe6GR3o7bhiV7jCbSI.html
23-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The fact that a handful of people who flew into various parts of India from the UK have tested positive for the coronavirus is cause for alarm simply because these infections were discovered the instant India tightened its screening process for inbound fliers. It’s very likely that for the past seven months, ever since India restarted flights to and from other countries through so-called travel bubbles, there has been a steady trickle of infected people into (and also out of) the country. The screening process was tightened following panic over the new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus identified in the UK (as far back as September, although it is only in recent weeks that it has hit the headlines after becoming the dominant strain in the country, and causing a surge in infections). UK officials have said the new strain is 70% more contagious (or infective) than the old one. They also say that in many parts of the country, it has become the dominant strain. That would mean at least some of the people identified as Covid-positive in Monday’s screening at airports could potentially be carrying the new strain.Indian health officials insisted at a briefing on Tuesday that the new strain hasn’t been spotted in India, but this is one of those statements that is economical with the truth. The reality is that India does not sequence enough viral genomes for this to be said with any amount of certainty, but in all the briefings (and it’s usually by the same worthies who are in charge of India’s Covid response) I’ve listened in on, I have never heard the terms “we don’t know” or “we can’t say for sure” ever being used. Indeed, what they lack in knowledge, these people usually make up for with certitude. The correct answer, for instance, to a query on whether the new strain is in India would be: it hasn’t been identified in our tests, but we do not sequence enough viral genomes to say for sure; we are now increasing the volume of genomes we sequence. That wasn’t so difficult, now, was it? As I wrote in Tuesday’s column (Dispatch 230), given that the new strain has been around since September, and flights have been operating between various airports in the two countries, there is every likelihood that the strain may already be in India – but we do not know for sure.In Tuesday’s column, I wrote about how the UK had caught a lucky break – one of the commonly used RT-PCR tests showed only pieces of two genes in the result, as compared to the three it usually does. One of the new strain’s 17 known mutations was responsible for this. The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction or RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard when it comes to diagnostic tests for Covid. It identifies the viral RNA (ribonucleic acid, the genetic material) by converting it into complementary DNA, which it does using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Then a series of chemical reactions are used to amplify the complementary DNA sections. The quantum of viral DNA is then measured using fluorescent markers. The test in question in the UK was calibrated to check for three different RNA targets – and because of the mutation, it found only two. Ergo, the country didn’t really have to keep sequencing viral genomes to figure out whether the infection was caused by the new strain – if a test showed only pieces of two genes in the result, it indicated the virus was the new strain.Apart from aggressively sequencing more viral genomes, India would do well to collect more information – for instance, every RT-PCR test also measures viral loads – from the molecular tests it conducts (the rapid antigen tests, apart from being unreliable, aren’t of much use in this context) rather than simply treating the output as a binary yes/no. Indeed, had a system to do this been in place, health officials here might have been in a better position to answer the original question: is the new strain in India?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-r40I7sSla5s3NpVGX2CG0K.html
23-12-2020||India||Strain infectious, but not more lethal: Govt||The new variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible but does not appear to lead to higher mortality or hospitalisation and is unlikely to make the current class of vaccines ineffective, top Indian government officials said on Tuesday, citing the information available till now on a mutation that was first spotted in the UK and has since triggered a global alarm. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said India has stepped up genomic surveillance in order to detect if anyone has the new mutation in the country, with a particular focus on people who arrived from Britain in the past month. At least 21 people in five cities, including five at Delhi airport, tested positive for Covid-19 after landing from the UK on Tuesday. Their samples will now be sent for genomic sequencing. To be sure, information is still being gleaned about the new mutation and any conclusion, either on its effects or its possible resistance to vaccines, cannot be made with any certainty at this stage.“The new strain has 17 changes and one of them, N501Y, is of the area which instructs the spike protein, the part that the viruses uses to enter cells. Because of this, it appears that the strain’s tendency to enter cells is higher... Does this make the disease severe? It does not seem to. Neither does it appear to increase the chances of death or hospitalisation,” Paul said.But, citing data discussions with experts, Paul said the development was worrying and that the government is vigilant since the new variant has a tendency to infect more people. Accordingly, the government will expedite genetic sequencing of all virus samples received at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) laboratories. “Is it a reason for panic? No. Is it something we should be vigilant about? Certainly,” he said, while adding that current evidence also suggests that the vaccines that have been developed and are being tested are unlikely to become obsolete due to these mutations. “All vaccines developed till now will work for this variant too.”The Union government also announced a new set of guidelines to trace and survey people who returned from the UK in the past month, advising states to separately quarantine them at institutional facilities if any of them develop symptoms. All such symptomatic people will be tested and if positive, the samples will be sent to genetic analysis to check for the B.1.1.7, the strain found in the UK.The same genetic sequencing protocol will apply for samples of those who tested positive upon arrival on Tuesday, the last day for flights to and from UK before an embargo comes into force till December 31. In all, 22 people were found with the virus in five cities: eight (including a crew member) in Amritsar, six in Delhi, four in Ahmedabad, three in Kolkata and one in Chennai. According to the protocol, people sitting in the same row and up to three rows in front or behind any of the infected patients will be traced and quarantined with a test 5-10 days later. Experts said that the new variant may already be in India. “The possibility that it hasn’t arrived in India is low,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), which is one of the labs that has been sequencing Sars-CoV-2 genomes. He explained that the virus has been found to be more transmissible but the transmission can happen only if people are not wearing masks. If precautions are not followed, the new variant may lead to super-spreading events, he added. “It is likely that the new variant may have already come to India, you will find it only if you are looking for it. This is the reason why we need to scale up the number of genomic sequencing that we are doing. India has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world and it is likely that some variant like it might have generated within the country too,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. Bhushan also spoke on the infection trends in India during Tuesday’s briefing. “Countries like the US, Brazil, the UK, Russia and Germany are showing new peaks in Covid cases. In comparison, India’s trajectory has shown a sustained decline in Covid-19 cases since mid-September,” he said. Bhushan on Monday wrote to the civil aviation ministry, citing recommendations from the group of experts who reviewed the information released from the UK. Experts from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium on Saturday said the new variant is significant because it now “accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England”, “has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein”, and the mutations “have potential biological effects”. Shortly after, UK PM Boris Johnson said the variant could be up to 70% more transmissible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strain-infectious-but-not-more-lethal-govt/story-H6YBznlHf3QXpHYYOFZ71O.html
23-12-2020||India||Farmers harden stand as suspense lingers over talks||Protesting farm unions have said they will write to British lawmakers and Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to travel to India to take part in Republic Day celebrations next month until the Modi government scraps three pieces of legislation they say will hurt their livelihoods.Uncertainty over resumption of talks between farm unions and the government over three contentious agricultural laws lingered on as farm unions said Tuesday they needed wider consultations on whether to hold negotiations again. “We will make more toll plazas freeways and write to Boris Johnson to defer his India visit as a mark of protest,” Kulwant Singh, a senior farm union leader, said. Farm unions were to decide on a response to a set of written concessions sent out by farm minister Narendra Tomar to end the month-long agitation by farmers against the three pro-reform agricultural laws. The unions have constituted a five-member committee to discuss with representatives of nearly 450 organisations protesting the three farm laws on whether and when to hold talks with the government, a senior farm leader said. On December 20, a senior farm ministry bureaucrat wrote to the unions on behalf of the agriculture minister, urging farmers to resume talks and suggest a date. The concessions offered by the government, which the farmers have rejected, include greater oversight on proposed free markets, sparing farmers penalties for pollution-causing farm fires, an assurance on support prices and allowing farmers access to civil courts to settle disputes. Protesting unions held a meeting on Tuesday. They will meet again on Wednesday at 3pm to arrive at a decision, Darshan Pal, a senior member leading the protests at Delhi’s Singhu Border, said. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a major platform of farm unions, said the government was pushing “farmer leaders to give specific point-by-point critique of the clauses (in farm laws)” although the farmers’ representatives “unanimously concluded and explained on December 3 that the Acts have to be repealed”. “But the government selectively picked issues and is now trying to claim that those are the main issues,” AIKSCC secretary Avik Saha said. Tens of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have hunkered down along Delhi’s borders demanding scrapping of the laws. The changes pushed by the government allow free markets for agricultural trade, permit traders to stockpile farm commodities for future sales and a national law on contract farming. Farmers say easing of restrictions will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. Protests by farmers have continued, with cultivators resorting to a relay hunger strike and chalking out plans to intensify their agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-harden-stand-as-suspense-lingers-over-talks/story-Z3C9xrDTxEyG71WzXaWwZN.html
23-12-2020||India||Farm unions plan ‘global’ protests against new laws||“Anti-capitalists of the world, unite” — a rephrasing of Marx’s iconic slogan “workers of the world, unite” — will reverberate in at least 10 global cities on December 26 in response to a call given by farm unions, who are coordinating plans for a global protest against three agricultural laws pushed by the Narendra Modi government. Farm leaders say there will be no dearth of protesters from the Indian diaspora. A plethora of anti-Walmarters and opposers of big corporations in the US and elsewhere, apart from independent farmers’ organisations, are also ready to respond to their call , they said. Cities where demonstrators have confirmed participation include global financial hubs, New York, Sydney and London. Protests have also been planned in other overseas towns and cities including Leicester in the UK, Sacramento, Calif., Houston, Melbourne and Ontario.The standoff between the Union government and farmers continues over the passage of new legislation to open up the country’s antiquated agricultural sector to private investment, a move the government says will enable farmers better incomes and modernize the farm sector. Farmers say the reforms will leave them at the mercy of private corporations. The Modi government has repeatedly said it is inclined to find a solution through discussions, which ended in a stalemate on December 8.The global protest is part of a five-point agenda drawn up to take the agitation forward, said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, a leader of the agitation. “We had made five big announcements,” he said. “One, on December 21, there will be a relay hunger strike. Two, on 23rd, on Kisan Day, we urge everyone to skip one meal in remembrance of our farmers.” “Three, on 26th and 27th, we will write to National Democratic Alliance’s allies to withdraw support to the laws. Four, on these both days, we have called all Indians abroad to stage demonstrations in front of Indian embassies and consulates. Five, during the next Mann Ki Baat(radio address) of the PM, farmers will bang thalis (utensils),” Yadav said. To be sure, the call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the platform of protesting farm union, is limited to the Indian diaspora only, according to its protest programme. But foreign entities opposed to big corporations are ready to join in. “Big corporations have common global policies that hurt interests of consumers and small growers,” said Anastasia Elliot of Walmart Watch, a Washington-based non-government organisation. “So, anti-capitalists of the world must unite to protect larger interests of society whether in developed or developing countries. We support Indian farmers,” she said over the phone on Monday. A section of the Indian Sikh diaspora has already carried out large protests in Canada, the US, the UK and Australia. Mewa Singh, the head of Non-Resident Indian Council in Punjab’s Ropar, said his office was coordinating with Indians abroad on making the protests global. “My son, a resident of Texas, Houston, will lead the protests there,” he said. Sikhs make up 1.4% of Canada’s population, but their close knit community is an influential voting bloc. “We stand by Punjab’s farmers because that’s who our forefathers were,” said Banda Singh, a resident of Brampton, Ontario. Indians abroad are also sending political petitions to their lawmakers. India recently summoned Canada’s high commissioner to convey its strong displeasure following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s statement that Indian farmers had a right to protest. The Canadian envoy in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, was told clearly that India considers such statements as “unacceptable interference” in the country’s internal affairs and these actions, if they continued, will have a “seriously damaging” impact on the ties. However, the possibilities of the farmers’ protests metamorphosing into a fresh global backlash are distinct. “The Indian government has used disproportionate force on peacefully protesting farmers. We will protest in front of parliament building on December 26,” said Sukhdev Gill, a dairy worker in Australia’s Victoria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-plan-global-protests-against-new-laws/story-bsxa3xkNjAzBDn7BCuVWEJ.html
23-12-2020||India||Bengal BJP leader sends divorce notice to wife who joined TMC||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Saumitra Khan on Tuesday sent a divorce notice to his wife Sujata Mondol Khan, a day after she joined the ruling Trinamool Congress. The legal notice for “mutual divorce under section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955” said that the couple were not in cordial terms and had been living separately for the past six months. The couple could not be contacted for their comments. Meanwhile, the state administration posted four police personnel at Sujata’s house in Bankura district, while three armed police personnel were deployed to give her round-the-clock security. Twists and turns straight out of a Bollywood movie played out on West Bengal’s political stage on Monday, shortly after Sujata joined the TMC. “Sujata, I will send you papers for mutual divorce. Please sign them and do not use Khan, my surname, from today,” an emotionally charged Saumitra said in a press conference on Monday as a family drama involving melodramatic exchanges between him and his wife was aired on live television. Later in the day, Sujata said in an interview to mediapersons: “I married him going against the wish of my family. I love him and will always do so. I still have the red sindoor (vermilion) on my forehead (a sign of a married woman).” “Can a personal relationship end in divorce because of politics? No TMC leader told me that I have to divorce him to join the party,” she added. Saumitra is a former TMC leader who joined the BJP in January 2019. He was the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Bishnupur in Bankura district. He retained the seat by contesting for the BJP and was made president of the state BJYM about three months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-leader-sends-divorce-notice-to-wife-who-joined-tmc/story-fAHcMTlhzOzX2McXVzO7zN.html
23-12-2020||India||Exit deals don’t negate right to compensation: Supreme Court order||A real estate developer cannot deal with homebuyers rights to claim compensation for delays in the completion of their apartments by merely offering refunds or some other exit option, the Supreme Court has ruled. In the order that could strengthen the rights of homebuyers under the Consumer Protection Act, the court has held that the right to claim compensation is independent of schemes offered by developers that give an option to the buyers to rescind their purchase. It also held that the damages to a consumer can be over and above the amount mentioned in the developer-buyer agreement, defined as the contractual rate of compensation for delays. In its order last week, a bench of the apex court headed by justice Dhananjay Y Chandrachud, highlighted that “a genuine flat buyer wants a roof over the head” and therefore, schemes offering them a refund of what they had paid to date would not be sufficient. “For a genuine flat buyer, who has booked an apartment in the project not as an investor or financier, but for the purpose of purchasing a family home, a mere offer of refund would not detract from the entitlement to claim compensation,” held the bench, which also included justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. The developer, said the bench, cannot assert that buyers who continue to be committed to the agreement for purchase of the flat give up their right to adequate compensation. “Mere refund of consideration together with interest would not provide a just recompense to a genuine flat buyer, who desires possession and remains committed to the project. It is for each buyer to either accept the offer of the developer and opt out, or continue with the agreement for purchase of the flat,” it said. The court also addressed another contention regarding the appreciation of the capital value of the flats with the passage of time, stating that this factor could only be one of the considerations while determining the quantum of damages but that it cannot deprive the consumers of a just and fair compensation. The order came as the bench dismissed DLF Home Developers Limited’s appeal against compensation to the flat buyers of the Capital Greens project in Delhi. The developer, through senior advocate Pinaki Misra, challenged the order of the National Consumer Commission, arguing the delay in completion of the apartments was due to certain reasons beyond the control of the developer. Misra added that the developer also offered to its buyers refunds of the amount paid by them, together with interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Representing the home buyers, senior advocate Shyam Divan defended the consumer commission’s order, directing DLF to pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the rate of 7% annually from the promised date of delivery for possession till the date on which the possession is actually offered. Affirming the order in favour of the home buyers, the bench said that “the fact that the developer offered an exit option with interest at 9% would not disentitle the flat purchasers from claiming compensation.” The other argument by DLF, with respect to unmanageable circumstances, was also rejected with the court noting that if fatal accidents at the site stalled the work while it was found that accidents took place due to a developer’s laxity in adhering to safety norms, the flat buyers cannot be made to suffer. “The flat buyers had to suffer on account of a substantial delay on the part of the appellants. In such a situation, they cannot be constrained to the compensation of Rs 10 per square foot, provided by the agreements for flat purchase,” clarified the court, commenting on the contractual rate. However, in accordance with a previous ruling on the rate of interest, the bench ordered that the compensation on account of delay will be 6% per annum instead of 7%.“We welcome the order of the Supreme Court because it will empower the thousands of homebuyers who have been suffering for a long time at the hands of the developers, who have delayed their projects for many years, and still denying justified compensation with refund of the investment. But we hope that this order will be implemented at the ground by the authorities to safeguard the rights of the homebuyers,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association. “We will look into this order in detail and then figure out as to how it will impact the real estate sector ahead. But any order that gives power to the consumer helps the sector as it restores the faith of the homebuyer...So we hope this order will positively impact the realty sector,” said Subodh Goyal, secretary of the western Uttar Pradesh chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exit-deals-don-t-negate-right-to-compensation-sc-order/story-H88vC7xRTSBsqiPOfcvyDL.html
23-12-2020||India||Love or ‘jihad’? A consent dilemma||He was a factory supervisor looking for a leg-up in his career. She was finishing her final year in school. They met at a tuition centre in the dusty central Uttar Pradesh town of Shahjahanpur. It was the spring of 2017. He sat on the bench behind her; during a break between classes to prepare for competitive examinations, he asked her a question, she turned back to respond, and they started talking. In April that year, the tuition batches were shuffled and she missed classes for five days, When she came back, he walked to the head of the class, said hello and asked for her phone number. She was taken aback for a moment, but wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to him. On April 20, they spent all night on the phone talking; at sunrise, he asked her if she would date him – in local parlance, proposed to her. She said yes. “In a few months, he knew what I wanted, how I felt, without me saying anything,” she added. Mohammad Shamim and Simran Sagar’s love story could have ended there. But in June, her parents caught her talking to him on the phone. Alarmed by the fact that he was Muslim, they confiscated her phone and quickly started looking for a suitable groom. Weeks later, she rejected the match they found. She had graduated high school by then and started a job, but her parents forced her to quit. “They locked me up in a room, refused to get me go out. For six months, I had no contact with the outside world.” During this time, her parents beat her almost every day. Eventually, she tricked her parents into letting her out, found a spare phone in the house and called Shamim. Over the next year, they plotted the future of their relationship – Shamim brought his family on board and the couple turned their attention to convincing her parents: He moved to Delhi to get a better job and salary, she obeyed her family’s every order to soften them up. By this year, they were feeling confident they would get married, but a new law against forced conversions by marriage, coercion or enticement put a spanner in their plans. “The atmosphere in Shahjahanpur became very bad. There were right-wing people in our locality opposed to interfaith relationships, they could do anything. Any whiff of our plans was enough for a first information report,” said Shamim. “My family was connected to lawyers and our house is 500m from the [police] station, so I was worried that if they found out about Shamim, they would take him to police,” said Sagar. “We heard of so many cases. It was clear to us that we had to leave UP,” she added.The concept of Love Jihad The law they’re referring to is the month-old UP Prohibition Of Unlawful Conversion Of Religion Ordinance 2020 that spells out punishment of up to 10 years in jail for conversion by marriage. The law was in line with a promise made by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stamp out “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, but one that the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise.  Shamim and Sagar had no plans to convert – he thinks a person’s faith is their biggest treasure – but they feared that if they applied for a marriage licence at home, then her parents and right-wing groups would file a case against them.Under the 1954 Special Marriage Act (SMA), a couple has to wait 30 days from the date of filing an application and in Uttar Pradesh, notices go to the houses of the applicants, followed by police verification. “We never wanted to run away, but realised it was too dangerous. We could be jailed, I could be beaten up. We had to run away to Delhi,” said Sagar. The new law has galvanised Hindu activists and many leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who say the ordinance was required to stop forced conversions and point out that eight other states already have anti-conversion statutes on their books. Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, both ruled by BJP, are bringing similar laws. But the law has also riled activists and opposition parties, who say it is unconstitutional because it practically outlaws interfaith relationships and bolsters “love jihad”. Judicial challenges to the law are pending before the Allahabad high court and the Supreme Court. Drafted by the UP law commission, the new ordinance is sweeping in its remit of conversions. Conversions using force, coercion, allurement, deceit and fraud are made non-bailable and cognisable offences, which means a police officer can arrest a suspect without a warrant and start an investigation without the permission of a court. Allurement can mean anything ranging from the offer of a gift or money to free education, employment, even the promise of a better lifestyle. Threatening divine displeasure is also outlawed. Complaints can be filed by a blood relation, in-law or adopted relative of a person undergoing the conversion. Anyone deemed to have helped in conversion can be booked.Burden of proof The ordinance provides for imprisonment of between one and five years and a penalty of not less than Rs 15,000. In cases where a minor girl or a woman from the scheduled caste or scheduled tribe communities is involved, the imprisonment ranges from three years to 10 years and a penalty of at least Rs 25,000. The law provides for voiding a marriage if it is found to be solemnised primarily to convert a woman. The burden of proof will be on the defendants. There are two other curious provisions: One, that if anyone “reconverts” to their immediate previous faith, it is not deemed to be a conversion. And, for repeat offenders, the quantum of punishment is doubled. The law mandates a two-step verification process. If a person wants to change their faith, they will have to apply to the district magistrate two months in advance. This is double the period stipulated in the 1954 Special Marriage Act. The forms for these affidavits are meticulous – one has to provide name, both parents’ names, permanent address, current address down to the house and ward number, age, sex, occupation, marital status, monthly income, dependents, caste status, the faith one is converting to and details of the person performing the conversion. Once a magistrate receives this application, a police inquiry will be ordered to check the “real intention, purpose and cause” of conversion. In the second step, the applicant needs to send a separate affidavit to the magistrate within 60 days of the conversion. The magistrate will then display a notice for 21 days to invite objections, after which the conversion can be confirmed. The government is clear that the law was needed to protect women from harassment and fraudulent men. AN Mittal, chairman of the committee that drafted the law, said experts studied the law in south Asian countries, and rulings of the top court and high courts and existing laws. “It will be very effective in checking such conversions and harassment of women. A victim woman or her family can now fearlessly go to the police,” Mittal said.FIRs and arrests Since November 28, at least 25 people have been arrested under 11 different FIRs lodged across nine districts. Mohammad Asif almost became the 26th. The 24-year-old man worked at a medical store in the low-income neighbourhood of Duda colony on the outer fringes of Lucknow. Two years ago, Raina Gupta, the 21-year-old daughter of a driver and a domestic help, moved to the area and love quickly blossomed between the neighbours, whose houses were barely 15m away. The families agreed, and decided to solemnise the marriage on December 2. Between them, they spent Rs 85,000 to deck their exposed brick, half-finished houses with streamers and lights. “The groom was following each and every ritual done in Hindu marriages, like tying turmeric bud on the wrists. The bride’s family had made arrangements for the wedding feast,” said a family friend on condition of anonymity. “Everything was going well until the policemen came.” Around 8pm, police barged into the wedding, tipped off by local right-wing activists. Despite being told that both families had consented, the police dragged them to the police station, and told them to register their marriage under the norms of the new law. The families were let go after the couple assured the police that no one was converting their faith. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), South, Suresh Chandra Rawat defended the police action. “The police didn’t intervene in anybody’s personal affair, but the two families were suggested to proceed according to the new law to avoid any inconvenience in the future,” he said. It was the police’s duty to enquire that there was no forced or dishonest religious conversion, and once the couple applies at the district magistrate’s office, a proper verification will be done of both families, he added. But the incident has taken its toll on the families, who have withdrawn from all social interaction and are suspicious of every visitor. The couple still hasn’t applied for a licence under the Special Marriage Act and are reluctant to proceed without consulting lawyers. “They haven’t dared to apply fearing police action and trouble from Hindu outfits,” said the man quoted above. “They aren’t even stepping out of home.” The right-wing argumentProponents of the new law point towards the biggest case registered under the ordinance as proof that strict provisions are needed. On November 30 in the far-flung eastern UP district of Mau, police booked 14 Muslim men from West Bengal under the new law on a complaint by a local businessman that his 30-year-old daughter was abducted to convert her faith. The father alleged that Shabab Khan lured the woman, whose name was withheld by the police, a day before her marriage. Khan worked as a driver in the house, and was married, the father added. “He was part of a gang which lures innocent Hindu girls, exploit them physically and mentally, and then force them to convert,” he said. A local resident said Khan was dismissed from his job by the father days before he started looking for matches for his daughter, and that the woman was in a relationship with Khan. Along with Khan, his wife, and 13 relatives and friends have been booked – five were arrested last week. But activists point out that the couple could have eloped to escape the marriage that the father had planned, and that there was no proof of abduction, or that the woman didn’t consent to the relationship. That shouldn’t matter, believes Baldev, a right-wing activist in Bijnor district who only gave his first name. The 22-year-old man is unemployed, but spends his days scouring neighbourhoods for interfaith lovers, specifically Muslim men accompanying Hindu women. He has a list of local landlords who report any “untoward” activities, and a contact in the local administration who keeps an eye out for any marriage applications or notices. To Baldev, the protection of Hindu women is an essential part of social service because fraudulent conversions by “charming” Muslim men are a threat to society. “They don’t tell our sisters their real identity and lure them into relationships. Often, they have two or three wives. The law is good, but we also need to stop such activities in our localities,” he said. He gets most of his information from local men in markets, and landlords and keeps his group abreast on WhatsApp on couples seen skipping classes, or out together. He keeps an especially sharp eye on Muslim-majority localities and on houses rented by young, working Muslim men. “We need to protect our faith, otherwise we will slip into a minority. We aren’t against love but against forced radicalisation,” he added.On an overdrive Many such vigilante groups, which have mushroomed in recent years, have gone into overdrive since the new law was promulgated. In two-high profile cases, in Moradabad and Lucknow, it was right-wing activists who first informed the police about an interfaith wedding. In a third case, in Kushinagar, the right-wingers tipped off the police but after the wedding was stopped, the authorities found that both the groom and the bride were Muslim. “We only keep a watch on such instances. Whenever we come across such cases, we report to the police for further action. It is our moral responsibility,” said Brijesh Shukla, an office bearer of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha. What complicates matters are the strict rules under the Special Marriage Act in UP, where notices of marriage applications are sent to the permanent addresses of families, and a police inquiry is ordered in many cases. This is unlike the procedure in Delhi, where no such notices are sent. “In many cases, fringe groups visit these marriage offices and follow up on the notices. By having photos and addresses of couples, these displays act as a direct threat to their life and privacy,” said Shubhangi Singh of the Association for Advocacy and Legal Initiatives. The public notice provision is currently under challenge in the Supreme Court. What most couples do, she added, is to get the help of middlemen who bribe clerks and lower government officials so that the notices are suppressed and not sent home. “This law has further emboldened those who oppose interfaith unions; the 30-day wait period and the police verification under the SMA needs to go,” said Asif Iqbal, founder of Dhanak, a non-government organisation that helps interfaith couples. Interfaith relationships have always been rare – the religion of man and woman is different for only 2.5% of couples in India – and for most of history, it was not regulated by law. The first interfaith marriage law was made by the colonial state in 1869 on the insistence of the Brahmo Samaj, a reformist movement. But under this law, you had to give up your faith if you got married to someone from another religion. This provision was amended in 1923. Hindus could now have a civil marriage without giving up their faith, but they were disqualified from inheriting family property. The requirement to give up faith remained for others.All these hurdles were removed in the 1954 Special Marriage Act.A bureaucratic event? “It was supposed to be a good law, but over the last 70 years, the bureaucratic hurdles have increased, mainly due to the rules enacted by each state government,” said Saptarshi Mandal, a professor at Jindal Law School. He drew a distinction between the Special Marriage Act and the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act, under which no verification is needed and religious ceremonies are valid marriages. “Marriage in all other laws is a religious event. In Hindu marriages, walking around a fire is held as valid, even photographs. Rituals in Christian or Muslim marriages are considered marriages. There is no stipulation for certificates. But in Special Marriage Act, marriage is made into a bureaucratic event,” he added. To him, the bureaucratic process signals an inbuilt suspicion of interfaith unions in the law – which is also reflected in anti-conversion statutes in states across India. “At one level, the UP law is nothing new. So much oversight on interfaith relationships is due to a fear of conversions. Ideally, if you respect religious freedom, then the decision to convert is a personal one. The state should keep out of it,” he added. As a term, love jihad is relatively new and originated far away from UP. It was first used by Christian and Hindu groups to describe a spate of alleged conversions to Islam in coastal Karnataka and Kerala in October 2009. The following year, then Kerala chief minister VS Achuthanandan popularized the term in a speech, and then in 2016, the conversion of Akhila Ashokan to Hadiya snowballed into a legal tussle that sparked an anti-terror probe and a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court. But anxiety around interfaith unions in UP dates back 100 years. In the 1920s, Hindu organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha and Arya Samaj started printing pamphlets and handbills on abduction of Hindu women by Muslim men. Titled provocatively as Hindu Auraton ki Loot, these pamphlets hinted at a global conspiracy to pillage Hindu honour. The groups used posters, novels, myths, rumour and gossip for the theory to seep into small hamlets. “This was between the non-cooperation and the civil disobidience movements, and there were several communal clashes and riots with the rising Muslim League. There was a targeting of the Muslim male and a disciplining of the Hindu woman with increased scrutiny on her behaviour and expression of love,” said Charu Gupta, a professor at Delhi University. Rumours go digitalMany of these pamphlets carried minute instructions –don’t wear lac bangles because the business is controlled by Muslims, don’t buy groceries from Muslims, don’t hire them as teachers. Local newspapers were a key component of this campaign, which even targeted Muslim civil servants. “This is not say that women were not cheated, they were, across faiths. Rumour mongering that was primarily in print has become digital, on WhatsApp, now. But the key difference is that it used to be a peripheral voice, but now the state is involved,” Gupta added. Things came to a head in 1938, when the daughter of a prominent Hindu lawyer in Kanpur, Bimla Devi, eloped with the son of a Muslim merchant and converted her faith. The case roiled UP, and stoked communal tensions to the extent that the then British governor mentioned it to the Viceroy in two letters. The police charged the Muslim man with abduction, and the case reached the Allahabad high court, but not before a smear campaign against one of the sitting Muslim judges. “The sensational case rocked the UP press for many months. Many of the leading papers followed it graphically and gave lengthy details of court proceedings,” noted Gupta in her book Sexuality, Obscenity, Community: Women, Muslims, and the Hindu Public in Colonial India. Eventually, the court awarded the woman’s custody to her parents; she was reconverted to Hinduism through shuddhi (purification ceremony) at the Arya Samaj temple in Kanpur, and married to a Hindu man. Not once was Bimla Devi allowed to appear in court. Sagar and ShamimIn November, Simran Sagar hatched a plan. She told her parents that she was ready to end her relationship with Shamim and get married. She had just one condition: Allow her to get a job. Her parents agreed, and within a week, Sagar escaped from her house, reached Delhi and was reunited with Shamim on December 11. With nowhere to go, the couple went to Dhanak for lodgings. “It felt like a dream. Even though we were in a small room and couldn’t go out, we were with each other,” she said. The couple have grand plans for the future – she wants to study computer science and he wants to get a better job and support her education. They want to remain in Delhi – she loves roaming around the city – but hope to regain contact with their families one day. “We know we did something wrong, so we will keep trying,” said Shamim. After being denied shelter by the Delhi government, the couple moved the high court, which ordered on Wednesday that they be given protection and a safe house. On Wednesday night, roughly 3.5 years after they first met, the couple moved into a government safe house, sharing a room and living together as a couple. They have to wait for a couple of months before registering their marriage, but they aren’t anxious. “It is a special moment for us; we want to show the world that there is only love between us, no jihad,” Sagar said.

23-12-2020||India||New Covid strain may be in India already: Experts||A new variant of the coronavirus that originated in the United Kingdom sometime in September is likely to have already reached India, experts said on Tuesday, calling for increased whole genome-sequencing based surveillance to detect the new mutation and prevent further spread. The new variant, VUI–202012/01, which accounted for nearly 60% of all cases in London by mid-December, is thought to be 70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the coronavirus. Scientists are still researching on the effects, virulence and severity of the new strain. To prevent the new mutation from taking hold in the country, the government has banned flights from UK from Tuesday night, and administered tests to passengers who have arrived from Britain. On Tuesday, 22 people -- including six from Delhi -- tested positive for the virus, and their samples were sent for genome sequencing. ALSO WATCH | ‘New Covid-19 strain not in India yet but can’t…’: Director ICMR-NARI “The possibility that it hasn’t arrived in India is low,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), one of the labs sequencing Sars-CoV-2 genomes. He explained that the virus was found to be more transmissible. but added that the transmission could occur only if people were not wearing masks. If precautions are not followed, the new variant may lead to superspreading events, other experts warned. “It is likely that the new variant may have already come to India, you will find it only if you are looking for it. This is the reason why we need to scale up the number of genomic sequencing that we are doing. India has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world and it is likely that some variant like it might have generated within the country too,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. He estimated that the country sequences one genome of the virus for every 3,000 positive cases, whereas the World Health Organization said that one genome in 300 positive cases should ideally be sequenced. “And, it is not like we do not have the capability. There needs to be more focus on it,” he said. At a government briefing on Tuesday, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul said that India will use its network of laboratories under the Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Biotechnology, and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to sequence more samples, especially from the travellers from UK who test positive. “Our labs have been asked to prioritise the recent virus samples and send them for genetic sequencing. The ICMR, CSIR, and DBT labs have been doing it so far but it will be scaled up. The positive specimen from passengers from UK in the last few days will also be sequenced,” he said. Dr Agarwal said some Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kits that use the particular gene where the mutation has happened for detecting virus may give out false negatives. “We need to recalibrate our tests. The -PCR usually uses two genes to detect the presence of the virus, we might not insist on a double gene positive to give a positive report,” said Agarwal. The United Kingdom has already issued guidelines for its labs to adapt the processes to ensure that the RT-PCR tests can detect this variant. A cause of concern was that the mutation was at the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter the human body. This protein is also one of the targets of vaccines currently being developed. But experts said that vaccines would remain effective despite the mutation. “Think of the protein used by a vaccine as a surface; the immune response generated is against the complete surface, so even if there is a change in a particular point the vaccine still remains effective,” said Dr Jameel. Dr Agarwal added, “The vaccine produces many antibodies and even if some do not bind, the vaccine remains effective. Other than that, there is T-cell immunity that is generic and a mutation in the binding site does not change that,” referring to cells that kill infected cells and prevent the virus from spreading.Increased surveillance through genomic sequencing might also help the country find the “ideal variant” for a natural vaccine for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-strain-may-be-in-india-already-experts/story-7ABVDSoUTigOot5BUuUhML.html
23-12-2020||India||AMU ‘mini-India’, its diversity nation’s strength: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that “politics can wait but development cannot”, and stressed that ideological differences should be set aside for the sake of national goals.Modi was delivering the keynote address as chief guest at the centenary celebrations of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) — the first time an incumbent Prime Minister has participated in an AMU event since Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1964. Addressing the university’s students, teachers and staff through a video link, the PM said: “There are elements in society who get uneasy when steps are taken for progress. They try to create negativity but sooner or later get marginalised. We have to understand that politics is an important aspect of society. But in society there are also issues other than politics and one has to rise above them for nation.”Though the address was delivered virtually, elaborate security preparations were made — including a police contingent deployed at the campus’s Bab-e-Syed gate — with a section of the university’s students opposing the PM’s participation in the event.The AMU has been a site of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, or CAA. Things came to a boil on the night of December 2019, when students and police clashed on the campus.In his speech, Modi rooted for the mission of making an “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, or self-reliant India, and said that time should not be wasted, like it was in the past, on differences. “We are aiming to build a New India where youth and students of AMU can play a major role,” he said while describing the university as “mini-India”.“The AMU campus is like a city in itself. We see a ‘mini-India’ among different departments, dozens of hostels, thousands of teachers and professors. The diversity which we see here is not only the strength of this university but also of the entire nation,” Modi said, hailing the contribution of the AMU in nation-building and in elevating India’s position internationally through extensive researches.As a premier institute of higher learning, the 100-year-old AMU has seen its students and faculty members being awarded with the prestigious Padma awards, President’s Award, and Sahitya Akademi awards. There are about 34,000 students at present.The PM also stressed on AMU’s diversity. Urdu and Hindi, Arabic and Sanskrit are all taught on the campus, he said. Along with Quran, the translations of Gita and Ramayana are kept in the library. “This diversity is the country’s strength. We have to neither forget it nor let it get weakened,” he said.Modi spoke about the efforts taken by the government to ensure that people — he made a specific reference to Muslim women — stayed in school. “The drop-out rate among Muslim girls was more than 70% and this situation persisted in India for 70 years. The government started Swachh Bharat mission, built toilets in villages, and toilets for school-going girls. Now this rate has fallen to nearly 30%,” he said, while applauding that 35 % of all AMU students are women. “I assure you that no citizen, irrespective of religion, cast and creed would be left behind on the path of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas,” said Modi.The Prime Minister also spoke about the pride that former students have in their AMU roots.“It is fascinating to see how the history of education attached to the AMU buildings is India’s valuable heritage. I often meet AMU alumni during my foreign visits, who very proudly say that they have studied at AMU,” he said.“At AMU, the researches are done in Urdu, Arabic and Persian. This is commendable,” Modi said. “The research conducted in Islamic history elevates the position of India in the Islamic world and gives new energy to India’s relations with them.”AMU public relations officer Omar Peerzada said it was a historic and successful event.AMU vice chancellor professor Tariq Mansoor said: “Today is a historical day...our university not only completes 100 glorious years of its inception, but after a gap of 56 years, an incumbent Prime Minister of the country took part in the celebrations. “ “The presence of the Prime Minister has ignited possibility and hope among all of us. For centuries despite diversities, we are living as a people in oneness and this is what makes Bharat unique and this is a message to the whole world,” he emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amu-mini-india-its-diversity-nation-s-strength-pm/story-dPOCyGpevBLWsZYFwhzhON.html
23-12-2020||India||Gupkar sweeps Valley, BJP largest in Jammu||A newly formed grouping of six parties made significant political gains in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and was on course to winning over 100 of the 280 seats in the recently held District Development Council (DDC) elections — the first major direct polling exercise in the region after the scrapping of its special status in August last year, trends and results showed on Tuesday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which fielded central ministers such as Jitendra Singh and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi for campaigning in the eight-phase polls, was set to grab the second spot. The Congress was poised to become a distant third. The outcome was on expected lines: while the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) comprising two Kashmir powerhouses — the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — and four other parties swept the Muslim-majority Kashmir region (140 seats), the BJP advanced another step towards cementing its political clout in the Hindu-dominated Jammu (140 seats).The PAGD was “deeply indebted & grateful to the people of J&K”, NC leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah said on Twitter, reaffirming the grouping’s “commitment to use all democratic & legal weapons at our disposal to continue to fight for our rights”.“The BJP had made this election a prestige issue about Art 370 & J&K’s special status. The people have now spoken & it’s for those who believe in democracy to pay heed to these voices,” he posted.On August 5, 2019, the central government nullified Article 370, which accorded special status to the then state of J&K, and bifurcated it into two Union Territories – J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one — triggering widespread protests.The PAGD, which also comprises the Peoples Conference, the Communist Party of India-Marxist, the Peoples Movement and the Awami National Conference, took shape in October 2020 to demand the restoration of the erstwhile state’s special status.“Today’s DDC results have made it clear that people of J&K voted en masse for @JKPAGD, thus rejecting the unconstitutional decision to abrogate Article 370. They have overwhelmingly supported @JKPAGD, which stands for restoration of J&K’s special status,” Mehbooba Mufti, PDP leader and another former chief minister, tweeted.PDP chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari, however, said the alliance had expected to do better.In the BJP camp, the party’s J&K spokesperson Anil Gupta termed the results a “victory for democracy” and a “slap” for those who were saying Kashmiri people had lost faith in democracy after the Centre’s Article 370 move. “The BJP did well all across J&K...,” he said.J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina said: “We would win 70-80 seats on our own, and we also hope that 30-40 independents supported by us will emerge winners. Therefore, we anticipate a bumper win.”Of the 231 seats whose results were declared by 10pm, PAGD won 92, the BJP 59, the Congress 19, and former minister Altaf Bukhari’s Apni Party eight seats, according to official figures of the State Election Authority of the UT of J&K. The other seats went to independents and smaller parties.While the PAGD contested 220 seats, the BJP 183, the Congress 118, and the Apni Party 134 seats.Wins or trends were available for 278 seats, while counting was underway in many places late into the night. The Election Commission stopped counting in two seats, in which a contestant each was found to be from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to polling officials. Final results were expected by or after midnight.In Jammu, the PAGD won or was leading in 26 seats, the BJP in 72 seats, and the Congress in 17 seats as of 10:15pm, according to provisional numbers. And in Kashmir, the PAGD won or was leading in 84 seats, the BJP in three seats, and the Congress in nine seats.While PAGD candidates performed exceptionally in south, central and north Kashmir, the alliance missed the mark in the Srinagar district (14 seats), where BJP nominee Ajaz Hussain registered a significant win in the Kanmoh II seat. Apart from this, the other seats the BJP won or was leading in the Kashmir Valley were Tulail and Kakapora in Pulwama.Another highlight of the results was PDP leader Waheed Para, who is under house arrest for his alleged links with militants. He won in his Pulwama constituency by a huge margin.J&K state Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the results meant defeat for the BJP. “They brought top Union ministers and top leaders for election campaigning. Still, they could not win more than 50-60 seats. This shows that people have rejected their slogans,” he said.Held under the shadow of Covid-19, the elections witnessed a turnout of 51.76% over the eight phases from November 29 to December 19, and were the first major direct polling exercise since the nullification of Article 370. Last year in October, Block Development Council elections were held in J&K, though the NC and the PDP boycotted them.Political analyst Pervaz Majeed said the PAGD should have won more seats in the DDC elections.“In the backdrop of the August 5, 2019 situation, the enthusiasm of people in these elections must be surprising to many. After the panchayat elections of 2011 and assembly elections of 2014, this was an electoral exercise that saw good involvement of people.“Moreover, it is a huge political development that the BJP found candidates in Kashmir who fought on its ticket and in fact ran the party’s campaign,” said Majeed, an assistant professor of journalism at Kashmir University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-sweeps-valley-bjp-largest-in-jammu/story-sUV6MgKj3tI0s6pKYP2fFI.html

Stalin levelled allegations of corruption, abuse of public office, obstruction of justice and other criminal offences against Palaniswami, Panneerselvam and accused senior ministers of amassing wealth disproportionate to their income. There were also charges against local administration minister SP Velumani, health minister C Vijayabhaskar, electricity minister P Thangamani, fisheries minister D Jayakumar, revenue minister RB Udhayakumar and food minister R Kamaraj. “We have provided this evidence to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC). We have filed several cases but no action has been taken,” Stalin told reporters after meeting Purohit. “The governor has the power of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2018. It is on that basis that we have lodged the complaint.” Stalin has requested the governor to direct the DVAC to inquire and register cases under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2018. The DMK’s document, titled ‘Large Scale Corruption’ by chief minister and the council of ministers of AIADMK government (2016-2020), states that Palaniswami indulged in corruption in awarding highway road tenders to his relatives.Reacting to Stalin’s petition, chief minister Palaniswami told reporters in Thoothukudi that there was no room for corruption as tenders were issued online. He was flanked by revenue minister RB Udhayakumar and food minister R Kamaraj who responded to the specific allegations. “It is DMK which is indulging in corruption and their cases are pending in court,” Palaniswami said, showing documents. “All this will come out soon. DMK is spreading false news and seeking attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-submits-graft-charges-against-cm-to-guv-palaniswami-rebuts-allegations/story-rU2KPI2LfDVuXyUioznRxJ.html

23-12-2020||India||Jammu and Kashmir DDC Election Results 2020 Updates: Gupkar Alliance ahead of BJP, latest tally shows||The counting of votes for 280 seats of Jammu and Kashmir District Development Councils (DDCs) in 20 districts started at 9am on Tuesday. This is the first time that elections were conducted for the DDC in the Union territory as the DDCs were introduced after the abrogation of the special status accorded to J-K under Article 370 on August 5, 2019.The polling was held under heavy security in eight phases — November 28, December 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19. Jammu and Kashmir have 140 DDCs each and elections were held for all the 280 seats. Apart from that, elections were also held for 935 panchayat halqas and 11,814 vacant panch constituencies in the Kashmir division. In the Jammu division, 135 panchayat halqas and 339 vacant panch constituencies went to polls.While the election to DDCs and panchayat by-polls were held through ballot, by-election to municipal seats were conducted through electronic voting machines (EVMs).All counting of votes is being done in district headquarters where the returning officers are in charge of the counting process for each constituency.
