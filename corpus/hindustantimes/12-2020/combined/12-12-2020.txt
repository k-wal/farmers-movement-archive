12-12-2020||News||From Hisar, notes on a new, changing India||Hisar, four hours west of Delhi, is a medium-sized Punjabi-speaking town in Haryana with a population of 300,000. It is definitely not the kind of place that gets regular visitors from the big metros. A coronavirus scare in the family had brought us here.On a weekday night, we happened upon Big Mugs — an unassuming “American-themed” restaurant in PLA Market. Judging by those in the reasonably full restaurant, it catered to the under-25 crowd who would normally be attending one of Hisar’s universities. But it was also the only place in the vicinity with an espresso machine. Amid the anxiety of dealing with ailing family members, day after day, week after week, the daily espresso became our 10 minutes of peace.We were clearly not from Hisar, and over time, we built a polite, if socially-distanced, friendship with the owner and head chef. One day, we ended up at Big Mugs only to find the espresso machine broken, but getting such a machine fixed in Hisar is no easy task. It would take a couple of days for the repairman to come from Delhi. But it wasn’t just the espresso, as we found out — vegetables, cheeses and a variety of other ingredients were all being brought in from Delhi.How did this make sense? In the middle of a coronavirus pandemic, how could such a place survive in Hisar?Rather than abandoning the place for a lack of coffee, we struck up a deeper friendship with the owner and head chef, no doubt fuelled by the peculiarity of our respective presences. They explained to us how Big Mugs did make sense. We discovered that Hisar, like other towns in the hinterland, are undergoing a major transformation, driven by a complex interplay of aspiration driven by social media, an international supply-side shock from the coronavirus pandemic, and untapped markets.To begin with, the owner of the place did not grow up in Hisar — he grew up in more cosmopolitan towns in Punjab such as Amritsar and Ludhiana. Like so many with his background, he aspired to go abroad with options in Thailand and Greece. But family compulsions forced him to come to Hisar. Over the years, he noticed not only a demand for pastas, pizzas and burgers, but also for food to be presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner. To him, there is no doubt what is fuelling this demand — social media. Instagram is a social media service in which people communicate through photographs and short videos, and India is now Instagram’s second-largest market (behind the United States) with up to 120 million users. Trends on Instagram are not set by fashion houses and Michelin-starred chefs but by “influencers” — ordinary citizens who strategically build a following on social media. The large number of users in small towns, coupled with the visual manner of delivery, creates a greater demand for certain ingredients and aesthetically pleasing food presentation in places such as Hisar.But if demand moves quickly, supply chains are the last to adjust. Hisar has a small number of restaurant distributors who engage in monopolist pricing. For instance, Hisar seems to suffer from a dearth of reasonably-priced cream cheese for cheesecake. To solve this problem, the owner hired a “buyer” whose sole job is to drive to Delhi, buy high-quality ingredients at a reasonable price, and bring them back to Hisar. With supply chains figured out, one piece of the puzzle remained for us. Who was cooking the food?The head chef, who says he specialises in Italian food, insisted that we try his pasta with freshly-made pesto sauce. We were impressed, the dish was perfectly textured with balanced flavours — at least as good as most fancy restaurants in Delhi or Mumbai. It turns out that before he came to Hisar, the head chef was cooking in an upscale restaurant in Kuwait when the pandemic hit, and, before that, he cooked in the kitchen of a five-star hotel in Mumbai. Most surprisingly, he had no connection to Hisar. The head chef was simply recruited to Big Mugs three months ago to run its kitchen. In normal times, it would be difficult to recruit a chef of this calibre to Hisar.But these are not normal times. For a long time, Gulf countries have been a major destination for Indian service staff who draw higher salaries and send remittances home. Of the 17.5 million Indian migrants abroad, about nine million are purported to be living in the Gulf. But due to the unprecedented lockdowns and slowdown in economic activity, not to mention declining oil prices, opportunities in the Gulf have dried up. The World Bank estimates that remittances back to India will shrink by 9% this year (from $83 billion in 2019 to $76 in 2020), a stark change from a 5.5% growth in remittances just last year, no doubt driven by declining prospects in the Gulf. Those who have been able to make their way back to India form the missing supply of those who can cater to new demands in the hinterland.It may seem strange that the chef would take up a job in Hisar, but he insists that, with changing demand, there is more opportunity for growth in these markets than in places such as Delhi or Mumbai. It’s a message that has been taken to heart — the owner and head chef plan to expand their business to Sirsa, another Punjabi-speaking town about 90 minutes from Hisar and even further from Delhi. They do admit that, at times, the dishes have to be adjusted to North Indian tastes, usually by upping the spice quotient with masala and chilli.It would be tempting to view this as a tale of a unique entrepreneur, but it’s a lot more. Three years after Big Mugs opened its doors as a one-of-a-kind restaurant, PLA Market has been transformed. It is now full of restaurants with chic interiors serving continental food. It would be naive to believe that these kinds of market transformations can mitigate the sheer drop in consumer demand and loss of income generated by the pandemic. But it is important to chronicle a market for food that used to only be available for the precious few is now expanding its boundaries into the hinterland — aided by the homogenising effects of social media and an unexpected supply shock of those who can meet these new demands. When one global market is stressed, a local one might find its feet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/from-hisar-notes-on-a-new-changing-india/story-We3vh0BZMmTXlMUIK4QaFO.html
12-12-2020||News||Needed: A new 3-D model for schools||Learning loss during the pandemic can be compensated in future years with adjustment modules added on, but when compounded with the losses in equity due to the digital divide, we must begin to worry. Schools are shut for good reason for the pandemic still rules the world, and we know that both children and their families are at risk when schools reopen. We are fatigued and crave the freedoms of the past when we could run free, meet our friends and do so much more. But that is no reason to indulge ourselves and put lives at risk. School reopening can only be justified under tight rules, strictly adhered to, and in line with safety norms. Neither safety, nor self-discipline has been a key feature of school lives so far; so it would be a tough ask.Some state governments have started to reopen schools. Some selective priorities like socially-distanced examinations, laboratory time and board exam preparations have been open for a while. Health advisories have been put out and the norms are known. What is still not known is whether children can gather together in clusters, since early evidence suggested that children had been spared the virus, but later evidence showed that children could be carriers and indeed, suffer the virus themselves. It would be a brave parent, or one in need, who would send their child out into such a risky situation unless there was regular mass testing, honest information and a rapid response system in place — and these three need to be developed before any school openings can be envisaged with safety.Festival seasons in India have always coincided with good weather, and that is our signal for enabling schools to pick up the pace. Ancient traditions of open-air, or inside outside schools, may also be safe to run, with masks and precautions. Even schools that are cramped, overly dependent on the four-walled classroom will need to flip this dependency and move out into wide-open spaces, plazas and common areas as much as we can and still maintain teaching and learning. Schools that can do so have an opportunity to beat the learning lag.There is no such thing as a completely safe solution, as has been found in countries such as the United Kingdom where schools have opened. There have been many reports of disease spread, and myriad notices sent home to parents to isolate their children for another fortnight because they had contact with Covid-19 at school. This is not reassuring for us, who strain for learning. One key lesson we can take from this is that stable schooling is not possible for now. Entire classes, indeed schools, will have to stay at home and be isolated when there is a case at school. Blended learning has come centre-stage, hybrid will certainly have to be the norm. We educators need to work faster towards models of hybrid learning that are not wholly dependent on the internet or screens as the pandemic peaks and eases off.Before we arrive close to the new normal, we have a turbulent journey for schools ahead of us. Even if schools reopen, they have to be prepared for a new 3D — dynamic, disrupted and distributed. Stable school schedules will not be possible when entire schools can be disrupted with just one super-spreader. In response to this erratic, disrupted open-and-shut paradigm, schools will need to learn dynamic scheduling — a new skill with a much deeper understanding of teaching and learning progress and responsive resourcing actions. None of this can be done centrally, or even at the state level, for contagion clusters are by definition local — so decisions on open and close will have to be distributed. This is what schools have to prepare for now — dynamic responses to distributed decision-making on safety that inevitably lead to disrupted calendars. It’s a hard call, but inevitable, if and when schools reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/needed-a-new-3-d-model-for-schools/story-LWTMZwSsfKvrZ19icqRXXP.html

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||As Covid fatalities mount in HP, hospitals struggle to tackle bodies||Even as Himachal Pradesh continues to witness a surge in Covid-19 deaths and cases, the state’s premier medical institute, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH), is struggling to manage the influx of dead bodies rendering them unattended in the isolation wards for hours.On Thursday, as many as 11 patients died due to the infection, but their bodies lay unattended in the wards for several hours as no staffer was available to pick them up. The staff assigned the job were allegedly found drunk on duty.“My mother succumbed to the virus on Friday night. I got the body on Saturday afternoon,” said Arun Kumar from Jakhorh village in Shimla’s Jubbal tehsil.What has added to the problem is the space crunch at the hospital morgue, which is full to capacity nearly everyday. The IGMCH morgue, which can accommodate 10 bodies, is being used for both Covid and other victims.The hospital management has admitted to the delay caused in the lifting of bodies from the isolation wards.“The death toll mounted suddenly on Thursday and our mortuary got fully occupied. The bodies were awaiting cremation at the grounds too,” said IGMCH medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj.“There was some delay in picking up of the bodies due to negligence on the behalf of staff members who were assigned the task. We then sent other staff to do the same. Strict action will be taken against the erring employees for dereliction in duty,” he said.The sudden rush of bodies of Covid victims has left the cremation facilities struggling to keep up the pace. Kanlog Crematorium in Shimla, which has only six platforms, is being used for both Covid and non-covid victims. The non-covid bodies are cremated before 10am while the virus victims are consigned to flames thereafter.“Bodies have started piling up at the hospital and only six out of 11 Covid victims could be cremated on Friday. Most of the dead are from outside Shimla and their family members are stunned because of the delay in cremations. It’s high time that the government took corrective measures,” said former Shimla mayor and senior CPI (M) leader Sanjay Chauhan, while he insisted upon constructing a temporary crematorium opposite the Kanlog.“Cremation starts around noon and it is not possible to cremate more than four to five bodies by the evening. If a non-covid body is brought for cremation, it takes at least two to three hours more as the covid body has to be kept outside the crematorium in this duration,” said Sanjay Sood, head of Sood Sabha, which manages the Kanlog crematorium.When reached, the chief minister’s office said they have raised the matter with the urban development department. “We have spoken to the urban development department to construct a temporary crematorium in Sanjauli which will be dedicated to Covid bodies,” said chief minister’s private principal secretary RN Batta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-covid-fatalities-mount-in-hp-hospitals-struggle-to-tackle-bodies/story-Rh4X0rZWWbuq586aXefjiK.html

The hospital serves 12 districts, including GB Nagar. The others are Ghaziabad, Saharanpur, Hapur, Rampur, Sambhal, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Kanpur Dehat and other adjoining district. RT-PCR testing is regarded the gold standard of testing for Covid-19. Dr. (Major) B P Singh, senior emergency medical officer (EMO) of Child PGI, said that the instituted achieved the feat in less than seven months. “The total positivity rate was 1.8 to 2 %. More than 5,000 of them have been tested positive,” he said. So far, as many as 5,58,389 samples have been tested in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. District magistrate Suhas LY said that after the outbreak of Covid-19, the main focus has been on expanding the capacity of the district to track the suspected and susceptible population early, test them quickly and treat them effectively. “From testing just 597 people in March, we ramped up testing to 110,205 in September. Till December 9, we have conducted tests of 5,58,389 samples. As a result of this increased testing, we are witnessing a continuous reduction in positivity rate and cases of new infection,” he said. The DM further said his administration has also set up an integrated Covid-19 control and command centre, which works as the nerve centre of Covid-19 battle in the district. “It is manned by people from health and other departments and is equipped with modern equipments for communication and decision making. We are continuously focussing on improving our surveillance and contact tracing as that is the key to early detection of cases. Also, through continuous monitoring of the containment zones as well as other areas, we are trying to keep the number of cases and the positivity rate low. Surveillance has also been ramped up,” Suhas said. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that there are four ICMR-approved laboratories in the district. “While the labs in Child PGI and Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) are under the state government, the labs in National Institute of Biology (NIB) and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) are owned and controlled by the central government. It is really commendable that the same set of labs, which used to test around 1,300 samples daily in May, are now testing over 4,000 samples in a day in December,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/child-pgi-tests-over-2-65-lakh-rt-pcr-samples-in-last-seven-months-gb-nagar-crosses-5-5-lakh-testing-figures/story-9CRnZvmLB8vzSgcB4igm4I.html
12-12-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: 23-year-old woman sustains severe burn injuries in acid attack||Ghaziabad: A 23-year-old woman from a locality in Ghaziabad’s Muradnagar sustained severe burn injuries when her brother-in-law allegedly threw acid on her at her house early morning before fleeing. The suspect, 30-year-old Sirajuddin (single name) was arrested late Saturday. Police said the incident took place around 3.30am on Saturday, when the victim was sleeping in her house, along with her mother and four siblings.“I was sleeping along with my five children when an unidentified person jumped the main gate of our house and threw some inflammable substance over my daughter,” her mother alleged in the police complaint.According to local sources, the woman also suffered facial burns and her clothes also got burnt during the incident. They said the victim’s mother then called locals who informed the police and the victim was later rushed to hospital in Ghaziabad city. The police, on the basis of the police complaint, registered an FIR against an unidentified person under Indian Penal Code sections 307 (attempt to murder), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 326a (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc).“The victim sustained about 15% burn injuries and was rushed to MMG Hospital. From there, she was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, from where she was referred back to Ghaziabad. Her condition is stable but she is under medical supervision,” said Iraj Raja, SP (rural).“The suspect is the husband of the victim’s elder sister and he developed relations with the victim. In the meantime, she became friends with a man from Meerut and Sirajuddin got furious. He tried to pressurise her,” said the SP. Officers said the suspect drives pickup vans and procured acid from Delhi. His name cropped up when police questioned the family at length.“It was easy for him as he knew that the door of the room had issues and the family kept it unbolted during night. So, he entered easily and gave way to the act and fled to his house in Meerut,” he, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-23-year-old-woman-sustains-severe-burn-injuries-in-acid-attack/story-MF4r5wredoV4Z9Ol9pliWM.html

It is preparing to administer the vaccine to 3.25 crore people in six months which will be completed in three phases. Those who will get vaccine shots include health workers, frontline workers and citizens above the age of 50 years and having co-morbidities. However, it is still unclear whether vaccine shots will be free or people will have to pay the charges.The vaccination drive is going to be conducted systematically. People will have to register at a designated website and they will be asked to present at a vaccination camp on a specific date and time to ensure it to be a smooth affair, the officials said.In the first phase, the state will be administering Covid-19 vaccines to health workers. Frontline workers (including police, fire brigade, conservancy staff etc.) will be vaccinated in the second phase while the third phase will have citizens above the age of 50 years and those having co-morbidities vaccinated. It has already started registration of health workers, said a senior official from the state health department, requesting anonymity.“Following the directives of the central government, we have started our preparations to the start vaccination drive assuming that the vaccine will be made available from January. The drive will be conducted at district hospitals, rural hospitals and primary health centres. A team of four to five people will conduct the drive and their training programme has also started,” he said.Also read: ‘Use election-like process for Covid-19 vaccination drive’ - Centre tells states“Each person will have to register to get a vaccine shot at a designated website. He or she will be called by sending a text message and will be asked to come at a specific date and time along with their identity card. The people available at the camp will check their registration and identity; the vaccinator will give the shot and the person will be kept under observation for at least half an hour. If there is no complication then the person will be allowed to go if not then further treatment will be given,” the senior official said.“We still have no idea whether the vaccination will be free for all or people will have to pay. The decision has to be taken by the Centre,” he added.He further said that the state health staff has already completed a vaccination drive for measles-rubella only two years ago in 2018, hence they are hoping that there won’t be any hassle as the staff has had a similar experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-months-3-25-crore-people-3-phases-maharashtra-s-covid-19-vaccination-plan/story-Vvco7WB9P5bK3b3DZuYfVP.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Farmers use steam cooking system to cook at Singhu border||With the number of protesting farmers increasing and arranging gas cylinders to cook meals for thousands of them becoming an issue, a steam cooking system plant was brought from a gurdwara in Punjab’s Gurdaspur and set up at the Singhu border on Friday.The steam cooking system installed on a trolley has three stoves attached to bigger utensils. It has the capacity to cook rice, pulse and vegetables for nearly 3,000 people in one go, said Gurwinder Singh, a sewadar of the Gurdaspur gurdwara.“As we had been preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner for nearly 5,000 people every day, arranging cooking gas cylinders was a problem. We then decided to bring the steam cooking system available at our gurdwara. This has brought a lot of respite to our volunteers because cooking has now become easy and fast,” said Singh.Nearly 50 volunteers have been managing the kitchen, which includes bringing ration, cutting vegetables, cooking meals, and serving them free of cost to the farmers and everyone else visiting the protest venue. The kitchen has been set up behind the main stage where farmer leaders deliver their speeches throughout the day.Explaining the functioning of the steam cooking system, Gurpratap Singh, another volunteer, said that the machine includes a boiler which takes water from the water tank attached to the trolley.“Instead of gas cylinders, we use wood to boil the water in the boiler. The high steam generated by the boiling water passes to the three stoves through pipes. This is how we cook the meals. One utensil on the stove can cook 50kg of rice or pulse in one go. Nearly 100 litres of water are required to cook one meal,” said the volunteer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-farmers-use-steam-cooking-system-to-cook-at-singhu-border/story-WeLBfl9cygXyE2bdkWO8KJ.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Three of family held for murdering woman on wedding day in Srinagar||The police here have arrested three family members of a woman who was murdered on her wedding day last month in Srinagar.The revelations of the murder of the bride-to-be, Shahnaza, daughter of late Mohd Qasim Sultan of Saida Kadal, Srinagar, allegedly by her step-brother, nephew and niece over property and jewellery has triggered shock and anger in the valley.Police said the blind murder case of Shahnaza was solved in record time after Nigeen police station filed a report on November 13 following directions from the court of chief judicial magistrate, Srinagar.The court direction came after the woman’s fiancé Nasir Hussain Kawa, a resident of Kawpora, Shadipora, filed a petition when he was informed that the woman died of a heart attack on November 4. They were set to be married on November 4-5.“The complainant stated that he had apprehensions of the woman being murdered and accordingly, the proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC were initiated,” said police spokesperson Manoj Kumar.Kumar said the investigating officers learnt from the medical reports that the woman was actually murdered prompting them to file a murder case.He said that a special investigating team led by SHO Nigeen under the supervision of SDPO Zakoora swung into action and started rounding up suspects in the instant case.Kumar said the special team got clues pointing towards the involvement of the deceased’s family, including her step brother Mohammad Shafi Sultan, nephew Wajid Gulzar Sultan and niece Nighat.“Among the suspects, Wajid was put to sustained questioning. He revealed that he along with his uncle Shafi and sister Nighat hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Shahnaza as she had been their eyesore,” Kumar said.The official said the main conspirator was Shafi, who eyed a piece of land and jewellery, and motivated Wajid and Nighat to take part in the murder plan.“On November 3, they all hatched a conspiracy to eliminate her. The victim used to wake up for prayers early in the morning and in the wee hours of November 4, as she was busy praying, Shafi along with Nighat and Wajid entered the room and attacked the victim from behind and smothered her to death,” Kumar said, adding that they then strangulated her with a piece of cloth and later tied it to the ceiling fan along with Shanaza’s body,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/three-of-family-held-for-murdering-woman-on-wedding-day-in-srinagar/story-t1x0lfxBdi9ohQ23yTh50J.html
12-12-2020||Noida||Delhi-Meerut Expressway’s UP sections may not get benefit of net metering||Ghaziabad: The under construction Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) may not be on “energy saving” mode in Uttar Pradesh. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that they will not be able to get the benefit of net metering system in UP due to the change in policy by the state government. As a result, NHAI will be forced to operate about 5,500 streetlights through electricity procured directly from the power department, instead of solar power, the officials said. The phase 1 (Akshardham to UP Gate) and phase 3 (Dasna to Hapur) of the DME project are operational, while phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) and phase 4 (Dasna to Meerut) are under construction and have an official deadline of December-end. The NHAI officials said that they are getting the benefit of net metering system under phase 1 in Delhi. “But we will be using direct electricity connection on commercial rates for running streetlights under phase 2. It is due to UP’s changed policy that we will not benefit of net metering system here. If there is a policy change, we will install the system. Now, we have applied for direct electricity connection,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.The phase 2 has installation of about 3,000 streetlights which will now be operated using direct electricity instead of solar power. “The 3,000 streetlights have daily consumption of about 1,000 kilowatts of energy,” Garg said. Under the net metering system, domestic or commercial consumers who generate their own electricity using solar panels or photovoltaic systems can export their surplus energy back to the grid. The mechanism also allows for reduction in electricity bill with the amount of energy exported to the grid. “The net metering system is installed under phase 3 as well, but the 1,500-odd streetlights are running on direct electricity received from the power department. Their operation involves usage of about 750 kilowatts of electricity per day. Likewise, phase 4 also has 1,000 streetlights which are proposed to consume about 500 kilowatts of energy per day. Since installation of net metering is part of the contract, we will get the system installed but streetlights will be running on direct electricity,” Garg added. The development means an increase in operational cost, the NHAI officials said. Officials of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) said that the issue has cropped up due to the policy change. “Due to the change in policy in January last year in UP, the net metering is allowed only for households and private tube wells, and not for commercial consumers. NHAI will be charged as per the commercial tariff and net metering will not be applicable for them. The issue cannot be decided at local level,” said RK Rana, chief engineer (distribution) of PVVNL. The work on some parts of phases 2 and 4 are likely to extend to the next year. The NHAI officials said that some work on a rail overbridge near ABES College and another 500 metres pipeline laying work may need more time to get complete under phase 2. They further added that work for another rail overbridge under phase 4 may also take more time and may extend to 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-meerut-expressway-s-up-sections-may-not-get-benefit-of-net-metering/story-JueCwrVkYyKxJFVhXLB55J.html
12-12-2020||Noida||We are moving ahead with development: CM Yogi||Ghaziabad: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday, without naming anyone, said that people were “jealous” of the developmental works being carried out by the state government. He was speaking during an event at Indirapuram on Saturday evening to inaugurate the newly constructed ‘Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan’. “People are jealous as to why such works are being done? It is because of jealously that they have lost their sleep. They are jealous as they are seeing the works, which had been held up for years, happening. We are moving ahead with development. These are people who are trying to create conspiracies against the country as they cannot see development of ‘Bharat’ and they do not want to see smiles on faces of youths and farmers,” Yogi said. He said that he has no hesitation in encouraging the faith and said that the ‘Kanwar Yatra’ will go on in a vibrant manner. “Our country is a land of faith and it binds us from east to west and from north to south. In this country, we have seen a lot of efforts being put up to create a divide. During the present times, some people are involved in spreading chaos and also have hands in trying to create a divide. But we have our faith with us and it gives us strength,” Yogi said. He also raised questions on the construction of Haj House in Ghaziabad which was constructed under the tenure of the previous government near the banks of river Hindon. “It is same Ghaziabad where directions of the National Green Tribunal and guidelines of the state administration were flouted and Haj House was constructed. Whenever there was demand for construction of ‘Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan’, every land was made disputed and hurdles were put up. However, we decided for its construction and even paid for the land cost of this majestic building. It will be used by pilgrims who wish to go for ‘Char Dham Yatra’ and other pilgrimage,” he said, adding that the state government spent about Rs 132 crore which also includes the land cost. The ‘Kailash Mansarowar Bhawan’ has come up in Indirapuram over an area of about 9,000 square metres and has state-of-the-art facilities for pilgrims who will be able to make stay. Yogi also spoke about “spiritual tourism” and said his government made best arrangements for about 24 crore pilgrims in ‘Kumbh Mela’ which was earlier held in “unorganised manner”. “Such events create employment opportunities for different people whom I met during the Kumbh Mela and they told that their incomes increased manifolds. When such opportunities can be created in Ayodhya and Varanasi, no one can stop such opportunities in Ghaziabad as well. When we are creating such opportunities, people are trying to create hurdles. But I do not worry and walk on path of development,” he added. Claiming that his government will not allow any criminal activities in the state, Yogi said, “Earlier, goondas (criminals) walked freely and policemen had to hide their faces. Now, criminals hang placards in their neck and beg for their lives. It is same system but ‘shashan’ (rule) has changed. Those who take law in their hands should think on what type of ‘Yatra’ they wish to go. Here, we have a lot of ‘Yatras’. When we are making efforts for all, we will not allow anyone to make law hostage,” he said. The CM also lauded the efforts of the Ghaziabad district officials in terms of cleanliness and also during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Earlier, Ghaziabad was among the dirtiest cities. But officials and workers did a makeover in just three years. The work done during the pandemic is also outstanding. They saved people and also kept in check the fatality rate. it is on the same lines of vision of our Prime Minister,” Yogi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/we-are-moving-ahead-with-development-cm-yogi/story-trCjLPUsyL56BMstfCLErO.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||2,000 patients received Ayurvedic treatment for Covid-19 in Delhi govt hospital||A day after doctors from across the country protested the Centre’s decision to allow Ayurveda practitioners to perform certain surgeries, the Delhi health minister congratulated one of the hospitals under it for providing “pure Ayurvedic treatment” to 2,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. “Congratulations to Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan for successfully catering to 2000 covid patients with pure Ayurvedic treatment. It is the 1st Indian Ayurvedic hospital which has treated covid patients from ages 1month-106years. I applaud the team and staff,” said the health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. The hospital was one of the three designated as Covid Health Centre that admitted mild to moderate Covid-19 patients who did not need much medical intervention. The hospital has been treating its patients with a concoction called Nagaradhi Kwath that contains three herbs, haldi milk, and Amla Churan for Vitamin C. This protocol was followed for a case control study of 1,000 patients where half received the ingredients and the other half didn’t. Another trial of 1,000 patients was conducted to test sitopaladi churna which is given to patients for common cold. “Our patients also did some pranayama and yoga to relieve anxiety. We are yet to analyse the results of the study but there was an improvement in the condition of the patients. We are not saying that these herbs cure Covid-19, but it helps in relieving the symptoms,” said Professor Vidula Gujjarwar, director principal of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurveda Charak Sansthan. The institute had also done a case-control trial of Chyawanprash and found that there was no difference in symptoms in those who were given the mixture and those who weren’t. “We are not against anyone practicing any pathy; in fact, an integrated system of Indian medicine should flourish. The problem is when the people who are trained in Ayurveda prescribe medicines or perform therapies that are allopathic. They are not trained for it and that would mean risk to the patients,” said Dr BB Wadhwa, president of the Delhi Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-000-patients-received-ayurvedic-treatment-for-covid-19-in-delhi-govt-hospital/story-kjSzE69tmZbOtTZgdcgvoO.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest may turn violent: Shanta Kumar to govt||BJP veteran and former Union minister Shanta Kumar, on Saturday, said that the farmer movement has reached a crucial juncture. He said that the government as well as the farmers should stay alert as the situation may spiral out of control due to involvement of anti-national elements.“It is unfortunate that despite long talks and assurances of Union ministers and PM Modi, the movement continues to intensify,” Shanta said in a press statement.The three farm laws, against which farmers are protesting, are based on recommendation made by a high-level committee on Restructuring of Food Corporation of India (FCI) headed by Shanta.“Some anti-social elements have joined the movement and some NGOs are suspected of indirectly pumping money to facilitate the protests,” he added.He alleged that the command of the movement is not in hands of real farmers.“A few days ago, there was a 100-day dharna at Shaheen Bagh. A delicate phase arrived when riots were fuelled in which 50 innocent people were killed,” he said.“The farmer movement is also slowly taking the form of a similar movement. Leaders are fuelling the protests for their vested interests,” said Kumar.He added that the movement is mainly run by Punjab leaders. Grain production in Punjab is high and the Food Corporation buys bulk of food grain from there. Its tax and commission amount to over ₹5,000 crore annually, said Kumar.“With the new law in place, farmers will be able to sell their produce elsewhere and the earnings from commission will automatically come down. This is the reason why middlemen, especially from Punjab, are giving crores of rupees, quilts and food grains to the protesters,” he alleged.“A leader whose photo has been put up at the protest site was accused of hijacking an airplane but was never caught. If this is true, the country needs to be careful,” he added.Earlier, Kumar had said that the farmers’ protest is politically motivated. He said the new laws will bring radical changes in the agriculture sector and will not end the MSP system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-protest-may-turn-violent-shanta-kumar-to-govt/story-IfClXQ1WBFEPqpjaPrt90L.html

According to the police, the incident took place around 10pm in Mankpur Khadar village. The vehicle that came in contact with the live wire was carrying a music system and people were dancing to the tunes of a song, the police said, adding that the three persons on the same vehicle received burn injuries and one of them died. The deceased was identified as Chirag, a resident of Faridabad. The injured were identified as Pawan Kumar, 19, and Sandeep Kumar, 18, both residents of Faridabad. They are undergoing treatment at a private hospital and are out of danger, the police said. The members of the marriage procession had come from Faridabad to Dankaur. Anil Kumar Pandey, station house officer, Dankaur police station, said that there was an 11kv power line in the village. “The marriage procession was moving when the DJ van hit the overhead wire. Three persons on the vehicle received burn injuries in the incident. They were rushed to a private hospital where Chirag was declared brought dead,” he said. The deceased’s family took away the body to Faridabad for last rites, the police said. The incident had created panic in the neighbourhood and the organisers immediately stopped the music system. A police team from Dankaur police station reached the spot and got the power disconnected, the SHO said. Vishal Pandey, additional DCP, Greater Noida, said that the police have not received any complaint from the deceased’s family. Officials of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) said that the power supply was resumed in the area in the morning. “We investigated the matter and found that the power line was intact. We found that the DJ vehicle was high in length and came in contact with the live wire. The organisers should have checked the vehicle’s height and the route to take such a procession in advance,” said VN Singh, chief engineer, PVVNL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/one-killed-two-injured-as-vehicle-touches-high-tension-wire-during-marriage-procession-in-dankaur/story-PAmUTNJtdOn5XtP5CjUJ4J.html
12-12-2020||Noida||Toll plazas in Ghaziabad and Hapur suffer 35-50% revenue loss during ‘toll-free’ call by farmers, says NHAI||Ghaziabad: The “toll-free plazas” call given by the protesting farmers impacted the fee collection at three major toll plazas in and around Ghaziabad on Saturday. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said that the protesters arrived at the toll plazas around 11.30am and allowed vehicles to pass without paying tolls. The Ghaziabad district has two major toll plazas at Dasna and Duhai interchange of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), while another major toll is at Chijarsi in Hapur which is part of phase 3 of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project. The call for making toll plazas free was given by the farmers who are protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws. After the recent talks with the government reached a deadlock, the farmers’ leaders gave a call for “toll-free” plazas on December 12. “As per our estimates, we suffered a revenue loss of about 35% at Chijarsi toll plaza, while the loss is estimated to be about 50% at the two toll plazas at Duhai and Dasna interchange. The protesters arrived in groups around noon on Saturday and held protests till late afternoon. The traffic at the three toll plazas was normalised by 5pm today,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. He said that EPE tolls have movement of about 60,000 passenger car units per day, while the Chijarsi toll has movement of about 40,000-50,000 cars a day. “Almost all the lanes have Fastag facility and about 80-85% vehicles use Fastags. However, the toll through Fastag is deducted only when the vehicles move at slow speed at toll plazas. After the farmers made lanes toll-free, vehicles moved at high speed. So, most of the vehicles went without any deduction,” Garg said. Although the administration had made deployment of police at toll plazas in Ghaziabad as well as Hapur districts, protesters came in groups of hundreds and stayed at the tolls, police officials said. “As part of their protest, they made toll plazas free for vehicles. However, we did not allow them to take up any protest or disrupt any traffic on highway. The protesters came in groups and every group staged their protests. There was no untoward incident reported during the day,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police, Hapur. Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers on Saturday continued the blockade of National Highway-9 at the UP Gate and said that their “toll-free” call was successful. “Various tolls in western UP were made toll-free, but none of our supporters indulged in any violence or disrupted any traffic movement. The call was to make the government aware about the strength of farmers and also to involve more farmers in the ongoing agitation. No violence or any untoward incident was reported during the protests. Our leaders have already told supporters that protest must go on peacefully,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The BKU supporters led by Rakesh Tikait has been staging protests at the UP Gate since November 28 and were joined by other farmers from Uttarakhand, Punjab and western UP. The protesting farmers on December 3 blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of NH-9 and are still continuing since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/toll-plazas-in-ghaziabad-and-hapur-suffer-35-50-revenue-loss-during-toll-free-call-by-farmers-says-nhai/story-ja6kSah2H2BNTfClsLtbuL.html
12-12-2020||Noida||Farmers remove toll barriers on Eastern Peripheral Expressway||A group of farmers from Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Tikait) on Saturday protested on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) in Sirsa village and lifted the toll barriers for a free passage of vehicles on both sides of the carriageway as a mark of opposition against the farm bills. The police, however, said that the barriers remained toll-free only for a while and toll collection returned to normalcy after the police personnel present at the spot reasoned with the farmers. Another group of farmers also gathered on the NH-91 near the Luharli toll plaza in Dadri and made free passage for vehicles. Farmers also reached Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway to do the same. However, a police team kept the farmers away from the plaza and tolls were collected normally. Sunil Pradhan, a BKU-Tikait member, said that the farmers’ group protested at different tool plazas. “We reached the Eastern Peripheral Expressway at 9am and lifted all the toll barriers. Farmers were stationed at the spot to ensure a free passage of vehicles,” he said. The six-lane EPE connect places in western Uttar Pradesh, such as Noida, Ghaziabad, Baghpat to Faridabad and Palwal in Haryana. Vishal Pandey, additional DCP, Greater Noida, said that police personnel were deployed at all the spots. “The farmers were not allowed to reach the Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway. The toll collection continued as usual on Yamuna Expressway. The farmers protested for half-an-hour on the service lane and then they left,” he said. Pandey said that on the EPE, nearly 100 farmers from three organisations had gathered and made one lane toll-free for one-and-a-half hour. “The police personnel present at the spot, however, reasoned with the farmers and the situation came to normal after a while,” he said. On NH-19, Luharli toll plaza in Dadri, the farmers managed to make the toll plaza free for merely ten minutes, said the police. Meanwhile, at Noida’s Chilla border, the farmers organised a Ramayana recitation programme. The rain and wind on Saturday led to a collapse of the makeshift tent of farmers at Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal on Saturday. The farmers had to take shelter inside the memorial building during the rain. Dr SK Giri, general secretary and spokesperson of BKU Lok Shakti, said that the farmers are resolved to fight on till their demands are met. “On Saturday afternoon, the farmers also met Gautam Budh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma at his office in Kailash Hospital. We also submitted a memorandum to the government through Sharma. We hope our grievances are addressed,” he said. Sharma did not respond to call and text message for a comment.  Meanwhile, Thakur Swaraj Singh Bhati, national president, BKU Lok Shakti , along with some other farmers also got their heads tonsured in protest against the farm bills on Saturday.A delegation of five farmers led by Thakur Bhanu Pratap, president BKU-Bhanu on Saturday evening met Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar at Singh’s residence over the issue. “We discussed farmers’ issues and demanded formation of Kisan Aayog. The two ministers talked to us for one-and-a-half hour and assured that the issues will be addressed. We may open the Noida-Delhi road at Chilla border on Sunday,” Pratap said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-remove-toll-barriers-on-eastern-peripheral-expressway/story-XCDrbNyBh287HBty8WeJGN.html

The incident occurred over the non-payment of salary dues for several months. The company deals with the manufacturing of Apple iPhones in India,” read a press statement from the minister. “The protest against the management turned violent after some people started vandalizing the office, setting vehicles on fire, pelting stones and setting the company’s board on fire,” the statement read. Regretting the unpleasant incident, the minister said that it is not right to take the law into one’s hand no matter what the problem was.“The State government has taken steps to develop industries in the State and is committed to the protection of the worker’s right. The problem could have been resolved if it had been adequately addressed as per law,” the statement quoted him as saying.Shettar said that the state government is ready to provide adequate protection to companies that have invested in the state.“We will take stringent measures to prevent such unpleasant events from recurring.

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Stocks and shares and making up losses||When all the shopping malls and markets of the world were closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the share market worked incessantly. Since I owe my allegiance to the brick and mortar segment, the virtual commodities being traded in the market were beyond my comprehension. Besides, my limited knowledge of mathematics and its cousin economics have always made me wary of the numerical world.I was more like an American, who would use a calculator to add two plus two, than an Indian, doing quick mental calculations. Mathematicians Aryabhata and Shakuntala Devi would definitely not have been proud of me.But then they were not like my lawfully wedded partner: A great optimist. He introduced me this year, as we remained locked in due to the pandemic, to the world of dividends, profit sharing and debentures with such fervour that there was no getting away from statistics.The peace of morning tea routine was shattered by the high decibel financial chatter on TV. My soulmate would be engrossed in it, his expressions changing in tandem with market trends. I would sit like a nincompoop fiddling with my cup of tea. The only sound that moved him, besides Big Ben of London, was the market opening bell, and the monologue of the TV anchor rattling off facts and figures of various companies faster than he could breathe.When he noticed that I was unable to make the head or tail of the market, hubby dear started lovingly explaining the workings of the share bazaar. After a few sessions I knew that upper freeze had nothing to do with the upper part of the freezer, that short selling did not have any shorts to sell, that future stock was not a career and that bulls and bears were actually human beings like us.My weary soul would hope that the topic would change with the next cup of tea, but to my dismay, it never did. It seemed my fiscal half had taken it upon himself to teach me a few nuances of the monetary world. After a few more weeks passed by I knew the names of all the TV presenters and the number of times they had repeated their outfits in a month. The rest of it was still Greek to me.It had taken me years to decipher a few facts about cricket, and then dealing with money matters was a double whammy. I was feeling so quarantined in my own house.Finally, my observant better half saw through my anguish, and so, one fine morning, brightly said, “Ok, no more fiscal talk, but I want you to know that I have been doing a bit of trading. How would it be if I tell you that you are part owner of a banking sector, that you can actually vote in a pharmaceutical company, that you have certain rights in a shipping company, and that your favourite metal, gold, is doing well at the index?”That made a lot of sense. My eyes lit up and I said to him, “Now you are talking, man!” It sounded more glamorous than the mundane numbers on the graph. Since then, I have become genuinely interested in the numbers game, and have started following the exponential rise and fall of the market. The going is good and I hope to cover my fiscal deficit soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-stocks-and-shares-and-making-up-losses/story-WOfZMzKGxZLRvB35goQ46L.html

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Reinvent Chandigarh’s Sector 17, the Bryant Park way||Last week I happened to visit the Sector 17 market for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak. The afternoon sun and the open spaces made an inviting combination. I happened to interact with the owner of a new café, an old family acquaintance, near the approach from the Rose Garden. He revealed that the footfall had begun to increase in the last few weeks as people were less inclined to visit the closed spaces of malls during the pandemic and instead preferred the open Sector 17 market. He sounded enthusiastic about the response he was getting and said he hoped the administration would allow outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants to entice more visitors. This interaction set me thinking about my first visit to the market more than 50 years ago as a school student.In the 1970s, Sector 17 had become the city centre with showrooms, three theatres (Neelam, Jagat, KC), offices, Parade Ground, the Inter State Bus Terminus, general post office and many open spaces. It emerged as the hub of activity when many businesses shifted there from Sector 22, including the Indian Coffee House, English Book Shop, Capital Book Shop and Gulatis. Then, with major restaurants opening, Sector 17 started attracting bigger crowds. The generation growing up will not know that a road used to cut across the sector in front of Neelam Theatre till the concrete plaza was built along with the parking lots.With the coming up of the Open Hand water feature and fountains near the over bridge, the open spaces became a haven for children and students. A few balloon sellers and booksellers on the pavement with an occasional pirated CD-DVD seller made your day livelier. Of course the shoeshine boys near Neelam theatre had always been there.Losing its charm Unfortunately, however, decades later, this market centre has lost its charm with the multiplex culture and mall-mania overtaking the city. Actually, its death knell sounded with the coming up of Elante Mall where you can spend hours in an air-conditioned environment. It should have been a challenge for the administration to reinvent Sector 17, but it gave up without a fight. Still worse was to come. The takeover of all the open spaces by the phari market had ruined the city’s soul.But then there are many things that are still in favour of Sector 17. It is the centre of the original Phase-1 of Le Corbusiers’ planning, it lies in close proximity to the Rose Garden, has huge open spaces and the best brands in town! Barring the few months of extreme summer, the place can still attract locals and tourists. All that needs to be done is replicate successful models from across the world. Of the cities I have been to, I can think of Bryant Park, New York; Leicester Square, London; and Quincy market, Boston. All these three places have enough for weekend locals or tourists round the year.However, Bryant Park can be used as a model to revitalise Sector 17 and supplement Corbusier’s plans for the city centre.The ideal city centre Sector 17 seems to be modelled on the city centres of any of Europe’s major destinations with a pedestrian-only zone surrounded by shopping areas and a few theatres/cinemas. The old cities have a few monuments and/or historical buildings, which Chandigarh lacks. The city centres of all European cities have a vibrant life, full of activities for all ages, again something which Chandigarh has ceased to have. There used to be musical performances near the fountains on Saturdays which fizzled out after some years.Bryant Park in Manhattan is a classic example of a park in the centre of a city being successfully managed by a private not-for-profit organisation, Bryant Park Corporation. It has an interesting history, undergoing restoration in the 1980s after being overrun by drug dealers and prostitutes. The park has in its premises the NY Public Library, with underground stacks, open green lawns, a few memorabilia shops and a few eateries besides a reading room and restrooms. It hosts different events round the year, like movies, musical performances and programmes with local sports teams. There are classes on yoga, martial arts and knitting! All activities including ice-skating in winter is free.The Chandigarh administration, in collaboration with local traders can easily reinvent Sector 17 into another Bryant Park. In fact, there is more open space in Sector 17 than in Bryant Park. To start with, parking areas in front of shops should be converted into greens with activities for children at one end, and a library, a few open-air eateries and a senior citizen corner at the other. A water body could be added to get the children back. Arts college students can be roped in to show their creations like sculptures and paintings. Portrait making in the evenings can be a big draw. Similarly, university students and cultural groups can be invited to present recitals, plays and other performances. There could be a small area for Punjabi cuisine or street food like corn-on-the-cob or roasted sweet potatoes, especially for tourists. Different competitions for school children or college students can be held, including painting, story writing and musical performances. In fact, a competition to get the best ideas for reinventing Sector 17 could be organised to start with. There is no limit to what can be done in different months of the year. On Sundays there could be flea market added to the activities. All major festivals can be celebrated here and a recreational centre also set up for children near the GPO area.As has been done in Bryant Park, garden umbrellas can be set up with steel chairs and tables, free newspapers and free WiFi at various spots. Book launches, free movies, free plays and so much more can be organised here!I hope the well wishers of the city bring back the glory days of the city centre.(The writer is a professor at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||J&K DDC polls: Gupkar alliance ditches Congress on seat-sharing pact in Nowshera||Congress, which had jumped on the Gupkar bandwagon ahead of the district development council (DDC) elections, has been ditched by the latter on their seat-sharing agreement.Former MLC and chief spokesperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) Ravinder Sharma said, “It is unfortunate that the National Conference (NC) fielded candidates where the seats were left for Congress in Nowshera assembly constituency. While Congress remained committed to the settlement and didn’t field its candidate against the PDP-NC alliance in Nowshera, the latter has backtracked.”Sharma, who was on a tour of the area to campaign for the Congress candidates, regretted that the NC fielded its candidates at the eleventh hour from Seri-Lamberi and Sunderbani seats in Nowshera assembly constituency against the settlement arrived at between the parties on seat sharing at some places.“It was settled at the very beginning of talks for seat sharing, of which he was also a part, that the PDP-NC would together contest the Nowshera seat while Seri-Lamberi would go to Congress and for the Sunderbani seat, the local leadership would jointly decide the candidate. I did honour the settlement but it was unfortunate that the NC fielded its candidate in Seri-Lamberi seat on the last day against the prior agreement.”Congress did not field any candidate from the Nowshera seat in the previous phase of the DDC polls.“I was conveyed by the top NC leadership on the day of filing of papers too that the latter would not field its candidate from Seri-Lamberi, but unfortunately it did, which is wrong,” he added.“At all other places where seats were mutually left for each other, no cross candidates were fielded, though on many seats we are contesting against each other,” he said.Seeking support for Congress, he appealed to the people to vote for any like-minded party or secular candidate where Congress was not in the fray, but reject BJP.Sharma along with senior leaders of the party carried out a hectic campaign in various villages of Nowshera and urged people to reject the BJP for its “anti-youth, anti-poor and anti-farmer policies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-ddc-polls-gupkar-alliance-ditches-congress-on-seat-sharing-pact-in-nowshera/story-Tox2kW29SmBjglXfm5WNsI.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: A joyful 50th anniversary, even during Covid||A couple of years back, a friend celebrated his golden wedding anniversary. His children made it a special day by holding a party where famous qawwals were invited to regale the audience with the choicest of qawwali. Later, the projector was turned on to showcase moments from the lives of the couple: From when they were young to the birth of their children and then grandchildren. In a nutshell, the entire life of the couple was scanned up to the present times.This got the wife and I thinking about celebrating the success of 50 years of our togetherness, which by no means is a small feat. In fact, we had started thinking two years ago about it, little realising how 2020 would turn out to be.However, though to me all days are alike but it’s “in” to celebrate these special anniversaries or birthdays in a big way. Therefore, some plan it in a hotel or resort and others fly to a special tourist destination or go on a cruise. Innovative ideas can be endless.We were perplexed recently when another friend of mine whose golden anniversary was due before ours did not invite us to a party, wondering how he could ignore us. A few days later, however, we learnt that he had offered prayers at a gurdwara and decided to donate money to needy children instead of organising a lavish celebration. Such gestures are indeed wonderful. After the Covid-19 global invasion we left India for Vancouver in Canada, thinking it would be safer to go out of India. This was not true because the second wave, as they call it, made it mandatory for us to stay at home there with no one to visit, even close relatives or friends, to contain the growing numbers. As our anniversary, the 50th D-day approached, it was celebrated in the home environs with just our own family. Of course, our children and grandchildren gave us many surprises by meticulously planning everything like special decorations, ordering snacks, drinks, our favourite food and expensive gifts. Last but not least, there was a surprise Zoom call enabling us to get together virtually with our siblings in India, and other near and dear relatives in the US and Canada. Covid had changed everything because we could not celebrate the big day by physically being together with our other family members and friends.However, what mattered at the end of the day was an introspection of our journey of 50 years together. Many people crossed a silver or golden anniversary milestone, but was happiness part of the equation? Were they compatible? Did they enjoy the journey.? Or was it just a forced coalition, a journey that was a tedious, unending long ordeal?The current generation is smart, people part ways the moment they understand that they are unhappy or that their alliance is not workable. Older generations were more wary of divorce no matter how unhappy they were. As we tread in our seventies, having shared good and worst times while standing united, giving each other strength, we cherished each moment of togetherness and felt inseparable. However, the thought that one of us may have to depart earlier gives us the jitters. It is inevitable that sooner or later, one of us will predecease the other at a time when we have started needing each other more in our old age as the children have grown up and have their own lives.We would love to live life fully so as to enjoy whatever time is left, without worrying about the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-a-joyful-50th-anniversary-even-during-covid/story-cPGduWC1UbYLBEaN6PAvrI.html

12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Srinagar: Six acquitted in Maulvi Showkat murder case||A special trial court here has acquitted six of the eight accused in the killing of prominent Jammu and Kashmir cleric Maulvi Showkat Ahmad Shah, who was murdered in a cycle explosion in 2011.Ashwani Kumar Sharma, additional sessions judge TADA, POTA and special judge designated under NIA Act in Srinagar, stated that the prosecution has failed to prove whether in fact the murder of Shah was committed by the accused persons on the basis of the alleged conspiracy and whether the act of the accused was a terrorist act.“In the present case, a terror has been struck in the people by using the IED in the killing of Shah (the deceased) but who has struck the terror and by whom the IED has been blasted has not been established before the court by the prosecution. It has not been established before the court when the conspiracy to kill was hatched as alleged,” the court said in the judgment pronounced on Thursday.The acquitted persons include Abdul Gani Dar alias Abdullah Gazali, former chief of militant outfit Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TuM) and alleged president of Sout-ul-Haq, alleged militants Nisar Ahmad Khan alias Ishaq and Javaid Ahmad Munshi alias Bill Papa, besides Abdul Majid Dar Almadni, Gulzar Khan and Riyaz Ahmad Shah. During the trial, Abdullah Gazali, out on bail, was found murdered in February 2020 inside Jamiat-Ahli Hadees, the same mosque outside which Shah was killed in an explosion in 2011 in Maisuma.The accused were represented by advocates M A Pandit, Abu Adil Pandit, Abu Owais Pandit, Nadeem Pandit and Mohammad Amin.The police had filed the chargesheet against the six and another two who were “absconding”, after claiming that the murder was part of a “conspiracy” to radicalise the Shah-led organisation Jamiat Ahli Hadith. The accused were chargesheeted with murder, unlawful activities Act and Arms Act.“The challan of the prosecution as such is dismissed. Accused persons are acquitted of the charges leveled against them…by giving them a reasonable benefit of the doubt,” the court said.The court also directed that the file be consigned to records and put before the court again on the arrest of seventh and eighth accused. The two are Fayaz Ahmad Dar alias Jameel-ur-Rehman, general secretary of PoK-based Jihad Council and Mohammad Azhar Ali alias Abdullah Uni, a militant commander who was killed in an encounter in September 2011.Shah, a prominent religious leader and head of Jamiat-Ahli-Hadees, was killed on April 8, 2011, in a blast planted on a cycle when he was entering a mosque for Friday prayers. Shah was also a close aide of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/srinagar-six-acquitted-in-maulvi-showkat-murder-case/story-tln9KdEhdUHP0X6Y64GyYI.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Mr Besra Sparrowhawk and her hubby||A few Besra sparrowhawks have been photographed in the Sukhna Lake jungles in winter when the bird resorts to altitudinal migration from its summer breeding grounds in the Himalayas. A comparatively rare migratory hawk, the bird derives its common English name from Hindi, where Besra is used only for the female of this species. In Hindi, the male is known as Dhotee/Dhooti/Dharti. However, in English both the sexes go by the common name, Besra. The choice of English name underlines the female’s precedence over the male because in raptors or birds of prey, the females are larger and pack more power than males. They are thus preferred by falconers. The word, Besra, itself is derived from Baaz (female Northern goshawk) and denotes the latter’s smaller version while her diminutive hubby, the Dharti, means just about a handful! Since a Besra (Accipiter virgatus) resembles the Shikra, it is confused and mistaken for the latter, a common and very visible hawk of tricity gardens.The Besra’s reticent nature and preference for lofty, dense forests renders it elusive to easy observation. All of this serves to enhance the enigma of this shikari on an annual winter safari to the Sukhna.To fill the void on the Besra, we shall dwell on aspects of its behaviour and character. Once upon a time, the Besra was a well known and understood raptor, especially by native falconers of yore. When it comes to knowledge of raptor behaviour and their distinctive character, there are no better observers than falconers and austringers. While the Besra outwardly resembles a Shikra, the former’s expertise and speed at dodging and twisting through trees/branches, obstacles and dense undergrowth are more allied to the reputed qualities of the Eurasian sparrowhawk. These qualities render the Besra a favourite to trap and train, and thence flown to hunt small birds. A section of falconers were so besotted with the Besra – due to her tenacity/speed – that they even preferred her to the female Eurasian sparrowhawk.Adding to our knowledge of the Besra’s capabilities to hunt down the most twisty of small birds, the distinguished raptor specialist, Rishad Naoroji, wrote: “Capable of rapid aerial manoeuvres and recorded capturing an Asian Palm swift.” Some falconers would train Besras and Shikras to kill small birds and serve these to larger, trained raptors in their mews such as Northern goshawks and Peregrine falcons. The energy of larger raptors was reserved for bigger shikar such as of gazelles, bustards, geese and hares.The most detailed account of the Besra’s prowess – as gleaned from native falconers – was provided by TC Jerdon in his book, Illustrations of Indian Ornithology, published in 1847. “The Besra is said to be somewhat more difficult to train than most of the hawks, and is a delicate bird, and requires great care and attention, especially during the hot season. It is highly esteemed among native falconers, and sells for a considerable price. It is very speedy, and particularly active and clever in the jungle, which its habits, as a denizen of the forests in its wild state, peculiarly fit it for. It is chiefly flown at partridge, which it seizes in general with great ease and certainty; also occasionally at quails, snipes and doves. The male or ‘Dhotee’ (which is smaller than the female) is but seldom trained and is then flown at sparrows, Brahminy mynas etc,” the book stated.Armed with an astute grasp of a wild raptor’s character, falconers would employ cunning methods to outwit these wary, strong birds. “The Besra, and other short-winged hawks, as well as occasionally the Luggur and some of the falcons, are usually caught by what is called among falconers the ‘Do Guz’. This is a small, thin net from four to five feet long, and about three feet broad, stained of a dark colour, and fixed between two thin pieces of bamboo, by a cord on which it runs. The bamboos are fixed lightly in the ground, and a living bird is picketed about the middle of the net and not quite a foot distant from it. The hawk makes a dash at the bird, which it sees struggling at its tether, and in the keenness of its rush, either not observing the net from its dark colour, or not heeding it, dashes into it, the two side sticks give way, and the net folds round the bird (Besra) so effectually as to keep it almost from fluttering,” wrote Jerdon.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-mr-besra-sparrowhawk-and-her-hubby/story-kxncnFuendSUuC562yjUdO.html

12-12-2020||Pune||‘State’s gender budget for FY 2020-21 unfavourable toward women empowerment’||Pune: UNICEF, Maharashtra, in its study, has revealed that Maharashtra’s Gender Budget for financial year 2020-21 is about 7,300 crore, around two per cent of state’s total budget and departments with highest allocations are from tribal, development, social justice, rural development, housing and public health. The findings were presented by Anuradha Nair, social policy specialist, UNICEF, Maharashtra, on Saturday at online national conference on Women@Work, jointly organised by Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE), Mumbai School of Economics, Public Policy (MSEPP), India Development Foundation (IDF) and Pune International Centre. According to Nair, the findings indicate that there have been no interventions for physical health disorders prevalent among women and no allocations for counselling centres for women’s mental health issues while health insurance for sex reassignment surgeries for transgender persons is not allotted. In higher education, no measure is undertaken to prevent dropouts, while the financial assistance for higher education is only 1% of the entire education budget, she said. “There’s a need for a ‘Gender Action Plan’ as women account for 48% of Maharashtra’s population. The reproductive, productive and community roles borne by women has not been addressed by the state. There’s no investment for women’s unpaid care work and to encourage their participation in the economy,” she added.Soma Wadhwa of the IDF who manages the DISHA programme that aims to support underprivileged women in India learn marketable skills said, “For women empowerment, the challenge is to work toward overcoming internal barriers like personality and attitude drawbacks, lack of confidence and education deficiencies and external barriers like gender bias and stereotyping and absence of infrastructural, counselling, socio-political and economic support. We have to establish a continuum of services connecting education to skills, jobs, entrepreneurship, markets and growth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-s-gender-budget-for-fy-2020-21-unfavourable-toward-women-empowerment/story-5jjJkV1dRX13aOy4Q2hWiK.html

12-12-2020||Lucknow||After PG, serve 10 yrs in govt hospital or pay Rs 1 cr: UP govt to docs||Government doctors who take up post-graduate (PG) courses under special provisions in the state medical institutes will now have to serve at least ten years at government hospitals after they complete the course. If they don’t do that, they will have to pay a compensation of Rs 1 crore, government officials said. An order in this regard was issued by the health department on December 9. The order states that government doctors after completing PG courses should return back to their native departments. Additional chief secretary, medical and health, Amit Mohan Prasad said this was a reiteration of the old order issued on April 3, 2017. The provision for government doctors to get seats in PG courses was initiated in 2014 to ensure that government doctors who have done MBBS get an opportunity to do PG courses to become specialists. For this special leave for three-years was granted to doctors who have served certain period in government hospitals, particularly in rural areas. The order (issued on December 9) also clarified that internship after completing the PG courses will not be allowed. Instead, internships can be done at government hospitals where DNB courses are conducted. Government doctors supported the 10-year order but said option for internship should be kept opened, which will be in the interest of the government. “By completing internship, the doctors will be eligible to become faculty at medical colleges,” said Dr Amit Singh, secretary provincial medical services association (PMSA) the body of government doctors. “A doctor who joins service has roughly 40 years to perform duty. If initial 5-years of service and three years of PG are taken out still over 30-years are there to serve at government institutions,” said Dr Singh. “Government is opening new medical colleges and these doctors can also become faculty in different colleges. And as per the order they can teach new students and even serve the patients while running MBBS/speciality courses,” said Dr Sachin Vaish, president of the PMSA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-pg-serve-10-yrs-in-govt-hospital-or-pay-rs-1-cr-up-govt-to-docs/story-whDyRzbETQPi9TZUdLNwLM.html

12-12-2020||Dehradun||Bihar youth’s arduous journey from working at snack factory to becoming Army officer||From earning Rs 50 per day in a snack factory in Odisha, becoming a sepoy in the Indian Army to graduating from the Indian Military Academy, it has been a long and arduous journey for 28-year-old Balbanka Tiwari from Sundarpur Barja village of Ara town in Bihar’s Bhojpur district. Saturday was a special day for him as he participated in the passing out parade with 325 other Indian Gentleman Cadets, as he met his daughter for the first time three months of her birth.Remembering his journey to proudly donning the officer’s uniform, Tiwari said that he had “struggled a lot” to see this day. Hailing from an economically deprived family, he had worked at a snack factory earning Rs 50 per day while pursuing school education and used work as a tuition teacher after completing high school to support his family. “My family’s financial condition was not so good. My father is a farmer and we used to live in a joint family. The only son of the two siblings (the other being daughter), I had no choice but to work after passing class X,” Tiwari said. He said, “To find work after passing matric, I went to Rourkela in Odisha in 2008. There, I first worked at an iron fittings factory for a few months, then at a snack factory earning Rs 50/day till class 12 which I passed from Odisha.”Remembering his days of struggle, Tiwari said that after passing high school, he also started working as a tuition teacher to earn some extra money which he could send back to his family in Bihar. He also got himself admitted in a local college for graduation and one day his uncle informed him about an army recruitment rally in Danapur area near his home in Bihar.

I appeared in the test and passed in the second attempt and joined as a sepoy. My posting was at the army’s EME centre in Bhopal in 2012,” said Tiwari. While serving in Bhopal, he came to know about the Army Cadet College (ACC) for getting promoted to the rank of an officer from a sepoy. “I cracked the test and joined ACC in IMA in January 2017. From there, I finally commissioned as an army officer today,” he said. His achievement got him double joy as he met his newly born daughter for the first time after three months. “The day has become more memorable for me as I also met my daughter for the first time since her birth three months ago. I will now spend some time with her before joining my regiment,” said Tiwari. His wife, Ruchi, who had come from Bihar along with his mother to witness him being commissioned, expressed happiness on seeing her husband as an army officer.“He has struggled a lot in his life to see this day. I am now very happy to see him fulfilling his dream. I am sure he will make us and the country proud by serving as an army officer,” she said.Also read: All farmers’ leaders to go on hunger strike on Dec 14 as protests intensifyThe IMA had allowed only two family members to attend the IMA passing out parade because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mahatma Housing Society, one of the popular residential societies in Kothrud, has taken the decision as it wants to maintain the quality of its internal roads. Spread over 72 acres, the society that houses bungalows and apartment has 5.5 km of internal roads that it takes care of from the maintenance charges collected from residents. Mahesh Gole, president of Mahatma Society, said, “Our internal roads were constructed 10 years back and it is in good condition. We don’t compromise with quality. Few years back, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) had carried out some work at the society by digging roads. However, we observed that repairing did not bring the surface of the road in its original status and we had to spend money on it. Hence, we took the decision to charge money for digging so that we can repair or restore work and maintain the road in good condition. Recently, MSEDCL carried out another work. At that time, we demanded royalty and deposit for work and they gave us. After work, we returned the deposit.” Gole said that PMC wants to lay water pipelines for the 24x7 water project. “We have demanded digging charges and deposits from private companies for digging roads,” he said. Nandkumar Jagtap, superintendent of water supply department, PMC said, “The housing society has written to PMC, but there is no provision in the Municipal Corporation Act. If they are not allowing us, we have to act according to the Act and carry out work under police protection. Though it is private property, we are doing public work.” The civic body collects digging charges per running meter. It charges Rs 10,155 per meter for digging and restoration of road. For government agencies, PMC charges 50 per cent digging charges. It provides special concession in rate to agencies like MSEDCL, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) that is Rs 2,350 per meter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/hsg-soc-seeks-road-digging-charges-from-pmc/story-BVKnfjrOmYmqHiMo1wtr9J.html
12-12-2020||City||3 MP Covid-19 patients die after power cut interrupts oxygen supply, CM orders probe||The MP state government has ordered an inquiry in connection to the deaths of three Covid-19 patients whose conditions allegedly deteriorated after interruption in oxygen supply due to power cut in government-run Hamidia hospital in Bhopal on Friday evening, said an official.The dead were identified as former corporator from Bhopal, Akbar Khan, 67, Babulal, 70, and Mohammad Khalil, 70.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday morning ordered an inquiry in the matter.Bhopal division commissioner Kavindra Kiyawat suspended a public works department sub-engineer as electricity generator tripped within 10 minutes after the power cut.A show-cause notice has also been served to the dean of Gandhi Medical College and superintendent of Hamidia hospital said the commissioner.According to a doctor of the hospital, 11 patients, including Khan, Babulal and Mohammad Khalil were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital.Also read: All farmers’ leaders to go on hunger strike on Dec 14 as protests intensify“Some of them were on ventilators while some were getting oxygen through high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) machine but after a power cut, the oxygen supply got interrupted as the HFNC didn’t have any power back-up. Even, the ventilators stopped working after a few minutes due to low power back-up. The condition of patients deteriorated and the on-duty doctors provided oxygen to them through Ambu bags. But three of them died after a few hours. The electricity supply was restored after two hours,” said a doctor who didn’t wish to be named. Akbar Khan’s brother Mehmood Khan said, “My brother was recovering from the disease but mismanagement of the hospital claimed his life.”However, Bhopal division commissioner Kavindra Kiyawat said, “According to an initial inquiry report, there is a three-level system of power supply in Hamidia hospital. If the power supply is snapped from an electricity office, the hospital has generators as a power backup system. If the power backup system also fails, all the important machines, including ventilators, have inbuilt batteries which provide power backup of 2 to 4 hours.”“The power was resumed in two hours. It is wrong to blame the power cut for the deaths of Covid 19 patients. An on-duty doctor Tahir Ali was present in the ward and he checked every machine was working. However, the action was taken against sub-engineer as power backup system of the hospital failed due to technical glitch,” he added.Hamidia hospital superintendent Dr ID Chaurasiya said, “Akbar Khan was suffering from many diseases including cardiac problem, diabetes and high blood pressure. He died due to comorbidities. The other patients also died of the same reasons.”Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “The death of three patients is very unfortunate. The commissioner is holding an inquiry in the matter. Based on the report of the inquiry, further action will be taken.”MP Congress Committee (MPCC) spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta demanded the resignation of medical education and health minister.“Hamidia hospital is known as one of the best government hospitals in MP. The power cut interrupted oxygen supply and claimed three lives in the hospital. This exposed the poor health facilities in MP and failure of BJP-led state government. The health minister and medical education minister should resign from their posts,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-mp-covid-19-patients-die-after-power-cut-interrupts-oxygen-supply-cm-orders-probe/story-FZrzTcs3E5Q3OX2zlWgT8I.html

12-12-2020||Pune||Smart City projects at Wadgaonsheri, Bibwewadi in Pune lie unused||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been developing amenity spaces under the Pune Smart City’s place making initiative, however, apathy by various civic departments has led to some projects lying unused. PMC implemented some of the place making concepts in Wadgaonsheri and Bibwewadi areas with the theme of ecology and innovation. However, after its construction, it is laying unused as neither the Bhavan department (which developed it) nor the garden department is taking responsibility of maintaining the place making projects. Now, the local corporator wants the space to be developed into a maternity home, which the civic body is not keen on. At Wadgaonsheri, the objective was to provide space for experimenting technological innovations for sustainable surroundings like urban farming and organic farming. This was also to encourage citizens to educate themselves with such practices as the area is surrounded by various IT firms. The area in Wadgaonsheri has been developed on 2163.75 square metres adjacent to the Pune-Ahmednagar highway near San Francis School by spending over Rs 1 crore. At Bibvewadi, e-Learning/skill development concept was replicated on 7,000 square feet. While both the place making projects were completed two years ago, there has been no use of them at all due to lack of maintenance. The Bhavan department had requested the garden department to take responsibility for maintaining and handling the project. However, the garden department refused to take responsibility stating that such projects do not come under their department. With no utilisation, the places are littered with anti-social elements and has been damaged by miscreants. Shivaji Lanke, head of Bhavan department, PMC, said, “It is true that we developed two places, which are not in use so far. We had requested the garden department to maintain. We also requested the security department to provide security to avoid damage and theft of structure. But, it did not work out. Now, we have decided to float tenders for maintenance, so that people can use it.” Ashok Ghorpade, chief superintendent of garden department, said, “Place making project does not come under the garden department. Bhavan department should have to looked at it. The area is small and not a concept garden at all.” Shewta Galande, local corporator of Wadgaonsheri area, said, “As the project is lying idle, we submitted a proposal to build a maternity home so that the space can be utilised. However, we have not received any written assurance. PMC has wasted public funds on place making projects and it is not useful for local people at all. PMC should develop amenity spaces for social purposes which is useful for the public.” What is place making? Place making is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Place making capitalizes on a local community’s assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people’s health, happiness, and well-being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/smart-city-projects-at-wadgaonsheri-bibwewadi-in-pune-lie-unused/story-vBGsfzBb5qYyRwWOT5ZKLM.html

CM instructed authorities to launch a special campaign against drug mafia and addiction from December 15 to December 22 as advised by the NCB, as per official information. The CM’s instructions came during a meeting with officials concerned on Friday.“Those who trade in drugs and narcotics are enemies of humanity. They should not be spared under any circumstances. Strict action should be taken against the drug mafia in the state. For this, a special campaign should be launched to attack their roots,” Chouhan is reported to have said. The districts with high prevalence of drug trafficking include Indore, Ujjain, Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam in Malwa region, Jabalpur, Chhindwara and Narsinghpur in Mahakoshal region apart from Bhopal, Hoshangabad, Gwalior, Satna, Sagar, Datia and Rewa.

The police should not deal with them aggressively, added the CM. Chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, director general of police Vivek Johri and additional chief secretary Home Rajesh Rajora were among those present at the meeting. Chouhan also asked for strict action in cases of attempts to supply drugs and narcotics at gyms, pubs, clubs, college canteens, schools etc. He declared that Hookah lounges will not be operated in the state.

12-12-2020||Delhi||Security at Delhi borders increased after farmers’ announcement to intensify stir||The Delhi Police has increased security arrangements at the city’s border points following the announcement by agitating farmers to block the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra Expressways on Saturday to further intensify their protest against the Centre’s new agri laws.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various areas on Delhi’s borders for the last 16 days and demanding that the legislations be withdrawn. The police have made adequate arrangements and these include multi-layered barricading and deployment of personnel. Measures have also been taken to ensure commuters do not face inconvenience at places were protest are being staged, a senior police officer said.The Delhi Traffic Police has deployed its personnel across important border points to ensure commuters do not face difficulties and is constantly updating people about open and closed routes on its Twitter handle.The developments come after farmer leaders on Wednesday rejected a government proposal to amend the new agri laws and announced they would intensify their agitation by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Yamuna expressway by Saturday.In a tweet, the traffic police on Saturday informed commuters about the closure of the Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari and Mangesh borders.Since these borders are closed, it suggested that motorists take alternative routes via Lampur, Safiabad,Saboli and Singhu School toll tax borders.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK Road. So, commuters have been advised to avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road and National Highway-44, the traffic police said. Due to the ongoing farmers’ protests, it said that both the Chilla and the Ghazipur borders are also closed for traffic from Noida and Ghaziabad.“The Chilla & Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi due to farmers protests.People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara & bhopra borders,” it tweeted.The Tikri and the Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement but the Jhatikara border is open only for two wheelers and pedestrian movement, the traffic police said in a tweet.Those going towards Haryana, can take Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders as they are open, the traffic police said.The government had asked farmer groups to consider its proposals for amending the laws to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want.Farmers leaders on Thursday also announced they would block railway tracks across the country if their demands were not met by the government and would announce a date for that soon.At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting on various borders of the national capital for over two weeks, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws.The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/security-at-delhi-borders-increased-after-farmers-announcement-to-intensify-stir/story-uaz3uLGNmxBsEZFAihxxuN.html

On Thursday, the AQI settled at 284, also in the same category. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that with a western disturbance impacting the entire region, pollution levels are not expected to worsen much over the weekend. Winds are likely to pick up during the day and settle the pollution levels, he said. “The wind speed reduced to 6kmph and the direction also changed from north-westerly to easterly on Friday. Some areas in Haryana have received rainfall on Friday afternoon,” said Srivastava. He said that the average wind speed in Delhi is likely to remain around 8-10kmph on Saturday and Sunday, which means that the air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” zone till Monday. “The western disturbance will pass on Saturday and the wind direction will change back to north-westerly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/light-rain-in-parts-of-delhi-ncr-air-quality-worsens/story-w9zbRlvKCJ8whJjPHP8nSO.html

12-12-2020||Patna||Delay in cabinet expansion of Nitish Kumar govt raises eyebrows||The NDA government in Bihar led by chief minister Nitish Kumar is about to complete a month in office next week and the delay in the much-awaited cabinet expansion is raising eyebrows in political circles.Speculations are rife that the induction of new ministers has become a tricky issue between two major allies in the NDA, JD(U) and the BJP, over sharing of portfolios and ministerial berths.According to some, the JD(U), with only 43 MLAs compared to BJP’s 74, is not keen on a cabinet expansion at the moment due to apprehensions that it could stoke resentment among a section of party legislators, who may not be made ministers due to party’s claim on fewer cabinet berths this time.Party leaders aware of the developments said some key decisions including on cabinet expansion could be taken at JD(U)’s national council meeting on December 27.NDA insiders said the cabinet expansion was originally supposed to take place soon after the conclusion of the first session of the 17th assembly, held in the last week of November. BJP’s likely claim on key portfolios like rural development, rural works and few other field departments that have been with the JD(U), could also be causing the delay, they said.There is also lack of consensus on the number of new ministers to be inducted from both the JD(U) and the BJP, though it is understood that the national party will get a higher share of cabinet berths. Out of the maximum of 36 ministers, JD(U) could get 14 berths while the BJP could get 18-20.Right now, there are 14 ministers in the cabinet including the chief minister following the resignation of former education minister Mewalal Choudhary of the JD(U) following a hue and cry over corruption charges. Choudhary’s portfolio was allotted to building construction minister Ashok Choudhary. Currently, there are four ministers from the JD(U) and seven from the BJP with one minister each from HAM(S) and VIP, smaller allies in the NDA government.“There are internal dynamics at play with the BJP, now a senior partner in the NDA, bargaining hard for certain key portfolios and also in other matters like reshuffling in the state bureaucracy and putting its leaders in various committees. This is all taking time and an expansion would take place once these matters are sorted between JD(U), BJP and smaller allies,” said an NDA leader, wishing not to be quoted.Also Read: Fodder scam: No relief for Lalu this year as bail hearing deferred for six weeksHe added that the expansion had got delayed because of the BJP central leadership and top Union ministers getting caught up in the farmers stir in New Delhi over the contentious farm laws.“It is not a comfortable position for the JD(U) with depleted strength in the NDA and a decision cannot be taken fast. So, there is a feeling that delaying a cabinet expansion is the best solution as it could help in dealing with certain tricky issues over the period,” said a senior JD(U) leader.Many feel, if the cabinet expansion does not take place by December 15, it would be done in mid January, since the period of Kharmas--from mid December till January 14-- is not considered auspicious for undertaking new ventures as per astrological beliefs.Meanwhile, state president of the BJP, Sanjay Jaiswal, said the expansion would take place at an opportune time while calling the reports of certain contentious points between the JD(U) and the BJP holding it up as mere speculation.“The expansion will take place at the right time. Everybody would get to know about it,” he said. JD(U) state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the expansion of the cabinet was a prerogative of the chief minister and a decision would be taken at the highest level of NDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/delay-in-cabinet-expansion-of-nitish-kumar-govt-raises-eyebrows/story-OAihGlH6xlnChF94DxWMQL.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers lay siege to toll plazas in Haryana, allow free movement of vehicles||Farmers overpowered staff at several toll plazas in Haryana allowing toll- free movement of all vehicles from Friday midnight. Following a call by farmer union leaders, the toll plazas on Delhi-Chandigarh national highway 44 at Bastara in Karnal and at Panipat were put under siege along with Kaithal toll plaza on Hisar-Chandigarh national highway (NH 152), Milk-Majra toll plaza on Panchkula-Saharanpur highway in Yamunanagar and Gullarpur toll plaza on Assandh-Karnal highway.The farmers have also held protests at the toll plazas and accused the government of forcing the farmers to take such steps. While the district administrations issued prohibitory orders and imposed section 144 CrPC, but the police did not take any action to stop the farmers.The call to make all toll plazas free for a day was given by the farmer unions to intensify their agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws after several rounds of talks with the government remained inconclusive. “Exactly at midnight, protesters reached the toll plazas and asked officials to allow the movement of all vehicles without charging any toll. They removed the barricades,” said an official at the Karnal toll plaza, requesting anonymity. The toll officials were not ready to speak over the development on record. Also read: Farmers Protest Live Updates: 3,500 police personnel to be deployed at 5 Delhi-Haryana toll plazasThe protesters said that they will stay at the toll plaza for the next 24 hours to ensure the free movement of all vehicles. “We have made toll plazas free for all commuters from midnight and will leave after 24 hours,” said their leader, Sewa Singh Arya. Police deployed at the toll plaza could not stop the protesters. Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said police have been deployed at the toll plazas to ensure people do not disturb the law and order. “We will ensure that nobody violates the prohibitory orders in place and the deployment is being increased,” Punia said. On Saturday morning, when the farmers left briefly, the toll officials started charging toll, but the farmers returned after half an hour and again forced toll officials to allow vehicles to pass without paying.On Thursday, the Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president, Gurnam Singh Charuni, said that during meetings with the Union government they have made it clear that their agitation will continue till the three laws are revoked. “We have now decided that all farmers will port their (Jio) mobile phone numbers to other service providers and on December 12 all toll plazas will be made free for all for one day. On December 14, the agitation will be intensified by holding protests at all district headquarters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-overpower-staff-at-toll-plazas-on-chandigarh-delhi-highway-allow-free-movement-of-vehicles/story-hxe6t1eqdUYD142XATlpPM.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi wakes up to light drizzle, AQI likely to improve||The national capital and its neighbouring areas received light drizzle on Saturday, as was the forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).The IMD had forecast that Delhi and the neighbouring towns are likely to receive rainfall on December 11 and December 12. This is also likely to improve the air quality of the city.“Light intensity rain would occur over south-Delhi, south-west Delhi, Dwarka, and IGI airport during the next 2 hours,” IMD said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that Delhi and the neighbouring satellite towns are likely to receive light rainfall between December 11 and December 12, as a result of a Western Disturbance passing over the Himalayas. After the passing of this Western Disturbance, the minimum temperature in Delhi is expected to fall by at least three to four degrees Celsius.“From December 14, temperatures will start falling again. North-westerly winds from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which have been receiving a good spell of snowfall, will be carrying cold winds. This will bring down the temperature here,” said Srivastava.He said that in the second week of November, the minimum temperature had fallen to 6.3 degree Celsius, but it rose again because of a few Western Disturbances that passed over Delhi-NCR in the last week of the month and the first week of December. He said that the frequent change in the wind direction to easterly had also caused the temperature to remain on the higher end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-light-drizzle-aqi-likely-to-improve/story-4rrAiv6AxSn5fL3g4ahO2J.html
12-12-2020||Lucknow||Minor accuses man of forcing her to convert in UP, FIR filed||A minor Hindu girl has filed an FIR against a Muslim man in Sahabad area of Uttar Pradesh’s Hardoi district, accusing him of forcing her to convert her religion “if she wanted to marry him”. Police on Friday said the man has been booked under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Hardoi superintendent of police (SP) Anurag Vats said the FIR was registered against a person identified only as Azad in the FIR at the Shahabad police station. He said the complainant stated that she and the accused were in a relationship for the past two years and the man had promised to marry her. The SP said the girl alleged in the FIR that the man asked her to convert to Islam if she wanted to marry him just before the wedding on November 30. “The IPC section of rape was included in the FIR as she alleged that the accused sexually exploited her on pretext of marriage,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/minor-accuses-man-of-forcing-her-to-convert-in-up-fir-filed/story-TxJK3EbSdfZdQYxAmWJUwM.html
12-12-2020||Lucknow||Plea filed against UP’s ‘love jihad’ law in HC||A lawyer from Uttar Pradesh challenged the constitutional validity of Uttar Pradesh’s controversial ordinance against religious conversions by marriage, coercion or enticement before the Allahabad high court on Friday, arguing that the state had no role to play in the personal choice of individuals in matters of marriage and religion. The petition, filed by advocate Saurabh Kumar, also sought an immediate stay on the operation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, apart from directions to the state government to not take any coercive action against individuals, including registration of FIRs. The ordinance, said the plea, gives a license to police authorities to terrorise and harass inter-faith couples who want to exercise their right to marry according to their choice, under the guise of “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe a relationship between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.“The ordinance, which has completely failed to strike a balance between freedoms and mala fide conversions, has been passed and is being implemented in much haste and reckless manner without ensuring that the same does not curb one’s Fundamental Rights or hamper national integration instead,” added the petition. The petition came days after a division bench of the high court, in a case of an interfaith marriage, held that the right to live with a person of his/her choice irrespective of religion was intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty. The petition, citing this two-judge bench in addition to the Supreme Court’s rulings in the Kerala ‘love-jihad’ case on the need to respect choices and autonomy of adult women and the right to privacy case, contended that the ordinance, which was promulgated on November 28, led to an unreasonable intrusion into the domain of personal autonomy. According to the lawyer-petitioner, the state government assumed a ‘tone-deaf’ position when it chose to ignore all these pertinent judgments by the constitutional courts and went ahead with promulgating the ordinance. No date was fixed by the high court to take up this petition. Similar petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court, which is also yet to examine any of these pleas. The Uttar Pradesh law outlawed religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement, and prescribed up to 10 years imprisonment for those found guilty. The law – under which at least 30 people have been booked and 10 people arrested -- includes a provision to void a marriage if it is solemnised primarily to convert a woman’s faith. The burden of proof is on the person who converted, and those who performed the conversion. The ordinance was cleared by the state cabinet days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to end “love jihad” in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/plea-filed-against-up-s-love-jihad-law-in-hc/story-AtKdTegiZiVN1Tpe38ZlCL.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A tale of two times||Old Delhi and New Delhi. Old Gurugram and New Gurugram. In both cases the ‘old’ and ‘new’ parts stand very close to each other, and yet they are so different.In the National Capital Region, one place where you can witness this contrast between old and new very starkly is Gurugram’s Civil Lines. There, the Church of the Epiphany is located in a compound of lawns, flowers and playgrounds. But it’s the two church buildings, separated by a little garden, that grab all the attention.Wings of the same church, one is more than 150 years old. The other is a millennial—it was consecrated in 2009.Surely, the older building is instantly eye-catching because of its historical colonial-era architecture—it can easily pass off as a parish church in some sleepy village of Victorian England. Built for British officers serving in the district, the red brick structure sparkles as a souvenir with its tall narrow lancet windows, a tiny bell tower, and a gabled roof.The newer church is way larger, but less ostentatious. Elegant in its disarming simplicity, it is as if she was confident of her place in time and did not want to outshine its elderly counterpart. The front is all straight lines and sharp angles. The plainness is calming.Inside the old church, the ceiling rests on a frame of timber roof truss. The wooden beams crisscross like musical elegies to yesterday’s world. A red carpet stretches out to the altar. The stained glass panel behind the metal cross shows the crucifixion. While the scenes outside the windows seem like another planet. The sun barely percolates. In a dramatic contrast, the sunlight fills up every possible crevices inside the newer edifice. So sprawling, so airy. The new church’s subdued styling is amiably complimented by the white of the walls. On sunny noons, the daylight streams into the hall through the church’s wide glass door and its tall windows, including a round skylight near the roof. Among other things, the prayer hall has a Yamaha synthesizer and two pianos. When it is empty, the silence in the new building is so haunting that one fears to even think of anything unsuitable—what if the thought echoes out loud?The church(es) opens daily from 7am to 8pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-tale-of-two-times/story-VSn7gAPZAlWIn2EX1X91LJ.html
12-12-2020||Pune||Minor kills girlfriend’s kin, commits suicide||A 17-year-old boy knifed his girlfriend’s 68-year-old grandmother and 10-year-old brother to death in Maharashtra’s Nagpur city before ending his life by jumping in front of a moving train on Thursday night. The teenager stormed the house of the girl’s family and attacked the victims, slitting their throats and stabbing them. The crime was apparently a fallout of the family’s objection to the friendship between the teenager and the 20-year-old granddaughter. Following a complaint by the victims’ family, the local Gittikhadan police registered a case of murder against the teenager, who reportedly killed himself by jumping before a train. His body was found on tracks. Sunil Chavan, the investigating officer, confirmed the incident, saying that there had been repeated altercations between the teenager and his girlfriend’s family in the past few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/minor-kills-girlfriend-s-kin-commits-suicide/story-u2DFV9pnrue2J3SaQCp4oM.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds Centre’s decision to divert MPLAD funds to combat Covid-19||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday upheld the central government’s decision to divert the funds allotted under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) that had challenged the move. The PIL had challenged an April 8 circular of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MSPI), which had suspended the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme for 2020-21 and 2021-22. The litigation had claimed that as the funds were required by the Members of Parliament (MPs) of each area for uplifting their constituencies, the suspension for two years should be set aside. The ministry, however, had justified the decision by stating that as the nation was trying to combat the pandemic, the MPLAD scheme funds were being diverted to the finance ministry for the larger public good, and hence the PIL should be dismissed. HC concurred with the ministry and held that the petitioner’s contentions were not in public interest, and hence, the litigants’ Rs1-lakh security deposit were forfeited and transferred to the Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while passing the judgment in the PIL filed by Neelima Vartak through advocate Shekhar Jagtap, held that the suspension ordained by the circular in question did not abrogate any legal right of a citizen that would warrant judicial intervention. The bench further held that though the petitioner had claimed that the suspension of MPLAD funds would adversely affect that citizens as well as MPs, neither had approached the court with such a grievance and hence, the petitioner’s claims did not have any merit. Justifying the suspension of the funds, the court in its order held, “For achieving another dominant public purpose, the government would indeed be within its power, competence and authority to rescind/suspend a scheme.” The court further said that as combatting the pandemic took centre stage, the decision of the government was justified. “In the given situation, the fight against Covid-19 has to take centre-stage over all other developmental works which are sought to be secured by utilising the MPLAD Scheme funds. The decision contained in the impugned circular is, thus, unexceptionable,” it held. In light of these observations, the court held, “This PIL appears to us to be misconceived because it seeks to impeach justifiable executive action and has no element of public interest in it, far less a genuine public interest. In such view of the matter, we have no hesitation to dismiss the same. It is ordered accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-centre-s-decision-to-divert-mplad-funds-to-combat-covid-19/story-YTrNWSInkh58TqwTSgR6PI.html
12-12-2020||City||11 years on, consumer body asks petitioner to approach court||It took 11 years for the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to ask a Mulund resident, who had approached the panel in 2009 stating that her ornaments worth Rs1.30 crore were stolen from the locker of a nationalised bank, to approach a civil court with her grievances. “This matter, as discernible from the material on record and from specificities of the evidence involved, is not such as can be aptly adjudicated on merit in summary proceedings by a quasi-judicial forum like the consumer commission,” said NCDRC presiding member Dinesh Singh. NCDRC asked the petitioner, Saroj Dasani, to approach the civil court concerned, saying the matter is best undertaken by a civil court for its apt adjudication on merit and to do justice to it, as the matter required recording of extensive oral and documentary evidence. Dasani in her complaint had said that she had opened a locker at the Mulund (West) branch of the bank in June 2008, and had kept some important papers and valuables like diamond ornaments in the locker. When she visited the bank a month later, she had forgotten the keys to the locker on the desk of the bank’s locker in-charge. When she visited the bank the next time, she had found that her valuables were there in the locker. However, on November 17, 2008, when she visited the bank again and opened the locker, Dasani found the locker empty, said her complaint. She immediately lodged a complaint in writing with the branch manager. The complainant believed that someone had made duplicate keys of her locker when she had forgotten the original set at the bank, and had used them to steal her valuables. She stated that the locker cannot be opened without the master key, which is in the possession of a bank officer and hence, the bank was fully responsible for the theft of her valuables worth Rs1.30 crore. The bank had responded to the complaint, contending that the locker was also being operated independently by the complainant’s husband. The bank had also asserted that the matter required adjudication of issues that involve disputed questions of facts and therefore, the matter should not be adjudged in summary proceedings before the consumer commission, but by a civil court. This year on December 8, NCDRC accepted the bank’s contention and returned the complaint, with liberty to the complainant to knock doors of the competent civil court with her grievances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/11-years-on-consumer-body-asks-petitioner-to-approach-court/story-euBY10zZ2I82vlPbyPDmoJ.html

12-12-2020||Mumbai||CBI books 2 Gujarat firms for duping banks of ₹72 crore||The Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) Mumbai unit has booked two Gujarat-based companies for allegedly duping two erstwhile banks – State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore – of Rs71.88 crore by defaulting loan repayments. The probe into the case has revealed that the directors of the firms misused the funds for other purpose and not for the stated purpose of expanding their businesses, said officers. The accused have been identified as Paresh Dayaljibhai Patel, managing director of Sayona Colours Private Limited; and the directors of its associate firm Shamrock Chemie Private Limited. CBI’s banking securities frauds branch (BSFB) had recently registered a first information report (FIR) against the accused on a complaint filed by Jitendra Shankar, deputy general manager (corporate stressed asset management branch), State Bank of India. The complainant stated that the promoter and directors of Sayona Colours Private Limited, represented by Patel and managing director late Brijesh Jayantibhai Patel, as well as the directors of Shamrock Chemie Private Limited, and some unknown government officials entered into criminal conspiracy during 2009-2015 to cheat State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore by manipulation of books of accounts and diversion of funds. The complaint had stated that Sayona Colours Private Limited was enjoying various credit facilities from the two banks. The account of the company became a non-performing asset (NPA) on October 27, 2014, following which the State Bank of India conducted its forensic audit. The audit revealed that the firm had discontinued the production of its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products on December 31, 2013, and the production was transferred to its associate firm Shamrock Chemie Private Limited. The FIR had further alleged that the company had also transferred the entire plant and machinery, approximately worth Rs9.09 crore to Shamrock Chemie Private Limited in 2013-14 without seeking permission from the bank or informing it. It was alleged that Patel and Brijesh Jayantibhai Patel had diverted funds worth Rs23.16 crore, borrowed from the banks, to Shamrock Chemie Private Limited, to themselves and their family members during 2009-2015. CBI’s preliminary probe has disclosed that the accused had committed cognisable offences of criminal conspiracy through manipulation of records, cheating and criminal misconduct/abuse of official position. They have been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Corruption Act. Investigators said they would soon be calling the employees of the two companies as well as of the erstwhile banks, who were involved in facilitating the loans to these two companies, for questioning on the financial irregularities. Despite several attempts, the accused did not respond to HT’s calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-books-2-gujarat-firms-for-duping-banks-of-72-crore/story-eS9hzYkIzRdSciv0b6bgBO.html

The police have also been asked as to how much manpower and vehicles would be deployed and whether any arrangement is possible for video recording the entire transit.The details have been sought by the high court bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill by December 21 on the plea of Bishnoi, who had submitted that he was actively involved in politics while in DAV College, Sector 10, Chandigarh. He had been active thereafter as well, on account of which he had a lot of political rivalry, leading to his involvement in a large number of cases in Haryana and Punjab.Bishnoi is now sought to be nominated as accused in some FIRs in Chandigarh as well, his lawyer, Prateek Gupta had told the court. Gupta added that Bishnoi has an apprehension that in case he is brought to Chandigarh on production warrants, he may be eliminated by way of some encounter as was done in the infamous case of Vikas Dubey, the UP gangster who was killed in an encounter earlier this year.Bishnoi had sought directions that his physical presence in May 2020 FIRs be dispensed with and he be interrogated through video conferencing and if still required to be taken out of jail he be handcuffed. Bishnoi is in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur jail for the past five years.Police want to bring Bishnoi on production warrants in the firing incident at hotelier-businessman Rakesh Singla’s Sector 33 bungalow on May 31.

12-12-2020||City||Mohali gears up for Covid-19 vaccine rollout||The district task force for vaccine introduction has deliberated upon the administration’s storage and distribution plan as Mohali prepares for a smooth rollout of the Covid-19 remedy.Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said on Friday that the vaccine is expected to be delivered to the district by December end or early in January 2021. Keeping this in view, training of the staff involved in the administration of the vaccine has been planned and vaccination sites have been earmarked.In the first round, 9,515 registered frontline workers from government and private institutions will be immunised. Primarily, the vaccine would be administered in health institutions since every beneficiary has to be kept under observation for about half an hour to monitor adverse event following immunization (AEFI), if any. If need be, schools, community halls, gram panchayat/ municipality buildings would be put to use with dedicated vaccination teams, the DC informed.The vaccine administration site or the session site will have three well-ventilated dedicated rooms/areas — waiting room for beneficiary line-up, vaccination room where the shots would be given and observation room for monitoring of AEFI.The IEC (information, education and communication) logistics have also been worked out since primary vaccine administration may or may not require follow up shots or the booster dose per beneficiary. “We are designing a fool-proof methodology so that each beneficiary gets requisite, timely, proper dosage of the vaccine as per the directions of health authorities,” said Dayalan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-gears-up-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/story-jcKBJ2w1UgW6sMJhGLs03O.html

12-12-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka to promulgate ordinance against cow slaughter: CM||Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa said on Friday that the state government will promulgate an ordinance to enact the bill against cow slaughter, after the Karnataka legislative council got adjourned sine die without taking up the contentious bill.The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020 makes the slaughter of a cow or a bull or a buffalo under the age of 13 a punishable offence. Any violation will invite a jail term between three and seven years, and/or a fine between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh.The bill was passed by the assembly on Wednesday, amid din, with stiff opposition from Congress. The legislative council was adjourned sine die on Thursday, and the bill is yet to be tabled there for passage.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lacks the numbers to sail through the Legislative Council, a move necessary to make it a law. The party has just 31 of the 75 members. In order to have the bill passed in the council, the BJP would need the support of the 14 member Janata Dal (Secular). JD(S) leader and former CM H D Kumaraswamy said on Friday that the bill in its current form could lead to harassment of farmers. Earlier in the day, the chief minister held a special ‘gau puja’ (cow worshipping ceremony) at his official residence. “The whole world knows that Hindu dharma worships cows. We will promulgate an ordinance as the council did not cooperate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-to-promulgate-ordinance-against-cow-slaughter-cm/story-u6NTUQOqT9fc3uzDAbEV8K.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC questions state claim over Mumbai Metro shed plot||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday questioned the Maharashtra government’s claim of ownership over 102 acres of land at Kanjurmarg being used for the construction of a Metro car depot. The plot has also become a serious bone of contention between the state and the Central government.“In so many documents, the state government has admitted the Central government’s ownership of the land...MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) has admitted that the land belongs to the Central government,” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni.The bench was referring to the December 2019 letter written by the additional chief secretary (ACS) of the urban development department (UDD) to the ministry of commerce, requesting the Central government to handover possession of the Kanjurmarg land to MMRDA.“The additional chief secretary has acknowledged the position that the land belongs to the Central government,” said the bench. “And, this is as late as December 4, 2019.”HC also referred to MMRDA’s admission that the land belonged to the Central government and had even offered to pay the market price for the 102-acre plot.In this backdrop, HC asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state government’s explanation to the admissions. Kumbhakoni responded saying that the ACS, UDD is not an official of the revenue department and does not know about the title of the land. Mere admission by a party does not confer the title of the land on some other person, he said, citing Supreme Court rulings in support of his contention.The advocate general said if the Central government is claiming ownership of the salt pan land, they will have to make out a proper case. “Admittedly, this land [102 acres at Kanjurmarg] was not part of any disputes or litigations, and therefore, any reference or admission of ownership by the Central government is irrelevant,” he added.Answering the court’s query about possession of the land, Kumbhakoni claimed there was absolutely no documentary evidence to show that the Central government was ever in possession of the land in issue. He said there was no mention of any activity undertaken by the Centre on this land nor did they raise any objection when part of the property was reserved for various public purposes under the 1967 development plan for the city.“The principle is that possession follows the title,” Kumbhakoni pointed out. “There is no record to show actual possession of the salt department,” he added.He further claimed that the Centre was claiming ownership over the salt pan land by virtue of three notifications issued in 1906, 1917 and 1920, for the acquisition of huge tracts of land in the belt for salt manufacturing. However, only one of them culminated in an award – for acquiring only 11 acres, and no award was passed in two other notifications – resulting in Lansing of the proceedings.Kumbhakoni was responding to a petition filed by the Central government seeking a stay on the Metro car shed work at Kanjurmarg.On Friday, senior advocate Milind Sathe, who represented MMRDA, urged the court to not stay the ongoing work at the site, claiming that the car depot and its timely completion was very crucial for the entire Metro project.Sathe pointed out that even the Central government was not averse to giving the land for the Metro car depot and pointed out the reply by the ministry of commerce to the letter written by ACS, UDD merely insisting on a joint survey of the land before it is handed over for the Metro car depot.HC has now posted the matter for further hearing on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-questions-state-claim-over-mumbai-metro-shed-plot/story-MbGzci8wEqaYVxHLn0kA8O.html

12-12-2020||Mumbai||Smooth travel in Mumbai Metropolitan Region by 2030: It’ll have a familiar ring road to it||For decades, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) – an emerging metropolis with an area of 6,335sqkm (2.1% of Maharashtra’s total area), nine key municipal corporations and 36% contribution towards the state’s gross domestic product (GDP) – has remained poorly connected to the financial hub, Mumbai. The commute is heavily dependent on the overburdened suburban railways, while buses majorly act as a feeder system. By 2030, however, the struggle may be a thing of the past, as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the nodal authority for infrastructure projects in the region, has planned a multitude of road and Metro projects. The vision is to establish a signal-free ring road around MMR – the sixth largest metropolitan region in the world – to make the road commute smoother.Part of the vision are the 22-km Mumbai-Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), connecting Mumbai’s Sewri to Navi Mumbai, the multimodal corridor (MMC) stretching 128km from Chirner in Alibag to Navghar in Virar (which will connect to MTHL), a 5-km Vasai to Mira-Bhayander bridge and another sea link from Versova-Virar, both of which are being planned by MMRDA. “From Versova, the commuter can connect to the Versova-Bandra sea link and the existing Bandra-Worli sea link to the Sewri-Worli elevated connector, forming an entire ring road that is expected to be completed by 2030. It will be signal-free,” said MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev, as he recently spelt out the plan. MMR is to Mumbai is what the National Capital Region (NCR) is to Delhi. It includes Mumbai and the satellite towns of Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Ulhasnagar.According to the 2011 census, MMR’s population is 22.8 million, of which Mumbai’s population is 12.44 million, making it one of the most populous cities in India. Mumbai, however, is only 10.5% of MMR’s total area, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) comprehensive mobility plan 2016. The same study also states that close to seven lakh people enter Mumbai in morning peak hours for work daily. However, most of the projects in the vision are still in planning stages. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) said work on the Bandra-Versova sea link has started. The MMRDA, in October, handed over the work order for the 4.5 km Sewri-Worli connector. The MMRDA has also completed 35% works on MTHL, which will cut the travel time between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to 40 minutes. The ambitious multimodal corridor project was handed over to the MSRDC recently. The Vasai-Bhayander bridge was first proposed in 2013. The 5-km bridge will reduce the travel time to 30 minutes from the current 50 minutes, say officials. “We are in the final stages of approval for forest and saltpan land, after which, tenders will be invited shortly,” said a statement by MMRDA.Radheyshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director, MSRDC, said, “We are in the process of land acquisition for the multimodal corridor, which will take at least a year, after which we will start the tendering process.”MSRDC is also looking at extending the under-construction Bandra-Versova link road (BSVL) till Virar. The 42.75-km sea-bridge will have connectors at Charkop, Uttan, Vasai and Virar. So with the coastal road connecting Navi Mumbai to the Bandra-Worli sea link, the Bandra-Versova sea link and the proposed extension to Virar, the travel time between south Mumbai and Virar in Palghar district, a distance of nearly 90km, will reduce to an hour from the current three hours.Apart from road projects, MMRDA is also executing a 337-km Mumbai Metro network, of which many lines connect to the MMR. This includes the 32-km Metro-4 connecting Wadala to Kasarwadavli in Thane, 24-km Metro-5 connecting three cities of Thane, Bhiwandi and Kalyan, an extension to Metro-7 till Mira-Bhayander, a 9-km Metro-10 that connects Gaimukh to Shivaji Chowk, Metro-12 that connects Kalyan, Taloja and Dombivli, Metro-13 from Shivaji Chowk to Virar and Metro-14 that will stretch from Kanjurmarg to Badlapur.Implementing the entire Mumbai Metro master plan will reduce traffic congestion from the current 137% to 33% in Mumbai by 2031, a study undertaken by MMRDA stated. The average speed on Mumbai roads will also increase from 17kmph to 30kmph by 2031, the study stated. Experts said this peripheral connectivity, along with the proposed east-west connections like the Goregaon-Mulund link road planned by the civic body, will help complete the regional grid. “However, there are still crucial links like the Panvel-Neral connectivity that need to be thought about,” said Pankaj Joshi, executive director of the Mumbai-based Urban Design Research Institute. “The Virar-Alibaug multimodal corridor is in itself a crucial ring road that was planned decades ago. It is good that we are seeing some of the plans taking shape on ground to strengthen regional connectivity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/smooth-travel-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-by-2030-it-ll-have-a-familiar-ring-road-to-it/story-0xB8IVKS6BBNConOhuKvFP.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PIL seeking EWS quota for Maratha community filed in Bombay HC||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed by Congress leader and activist Dr Sanjay Lakhe Patil in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking directions to the state, to grant Economically Weaker Section (EWS) status to members of the Maratha community, as the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the benefits of the Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) quota. The PIL has contended that as the case in the Apex court may take some time to be completed, the Maratha community should get benefits in the education sector under the EWS quota.The PIL filed through advocate SB Talekar has pointed out that after the HC had upheld the SEBC Act and the members of the Maratha community, which constitutes one-third of the state population, had got reservations of 12% in the education sector and 13% in the government employment sector, the HC decision was challenged in the Supreme Court (SC). The Apex court on September 9, 2020, had stayed the implementation of the SEBC Act.The petition states that before the SC stay, the Maratha community had already got reservations under the SEBC Act, hence after receiving complaints that the Maratha community should not get benefits under the EWS category at the same time, the state of Maharashtra in July, 2020, had clarified that the Marathas could not avail of the benefit of 10% reservation under the EWS quota.“The reservation provided in favour of the Maratha community, as belonging to SEBC cannot be availed by the members of Maratha community by virtue of the interim order passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. As per the directions of the Supreme Court, the appeals pending before it would be placed before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a larger bench,” the petition reads.As the constitution of the larger bench could take six months or even six years, the petition sought directions to the state government to stay the implementation of the July 2020 government circular and allow members of the Maratha community to avail of the benefits of the 10% quota under the EWS reservation in both education and state jobs till the time the Apex court decides the constitutional validity of the SEBC Act.Though the PIL was listed to come up for hearing before the division bench chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni on Friday, due to paucity of time, the PIL will be heard in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-pil-seeking-ews-quota-for-maratha-community-filed-in-bombay-hc/story-B0lXYQawwFXVH0LuVTvsgO.html
12-12-2020||Kolkata||Shah plans Bengal visit as row over attack on Nadda escalates||The attack on Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda’s convoy in West Bengal’s Diamond Harbour escalated into a massive political row on Friday, with Union home minister Amit Shah planning a trip to the poll-bound state next week and top state officials declining to follow a central government summons to discuss the law-and-order situation. Diamond Harbour is the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, and the war of words holds significance as the BJP is making a strong pitch to wrest power in the state next year. After stones were pelted at cars in Nadda’s convoy, an incident that the CM described as “staged by the BJP to draw public attention”, the Union home ministry on Friday asked chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and director general of police Virendra to appear before it on December 14. This drew a strong reaction from the Trinamool Congress (TMC), arguing that law-and-order was a state subject, and therefore outside the Centre’s remit. Chief secretary Bandopadhyay wrote back to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Friday afternoon, seeking relief from personal appearance. The letter said security cover was provided to Nadda on Thursday, action was being taken by the state police, and seven people arrested. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were among those hit by stones, the BJP said on Thursday. “Nadda was saved because he was in a bulletproof car provided by the local police. However, the rest of the claim about police deployment is a lie. We saw no policemen along the route,” Roy, said on Friday. In an interview to HT on Friday, Vijayvargiya said the CM and her nephew were “100 per cent” responsible for the incident. “The goondas were throwing stones in front of the police. We do any protest, they throw tear gas at us, or [fire] pellet guns. But when TMC people do this kind of goondaism, they just stand and watch. It means that it’s all happening with their consent,” he said. The state’s governor Jagdeep Dhankhar held a media briefing slamming the state government. “Finding the situation alarming, as my constitutional duty, I have sent a report to the central government about the extremely disturbing developments that do not augur well for democratic value...,” he told a press conference.The TMC, however, reacted sharply to his remarks, calling him a “conduit pipe” of the BJP. In an internal report, the contents of which were shared by TMC leaders, the state police on Friday informed the CM that a criminal case was registered against Rakesh Singh (a BJP leader) for provoking the agitators at Sirakhol. The incident of “vandalism” took place for 10-15 minutes and nothing happened at Diamond Harbour, said the note sent to Banerjee. Rakesh Singh, senior police officers said, was among the accused when a bust of 19th century social reformer and educationist Vidyasagar was vandalised in a Kolkata college named after him during a rally of Amit Shah prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The report sent to Banerjee also mentioned that Nadda was provided with a bulletproof vehicle and a pilot car in addition to the security cover by central police forces that he enjoys. The report added that four additional superintendents of police, eight deputy superintendents, eight inspectors, 30 officers, 40 rapid action force personnel were deployed along the route to the venue of the meeting that Nadda attended. Meanwhile, accusing the BJP-led government at the Centre of violating the spirt of federalism, TMC Lok Sabha MP Kalyan Bandopadhyay said at his party’s headquarters that there is no law under which the home ministry can summon DGP and chief secretary. “Law-and-order is a state subject. We are vehemently opposing this. Nadda was moving around with people having criminal background. Why were there so many cars in the convoy? Vehicles and motorcycles belonging to outsiders cannot be part of a convoy meant for a person having Z-category security,” he said.Experts, however, said the Centre did have the right to summon state officials under such circumstances. “The TMC is absolutely wrong. It is true that the Centre has no jurisdiction over the law-and-order in a state...but what the ruling party misses is that under Article 355 of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Centre to look into internal disturbances in a state,” Former principal of Presidency College and an expert on the Constitution, Prof Amal Mukhopadhyay, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/shah-plans-bengal-visit-as-row-over-attack-on-nadda-escalates/story-ROaDJ1R37eL1cDDz8ZG70I.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s winter pollution more toxic in 2020; PM2.5 levels 25-30% higher than 2019: CSE||The average share of tiny pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments — PM2.5 — was higher across all cities in Maharashtra this winter with the maximum spike observed in Mumbai.This winter, air pollution set in almost two weeks earlier, indicating a change in pattern. The average PM2.5 levels were 25-30% higher in October and November for the Mumbai region compared to the same period last year. An analysis of winter pollution (till the first week of December 2020) in major cities of Maharashtra was carried out by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Delhi. Released on Friday, CSE’s analysis revealed that the clean air gains of the early months of lockdown and monsoon were offset by the reopening of the economy and winter weather.The share of PM2.5 in PM10 (larger coarser particles) this winter was 40% during October and 46% through November. It is generally lowest during summer and monsoon months (less than 30%) and highest on Diwali.“The share of tinier and finer particles (PM2.5) in the overall coarser PM10 concentration determines the toxicity of air. When the overall share of tinier PM2.5 in the overall coarser PM10 is higher, the air is more toxic as the tiny particles penetrate deep inside the lungs and cut through the blood barrier increasing the health risk,” said CSE in its analysis.As compared to the cleanest air quality week this year (in the week ending on July 5) for Mumbai, the weekly average increased 10 times during the week ending on November 15.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE said, “Pollution levels increased during winter despite the geographical advantages and favourable meteorology for Mumbai. This indicates high local pollution and strong regional influences.”According to the analysis, overall average PM2.5 levels for just over 11 months (January to December first week) were considerably lower than those of 2019 due to the impact of the lockdown. However, PM2.5 concentration during winter rose beyond safe standards for Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra. October saw more polluted air across all cities, and Mumbai was the worst as its average PM2.5 levels were 25% higher than in 2019. It was 26% higher for Navi Mumbai and 28% higher in Kalyan. November was also more polluted with the monthly average being 7% higher in Mumbai, 21% in Navi Mumbai, and 31% in Kalyan. Cities outside the Mumbai Metropolitan Region also showed a similar or marginally lower trend.Chowdhury explained that thanks to better ventilation through the se brrese, suspension of pollutant particles was much was much lower in Mumbai than in the Indo-Gangetic plain in winter. However, pollution sources from vehicles, industry, construction, and biomass burning had helped bring winter pollution in almost two weeks earlier. “Reopening of the economy coinciding with the onset of winter allow PM2.5 levels to rise starting from October. It is clear that the Mumbai region cannot rely only on its locational advantage of proximity to the sea,” she said. So far, the most polluted areas in Mumbai include Worli, Vile Parle, Kurla and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSIA) where the 24-hour PM2.5 average was in the ‘very poor’ category on multiple days during November even as the city-wide average was in the ‘moderate’ category.Among solutions, CSE suggested strict enforcement of power plant standards across Maharashtra; minimise use of coal and other dirty fuels in the industry; improving emissions control; scale up public transport and vehicle restraint measures; and manage waste through zero waste and zero landfill strategy. “There is a need for deep cuts across all key sectors of pollution and across the entire region to reduce annual average levels and thereby avoid winter pollution peaks for Maharashtra cities,” said Chowdhury.WARNING FOR FURTHER POLLUTION SPIKE DURING CHRISTMAS, NEW YEAR: CSEAir quality in the city is usually at its worst around Christmas and New Year. Going by this trend, a further spike in air pollution may be expected said CSE. Kurla and Worli have the highest November averages in Mumbai, while Bandra, CSIA and Colaba have the lowest. Nerul in Navi Mumbai is the most polluted in the Greater Mumbai region. CSIA, despite one of the lowest monthly concentrations, has the highest daily spikes. CSE STUDY SHOWS DIWALI AIR WAS MORE POLLUTED THAN 2019The average PM2.5 level on Diwali day (November 14) in Mumbai was 76 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3), up from 53 μg/m3 recorded in 2019. There was a 75% higher rise in hourly PM2.5 concentration between afternoon and night of Diwali 2020 mostly due to firecracker bursting. The change in hourly PM2.5 concentration between afternoon and night of 2020 Diwali was 145 μg/m3, up from 83 μg/m3 in 2019. Diwali also occurred later in November than the previous year (October 27).HOW THE ANALYSIS WAS DONE?CSE did its analysis based on air quality data from 10 monitoring stations in Mumbai; three in Navi Mumbai; two in Chandrapur; and one station each in Thane, Kalyan, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad, and Solapur under the continuous ambient air quality monitoring system (CAAQMS) of the Central Pollution Control Board. This data is publicly available real time information from CPCB’s official online portal, Central Control Room for Air Quality Management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-winter-pollution-more-toxic-in-2020-pm2-5-levels-25-30-higher-than-2019-cse/story-yMV55Noonze99SBBH5FbxN.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to set up 48 centres, form 500 teams for Covid-19 vaccine distribution||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to set up at least 48 vaccination centres and form 500 teams for seamless distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine in the city.In the first meeting of BMC’s task force for vaccination on Wednesday, the civic body decided to form 500 teams of five members each. These teams will directly report to the task force headed by additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is in charge of health at the BMC. BMC plans to vaccinate 1.25 lakh frontline workers in 15 days after the vaccine arrives, and the second dose will be administered in 15 days after the buffer of 28 days between the two doses is over. According to BMC officials, the first target will be to vaccinate frontline workers followed by the police force and conservancy workers in the second phase. In the third phase, all citizens above the age of 50 will be vaccinated. The civic body is also developing a mechanism where a text message will be sent to senior citizens to get vaccinated. The database collected during ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign will be used for sending text messages. The initial target, post frontline workers, is to vaccinate around one crore population of Mumbai. Further, it has been decided that the city will have a minimum of 48 vaccination centres by maintaining a ratio of two to three vaccine centres in each of the 24 administrative wards. The number of centres in each ward will increase or decrease depending on the size and population of a particular ward. Kakani said, “Once vaccination starts, we will start distribution in every corner of the city simultaneously. There will be no discrimination. Every ward will have two to three vaccination centres.”The city has 24 administrative wards across the island city western and eastern suburbs. According to BMC officials, they will use its dispensaries, civic hospitals and schools that will act as vaccine distribution centres in every ward. The distribution will take place in a close environment and not in open ground to ensure proper cold storage of vaccine doses. In the coming week, the BMC is expected to float bids for procurement of deep freezers for storage of vaccines. For now, the vaccine will be stored at the Central vaccine storage facility by the BMC in Kanjurmarg.Kakani added, “We will use a network of our municipal dispensaries, civic hospitals and civic schools where vaccine distribution centres will be set up. All wards have already identified such spots. Also, vaccination will be done in a closed environment, considering the vaccine doses will require certain temperatures to be maintained for which cold storage will be required.” According to BMC officials, final distribution plan will be decided post the Central government lays down its guidelines. Representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) were present the meeting. They have expressed satisfaction over the preparedness, said BMC officials.According to BMC officials, the final distribution plan will be decided post the Central government lays guidelines for the same. The number of distributions centres will also go up post private institutions are permitted for vaccine distribution, said BMC officials.The central government, two months ago, has already formed an expert committee comprising representatives from all relevant ministries and institutions, and the state government has also announced the formation of a task force to oversee all aspects of its Covid-19 vaccine plan – from the identification of the vaccine to buying to financing the purchase to distribution and administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-set-up-48-centres-form-500-teams-for-covid-19-vaccine-distribution/story-jbiwmDZt7ClrVvZGZdQi3I.html

We had started a drive last year and recovered Rs 18 crore. But, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, arrears again piled up. The dues now stand at nearly Rs 20 crore,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB. While last year, CHB had even cancelled the allotment of around 250 allottees for the violation, Garg said this year, eviction will not be the immediate action. “We will be taking action against the defaulters as per law. But, in the wake of the pandemic, we will not be resuming their properties,” he added. In addition to issuing notices, the board has also put up the list of defaulters on its website and on the premises of its office. The flats in question were allotted under the slum rehabilitation scheme in different parts of the city. Allottees of one-room EWS flats are charged Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 per month as ground rent, which is increased by 20% after five years of allotment. Under the Chandigarh Small Flat (Amendment) Scheme 2020, if allottees do not pay the rent, they are liable to pay a penalty of 12% per annum. If paid on time, the yearly collection of rent will be around Rs 20 crore. While, CHB keeps 5% of the recoveries as administrative costs, the rest is deposited with the administration. Recoveries pending in commercial properties In October this year, CHB had served similar notices on more than 600 commercial establishments for recovering Rs 56 crore in outstanding dues. Many allottees have not been depositing ground rent, instalments and interest for several years. Most defaulters have been allotted CHB properties in rehri markets and motor markets in different sectors, and the grain market in Sector 26. The highest amount due from a single allottee is Rs 1.3 crore. “Recoveries from commercial properties have been slow so far. In some cases, allottees have moved court,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rehab-colonies-rent-dues-mount-to-20-crore-chb-starts-sending-notices/story-pPmVkbrIfRtLQE6F4fp8jI.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra blood crisis: SBTC to take action against blood banks if data is not updated online||The State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) has instructed all 340 blood banks in Maharashtra to update information on the availability of blood units at the Union government’s website, e-Rakt Kosh (www.eraktkosh.in), which connects blood banks across the country. Those who fail to do so within a week will face stringent action. Blood banks in the state have been reeling under an acute shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic. At present, Maharashtra has 21,000 units of blood. Bloodstock in Mumbai has fallen from 3,500 units on December 2 to 3,200 units on December 10. Running out of blood, most banks are relying on replacement blood, often resulting in relatives of patients having to hunt for donors.SBTC has warned blood banks that they must update their information on e-Rakt Kosh within a week. “Till Wednesday, 290 blood banks had updated their data, which can be viewed on the website. The general public can contact respective blood banks with their requirements,” said Dr Arun Thorat, director, SBTC, adding that defaulters will face action. A government resolution (GR) released on December 4 also says blood banks that refuse patients with blood disorders like thalassemia and haemophilia, despite having stock, will be fined ₹1,000. If blood banks charge patients, they will have to refund thrice the amount. Any blood bank found overcharging the processing service will have to refund five times the charge to SBTC. Health activists have welcomed the state government’s move. “Some hospitals, despite having blood, are harassing patients, including people with blood disorders. The government needs to come up with better alternative plans to stock blood and take stringent action against defaulters,” said activist Dr Abhijit More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-blood-crisis-sbtc-to-take-action-against-blood-banks-if-data-is-not-updated-online/story-8P6CSYnOlfbZEKKqGjY0GM.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra records less than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for a week; crosses 48,000 fatalities||Maharashtra on Friday recorded 4,268 cases, pushing the case count to 18,72,440. The number of active cases has now slightly increased to 73,315. Around 3.91% of the total patients are currently being treated at various hospitals and Covid Care Centres in the state. Toll breached 48,000 mark as 87 casualties were reported. Of them, 38 occurred in the last 48 hours, 23 in the last week and the rest 26 deaths are from the period before that. The tally stood at 48,059, the health officials said.For the last one week, Maharashtra has been reporting less than 5,000 Covid-19 cases. Despite the anticipation of a potential second wave post-Diwali, the state has not witnessed any sign, except last week of November when a rise in cases was observed. However, officials are still worried as a surge in the number of cases is likely by January.The situation has slightly improved even in the case of casualties as it took the state twelve days to complete one thousand deaths. It has breached 47,000 Covid deaths on November 29. The state completed 45,000 Covid deaths on November 7 and in nine days crossed the mark of 46,000 deaths on November 16. It had taken 13 days to reach the 47,000 death-mark, the data released by the state health department shows.This can be further explained as total 1,171 deaths were reported in the first 11 days of November and this month, the figure has come down to 908.“More or fewer casualties have come down in the state and the case fatality rate (CFR) has declined to 2.57%. It would be difficult to bring down CFR below 2% because Maharashtra has a very high number of co-morbid patients as compared to other states. It can be achieved but will take much time,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients.Though there is a decline, Mumbai continues to record maximum cases in the state with 654 cases reported on Friday taking the case count to 2,89,350. Of them, active cases are 12,423. There were 13 deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 10,955.Pune city contributed the second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it has recorded 294 cases, taking their tally to 1,83,893.Nagpur city recorded 276 cases, third-highest number of cases, pushing its case count to 90,749.The state has completed a total 1,15,70,137 Covid tests with 67,710 tests conducted on Friday. The positivity rate for the day recorded at 6.30% against the overall positivity rate of the state that stood at 16.18%.The number of recovered patients reached 17,49,973 with 2,774 recorded in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate was recorded at 93.46%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-less-than-5-000-covid-19-cases-for-a-week-crosses-48-000-fatalities/story-9kGRzCY2vfE0wov0rzoloN.html

12-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to launch a digital platform to help disabled||To celebrate 80th birthday of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, the state government on Friday announced to launch a digital platform where people with disabilities can register for their needs, such as hearing aid, battery-operated wheelchair, prosthesis, Braille kits etc. The portal will be called www.mahasharad.in, state social justice minister Dhananjay Munde announced on Friday. Earlier this week, a rural development scheme ‘Sharad Pawar Gram Samruddhi Yojana’, was cleared by the state cabinet after Pawar’s name, who is turning 80, on December 12. The veteran leader is considered as the guiding force of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprising three parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.“A large number of generous people either from social service organisations, private companies and industrialists are always interested in helping those who genuinely are in need and sometimes don’t know whom to be contacted. On the other hand, so many people are suffering from disabilities and require modern equipment to live their lives with fewer difficulties. The website will bridge the gap between those who need help and those who are capable as well as believe in a noble cause,” Munde said.The portal will be launched during a programme organised to celebrate Pawar’s 80th birthday at YB Chavan Centre at Nariman Point on Saturday.‘Mahasharad’ is an abbreviation of Maharashtra System of Health Rehabilitation And Assistance for Divyang.“We have set a target of extending the benefit of the portal to 29 lakh disabled people. The portal will start from December 12 and its mobile application will also be made available at google play store from March 2021,” the social justice minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-launch-a-digital-platform-to-help-disabled/story-JOUZyf71PgBVaXhQxf1QIP.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Civic chief assures rehabilitation of affected parties of Kalyan Ring Road project||Work on the Kalyan Ring Road project will be delayed as the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) commissioner, Vijay Suryavanshi, has assured rehabilitation of the project affected people (PAPs) before taking up the demolition of the structures along it.The said project will affect a total of 850 structures that include shops, farm lands and residential buildings. Of these, 590 are located at Durgadi, Atali, Ambivli and Titwala-Manda areas.The most-awaited ring road project is being undertaken by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) while the KDMC will help clear the spaces for the project by finishing land acquisition formalities and also by demolishing the structures along the project. Around 60 per cent of the road work has been completed. The residents of these areas had protested in January this year demanding rehabilitation after the civic body asked them to vacate the structures.“We have been following this up since the last two years with the civic body. Now, the commissioner has assured to provide rehabilitation to the affected people, which is a relief. We are not against the project but these are the people living here for years. They have invested in their homes. When KDMC asked them to vacate, they all were in panic,” said Pravin Supe, who represents the Atali-Ambivali Samajik Sanstha.“We have managed to acquire 80 per cent of the land, on which 60 per cent of work is completed. The demolition can begin only after acquiring the remaining land. Since the commissioner has given directives to rehabilitate, the demolition work will take time,” said Sanjay Pokharkar, surveyor for the project, KDMC.In 2014, the MMRDA proposed a 26-km ring road in Kalyan connecting Dombivli (W) to Titwala village. The four-phase project is being carried out by four different agencies. The road from Hedutane (Dombivali) to Titwala (Kalyan) will benefit lakhs of people who travel within Kalyan-Dombivli. Presently, the Kalyan-Shilphata Road, which is used to connect between Kalyan-Dombivli and Titwala, is the most congested route. The ring road will be a major impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-chief-assures-rehabilitation-of-affected-parties-of-kalyan-ring-road-project/story-z8GLiWkrrQSu7uTjuJ3suN.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department to revive fee regulatory panel to look into plaints of hikes||In a relief to several parents of private school students in Maharashtra, the state education department has decided to revive and strengthen the divisional fee regulatory committee (DFRC) in the coming days.State education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the DFRC will be revived and will address various issues of parents soon. “We have received several representations from parents, demanding action in issues of fee hikes and overcharging by schools. We are thus trying to revive the DFRC,” said Gaikwad.In 2016, after the Fee Regulation Act was implemented in the state, only two committees were formed – one at the state level and another in Mumbai – to address fee-related disputes. In 2017, some schools challenged the decisions given by the committee in the Bombay high court (HC) which ruled that “parents disgruntled about school fees cannot approach the DFRC” and stated that only school managements can approach DFRC.The state government then formed a committee under retired justice VJ Palshikar to recommend amendments in the Fee Regulation Act in 2017. In February, the newly-appointed state government paved the way for the formation of eight DRFCs in the state.On Thursday, several parents protested against the government’s inaction concerning fee-related issues in private schools. Parents have planned to protest outside the minister’s house on Saturday. “We are going to sit outside the minister’s house demanding action on our complaints, and will continue doing so until we get a response,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-to-revive-fee-regulatory-panel-to-look-into-plaints-of-hikes/story-6GoLqg0SjWyygk7yOkiUcL.html

Among the surveyed, more than 70% are hoping to relax and celebrate this winter holiday season with their family, spouse or partner, while the rest are looking to end the year travelling with friends and colleagues. The findings showed that 60% of respondents who are willing to travel during the winter holiday season are planning to spend the year in the hills or on the beaches. According to the survey, only 20% of respondents are looking to wrap the year at bars or parties.The survey was conducted among more than 2,000 respondents between November 15 and December 5.The survey revealed that 70% of respondents want to spend time outdoors, doing adventure activities like rafting, hiking, water sports or sightseeing. As travellers also want to be safe during their trips, the respondents were seen giving the highest preference to sanitisation, hygiene and safety certification while choosing their stay option.Commenting on the travel trends, Rajesh Magow, co-founder and group CEO, MakeMyTrip Limited, goibibo, said, “Over the past few months, we have worked closely and creatively with the travel and hospitality value chain to raise safety standards and help customers make the journey from being homebound to being travellers again.”Bookings for the winter festive holiday season on goibibo indicate an increase in travel to domestic leisure destinations like Goa, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar, Pondicherry, Coorg, Shimla, Manali and Darjeeling. “As we step into 2021, we are confident of a continued upward travel trend that will find more force as the mass vaccine rollout plan materialises,” said Magow.The survey also suggested that the winter holiday season will witness nearly 60% of leisure travellers booking a trip for two or more days, and long-distance leisure travel will make a strong comeback.“Fifty percent of travellers across all demographics and cohorts are willing to opt for air travel for the upcoming winter holiday season, signalling a strong boost in passenger confidence and trust in air travel for a holiday post-pandemic,” said a goibibo spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-in-3-indians-planning-to-travel-during-christmas-and-new-year-season-survey/story-uYMp3sBDIElS11PMdVfHQN.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai doctors participate in peaceful strike; no impact on emergency services||Thousands of doctors in the state on Friday joined hands with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and participated in a peaceful protest against the Centre’s decision to allow specified streams of Ayurvedic doctors to perform general surgical procedures. However, the emergency services at hospitals were functional.As a part of the nationwide protest, hundreds of allopathy doctors went on a strike, whereas, all non-essential and non-Covid services from 6am to 6pm were withdrawn. Many outpatient department (OPD) services, including elective services, were cancelled. However, IMA does not have the data about the total number of doctors who participated in the strike.“Considering the protocols of the pandemic, we didn’t hold any public demonstrations. But we gathered at different spots in the state with posters,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, IMA, Maharashtra.All emergency services including casualty, emergency room, critical care, intensive care units (ICU), Covid-19 care, emergency surgeries and labour rooms functioned normally.Also, many doctors did not participate in the strike and continued with their OPDs. “At our hospital, all the OPDs were functional. None of the surgeries was cancelled due to the strike. Everything went as usual without any hurdle,” said Dr V Ravishankar, chief executive officer (CEO), Lilavati Hospital.Similarly, at civic-run hospitals all non-emergency services were performed. “We are the factory and running the main machine of the healthcare system of the city. How can we close down our OPDs? We received around 2,000 patients on OPD and all were treated by doctors,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.As per a notification issued on November 20, the Central Council of Indian Medicine authorised Ayurvedic postgraduation in Shalyathanthra and Shalakyathanthra to perform 58 general surgical procedures. It includes general surgery, urology, surgical gastroenterology, ENT, ophthalmology and dental medicine among others.“Just by giving some Sanskrit names, Ayurvedic doctors can’t perform surgical procedures. A doctor spends years to gain expertise before operating on any patient. Also, they need approval and registration with the Indian Medical Council. To raise among people about the issue, we decided to stop the non-Covid non-essential services on Friday,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA, Maharashtra. “If an inexperienced doctor operates on a patient, it will be a risk to the patient’s life,” he added.The IMA has called this aa ‘Mixopathy’ practice which can increase calamities, as per a statement released by the association on December 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-participate-in-peaceful-strike-no-impact-on-emergency-services/story-bDKnNNYnKXY0nPDLUinW3L.html
12-12-2020||City||BJP leader Kirit Somaiya alleges TDR fraud; Mumbai civic body says no decision taken||Alleging that a group of private builders are being fraudulently allotted transferable development rights (TDR) worth ₹74 crore as compensation for a public road at Andheri which connects Mahakali caves, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya on Friday accused the civic body of facilitating a floor space index (FSI) fraud. Somaiya has claimed that this road was a private road until 1914, and was then handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India. As it is an existing public road, there is no question of granting it as compensation to current owners who recently purchased the adjoining land in 2016, said the former parliamentarian.“TDR cannot be granted to an existing road. It may be noted that in 1914, when the land was given to government, there was no concept of TDR. This area was not part of BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation). In the past 106 years, previous owners have never raised any objection or dispute about compensation. It was well settled,” Somaiya in a statement said on Friday.However, Vinod Chithore, chief engineer, development plan department, BMC, said, “The private builders who are the new owners of this land, have applied to BMC for granting TDR. However, the corporation is still examining the case, and no decision has been taken yet on allotting them the TDR. We will verify if there is merit in the case first.” According to the documents provided by Somaiya, an application made to the corporation on November 9 stated that an adjoining road admeasuring 1,364.58 square metres was already acquired by the civic body without payment of compensation to the land owners. Therefore, a payment of ₹74.07 crore is due toward the land owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-leader-kirit-somaiya-alleges-tdr-fraud-mumbai-civic-body-says-no-decision-taken/story-m0C8TqJjNNko6HPdyUxVTO.html

The nominations will be accepted from December 23-30, while scrutiny will be done on December 31. The last date for withdrawal of nomination is January 4. The final electoral rolls will be published on December 14. “The code of conduct has come into force,” state election commissioner UPS Madan said in a statement. Of the total 27,881 gram panchayats, over half the local bodies are going to polls in January. The January 15 polls will be spread across five regions– Konkan, Western Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidarbha and North Maharashtra. Konkan division has 798 gram panchayats going to polls, while Nashik division has 2,476, Pune division has 2,870, Aurangabad division has 4,134, Amravati division has 2,448 and Nagpur division has 1,508. Of these, elections to 1,566 gram panchayats were slated to be held on March 31, 2020, but were deferred owing to the Covid-induced lockdown. The election, however, will be held in the backdrop of the pandemic and the possibility of a second wave of infections in the state. The polls will prove to be a litmus test for the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) against the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to check their acceptance and popularity in the hinterland. The three parties – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – are expected to contest the gram panchayat elections in an alliance. However, there is no official announcement yet. The MVA recently contested the polls for the five seats of the legislative Council and got success in keeping the BJP out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-000-maharashtra-gram-panchayats-to-go-to-polls-on-january-15/story-ADN19ejxDuTb4asli9lv3K.html

12-12-2020||Lucknow||UP govt plans to distribute tractors to 69 ‘lucky’ farmers||Amid the ongoing farmers’ protest over Centre’s three contentious agriculture laws, the Uttar Pradesh government is gearing up to distribute tractors to dozens of ‘lucky’ farmers soon in a bid to cultivate goodwill with the farmers’ community in the state, sources dealing with the issue revealed.As many as 69 farmers belonging to different districts will be shortlisted for the free distribution of tractors through bumper lucky draws under the Mandi Parishad’s old scheme—the scheme had been in the cold storage for last around three years. In order to make the prize distribution a big event and turn the spotlight on the same, chief minister Yogi Adityanath will distribute tractors’ keys to around a dozen farmers at a function to be organised in the state capital while the rest of the shortlisted farmers will get keys from commissioners during the functions held at divisional headquarters simultaneously on the same day.The chief minister also heads the Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Market Board (Mandi Parishad) as its ex-officio chairman.Confirming the re-launch of tractor distribution scheme after some break, Mandi Parishad director JP Singh said tractors would be provided to the farmers under the old scheme called the ‘Mukhya Mantri Krashak Uphar Yojana’. The lucky draws under this scheme, he added, could not be held for the last two years or so due to various reasons, including the prevalence of pandemic since March this year.Also read: ‘Independent ties with countries’ - India pushes back against Russian minister’s comments“We have sought time from the chief minister to grace the function to hand over tractors’ keys to the first prize-winning farmers here,” he said, adding, “A total 69 tractors will be distributed, some by the CM here and the rest in divisions the same day.” The date of the event, he said, would be fixed as per the convenience of the CM. The government launched the Uphar Yojana as back in 2003 to encourage farmers to bring their agricultural produce to market produce committees (mandis) for the sale. The scheme sought to give prize coupons on monthly, quarterly and half-yearly basis to farmers on their mandi transaction worth Rs 5,000 and above.Currently, under the scheme that was amended and upgraded gradually with time, six-monthly bumper lucky draws are supposed to be held twice a year to distribute two tractors (35 HP) each in all the 18 divisions to the farmers winning the first prize. Sources said no bumper lucky draws had been held for around last three years and this time the government had decided to clear some of the backlog in one go. “At a time when the state government has suspended many schemes with financial implications due to the funds being diverted to fight the pandemic, the government’s decision to distribute tractors is certainly an attempt to send a positive message to the farmers,” they said. Singh, however, said that the move had nothing to do with the current farmers’ unrest. “In fact, we invited bids earlier to buy tractors and the tractor companies have offered 25 per cent discount to us on the price of the tractors we have decided to buy to gift the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-plans-to-distribute-tractors-to-69-lucky-farmers/story-veq6ZsGZW9CaCLClPeVfgI.html

But, as rain is predicted on Saturday, to be followed by fog on Sunday and Monday, the mercury is likely to register a significant drop.At 28.1°C, the day temperature was the second highest for a December day this decade, after the 28.4°C temperature recorded on December 1, 2014. It was also five notches above the normal temperature expected at this time of the year. Chandigarh remained the hottest station in all of Punjab and Haryana, as per IMD.“Western Disturbances are active in the region. Although they didn’t bring in any rain on Friday, the winds were warmer, which caused the day temperature to rise. The sky was also clear, due to which there was sufficient sunlight,” said Surender Paul, director, IMD, Chandigarh.Rain expected today, chill to follow“Rain can be expected in the city around afternoon on Saturday. With cloudy weather and rain, the day temperature will drop steeply and can go below 20°C as well in the coming days,” he added.IMD has also forecast moderate to dense fog in isolated pockets of the city on Sunday and Monday, which will keep the day temperature on the lower side. “Cloudy weather will trap the heat and keep night temperature from falling. However, in the next week, even the minimum temperature can fall by three degrees due to snowfall in Himachal Pradesh and cold northward winds blowing in from there,” Paul said.In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 20°C and 21°C, while the minimum temperature will hover around 9°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-28-1-c-chandigarh-records-warmest-december-day-since-2014/story-lCbPg1QviIvniU92hI1igM.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||NGO starts free electric foot massages at Singhu protest site||After two weeks of resorting to manual foot rubs, herbal oil, and painkillers for their joint ache and leg pain, protesting farmers at Singhu border were on Friday introduced to free ten-minute massage sessions with 25 foot massagers installed at the protest site.The 25 massagers that were set up at the protest site was introduced by Khalsa Aid, a non-government organisation. The facility is free for all protesters, and all they need to do is get a token number and then wait their turn.  “Our volunteers at Tikri protest site said that several of them were offering manual foot rubs to the farmers. This is what prompted us to arrange for these massagers. We have multiple ongoing projects and already had five such foot massagers which are used during events like kanwar yatra or amarnath yatras,” said Amarpreet Singh, Khalsa Aid’s director in India.Mandeep Kaur, 50, a nurse from Lehra Bet village in Ferozpur district, has been at Singhu border for a week now, protesting with her family. “The constant movement around the protest site and the winter cold can often leave old people with pain in their leg beside severe backache. The massage session helped in comforting me and I will ask my son to buy me these,” she said.Throughout the day, farmers lined up outside the tent with their allotted tokens to get the “electric massage” after word spread around the protest site. Till Friday evening, more than 350 farmers had availed of the services which started at 8am on Friday.Jagdiv Singh, 60, a resident of Amritsar, said, “Getting inside the trolleys and climbing down from them or even sitting for long hours has caused us extreme backache and joint-ache. Other farmers around our trolley told me about the foot massagers, so I came here to try it. Till now, I had been relying on massages given by other younger farmers at the spot,” he said.Two friends – Saab Singh, 63, and Lakhi Ram, 80 – from the Mundlana village in Sonipat district walked out of the enclosure smiling on Friday evening. “Every day, we walk from our trolleys to the stage area which is around 2km away. Sometimes, we do these trips twice a day. As a result, we were left with terrible pain. But the 10-minute massage session has helped. We will come back tomorrow as well,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngo-starts-free-electric-foot-massages-at-singhu-protest-site/story-S4DFfBjng2zmb7KHe0aPFO.html

Many farmers, especially the younger ones, also sleep in the small space below trucks or in tents.On Friday, groups of men started covering the flaps of the few large waterproof white tents with mud to ensure that people inside the tent are protected from the water and wind. Many bring essential supplies like blankets, warm clothes, and mattresses from home which may have been exhausted by the protesting farmers.Baldev Singh Wadala, a senior member of the Punjab unit of All India Kisan Sabha, said, “Though we had come prepared with tarpaulin sheets and several measures against the cold, there aren’t enough sheets to ensure that everyone has a roof over their head. We have called for more tarpaulin sheets and blankets from our villages in Punjab to shelter as many people as we can.”While the movement of farmers towards Delhi is restricted, several farmers from Punjab continue to arrive at the protest site every day. Many bring essential supplies from home which may have been exhausted by the protesting farmers.Jaskiran Singh, 20, a farmer who hails from Amritsar, said his group reached the protest spot on December 2 and has been staying in a waterproof camping tent since then. “We had brought these tents along with us. I asked my older brother to bring four-five more such tents when he comes so that we can accommodate more elderly people in case it rains,” he said.Suresh Malik, 48, from Madina village in Sonipat district, has been camping at the Singhu border since November 26. “We have parked several tractors close together and covered them with tarpaulin sheets to ensure temporary protection against the rain,” he said.Non-governmental organisations like Khalsa Aid have also set up makeshift enclosures with waterproof tents accommodating over 400 beds. “They were set nearly a week ago. We have brought in more tarpaulin sheets and around 500 commercial tents, which are waterproof, as a measure against the rain and chill,” said Amarpreet Singh, Khalsa Aid’s director in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tarpaulin-sheets-waterproof-tents-farmers-brace-for-turn-in-delhi-weather/story-OIqAVT6biDdSAJbjJOgeiL.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Govt alleges Rs 2,400 crore scam in North civic body||Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi urban development minister Satyendar Jain on Friday accused the north Delhi municipal corporation of misappropriation of funds to the tune of more than Rs 2,400 crore and said that the Delhi government had initiated a probe into it.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — which rules all three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) — immediately denied the allegations, calling them “politically biased”.“There has been misappropriation of funds to the tune of more than Rs 2,400 crore in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. It concerns payments between the north and south Delhi municipal corporations. We have ordered a probe into it which will be headed by an additional chief secretary-rank officer in charge of the urban development department of the Delhi government,” said Jain, who holds the health, home and urban development portfolios in Delhi government.He further said, “Rs 2,400 crore is a big amount and such misappropriation is unbelievable, especially when the municipal corporations claim that they are not being able to pay salaries to doctors, nurses, teachers, sanitation workers and other employees.”Jain’s allegations and the probe comes at a time when mayors of the three civic bodies have been protesting outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for more than three days to demand disbursement of funds which they claim the Delhi government owes the civic bodies.When asked about claims by the three municipal corporations that the Delhi government owes them ₹13,500 crore, Jain said that the Delhi government has always disbursed payments to the MCDs on time, with no instance of default or delay, in accordance with the applicable finance commission report, and it is the MCDs which owe money to the Delhi government.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, however, said, “This is nothing but a diversionary tactics by the government to not release our dues. There is no misappropriation of funds. The ₹2400 crore Jain is referring to is related to the rent of civic centre to be paid by the south corporation. The matter is being discussed by the two corporations. The south corporation has also facing issues related to fund. How will they pay if the government has not cleared their dues.”All the three municipal corporations are facing a crippling financial crunch with North corporation and the East civic body not being able to pay regular salaries to their staff. This has led to protests by municipal, engineers, doctors and other staff. The BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are politically biased statements. It is shocking that even after being in power for six years, Satyendar Jain does not know that in MCDs the commissioner independently brings the budget before the standing committee and it is up to the elected councillors to accept his proposals or reject them.” “The minister’s statement that Delhi government has no fund dues towards MCDs reflects the frustration of Kejriwal government due to public pressure building on it since the mayors have been sitting on a dharna demanding funds outside the CM’s residence,” Kapoor said. On Thursday, a group of BJP supporters had barged into the house of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, breaching the police cordon. The BJP workers claimed that they were angry over threats to the MCD mayors allegedly made by AAP leaders. The AAP, however, rejected the alleged video clip, in which the purported threat is being made, as doctored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-probe-against-civic-bodies-for-misappropriation-of-rs-2-400-crore/story-ucg6JfJUsucYkh4Mxvq4rL.html

BJP workers also held demonstrations outside the residences of Delhi ministers Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Rajender Pal Gautam and Imran Hussain.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, met the L-G and submitted a memorandum.Gupta said, “The mayors and councillors are sitting outside CM’s residence for the past five days, but he doesn’t have time for them. The corporation is unable to pay salaries to its employees and the CM is not bothered. Their leaders are threatening to kill the mayors. We have requested the L-G to intervene and direct the government to release the funds immediately.”The Delhi government has maintained that it has paid all dues to the MCDs as per the recommendations of the Delhi finance commissions. Delhi PWD minister Satyendar Jain reiterated on Friday that the government has always disbursed payments to the MCDs on time, with no instance of default or delay, and it is the MCDs which owe money to the Delhi government. The BJP, however, continued its attack on the AAP government. Party leaders said that instead of calling the corporation leaders for a discussion, the ruling party in Delhi is using diversionary tactics to avoid the problem. “The corporation is not asking for additional funds. They are asking for the government to pay what is due to them. It is the corporations’ money. The corporations are unable to pay salaries to corona warriors. In these tough times, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) should rise above politics. But they are trying to mislead people,” said Bidhuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-leaders-ask-l-g-to-direct-govt-to-release-pending-dues-of-corporations/story-yoViTaGYhBqLsAuv23MFTJ.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Inefficient MCDs affecting people: AAP||Continuing with its criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday accused the civic bodies of inefficiency. The BJP rubbished the accusations and said the AAP government is “frustrated” over the issue of non disbursal of funds to the civic bodies.“For the past 15 days, the mayors are busy protesting outside the CM’s residence and the MCDs are operating without leaders. While the commissioners are on leave, the BJP-led MCDs have failed to appoint officials in their stead. The sheer inefficiency of the MCDs is affecting the people of Delhi. Has the BJP already accepted their defeat in the upcoming MCD polls?” AAP leader and Kalkaji MLA Atishi said.The BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson responded, “Ms Atishi’s statements expose the frustration of the Arvind Kejriwal government over the fund issue. Today, people of Delhi know very well that the financial turmoil in civic bodies is due to the Delhi government’s biased style of functioning and its failure to release funds to the municipal bodies. It is more shocking because the AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal himself resorted to dharnas in 2014 and 2018 demanding certain powers (from the Centre) to function without hassle and, today, his party is objecting to peaceful dharnas. AAP leaders should rather convince the government to release funds.”Mayors of the three MCDs have been protesting outside the residence of CM Arvind Kejriwal demanding around Rs 13,500 crore in funds, which, they claim, the Delhi government owes to the civic bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcds-highly-inefficient-says-aap/story-8fKGqEtf74XHmqGfx6QZRK.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Will run office from protest site: Mayors||The three mayors of the city’s three municipal corporations — north south and east — said they would run their offices from outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence from Monday, as they continue to protest the alleged non disbursal of funds by Delhi government. The mayors said that the protest, which started on Monday, will continue till the AAP-run Delhi government releases Rs 13,000 crore to the corporations.Addressing a press conference from outside CM’s residence, North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “We have been sitting here for the past five days, but the CM has not bothered to even talk to us. We have decided that we will run our offices from the protest site (outside CM’s residence) from Monday. We will not leave from here till Rs 13,000 crore is released by the government.”South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh and East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said development works have suffered due to the fund crunch. The corporations are unable to pay salaries to its employees on time. “These people are working hard during the Covid pandemic. Instead of helping the corporations, the government is making things difficult.” In a statement, AAP said, “Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCDs know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests. The mayors are well aware that the Delhi government has given all the funds due and it is because of their corruption and inefficiency that the MCDs are facing financial ruin. Since they have decided to only protest rather than govern, it is best that they resign and let AAP run the MCDs. We will run the MCDs efficiently and within the same budget.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcd-mayors-to-work-from-outside-cm-s-residence-while-on-protest/story-msya71vO6tGapeRzSMCsDN.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Covid hospitalisations under 5k mark first time in 97 days||With fewer cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) being reported in the city over the last fortnight, the number of hospitalisations dropped below the 5,000-mark on Friday for the first time in 97 days. The total number of hospitalisations in the city was 4,934 on September 5.Of the 71,679 tests conducted, 31,724 (44.2%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.On Friday, Delhi recorded 2,385 new cases of Covid-19 and 60 deaths due to the infection. So far, 603,535 people have been affected and 9,934 have died in the city.As on Friday evening, only 26% of the total 18,853 beds earmarked for Covid-19 were occupied and 46% of the 5,075 ICU beds were occupied, according to the Delhi Corona app. The ICU beds’ occupancy was over 86% during the surge in cases during November.The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the “third wave” of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was waning in the state, with the positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive—remaining below 5% for 10 days consecutively. On Friday, it stood at 3.33%. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for two weeks.“The third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi is going down. We can now say that the peak was on November 7 when a positivity rate of 15.26% was recorded. Now, the positivity rate has remained below 5% for 10 days,” said Jain in a press briefing.He said Delhi has been conducting one of the highest tests per million in the country with over 70,000 a day. As of November-end, Delhi reported the highest tests per million in the country at over 330,201. The national average stood at 100,159.Delhi was followed by Ladakh (241,355), Goa (237,626), and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (202,033), which have a fraction of Delhi’s population.“Currently, the situation seems to be under control. But people need to continue wearing masks and maintaining social distance. It is because people of Delhi have cooperated that we are seeing this result. I also want to thank the healthcare workers who have worked day and night,” the minister said.Delhi has tested over 71,741 samples a day on average during December, compared to an average of 53,579 during November. Nearly half of these tests were conducted using the RT-PCR method. In Delhi, the ratio of tests was skewed towards the less-accurate rapid antigen tests since they were rolled out in mid-June during the first surge in the number of cases.The number of RT-PCR tests was ramped up in the city in mid-November after a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah.“I agree that the reports for the RT-PCR tests, which should be given within 24 hours, are getting delayed in some places and we are trying to strengthen that. When we met with the centre, we were asked to double RT-PCR testing. We doubled our testing, but the reports were getting delayed. Now, the situation is improving,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-number-of-hospitalisations-in-delhi-drops-below-the-5-000-mark-for-first-time-in-97-days/story-gteJ8TKLktY6jS0qmIYEJP.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Man dies after being stabbed 22 times; three held||A man was repeatedly stabbed to death and two others injured, allegedly by two men and a juvenile person on Wednesday night, the police said. The three men were attacked while returning home from Safdarjung hospital where the two injured men work as contractual housekeeping staff. The attackers, police said, also used to work at the hospital but had been replaced by their contractor with the injured men. Police believe that this had motivated the attack on them. All three attackers have been caught, police said.The man who was killed was identified as Neeraj, and, according to police, he was stabbed 22 times.The injured were identified as Mukesh, who sustained 12 stab wounds, and his brother, Rakesh, who was stabbed at least five times. All three were identified only by their first names. The incident took place on Wednesday night around 10pm when Mukesh and Rakesh left the hospital after completing their shift and were accompanied by their friend Neeraj.“They had just reached a slum cluster near the hospital where two men, Krishan and Ravi, accompanied by a juvenile person, intercepted them. They had an argument with Mukesh and Rakesh which soon turned violent. As Neeraj intervened, Krishan, Ravi and the juvenile took out knives and stabbed him multiple times. When Mukesh and Rakesh tried to raise the alarm, they too were stabbed. As they collapsed, bleeding profusely, the locals and passersby reported the incident to the police. All three were rushed to Safdarjung hospital where Neeraj was pronounced dead while Mukesh and Rakesh are undergoing treatment,” said a senior police officer, not wishing to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said, “Our probe revealed that Mukesh and Rakesh had been replaced with Krishan and Ravi by their contractor and because of that, they were angry with the duo and that led to the fatal attack on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-dies-after-being-stabbed-22-times-his-friends-injured-three-held/story-aWs3hlnOLyzmPNxlwLjf8I.html

On December 10, between 11.30am and 12pm, he was not found in the flat. When we started making enquiries, we found that the security guard of the colony, who knew the officer well, had asked him where he was going when he left the flat on Thursday morning. He had told the guard that he would be back in a few minutes but hasn’t come home since then,” the family member said.The man’s family has also released his photograph and details on social media, which are being widely circulated.Police said the initial probe has revealed that the officer left the house on his own. “He left his mobile phone at home.

12-12-2020||Pune||Theatres reopen: Actor Prashant Damle to perform at Yashwantrao Chavan auditorium today||Actor and theatre producer Prashant Damle is busy with his final dress rehearsal, for Marathi play “Eka Lagnachi Pudhichi Ghosht,” with actor Kavita Medhekar, which will mark the reopening of theatres in the city after at least nine months.The well-known comedy play directed and written by Adwait Dadarkar is the first production to stage their opening show in the city at the Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha today (on December 12).A house full sign hangs near the ticket counter where many people return without tickets.“We will be operating at 50 per cent capacity and the tickets were all booked within an hour of opening the counter,” said Sameer Hampi, SH Enterprises, who has organised the show.The auditorium which has a seating capacity of 892 will be occupied 50 per cent as per the new norms.”The lead actors have taken a pay cut of 50 per cent while second lead actors have taken a cut of 30 per cent. Even the Government of Maharashtra has waived off the toll on the drama buses travelling to different cities, thus giving a helping hand for the theatre to stand on its feet,” he said.“We were a little apprehensive about getting a good response but true theatre lovers have proved time and again how much they value live performances,” said Hampi.Damle, who is known for his comic timings and also as a benevolent producer who during the lockdown had taken care of his entire crew by providing them care packages, had hinted on the social media about some “good news” for theatre lovers.”I will be performing in three shows over the weekend, starting with an inaugural show at Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha, and on Sunday, two shows, one at Balgandharva Rangmandir and Ramkrishna More Sabhagruha, Chinchwad,” he said.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken all necessary safety precautions to make sure the experience is good and safe for audience.“We have sanitized the auditorium and after the show, it will be sanitised again. At the entrance, we have sanitizer spray, oximeter check as well as a thermometer. People will have to wear face mask and follows the social distancing norms,” said Sunil Mate, incharge, cultural programmes and auditoriums, PMC.He said that tomorrows (Saturday’s) performance will determine the success of the forthcoming plays and events planned in the city.“We have noticed that plays with celebrity actors are picking up faster than some of the smaller production houses and we are hoping that good response from audience will help theatres to get back to business,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/theatres-reopen-actor-prashant-damle-to-perform-at-yashwantrao-chavan-auditorium-today/story-NufJjft1oZXdHSJgXUa7wO.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||BJP plans drive against ‘misinformation’ on laws||Troubled by the massive protest by farmers at Delhi’s borders, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government is planning a communication outreach, covering all districts of the country, to counter what it termed a “misinformation campaign about the three recently passed farm laws”.As part of the campaign, the party has planned scores of chaupals (rural town hall meetings), press conferences and interactions to convey the message that the “contentious legislations” are, in actuality, quite beneficial to farmers and would significantly raise their incomes.BJP national general secretary Arun Singh told HT that most farmers supported his party though some have been misinformed by political rivals.“Our aim is to show that the Prime Minister wants to increase their incomes -- to double them. He is their Messiah. Farmers are with us but some have been wrongly informed, so we want to fix that,” he said.The senior BJP leader said his party will tell the people how the opposition parties were lying.“We will tell them about the Fasal Bima Yojana and all other schemes for farmers. In this effort, all MPs, all ministers and chief ministers will be involved. We will travel, spread the word and communicate,” Singh said.Singh said the BJP had done similar outreach programmers earlier as well, when it had brought in ordinances on the same subject. “We will do 100 sammelans (meetings) in every state, like kisan chaupals (farmer gatherings). We will start from Saturday and every district will see a press conference...,” Singh said.The head of BJP’s Kisan Morcha Rajkumar Chahar said there would be kisan sammelans across the country which will be held keeping in mind the restrictions in place in view of Covid-19.“The farmers are innocent. But some have done propaganda on the bills to mislead them. Our aim is to counter the propaganda…This is a big conspiracy against Modi ji’s popularity. The forces which are worried at his rise had earlier tried to hold protests on the revocation of Article 370 and the amended citizenship laws. Those did not succeed and they are now trying to mislead farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-plans-major-outreach-to-counter-misinformation-on-farm-laws/story-iEhbJqkFiI4rt3EksksizJ.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Singhu border: Farmers protest by day, watch religious films by night||After spending his day raising slogans, holding placards, and creating awareness among people about the farmers’ protest, Ranjodh Singh, 26, a dairy farmer from Jagraon village in Ludhiana district now spends his evenings watching devotional movies on the “big screen” at the Singhu border.“I stand near the stage holding these placards to create awareness among those visiting the protest site. With the speeches wrapping up by evening, there isn’t much to do after that,” he said. “But for the past two days, we have been watching movies on the big screen here.”On Wednesday, an 8x12-feet LED screen was set up near a langar spot a few hundred metres away from the green United Farmers Front stage set up at the Singhu border.For the past two days, hundreds of protesting farmers have been attending the screening of a two-part 3D animated movie called Chaar Sahibzaade directed by Harry Baweja. The farmers said the two-hour historical drama movie, popular in Punjab, is based on the sacrifices of the sons of Guru Gobind Singh.“We sit by the langar and watch the movie during dinner. It is a lot like having a meal at home with family. Through this movie, people will learn more about our culture and it will help in dispelling wrong notions about us or our struggles,” he said.The LED screen has been set up by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee to provide the protesting farmers with some relief.Maan Singh, who is in charge of the screenings held at the spot, said, “Though our focus is on films detailing the history of our culture, we also screen short documentaries on farmers or play shabad-kirtans. The attendees seem to enjoy it as it provides them with a break from the day’s protest activities.”Shoaib Malik, a volunteer at the spot who handles the equipment, said people came up to him on Friday and asked which movie would be screened at night.Eighteen-year-old Gurnool Singh, who hails from Amritsar, was among them. “We were walking towards the langar at night when we noticed the movie playing on the LED screen. We had seen the movie in the theatre when it released a few years ago. To watch it under the open sky with hundreds of farmers is a different experience. We want the organisers to screen more educational content related to farming and agriculture.”After videos of the screening were posted on social media, many labelled it a luxury. “These are attempts to discredit our movement somehow. If an organisation has set up screens and is playing inspirational movies, what is the harm in that?” said Sandeep Singh, a farmer who hails from Khai Phemeki village in Ferozepur district. “I couldn’t catch the complete movie for the last couple of days. But I will definitely visit the spot early today to see what movie they pick today [Friday].”Similar screenings have been held at Tikri border by independent artists and directors who have showcased their documentaries on farming and agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-farmers-protest-by-day-watch-religious-films-on-big-screen-by-night/story-m0mCt2XvfrFnfMJ1wdXUUM.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Cops get tested for Covid-19 at Singhu||While farmers were busy chalking out strategies for the ongoing protest against the three farm laws that seek to open up agricultural trade, the police personnel stationed at Singhu border were busy queuing up for Covid-19 tests on Friday. The testing of personnel was carried out after two senior police officers – DCP Gaurav Sharma and additional DCP Ghanshyam Bansal – who were leading the police teams contracted Covid-19. It wasn’t clear where the officers had contracted the virus but Delhi Police asked the state government to hold tests at the borders, where police personnel are stationed in large numbers.“Tests were conducted only for the police personnel. The results will come tomorrow (Saturday),” said Ajit Singh Thakur, subdivisional magistrate (Alipur), under whose jurisdiction Singhu border falls.Additional DCP Jitendra Kumar Meena, who led the police team on Friday in the absence Sharma and Bansal, said, “Random testing of 78 police personnel was carried out at the Singhu border on Friday. No farmer was screened for Covid-19.”On Thursday, the Covid-19 testing of three officers was done at Chilla border after they showed symptoms of the disease.Another senior official in the revenue department said earlier this week, the district administration had sent mobile testing vans twice to the border area with rapid antigen test kits but none of the protesting farmers had voluntarily come forward to be tested.The protesting farmers and leaders held meetings at the four border points – Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla – throughout the day to discuss their next plan of action.With protester numbers swelling, the police also increased their deployment, especially in the wake threats by farmers to block the Delhi-Jaipur highway on Saturday.Nearly 300 farmers, including women, from Gujarat and Maharashtra on Friday joined the protest at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla. “We had left for Delhi on December 22, but were stopped by the police at many places. Since, we were adamant on proceeding to our destination, they could not hold us back for long. Hundreds of people from these two states will join us in a day or two,” said Pratibha Shinde from Maharashtra, president of Lok Sangharh Morcha (Maharashtra-Gujarat unit).Addressing the protesting farmers at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP gate) border, Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said the government is not “taking their agitation seriously” and hence, they need to “intensify the protest”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-farmers-make-plans-police-queue-up-for-covid-19-tests/story-AJu2MFHHVqPTohcpVRy97L.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Police on toes as farmers threaten to intensify stir||Delhi Police have decided to double down on security at the Capital’s borders during the weekend in wake of threat by protesting farmer leaders to intensify their agitation against three new farm laws passed by the Centre. The Delhi traffic police too have decided to increase their presence in border areas so that vehicular movement is not disrupted. Farmer unions leading the protests in Delhi said more farmers from Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab are expected to join their agitation from Friday night and on Saturday. As per All India Kisan Sabha’s Punjab general secretary Major Singh Punawal, the Jaipur-Delhi Expressway will be blocked on Saturday. Large protests will be held at toll plazas on Saturday and Monday, and the toll plazas will be made free across the country, he said. Senior officials of the Delhi traffic police said that though their priority will be to not let traffic movement within the city or around the borders be affected, the department is ready with a “contingency plan” to ensure there is no disruption. On Saturday, nearly 4,000 traffic personnel will be deployed across the city to man traffic movements. Majority of this force will be stationed at border points, the police said. “We are not releasing the contingency plan because we are not going to allow the protesting farmers to cause any kind of disruption. But in case they manage to reach the borders, we are prepared,” said a traffic official. On Friday , the Delhi traffic police had a meeting with local traffic units and with police teams from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to decide on a contingency plan. This included a plan of alternative routes to be used in case any additional entry point into the city is blocked. All the traffic circle inspectors were informed about their place of deployment and given a list of alternative borders and routes through which movement of vehicles between Delhi-Haryana and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh can be diverted if the main borders are blocked by protesting farmers or workers of political parties and various unions that have supported the nationwide strike, said a traffic police officer. At present, seven border crossings into the national Capital have been completely shut by the protesters. These include Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mungeshwar in outer and south-western parts of the city and Chilla border, connecting Delhi and Noida, in east Delhi. Apart from these seven points, the Delhi-Meerut expressway at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border is closed for vehicles coming to Delhi from the Ghaziabad side, while the opposite carriageway through which vehicles move towards Ghaziabad is open. The service road of NH-24 at the UP gate border is also closed, as protesting farmers have occupied it for the past 10 days. Traffic police officials said due to the closure of the seven borders, the available borders for movement between Delhi and Haryana would be Lampur, Safiabad, Saboli, Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan, Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera. “Similarly, motorists travelling between Delhi and UP are advised to take Apsara, Bhopra, Anand Vihar, Kalindi Kunj, DND, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli and Dallupura to avoid traffic chaos. In case, some of these borders are also disrupted, there are porous borders through which vehicles will be diverted,” said another traffic officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-on-toes-as-farmers-threaten-to-intensify-stir-block-jaipur-highway/story-iIH3qI0Fgdn2HTPPbzSKII.html
12-12-2020||Chandigarh||VIPs recommended for priority Covid-19 vaccine shot in Haryana||Public representatives in Haryana, including members of Parliament (MPs) and members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), have been recommended for priority inoculation of coronavirus vaccine by the state government. A December 10 communication by the state health department to the Union health ministry recommending inclusion of MPs and MLAs in the priority list said the public representatives are at a risk of getting exposed to the virus since they frequently meet people to hear their grievances. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will also write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure their immunisation on priority, officials said. “ The recommendation for including MPs and MLAs in the priority list primarily entails vaccinating 105 persons (10 Lok Sabha MPs, 5 Rajya Sabha MPs and 90 MLAs),’’ an official said. “The coronavirus vaccine administration will span over a year with multiple groups being included sequentially. For the first phase of vaccination, health care workers will be inoculated. That means they are the top priority. Frontline workers like municipal, sanitary workers, state and central police forces, civil, defence, armed forces will be vaccinated next. The third category is population above 50. The public representatives, if approved by the Centre, will be the next,” a health official said. Journalists, civil servants figure in listMedia persons registered with the district public relations offices also figure in the state’s recommendation for priority inoculation. Civil and revenue administrators such as deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, sub divisional magistrates, tehsildars and patwaris etc have also been recommended for priority vaccination since they handle disaster management and are actively involved in public interaction. Besides, volunteers who were involved in Covid-19 vaccine trials and given placebos have also been recommended for priority inoculation, said the communication sent to the Union health ministry. Officials said a request has been made to the Centre to accord priority vaccination to these vulnerable occupational groups so that they who are providing services at the frontline are also protected on priority. The communication also said that during the serological survey conducted by the Haryana health department, a section of the population was found sero positive due to development of antibodies against Covid-19 infection. Frontline workers among the serological positive population may not be considered for priority vaccination in the first phase and instead may be considered for the second phase, it said. Besides, population below 50 but having comorbidities have also been recommended on the grounds that they are a productive group and are only 2.25 lakh in numbers. Thus, they can be easily accommodated along with people who are above 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vips-recommended-for-priority-covid-19-vaccine-shot-in-haryana/story-UBPB9wPvYfLQh0BAzCDhLO.html

12-12-2020||Pune||State okays university status to COEP||The College of Engineering Pune (COEP) has finally received autonomy status, according to the state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant. The decision was taken at a meeting attended by state labour and excise minister Dilip Walse Patil, College of Engineering Pune officials and Sawant on Wednesday.After the act is passed at the legislative assembly, COEP will get the “university status”, which will be granted in four to six months’ time. “Though COEP was given the autonomy status, they had to depend on government officials for faculty recruitment, policy making and implementing decisions. In the past 15 years, COEP administration has raised funds of around Rs30 to 35 crore from corporates and alumni students. And they have also done considerable savings of Rs 25 crore, which is used for the development of the institution,” said Samant. “To improve quality education at COEP full autonomy was needed to be given and the Prof Sanjay Dhande committee recommendations are also important to be implemented in this case. So, permission was given for full autonomy to COEP and further proceedings will be done accordingly by the department,” said Prataprao Pawar, chairman of board of governors of COEP who was also present at the meeting.Also, maps and designs for COEP “Excellence Centre” at the 30 acres given by the state government at Chikhali were also approved in the meeting. Soon, tendering would start and work on the new campus at Chikhali for the benefit of students from Pimpri and Chinchwad areas will begin. Prof BB Ahuja, director of COEP said, “The vision and future plans of COEP and were discussed at the meeting. Till the university status act is passed at the legislative assemble, Samant has assured us to give complete autonomy and we appreciated it. It is basically giving more empowerment to COEP and they are also giving the first instalment of Rs 25 crore soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-okays-university-status-to-coep/story-vH92xmm7edQSGwM5T8w8MP.html

Bidkar, who had lost in the 2017 municipal election, gained the favour of the party as nominated member in PMC.Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “By appointing Bidkar, BJP has certified that its 98 elected members in PMC do not have the capacity to rule in PMC. They were forced to appoint a nominated member as the leader of house. It is happening for the first time in the history of municipal corporation that a nominated member has got the leader of house post.”Shiv Sena city unit president Sanjay More said, “It’s sad that despite getting a clear majority and having 98 members, BJP appointed a nominated member. He himself would not have the power to cast vote in the house.”Opposition party members said that Bidkar’s appointment was a move to keep MP Girish Bapat away from the functioning of PMC as both are considered as rivals.BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik said, “There is no law that states that a nominated member cannot be appointed as the leader of house. Bidkar is a senior leader and has played an important role in increasing the vote base in the Pune station area.”BJP spokesperson Sandeep Khardekar said, “It is the duty of oppositions to make allegations. They are doing their job. Bidkar is capable and would ensure that BJP would execute all the promises given in the manifesto.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-nominates-bidkar-as-a-leader-of-house-in-pmc/story-BsTgQIYrdwSv0KbK07yaGI.html

12-12-2020||Pune||Memorial on legendary Marathi poet GaDiMa to come up at Pune||Pune: A monument (smarak) in memory of legendary Marathi poet Gajanan Digambar Madgulkar aka GD Madgulkar aka GaDiMa will become a reality on his 100th birth anniversary. While the decision to build a memorial was taken by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) three years back, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has taken the lead and it will be built at Kothrud. GaDiMa (October 1, 1919 – December 14, 1977), who was a poet, lyricist, author, playwright, actor and editor of a magazine, also took part in India’s independence movement. The followers of GaDiMa had staged an agitation for delay in setting up a memorial at Balgandharva Rangmandir in 2018. The poet’s relatives are also seeking a smarak for the past 40 years. Mohol said, “The land in Kothrud area was allocated in 2017. After that, tender was scrutinised. In February 2020, before the corona pandemic started, tender was sanctioned by the standing committee. However, work could not take off because of lockdown. Now, we have decided to start work and finish it as early as possible. The smarak will be constructed as per GaDiMa’s family members’ suggestions. The purpose of smarak is to conserve the contribution of GaDiMa in different fields such as culture, literature and films.” The chosen site is behind Wonder Society in Kothrud. It will be built on 6.27 acre. The proposed four-storey building will have an independent auditorium with seating capacity of 300 people, GaDiMa Smarak, exhibition centre and an aquarium. At the ground floor, the corporation will develop a cafeteria, besides separate parking area for two-wheelers and cars. The smarak will also include GaDiMa personal life journey, cultural and film contribution. PMC has given names to dalan (section) — Geet Ramayan Dalan, GDMa Sahitya Dalan, GD Ma Personal Dalan. PMC has allotted Rs 8.50 crore for the project. Shivaji Lank, superintendent engineer, PMC building construction department said, “It will take two years to complete the smarak. We have allocated funds to construct the smarak within the deadline. The smarak was announced in 2017.” Sumitr, grandson of Madgulkar said, “We have been seeking a memorial for for the last 43 years. Mayor Mohol showed a presentation of the plan. Finally, we are happy to see that smarak will be built. We don’t want only statues of GaDiMa, but people should see, listen and read his works, especially the younger generation.” Contribution to Indian cinema Gajanan Digambar Madgulkar created Geet Ramayana in Marathi language, a collection of 56 poems that were aired on All India Radio. He has written stories for legendary actor-director- producer V Shantaram like “Do Ankhen Barah Haath”, “Navrang” and “Goonj Uthi Shehnai”. He penned stories, screenplays and dialogues for around 157 Marathi and 25 Hindi films. He wrote more than 2,000 Marathi songs.

12-12-2020||Pune||Light drizzle likely to put chill back in night temps in Pune: IMD||PUNE A very light drizzle was witnessed in several areas in Pune on Friday morning. The cloudy weather continued till noon, as per the forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature on Friday evening was 18.2 degrees Celsius, whereas the maximum temperature was 28.8 degrees Celsius. IMD forecast that the night temperature was expected to drop to 11.8 degrees Celsius. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting department of IMD Pune, said that there is a trough - a weather system running through the southern parts of Gujarat, to Konkan and Goa.“This trough is the reason for unseasonal light showers in the city. And the cloudy weather in Pune. The cloudy conditions will continue till December 14. Very light showers are also forecast till December 13,” said Kashyapi.For the state, IMD has forecast light showers in northern central Maharashtra till December 13. “Along with light rains, thunderstorms are also likely in these parts till December 13. On December 14 and December 15, some parts of Vidarbha may witness light showers along with thunderstorms,” said the IMD officials.The minimum temperature on December 10 at Parbhani was 13.6 degrees Celsius. The lowest minimum temperature on December 11 was at Gondia, 14 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/light-drizzle-likely-to-put-chill-back-in-night-temps-imd/story-GGP4qISPxieslKgGBLX7fN.html
12-12-2020||Pune||Pvt doctors reluctant to sign up for Covid vaccination drive due to unanswered queries||Of the 5,000 private health facilities registered with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), at least 1,720 have not submitted names of staff for the Covid-19 vaccination. These numbers are as of December 5, and despite the administration’s repeated attempts to increase registration by extending deadlines, confusion about where to register and lack of clarity on the vaccination itself, has doctors hesitant to register. By mid-October, the central government directed all states to collect a database of all staff working in various hospitals - both private and public. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra chapter had raised several questions after the state government changed point number 8b of the government’s directive; the words “registered with the district” were introduced in parenthesis, while enumerating private medical facilities. This had led to confusion among private practitioners. In following meetings, the state government later confirmed that all private hospitals can register for the priority vaccination drive.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi declaring that the country would soon have a vaccine in the coming weeks, 25% of private health facilities and their staff are yet to register. The earlier deadline for the same was the end of November, which has since been extended several times till now. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospitals’ Board, IMA Pune, said, “Earlier there was confusion about where to register. We were asked to register on three platforms - one on the PMC’s centralised portal; second on the Maharashtra Medical Council portal; and thirdly at the local PMC ward-level. This is the clerical part. The medical apprehensions are that we do not know which vaccine will be approved. The safety and efficacy of a particular vaccine will only come out once the vaccine is approved and the results are out in public domain. Doctors are mainly concerned about how the vaccine would be administered, who will administer it, and who will give the dose and where it would be made available.”He added, “There are also reservations about safety and efficacy of the vaccine. There are debates and discussions among the medical fraternity about the vaccine for which a few doctors have decided that they will register for the second drive. The other issue is, whether a vaccinated person will have flu-like symptoms after being vaccinated? Or, that I may get a complication phase, or inflammatory phase, which kicks in on day 8. The third and most common concern is what of transmissibility post vaccination? So If a doctor does get infected and continues to remain a possible transmissitter and an asymptomatic carrier, then it will prove to be dangerous for his/her family?”With most vaccine candidates having carried out phase two and trials on the above-18 and healthy volunteers who do not have any comorbidities, seniors doctors who are most likely to have multiple comorbidities and the age factor itself, are also reluctant to get registered for vaccination. Dr Patil added, “The hesitancy among doctors might send out a wrong message to the general population on whether to be vaccinated or not. So we are sensitising our members to get themselves registered and most major hospitals have already sent out their details. These pending applications might be from smaller clinics or hospitals.”Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer, PMC, said, “Despite repeated attempts private hospitals are not registering themselves and only those registered would be applicable for the priority vaccination drive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-doctors-reluctant-to-sign-up-for-covid-vaccination-drive-due-to-unanswered-queries/story-mYgAMHtiOHYIogplZoZ4KP.html
12-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai receives unseasonal light showers on Friday, minimum temperature still high||The city woke up to unseasonal, light showers on Friday morning owing to the presence of a low pressure weather system in the Arabian Sea. Though the showers did not bring any relief from the high minimum temperature on Friday, the city witnessed its coolest December day since 2014. The city is likely to witness cloudy sky with the possibility of light rain or thundershowers on Saturday. The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, received 3mm of rainfall from the early hours of Friday to 8.30am, while the Santacruz station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 0.2 mm of rain. Humidity levels were 92% in south Mumbai and 79% in the suburbs. Between 8.30am and 5.30pm, light rain at 1.4mm was recorded in south Mumbai and at 0.7 mm in suburbs. It was mostly dry weather with a partly cloudy sky from afternoon. As a result of light showers and cloudy conditions, the maximum temperature in the suburbs was 28.8 degrees Celsius (4 degree Celsius below normal and a 4 degree Celsius drop since Thursday), making it the lowest maximum temperature for the month since 2014. On December 31, 2014, the city had recorded 27.8 degrees Celsius, but the lowest for the decade was recorded on December 13, 2010, at 26.5 degrees Celsius. South Mumbai on Friday recorded 28 degrees Celsius (5 degree Celsius below normal) as the maximum temperature. Conversely, the minimum temperature in the suburbs was 24.4 degrees Celsius, 5.6 degrees Celsius above normal – the second highest December minimum temperature in 10 years. The highest was recorded last year on December 5 at 25.3 degrees Celsius. South Mumbai recorded 24 degrees Celsius, 3 degree Celsius above normal, on Friday. Meanwhile, unseasonal rainfall was also recorded from parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, across Raigad district, and other areas along south Konkan between Thursday night and Friday morning. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a forecast for light showers or drizzling for Friday, and revised the forecast at 8am to the possibility of thunderstorms for the rest of Friday and Saturday. “There are two reasons for this type of weather,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, adding that the first being the low pressure weather system over southeast and now adjoining southwest Arabian Sea, and cloud bands extending from it spreading right from south Gujarat, north Maharashtra, and over the Konkan coast. The second was the western disturbance extending from the northern parts of the country all the way up to northwest and western India. “As it passes, there is an interaction of westerly and easterly winds in and around the north Maharashtra region. This could result in light to moderate rains for north central Maharashtra and isolated areas along the Konkan coast,” he said. Rain during December is rare phenomenon for the city. However, last year 1.2mm of rainfall was recorded on December 5 owing to a weather depression in the Arabian Sea. Between December 5 and 6, 2017, Mumbai suburbs recorded 53.8mm rainfall, while south Mumbai recorded 82.2mm, as Cyclone Ockhi went past the city. It was also the all-time high December rain for Mumbai. Meanwhile, the city received rain two days after recording the highest maximum temperature in the country on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to IMD. From 36.4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 36 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, the maximum temperature began dropping from Thursday to 33.8 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) was at 145 (moderate) with hazy conditions on early Friday but researchers said showers would help improve the AQI over the weekend. An AQI of 139 (moderate) has been predicted for Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-receives-unseasonal-light-showers-on-friday-minimum-temperature-still-high/story-dhgQwAdOsCN047MZ0RroSJ.html
12-12-2020||Delhi||Pvt unaided schools charitable institutions, must ensure online education for all, govt tells HC||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi high court that all private unaided schools, being charitable institutions, cannot resort to profiteering and they must ensure that in emergent situations, every student has access to proper education. To that end, it is the responsibility of schools to provide students with learning materials online without any discrimination or hinderance, the government argued.The Delhi government was responding to a plea by the action committee unaided recognized private schools, an umbrella body of 400 private schools, which had sought the quashing of two orders of the city government, issued on April 18 and August 28, restraining schools from collecting annual charges, development fee and any other fee other than the tuition fee.The government told justice Jayant Nath that the acute financial pressure and stress on the general public owing to the pandemic have not abated and, in such a situation, the attempt by the association to burden parents is “harsh”, “unjust”, “unfair” and “inequitable” to say the least.The government further contended that on examination of the fee statement of private unaided schools, it was found that in most cases, the expenditure incurred on salary and establishment infrastructure was approximately 40%-60% of the tuition fee charged by schools.“It was therefore considered expedient to allow the schools to continue charging only tuition fee as the same would have enabled the schools to continue imparting education to students during the unprecedented situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the document filed by advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government.It further said these educational institutions are bound to ensure that students are not harassed by the charging of any increased tuition fee or any other fee under a new head. It said some schools were found resorting to certain malpractices which were “inhumane”, especially in view of the outbreak of Covid-19.Advocate Kamal Gupta, counsel for the action committee, said “the government of Delhi’s liking for vote bank politics has marred its understanding of devastating consequences upon private education. Property taxes, insurance, maintenance of buildings and infrastructure etc cannot be met from tuition fee”.“What the government calls commercialisation in private schools, is in fact a fraction of cost of the education; the government’s per child expenditure is many times more than private schools. Annual charges and development fee, if not collected, would lead to closure of many schools,” Gupta said.The government told the court that some private schools were not providing online learning material/classes to students whose parents have not paid or not agreed to pay the “illegally hiked fee”. “Even though the tuition fee covered the cost towards salary, establishments, and curricular activities such as library, lab, science fee, computer fee, examination expenses, etc., some private schools were not paying salary to the teaching and non-teaching staffs in this ongoing lockdown or paying them less salary,” the affidavit filed on November 17 said.Aprajitha Gautam, from the Delhi Parents Association, alleged that the Delhi government is not taking action against the erring schools which have violated the rules laid down by the authorities.“The government’s stand in the court and on the ground is completely different. It is not taking action against several schools which continue to charge the development fee and annual charges. We had shared with the government a list of 76 schools which had violated the norms. However, no action has been taken against them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pvt-unaided-schools-charitable-institutions-must-ensure-online-education-for-all-govt-tells-hc/story-HqQtrd1SkCs9EubT35oRkN.html
12-12-2020||World||Geminid meteor shower over the weekend. Here’s how you can watch it||The Geminid meteor shower is an annual celestial event that occurs at the end of the year. And this year, it is expected to be a treat for stargazers across the globe due to some special natural conditions. The meteor shower is expected to peak from December 13 to December 14 and can be best seen between 1am and 4am.US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has said the meteor shower will begin from 7:30-8:00pm CST on December 13 with an increasing rate of meteors towards 2am in the northern hemisphere. Stargazers observing from midnight to 4am can capture the best moments.The dazzling meteor shower is happening during the new moon phase this year making it special, that means the shower will be lightening the sky on a moonless night. The dark due to the absence of the moon will make it easier for the stargazers to observe the event. The space agency predicted that the skywatchers in the northern hemisphere can catch near to 60 meteors per hour; that is an average of one Geminid per minute during the peak time, while people in the southern hemisphere will see less than their neighbours in the north.Geminids are unique because they don’t belong to the parent body of a comet. As per meteor scientists, Geminids are the only shower having an asteroidal parent body. This asteroid parent identified in 1983 via a satellite is called 3200 Phaethon. A Geminid meteor shower is a result of burning up dust left by 3200 Phaethon when the Earth passes by the mighty asteroid. Geminids that are named after a constellation Gemini as they appear to radiate from that point, travel at a rate of 35 kilometres per second, 40 times faster than a speeding bullet.How to watch?It is recommended to get to a place with fewer trees, city lights and pollution to block the view, lie on the back and look up. The smartphone-addict generation is advised to let their eyes settle to dark for 30-35 minutes and as the eyes get adjusted, the stargazers will be able to watch more meteors. One can see a Geminid if they try to trace the meteor backwards and end up meeting with the constellation Gemini.Nasa too will live stream the meteor showers on the peak nights, capturing it from a meteor camera at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama from 8 to 4am CST that is 7:30am to 3:30pm IST on its Meteor Watch Facebook page.As per Nasa, the shower will begin at 1am UTC or 6:30am IST and skywatchers in India can see the shower as experts suggest that it will be visible in the north of the equator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/geminid-meteor-shower-over-the-weekend-here-s-how-you-can-watch-it/story-OG4ft75CVspx9tmc0GSfJM.html

Paris police made at least 81 arrests, the interior minister tweeted.Riot police escorted Saturday’s march through the rain-slickened streets in Paris.The proposed security law has been met by successive weekends of protests.The bill’s most contested measure could make it more difficult for people to film police officers. It aims to outlaw the publication of images with intent to cause harm to police. The provision has caused such an uproar that the government has decided to rewrite it.Critics fear the law could erode media freedom and make it more difficult to expose police brutality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-arrested-at-paris-protest-over-proposed-security-law/story-bARfR5k650lg2auNCK4RAN.html
12-12-2020||World||Pfizer vaccine cleared in US, a landmark in Covid-19 fight||Pfizer Inc. gained emergency US authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, completing an unprecedented scientific sprint that could eventually help bring an end to a pandemic that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans.The Food and Drug Administration’s decision to authorize use of Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE’s vaccine will now set in motion a complicated immunization drive that will launch across the country in coming days.Gen. Gustave F. Perna, the chief operating officer for the government vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, said at a news briefing Saturday that vaccines are being packaged and will arrive at the first administration sites on Monday. Among the first to be inoculated will be health-care workers and seniors living in long-term care facilities.The shot is a landmark achievement, built from a breakthrough technology in a matter of months, in the face of a pandemic that has sickened millions worldwide. It has already been cleared by regulators in the U.K., Canada and other countries.“With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks,” Peter Marks, the head of the FDA’s office that oversees vaccines, said in a statement.The approval also caps a fraught political struggle that has seen President Donald Trump push drug regulators to swiftly clear a vaccine. In the final hours of the review Friday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows suggested to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn that failure to clear the vaccine for use soon could cost him his job. On Saturday, Hahn defended the agency’s thoroughness and transparency.“We worked quickly because of the urgency of this pandemic, not because of any external pressure,” Hahn said Saturday on a call with reporters.The FDA’s career scientists “conducted a fast but incredibly thorough review,” he said, adding they worked “around the clock including holidays, weekends and nights.” The agency is in the process of reviewing its response to Covid-19, including how it handles emergency authorization requests, Hahn said.Trump called the clearance “one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history” in a video on Twitter, saying it will save millions of lives and end the pandemic.Distribution BeginsThe first doses will begin shipping throughout the country immediately, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said. Trucks will head out from manufacturing sites in Wisconsin and Michigan, packed with the shots, which must be stored at ultracold temperatures. Pfizer has developed special dry-ice containers to make it easier to store for facilities that don’t have the needed equipment.“We’re pretty convinced that we can make this happen here,” Marks said regarding maintaining cold storage. “We’re hopeful that this is going to work out.”The vaccine is expected to be given first to health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Later on Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will make its own recommendation on the vaccine, likely clearing the way for doctors to begin administering it.Health systems around the U.S. are preparing to begin immunizing people in the coming days. Sanford Health, based in the Upper Midwest, said that it had received notice from Pfizer that its order had been received and that it would be notified when its doses ship.“We could receive the vaccine in our hospitals in North Dakota and South Dakota as early as Sunday, and be putting shots in arms as soon as Monday,” said spokeswoman Angela Dejene.A shot similar to Pfizer and BioNTech’s made by Moderna Inc. is expected to gain U.S. clearance next week, providing the country with a potent combination for beating back the pathogen. More vaccines are also expected to be brought to market next year, expanding the arsenal doctors will have to rein in Covid-19.Pfizer’s vaccine, like Moderna’s, uses a new technology called messenger RNA that turns the body’s own cells into vaccine-producing factories to fight the coronavirus. In a trial of almost 44,000 people, it was 95% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of Covid-19, protecting people of all ages and ethnicities. Crucially, it was able to prevent the most severe infections.Pfizer and BioNTech plan to provide clinical-trial participants who received the placebo the authorized shot “at scheduled timepoints in the study,” the companies said in a joint news release, without elaborating. “The vaccine option will be voluntary and will be implemented in alignment with the regulatory authorities where the trial is conducted.”Allergy IssuesFollowing a Thursday vote by an advisory panel of outside experts backing the vaccine for use in people 16 and older, the FDA was weighing how to address reports of serious allergic reactions in the U.K., where the vaccine was approved earlier this month. Officials there have since told people with a history of significant allergic reactions not to get the vaccine.In a fact sheet for patients, the FDA said “there is a remote chance” the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction and told doctors in a similar document they should have medical interventions on hand to help treat such a side effect. The CDC, which is helping states with the vaccine rollout, will ensure each site has medication on hand to treat any allergic reactions, FDA’s Marks said Saturday.While serious allergic reactions were not seen in Pfizer’s clinical trials and Marks said the FDA is “comfortable” giving the vaccine to Americans, he added: “We’ll be monitoring very closely for them. I think we still need to learn more.”Many Americans have expressed skepticism about the vaccines being developed to fight the coronavirus. A wider campaign to convince the hesitant to get inoculated is expected in the weeks and months ahead.“As a physician, I have no hesitation recommending that my parents and my patients’ families receive the vaccine, and I encourage all Americans to get vaccinated in the order recommended by the CDC,” said Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC. “When my group is called, I will gladly roll up my sleeve.”Side effects in Pfizer’s clinical trial were mild and developed more frequently in younger participants in the study, specifically those aged 55 and younger, with no signs of serious safety concerns, according to an FDA staff report on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.After the second injection, fatigue and headache were the most common systemic reactions, occurring in 59% and 52% of the younger participants, compared with 51% and 39% in those over age 56.Stopping SpreadIt isn’t clear whether the vaccine is effective at preventing Covid-19’s spread. It is possible the shot didn’t work as well at preventing cases where people didn’t have symptoms, meaning there will likely be a continued need for basic public-health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing.The FDA expects more data on the shot’s effect on Covid-19 transmission in a “few months,” Marks said Saturday.The vaccine showed some protection from symptomatic Covid-19 after one shot, but the FDA is recommending people take both doses to achieve the full 95% effectiveness of the vaccine, particularly given that Pfizer studied a two-dose regimen so it’s not known how long the reduced protection from one shot would last.Pfizer didn’t study the vaccine in pregnant or lactating women, though the FDA is leaving it up to those women as to whether they will receive the vaccine. The company also did not have much data on the shot’s use in 16 and 17 year olds but Marks said they’re comfortable with the safety profile for the age group.Global DemandAmong the vaccine front-runners, the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the only one that didn’t take funding from the White House-led Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 shots. However, the two companies have secured a $2 billion deal to supply 100 million doses to the U.S., with an option for 500 million more.Countries around the world are clamoring for more doses of the vaccine, said Sean Marett, BioNTech’s chief business and commercial officer, in an interview.“Everybody wants all their doses on January 2nd of next year, but that’s not practical,” he said in an interview. “This is a new technology, there does not exist a manufacturing network. We are building it.”To help increase the number of shots on hand, the U.S. agreed to buy 100 million more doses of Moderna’s vaccine on Friday, doubling its initial order. The government has an option to buy another 300 million doses of the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-cleared-in-us-a-landmark-in-covid-19-fight/story-49htqZCKv9lSY20tHGrTMO.html
12-12-2020||World||US President-elect Joe Biden vows to rejoin Paris Climate Accord on day one of presidency||US President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warmingHeads of state and government from over 70 countries were joining the online event hosted by France, Britain, Italy, Chile and the United Nations, to pledge greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.The United States, which quit the Paris accord under President Donald Trump, wasn’t represented at the federal level.In a statement, Biden noted that the US had been key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world.“The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,” he said. “I’ll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.”Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting US emissions to net zero “no later than 2050.”Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2C (3.6F), ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7F), by the end of the century.Achieving this will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world’s carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.“We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the US economy,” he said.American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and US business leaders, such as Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook.Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, none of which has offered significant improvements on its existing emissions targets.Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil’s recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 percent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 — far later than most other countries.By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent’s 2030 targets from 40% to at least 55% compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.China, the world’s biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. Observers say this is likely a low offer that Beijing can significantly improve on in years to come.The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year due to the pandemic.The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year’s host, announced this month it is aiming to cut emissions by 68% over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.“Because if we don’t, the alternative is unthinkable,” she said. “None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-vows-to-rejoin-paris-climate-accord-on-day-one-of-presidency/story-z6OIGy0GQJ8qQmYVXSYq3J.html
12-12-2020||World||Zodiac Killer’s victims, letters and the code||After 51 years, a team of mathematicians have finally cracked a cipher sent by the infamous serial killer who called himself the Zodiac. The Zodiac killer’s identity still remains unknown. The serial killer claimed to have murdered 37 individuals in total but investigators have only confirmed seven victims, two of whom survived the attempt. He primarily targeted young couples but had also murdered a cab driver once. The Zodiac killer operated in northern California, USA, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. His five confirmed murders were committed between December 1968 and October 1969. Confirmed murdersLake Herman Road murders: The Zodiac killer’s first victims were a high school couple, Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday on December 20, 1968. The two were on their first date and had driven out to Lake Herman Road, just within Benicia City limits, where they had parked their car. According to reports, the killer had pulled up his car beside the couple’s, before shooting Faraday in the head and Jensen five times in the back as she fled.  Blue Rock Springs murder: On July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau had pulled up at Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, 6.4 km from the Lake Herman Road murder site. A car had pulled up beside theirs, only to drive off and come back within 10 minutes. The driver got out of the car with a flashlight and a gun before flashing the light at the couple and shooting them five times. While returning to his car, he heard Mageau moaning and shot him two more times.Lake Berryessa murder: This was the first incident where one of the victims had survived. Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard had gone to Lake Beryessa in Napa County on September 27, 1969. A man had approached them with a gun, wearing a black hood over his head and sunglasses. The man claimed to be an escaped convict and demanded a car to escape to Mexico. He ordered Shepard to tie Hartnell up before tying her up himself. On discovering that Hartnell was loosely tied, he stabbed the couple, Hartnell six times, and Shepard 10, before drawing his patented cross-circle symbol on Hartnell’s car, and writing beneath it: “Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife.” He then phoned the Napa County Sheriff’s office from a payphone, reporting the crimes and confessing to them before escaping the scene. Shepard died two days after being taken to the hospital while Hartnell survived. Presidio Heights murder: On October 11, 1969, the killer entered a cab driven by Paul Stine in San Farncisco and requested to go to Washington and Maple Streets in Presidio Heights. When Stine drove past Maple Street, he was shot in the head. The killer took his wallet and keys and tore away part of his bloodstained shirt. Three teenagers were witnessing the incident as it unfolded and called the police. Patrol officers responded to the call and even saw him, but he escaped.  Letters from the Zodiac KillerThree letters written by the Zodiac killer were received on August 1,1969 at the Vallejo Times Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner. The killer had taken credit for the Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs murders in them and each letter contained one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram in which the killer claimed to have revealed his identity. On October 14, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received another letter from the killer along with part of Paul Stine’s shirt as proof that he was the killer.  On November 8, 1969, the killer sent a 340 word cryptogram which was recently solved after 51 years on December 5, 2020. On November 9, 1969, the killer sent a seven-page letter describing how he was stopped by two policemen and had even spoken to them after committing the Paul Stine murder. On December 20, 1969, a year after the lake Herman Road murders, the Zodiac mailed a letter to lawyer Melvin Belli with another part of Paul Stine’s shirt, he said that he wanted help.  The solved letterA team of codebreakers, David Oranchak, Sam Blake and Jarl Van Eycke, cracked the 340 word cryptogram on December 5 which the killer had sent to the San Francisco Chronicle on Novermber 8, 1969. The letter read: “ I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. That wasn’t me on the TV show which brings up a point about me. I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice all the sooner. Because I now have enough slaves to work for me where everyone else has nothing when they reach paradice so they are afraid of death. I am not afraid because I know that my new life will be an easy one in paradice death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zodiac-killer-s-victims-letters-and-the-code/story-8fxNwImx7WtpPAChbDmdLJ.html
12-12-2020||World||Italy’s staggering virus toll poses uncomfortable questions||Italy could soon reclaim a record that nobody wants — the most coronavirus deaths in Europe — after the health care system again failed to protect the elderly and the government delayed imposing new restrictions.This wasn’t supposed to happen. Italy was the first country in the West to be slammed by Covid-19 and, after suffering a huge wave of death in spring, brought infections under control.Italy then had the benefit of time and experience heading into the fall resurgence because it trailed Spain, France and Germany in recording big new clusters of infections. Yet the virus spread fast and wide, and Italy has added 28,000 dead since September 1.“Obviously there needs to be some reflection,” Guido Rasi, former executive director of the European Pharmaceutical Agency, told state TV after Italy reported a pandemic-high record of 993 deaths in one day. “This number of nearly 1,000 dead in 24 hours is much higher than the European average.” Italy added another 761 victims Friday, bringing its official total to 63,387, just shy of Britain’s Europe-leading 63,603 dead, according to Johns Hopkins University. Both numbers are believed to greatly underestimate the real toll, due to missed infections, limited testing and different counting criteria.Still, Italy could overtake Britain despite having 6 million people fewer than the UK’s 66 million, and would trail only the much larger US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population after Japan, and the elderly are the most vulnerable to the virus.The average age of Italian victims has hovered around 80. In addition, 65% of Italy’s Covid-19 dead had three or more other health problems before they tested positive, such as hypertension or diabetes, according to Italy’s Superior Institute of Health.But that doesn’t explain the whole picture. Germany has a similarly old demographic and yet its death toll is one-third of Italy’s despite its larger population of 83 million. Germany recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus victims Friday — 598 — but has only 21,000 dead overall.Analysts point to Germany’s long-term higher per-capita spending on health care, which has resulted in greater ICU capacity, better testing and tracing capabilities and higher ratios of doctors and nurses to the population. But Germany also imposed an earlier, lighter lockdown this fall and is now poised to tighten it.“If you can act sooner, even a bit lighter in the measures, they work better than acting harshly a bit later or too late,” said Matteo Villa, research fellow at the Institute for International Political Studies, a Milan-based think tank.Italy, he said, waited too long after infections started ticking up in September and October to impose restrictions and didn’t reinforce its medical system sufficiently during the summertime lull.“If you look at France and the UK, you can see Italy did fare much worse,” he said. “And if you look at a comparable population with similar demographics, which is Germany, Italy did a lot worse.” With another wave of infections feared to be just around the corner with Christmas visits and the winter flu season, many are wondering how many more will die.Doctors have blamed systemic problems with Italy’s health care system, especially in hardest-hit Lombardy, for failing to respond adequately. They have cited the growth of private hospitals in Lombardy in recent years at the expense of public ones. Brain drain and bureaucratic obstacles have resulted in fewer doctors going into practice, while general practitioners have complained of a lack of support despite being the backbone of the system.Nearly 80,000 Italian health care workers have been infected and 255 doctors have died.“We asked for a lockdown at the start of November because the situation inside hospitals was already difficult,” said Dr. Filippo Anelli, head of the country’s doctors’ association. “We saw that it worked in the spring and allowed us to get out from under Covid. If this had been done, probably today the numbers would be coming down.” But the Italian government resisted re-imposing a nationwide lockdown this fall, knowing the devastating impact on an economy that was just starting to come back to life after the springtime shutdown.Instead, on November 3 the government divided the country into three risk zones with varying restrictions. But by then infections had been doubling each week for nearly a month and hospitals were already overwhelmed in Milan and Naples.Italy also went into the pandemic poorly prepared. It had fewer ICU beds than the average of developed countries. And in recent weeks, investigative news reports have noted that Italy hadn’t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006 — which could help explain its critical shortage of protective equipment early on and its chaotic initial response to the pandemic.A World Health Organization (WHO) report, which was posted and then immediately taken down from the WHO website, noted that Italy’s 2006 plan was merely “reconfirmed in 2017” without being updated. The report said the plan was “more theoretical than practical” and that when Covid-19 hit, all hell broke loose.“Unprepared for such a flood of severely ill patients, the initial reaction of the hospitals was improvised, chaotic and creative,” said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-staggering-virus-toll-poses-uncomfortable-questions/story-0jt9C4IVw5zAcOr7J40vaJ.html

12-12-2020||World||Air India gets reprieve in UK court over aircraft lease payments||Air India has got some reprieve from a UK court as it allowed India’s flag carrier time until early January to make payments in a case of unpaid dues of over USD 17.6 million, with the judge accepting the “broad thrust” of the airline’s financial difficulties, especially due to the grounding of flights during the Covid-19 lockdown.Judge Simon Salzedo, however, issued a strong rebuke to Air India for its “unsatisfactory and discourteous” conduct in relation to the case by not engaging with the process in a timely manner.The hearing, held remotely at the Commercial Court division here on Friday, involved unpaid dues of over USD 17.6 million to China Aircraft Leasing Company Limited (CALC) as part of an aircraft lease agreement for rent and maintenance.“I accept the broad thrust of Air India’s submission of the financial difficulties it has been facing along with the rest of the aviation sector and also note that it has been making some payments to the lessors,” the judge noted, as he granted Air India until January 11, 2021, to clear the overdue payments.However, that extension is conditional on the airline paying in the already committed amount for the month of December, amounting to a total of USD 5 million.The counsel for CALC, a global aircraft leasing company, had sought immediate payment and argued that Air India being a state-owned airline can always seek funds from the Indian government and is only seeking to delay matters for its client, who has been waiting for nearly a year for the payments.Air India, on the other hand, argued that it does not dispute that the claimant is entitled to payments for leased aircraft, but as a result of severe constraints on the airline industry, most of its aircraft have remained grounded. The airline claimed that while it had managed to strike rent reduction and payment plans with other lessors, talks with CALC had been unproductive.It urged the court for time until January 29 for the payments in order to avoid disruptions to its UK and Europe operations, especially over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, which would go on to further “hinder” its ability to pay.The judge struck a compromise and has given Air India until January 11 to clear the sums outstanding.The Indian state-owned carrier has been seeking a buyer for some time now as the government wants to divest its 100 per cent stake in Air India and budget carrier AI Express.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-india-gets-reprieve-in-uk-court-over-aircraft-lease-payments/story-9B3OFvaN2RxRtTDffIxdfJ.html
12-12-2020||World||With Conservative Party at his back, Boris Johnson can’t cave in on Brexit||As UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces calls to compromise in order to secure a trade deal with the European Union (EU), one thing above all is limiting his room to move: the Conservative Party.At stake in the final days of the UK’s four-year divorce negotiations are the future of the country’s economy and Johnson’s own authority over the party he leads.For many pro-Brexit Tories who have waited years for Britain to break free of EU shackles, Johnson’s statement Friday that a split without a new trade deal is now “very likely” must seem like a dream. But that is a problem for the premier, who says he still wants to get an accord and has told his negotiating team this weekend to do whatever they can to come up with a last ditch agreement.Johnson would be “sowing the seeds of his own destruction” if he accepted the EU’s position, was the ominous warning of one MP, speaking privately.If Johnson does manage to pull off a deal at the eleventh hour, his struggle will switch from Brussels to London. Any agreement will need fast-tracking through Parliament so it can come into force by December 31 when the transition period expires and the UK finally leaves the EU single market.The Conservatives are split over Europe and while some will welcome any deal, the trickiest faction for Johnson will be the old guard of euroskeptic Tories. These MPs have built careers on taking hard-line views and no longer need to be loyal to the leader because their ministerial ambitions have been fulfilled, or faded away.Fringe MovementThe Brexiteers were once a fringe movement in the party but now are the mainstream. The new intake of more than 100 Conservatives in parliament, who stood on a clear pro-Brexit manifesto at the election exactly a year ago, will also need to be persuaded that an EU trade agreement is better than leaving the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.“The prime minister has given me -- and colleagues -- his assurances he will deliver,” said Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, a constituency which voted to leave the EU in 2016. “Unless we get a fair trade deal -- and we all want a deal, so long as it’s a fair one -- then we will have no alternative but to trade on WTO or Australia terms.”Whatever happens this weekend, the final stage of the Brexit process puts Johnson’s politial credibility on the line. Brexit and Johnson are inextricably linked -- he was the face of the successful 2016 referendum campaign and won the Tories a historic election majority last year promising to “get Brexit done.”But his party has been critical of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic for months, and if his own side starts accusing him of betrayal over Brexit, too, his days in office may soon be numbered.The dilemma of whether to compromise for a deal is particularly sensitive for Johnson because the main hurdles to an agreement with the EU cut to the heart of the arguments in favour of Brexit -- restoring British sovereignty.‘Taking Back Control’The biggest disagreements are over a so-called level playing field of fair competition rules for businesses in Britain and Europe, how any deal would be governed, and access to fishing waters. Resolving these may require fixes that contradict the sovereignty principle of “taking back control” over British laws.For example, on the level playing field, the EU is pushing for ratchet clauses, which would require Britain to keep up with changes in EU laws in areas including environment and social protection. Otherwise, Britain would lose tariff-free access to the EU market.One Tory MP, newly elected in 2019, said they wouldn’t vote for any agreement that conceded this principle, and that they would rather have no trade agreement with the EU at all, and the tariffs that would follow, if it meant Britain had the full freedom to compete with the bloc.In a sign of the strength of feeling among Conservative lawmakers, scores of rank-and-file Tories urged Johnson to stand firm and not concede to the EU’s demands in public debates in Parliament this week.Danny Kruger, a newly elected MP in 2019, said the long-term consequences of a bad deal that keeps Britain in the EU’s regulatory orbit would be “far worse than any temporary short-term consequences that might flow from no deal”. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, said he wouldn’t support a deal that “leaves us shackled to EU rules and regulations in perpetuity.”Fisheries is another emotive issue where Conservative MPs are on alert for a sell-out. At least 20 to 30 Tory backbenchers would vote against any deal that is perceived to have conceded to the EU on fishing, predicted one Conservative lawmaker, who asked not to be identified.And while Johnson has a clear majority in Parliament, it only takes a rebellion by one-tenth of his MPs to endanger a win in the House of Commons. Earlier this month, 55 Conservatives voted against the government over its latest coronavirus restrictions, and the measures only passed due to a majority of the opposition Labour Party abstaining.On Brexit, the Labour Party is likely to either support Johnson or abstain. However, it would be gravely damaging for the prime minister if he relied on opposition votes to succeed, one senior MP said. Johnson would lose trust and authority and the wound would never heal, the MP said.Johnson is aware of the parliamentary dynamic and understands the need for any accord with the EU to command the support of his MPs, according to a person close to the trade talks, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.The UK and EU negotiators have been given until Sunday to make a breakthrough, at which point Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will take a view on whether the process should continue.On Friday, the prime minister said businesses should get ready for the talks to fail and for Britain to trade with the EU on WTO terms. This would be “wonderful for the UK,” Johnson told reporters. “We’d be able to do exactly what we want.”Euroskeptic Tories may get their dream Brexit at last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-conservative-party-at-his-back-boris-johnson-can-t-cave-in-on-brexit/story-4PYWNCeb6rMO0StiNyISdI.html
12-12-2020||World||Ocasio-Cortez slams McConnell for bottlenecking Covid relief fund on Instagram live||US Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed Republican and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for warming up to the wealthy while explaining what was holding up the Covid -19 relief during a live session on Instagram. Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, has been pushing for a direct payment of $1,200 to be included in the Covid-19 relief bill and pointed that some Republicans, including senator Josh Hawley, were in support of it, but McConnell was proving to be the bottleneck.According to Ocasio-Cortez, McConnell would only allow the $1,200 checks only if he gets to pass corporate liability protection in exchange. Corporate liability protection, or corporate immunity, if passed, would mean that big corporations, for five years, would be immune from Covid-19 related lawsuits from their employees for putting them in dangerous environments in a time when coronavirus infections are surging across the US.Dangerous environments include cramming a large number of people in close proximity without providing them with the necessary safety equipment as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. As per Ocasio-Cortez, Democrats were against this proposal since a one-time $1,200 cheque and a ‘super short’ expansion of unemployment insurance were not worth people’s lives or hospital bills worth millions of dollars.“The deal is that you’re gonna end up behind, because you may get a $1,200 check on one hand, but you may also get a multimillion-dollar hospital bill with no recourse and no ability to protect yourself from a negligent corporation or employer. So that’s not worth it. Your check is not worth your life,” she said.She branded the situation ‘sad’ for being a partisan issue and slammed McConnell for wanting ‘yet another corporate bailout’ to improve people’s well-being and ability to survive. “The current $900 (billion) package that’s being negotiated has tiny unemployment expansion, to the tune of about $300 and no stimulus check. Is that enough?” Ocasio Cortez asked her viewers on Instagram.She went on to slam McConnell for warming up to the needs of the wealthy when she brought up the $4 trillion leveraged fund that was passed in March for Wall Street. “We don’t see this kind of austerity when it comes to things that the absolute wealthiest people in our society demand. She also said that this ‘austerity mindset’ is not visible while spending for the military. “We are voting, and have voted this year, in committees and on the floor in advancing a $740 billion defence bill.”The US has 15,851,014 cases of the coronavirus disease and 295,522 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ocasio-cortez-slams-mcconnell-for-bottlenecking-covid-relief-fund-on-instagram-live/story-2KoXXZtaY0BKV1htfphn9I.html

A French minister said on Thursday that France would compensate its fishermen and take other measures to help them if talks on a trade deal collapse, in an effort to avoid clashes at sea.Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday it was now unlikely a trade deal would be agreed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-navy-to-protect-britain-s-fishing-waters-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit/story-6AwuHZRK4DiKhmS2MXgvWN.html
12-12-2020||World||Britain to end state support for fossil fuel sector exports||Britain said Friday that it is ending state support for fossil fuel industry exports, and shifting government assistance to low-carbon and renewable energy projects abroad.The announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson comes a day before he co-hosts a virtual summit with more than 70 world leaders to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate accord.Britain already declared earlier this month that it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030.“By taking ambitious and decisive action today, we will create the jobs of the future, drive the recovery from coronavirus and protect our beautiful planet for generations to come,” Johnson said in a statement.The UK government said it will “end export finance, aid funding and trade promotion for new crude oil, natural gas or thermal coal projects, with very limited exceptions.” The policy means an end to government support in the form of overseas development aid, export finance or trade promotion for the extraction, production, transportation and refining of crude oil or thermal coal outside Britain. The same will apply to natural gas, except for some gas-fired power plants and other projects that would be in line with the phase-out of fossil fuels by mid-century laid out in the Paris accord.Fossil fuels have enjoyed a large share of UK export credits for decades — supporting 21 billion pounds ($27.8 billion) of oil and gas exports in the last four years alone.“The UK government has finally seen sense, that we need to match our action on climate change at home with an equivalent effort overseas,” said Alison Doig of the London-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “Investing (...) in an international green energy transition will create new markets overseas and secure future trade and jobs for the UK; a win-win.” Mohamed Adow, head of the Nairobi-based group Power Shift Africa, also welcomed the move.“We need to make sure there’s no devil in the detail when the full policy is released, but on the surface it looks to be a hugely encouraging move and sets the tone for this weekend’s Climate Ambition Summit,” he said. “Now other countries need to follow suit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-end-state-support-for-fossil-fuel-sector-exports/story-7imnsCsOhMhsYsJ6YS68LI.html

That’s despite restrictions at the second-highest level of 2.5 out of a scale of 3 in the greater Seoul area since Tuesday.If the spread continues, the government will have no choice but raise measures to Level 3, Chung said in a meeting on Saturday, urging that efforts be made to curb the spread to reduce the impact that tighter limits would have on the economy and society. On his Facebook account, President Moon Jae-in referred to the Covid-19 situation as an “emergency” and ordered the mobilization of all resources to contain the virus.South Korea had been praised and emulated for its earlier success in slowing the virus’s spread without a lockdown, relying instead on rapid testing and contact-tracing to reduce flareups.Under South Korea’s Level 3 restrictions, gatherings of 10 people or more are prohibited, including all sporting events, while schools can only offer online classes. The public is advised to stay at home as much as possible, and companies are required to have non-essential employees work from home. There are no travel restrictions, although foreign visitors are required to be quarantined for 14 days unless they are exempt under cross-border agreements.The country in November modified its social-distancing system with a five-tier system that intensifies restrictions according to the severity of the outbreak. Level 3 is adopted when an “extreme” spike in locally-transmitted infections sparks a large-scale, nationwide outbreak, or when daily cases reach 800 or more, according to Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-says-tightest-covid-restrictions-may-be-inevitable/story-W4lepMVv114ZPvdkIx2GhO.html

During his murderous spree, he sent a series of terrifying letters to the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper.Some of the notes were in code, including a particularly complex missive with 340 characters that became known as the 340 cipher. “I hope you are having lots of fun trying to catch me,” said the cipher, cracked last week by codebreakers David Oranchak, Sam Blake and Jarl Van Eycke, according to a video posted on YouTube by Oranchak. “I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice (sic) all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me.” Like the murders themselves, solving the Zodiac ciphers has become an international fixation for true-crime followers.Oranchak, whom the San Francisco Chronicle identified as a 46-year-old Web designer who lives in Virginia, said in the video he had hoped the cipher would yield information about the killer’s identity.“The message doesn’t really say a whole lot,” he said. “It’s more of the same attention-seeking junk from Zodiac.”The San Francisco office of the FBI on Friday confirmed that the group had cracked the coded message, and said the investigation into the half-century-old case was ongoing.“The FBI is aware that a cipher attributed to the Zodiac Killer was recently solved by private citizens,” the FBI said in a statement posted on Twitter. “The Zodiac Killer terrorized multiple communities across Northern California, and even though decades have gone by, we continue to seek justice for the victims of these brutal crimes.” No one was ever charged in the Zodiac case, and theories abound as to the killer’s real identity. The case has inspired numerous books and movies, including 1971’s “Dirty Harry” starring Clint Eastwood and 2007’s “Zodiac” with Robert Downey Jr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-more-than-50-yrs-coded-message-sent-by-zodiac-serial-killer-solved-by-amateur-sleuths/story-P6tTUZAyRfb2YmRWozQFTJ.html
12-12-2020||World||Indonesian cleric turns himself in for Covid-19 violation||A firebrand Indonesian cleric turned himself in to authorities Saturday after he was accused of inciting people to breach pandemic restrictions by holding events with large crowds.Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Islamic Defenders Front, arrived at Jakarta police headquarters a day after police warned they would arrest him after he ignored several summonses.Wearing a white robe, turban and face mask, Shihab told reporters that he never ran away or hid from police.“With God’s permission, I can come to the Jakarta police for an investigation according to the laws and regulations,” he said ahead of questioning.Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told a news conference Friday that Shihab is accused of ignoring measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 by holding an event to commemorate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday and the wedding of his daughter last month that pulled in thousands of his supporters.He said Shihab could face up to six years in prison if found guilty of inciting people to violate health regulations amid an outbreak and of obstructing law enforcement.Shihab’s presence in several events in Jakarta and West Java attracted large crowds with attendants visibly ignoring physical distancing and many failing to wear masks.Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan and West Java Gov. Ridwan Kamil have been questioned as witnesses in the case.The gatherings took place less than a week after his arrival from a three-year exile in Saudi Arabia.Shihab left Indonesia in 2017 for a pilgrimage to Mecca shortly after police charged him in a pornography case and with insulting the official state ideology. Police dropped both charges a year later due to weak evidence, but authorities in Saudi Arabia had banned him from leaving the country without an explanation.The Islamic Defenders Front, known by its Indonesian acronym FPI, has a long record of vandalizing nightspots, hurling stones at Western embassies and attacking rival religious groups. It wants the Islamic Shariah law to apply to Indonesia’s 230 million Muslims.The group has gained significant influence in recent years through humanitarian and charity work. It was a key organizer of massive street protests in 2016 and 2017 against the Christian governor of Jakarta, who was subsequently imprisoned for blasphemy.Indonesia has reported more than 600,000 cases of the coronavirus, the largest tally in Southeast Asia and second in Asia only to India’s 9.8 million cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-cleric-turns-himself-in-for-covid-19-violation/story-favm4fFRjn04ZhuXVHRBHM.html

The notification regarding the ban claimed that speculative transactions also emerge out of the situation which jeopardizes the interest of the people and deprive them of their hard-earned money, thus creating panic and anxiety in the society.Likewise, the ban also extended over the use of cassette players sound, system, CD/DVD and other mediums for making objectionable/sectarian-related speeches, Dawn reported.This comes as Pakistan opposition’s 11-party alliance - Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) is set to hold its sixth power show in Lahore on Sunday, despite efforts by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s to block the rally proceedings.The Pakistan government also flooded the Minar-e-Pakistan lawns in a “failed effort” to stop PDM from holding their rally on December 13.The PDM has held five similar rallies in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta and Multan since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-opposition-rallies-in-pakistan-islamabad-extends-two-month-ban-on-gatherings-demonstrations/story-HC7P07MVnKncmdVEFL2ntK.html

Iraq topped the list of most dangerous countries for practising journalism, as 340 journalists lost their lives there, followed by Mexico (178 journalists), the Philippines (178 journalists), Pakistan (138 journalists)’In 2020, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) recorded the killing of 42 journalists and media staff so far in targeted attacks, bomb blasts and cross-firing incidents in 15 countries.“Mexico tops the list for a fourth time in five years with 13 killings, followed by Pakistan (five) the Philippines, Somalia and Syria (two each) while one journalist was killed in each of the six countries Cameroon, Honduras, Paraguay, Russia, Sweden and Yemen,” Dawn reported quoting the report.The report further stated that in the Indian sub-continent, murders of journalists in Pakistan have featured almost every year since 1990 adding that 40 per cent of the total deaths of journalists in the Asia Pacific region.Earlier this year, a report by Freedom Network said that Pakistan continues to be ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, as more than 140 journalists have been killed in the country since 2000.This year’s report on impunity against journalists facing trial by law in Pakistan will cause much distress to all those who consider the existence of a strong and independent media essential to good governance and social progress, writes IA Rehman, journalist and human rights advocate, for Dawn.Even as Prime Minister Imran Khan claims of no crackdown on Pakistan’s journalists, Mubashir Zaidi, a journalist, has revealed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has registered cases against 49 journalists, as of September this year.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also condemned the action of the PTI government demanding that the state should refrain from such actions and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent.“HRCP is alarmed by the news in circulation that the FIA is registering cases against 49 journalists and social media activists under PECA regulations. We demand that the state refrain from such action and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent,” it tweeted in September.Khan claimed that there is no crackdown on the media in Pakistan and yet the arrests clearly contradict the government claims.Pakistan is ranked 145th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’s (RSF) 2020 World Press Freedom Index, three places lower than in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ifj-lists-5-countries-including-pakistan-most-dangerous-countries-for-practice-of-journalism-in-the-world/story-z2QgXzxlXF0yBA2ER2ly0O.html
12-12-2020||World||How Germany lost its way on coronavirus||Chancellor Angela Merkel’s voice briefly cracked as she appealed to Germans this week to rein in Christmas celebrations to protect grandma and grandpa from the coronavirus.The trained physicist’s unusually emotional outburst during a debate in parliament was brought on by her failure to slow the spread of the disease. After comfortably handling the initial wave of the pandemic, the country is now lagging behind many of its neighbours and faces increasing pressure to tighten restrictions days before Christmas.Germany’s stumbles are a function of its complex and at times dysfunctional federal system, Merkel’s pursuit of open borders and political power plays ahead of next year’s elections. It puts Europe’s largest economy at risk of another blow to consumer and business confidence.Fresh off brokering a historic recovery package for the European Union(EU) in Brussels, Merkel is under pressure to reinvigorate Germany’s fight against the pandemic. She is expected to meet with the heads of the country’s 16 states over the weekend to impose stiffer measures, including closing non-essential shops and extending school holidays.Germany’s soft shutdown -- which closed bars, gyms, and theaters but allowed most of the economy to continue operating -- halted exponential growth in infections, “but as we can see, that’s not enough,” Martina Fietz, a government spokeswoman, said Friday. “The number of people voicing concerns about the tense situation in our hospitals is increasing, and they shouldn’t be ignored.”Merkel, who is in the final year of her 16-year tenure as chancellor, is partly to blame for the current situation. She effectively declared mission accomplished in the spring when she vowed to avoid reimposing a national lockdown -- which was already less harsh than in countries such as Italy and Spain.That created the feeling that the country could get away with looser restrictions that would do less damage to the economy. It also prompted a false sense of security during the summer months, in which Germany allowed people to travel freely throughout Europe while failing to properly prepare for the second wave by ramping up testing capacities faster, protecting the elderly and beefing up online-learning capabilities.The country’s situation at the heart of Europe -- bordering on the fall hot spots of Belgium and the Czech Republic -- may also have contributed to a stubborn outbreak, which has gotten worse since the partial shutdown was implemented in early November. On Friday, the country’s contagion rate climbed to more than triple the target rate set by Merkel’s government.When it became clear in mid-November that the infection rate was not coming down, Germany’s federalist system -- in which states control health policy and schools -- became a major stumbling bloc for a clear response. Merkel at the time pushed for much stricter curbs. But many regional state leaders resisted, afraid of alienating voters with further restrictions and angry about the way Merkel tried to force them into a decision.Others simply jockeyed for a role in the post-Merkel order.Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder, the current front-runner to become the next chancellor, backed Merkel’s tougher approach, as he used the pandemic to elevate his national profile. He cancelled Munich’s Oktoberfest already in the spring and imposed a curfew for hard-hit areas this week. On Friday, he called for a strict lockdown before Christmas.By contrast, Armin Laschet -- the head of North Rhine-Westphalia and a key rival to become the chancellor candidate for Merkel’s conservative bloc in September’s election -- argued for a quicker return to normalcy. But with deaths now at record levels and intensive-care capacity filling up, the signals are impossible to ignore.“We need a lockdown for all of Germany as quickly as possible,” Laschet said in a news conference on Friday. “We all wanted something else. We wanted to celebrate a carefree Christmas.”Instead of brightening the mood before the holidays by loosening curbs like in France and the UK, Germans face the psychological blow of tighter restrictions as 2020 draws to a close.Still, the gloom is relative. Germany’s outbreak never neared the highs in countries like France, the UK, and Spain, and contagion rates remain less severe than in more than half of Europe.Polls show that Germans are suffering from pandemic fatigue and that their sense of risk has changed, according to Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, noting that Germans have reduced their contacts by only about 40%, compared with a more than 60% reduction during the first-wave lockdown. And muddling through is not what the country is accustomed to.“The development is not what I would have wished for and not what probably everyone in this country would have hoped for,” Wieler said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-germany-lost-its-way-on-coronavirus/story-GmWvCPNxydcALZS1fNALdI.html
12-12-2020||World||Longest Arctic sailing season tops off a year of climate disasters||Thinning ice in the Arctic Ocean made this year’s navigation season for natural gas tankers the longest on record, the latest sign that the pace of climate change is accelerating in the Earth’s northernmost latitudes.The Northern Sea Route, stretching more than 3,000 nautical miles between the Barents Sea west of Russia and the Bering Strait in the country’s east, traditionally opens from June through October, when higher temperatures break up ice. This year, voyages started a month early and will continue until at least the end of December. Record warmth meant slower freezing during the autumn.“This year could potentially become a turning point for the Arctic,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “This was a fairly exceptional year in that the warmer-than-average condition was incredibly persistent throughout the whole year.”The length of the shipping season in the Arctic is one of the most tangible signs that the region is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. In a year that’s likely to rank among the three warmest on record—if not the hottest ever—it’s the Arctic that registered the most notable increases in what is emerging as an enormous climate-related disaster.Temperatures of more than 5 degrees Celsius above average for the first 10 months of 2020 fueled the most active wildfire season on record. High atmospheric temperatures led to an increase in water temperatures. Sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the month in July and October, and the second-lowest for most of the year. Thawing permafrost is threatening strategic oil, gas and civilian infrastructure in northern Russia, Canada and Alaska.What’s bad for the planet is an opportunity for the $100 billion-a-year liquefied natural gas industry, the quickest growing part of the fossil fuel business. To ship the fuel across an ocean or beyond where pipelines reach, the gas is chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) until it turns to a fluid.The trade in LNG cargoes has surged in recent years, boosting the stream of tankers moving the commodity from fields in Africa, the Middle East and Australia to lucrative markets mainly in Asia. Melting ice in the Arctic reduces shipping costs for cargoes that would otherwise have to transit the Suez Canal or the southern tip of Africa.To the west, the Barents and Kara Seas remained largely free of ice as late as November, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate satellite program. To the east, ice cover in the Chukchi Sea between Russia and Alaska has dropped by more than 45% since the late-1970s, according to Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.The longer the Northern Sea Route stays open, the more LNG cargoes can head directly to Asia, where it is consumed by industry and power generators in China, Japan and South Korea. Russia and the LNG industry are working to extend that shipping season, deploying the world’s biggest icebreaker starting in October to escort tankers for more months of the year.“Undoubtedly, such early and late navigation brings us closer to the implementation of one of the key goals of the Northern Sea Route development strategy—year-round navigation,” said the press office of Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear corporation in charge of managing the route.The nuclear-powered Arktika is capable of breaking through ice up to 2.9 meters thick (just under 10 feet), almost a third more than the current generation of ships in the Russian fleet. That will help Novatek PJSC move LNG cargoes to market from its giant fields on the Yamal peninsula in northern Russia.The Arktika will accompany ice-class LNG carriers to help make a path through this route and may enable a few journeys to Northeast Asia over December and through as late as April, consultants Energy Aspects Ltd. said in a note in November.This year’s extraordinary climate conditions have already allowed for a record number of voyages to Asia through the Northern Sea Route. About 30 will be made this season, five more than initially forecast, Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer at Novatek said in November. That compares with 17 in 2019 and four in 2018. One last ship may finish the voyage through the Arctic route to Asia this month.For years, the gas industry and LNG exporters have promoted their fuel as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal. Novatek says its LNG plant is among the most efficient in the world, with some of the lowest carbon and methane emissions. It also uses tankers that burn LNG instead of ship oil, dramatically reducing pollution from its vessels. But while gas delivers lower carbon emissions than any other fossil fuel, policy makers worldwide are increasing their scrutiny of the business as they work toward slashing emissions that damage the atmosphere.The LNG industry’s success in the Arctic is a concern for scientists and environmental groups, who see a “feedback loop” with more ships speeding up the pace of warming in the region. The ice’s white surface reflects sunlight and helps cool the atmosphere. When it melts, it is replaced by ocean water, which is dark and absorbs solar radiation. More shipping traffic in the Arctic also brings higher emissions of polluting gases, which can boost temperatures and soften ice packs locally, Burgess said. The presence of the tankers also increases the risk of accidents and spills in an area where biodiversity is fragile, she said.“There’s a strong interest to take advantage of the more efficient shipping route,” Burgess said. “Equally, it’s important that there’s policy put in place to make sure that’s done legally and safely, with adequate measures put in place to protect these vulnerable ecosystems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longest-arctic-sailing-season-tops-off-a-year-of-climate-disasters/story-rUjRr1PfvTq6x996GuqodL.html
12-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s legal campaign ‘not finished’ after Supreme Court defeat, says Rudy Giuliani||Rudy Giuliani, US President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, on Friday indicated that the President’s legal team will continue to challenge the outcome of the presidential elections, even as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit led by Texas to overturn the vote count in four battleground states, reported The Hill.“There’s nothing that prevents us from filing these cases immediately in the district court in which the president of course would have standing, some of the electors would have standing in that their constitutional rights have been violated,” he said in an interview. “We’re not finished... Believe me,” he concluded.This comes after the US Supreme Court rejected a bid by Texas’ attorney general to block the ballot of voters in battleground states that favoured President-elect Joe Biden.According to The Hill, the dismissal of the Texas-led lawsuit was the most significant legal setback suffered by the Republican legal campaign.The lawsuit was filed by Texas Attorney, a staunch supporter of Trump, seeking to invalidate the election results of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin. Following this, 18 states had joined the state to halt presidential electors in the four states.An amicus brief was filed by the attorneys general of seventeen states where President Donald Trump was projected as the winner - Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.This comes as the US President continues to repeatedly question the legitimacy of Biden’s win, accusing fraud and impropriety in the elections, and seeking recounts in several states, despite election officials in battleground states having already certified the President-elect’s victory in the presidential polls.Following a series of legal defeats, the US President has refocused his efforts on pressing state lawmakers to replace Biden electors with those who support him and urging members of Congress to decline to certify the election results in January, The Hill reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-legal-campaign-not-finished-after-supreme-court-defeat-says-rudy-giuliani/story-ERpDEBdSpM8a2morEvjt9I.html

Reuters reported earlier that the deal was in the works.On Thursday, Trump said Morocco and Israel agreed to establish full diplomatic relations and that he was recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over the long disputed region of Western Sahara. That decision defied a global consensus and United Nations resolutions in which the international community declined to take sides in a conflict that has lingered in the years since a 1991 cease-fire.Sporadic fighting between Morocco and the rebel group known as the Polisario Front claimed about 9,000 lives over 16 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-1-billion-arms-sale-to-morocco-after-israel-deal/story-WmoCSpteuR1rAS8yKzqM4I.html
12-12-2020||World||Pro-Trump supporters to rally again in Washington||Supporters of President Donald Trump are returning to Washington on Saturday for a pair of rallies to back his desperate efforts to subvert the election that he lost.The rallies come a month after a pro-Trump demonstration that drew at least 10,000 people to the capital. The day began with Trump thrilling his supporters by driving by in his limousine and ended with scattered clashes between Trump supporters and local activists near Black Lives Matter Plaza.Saturday’s rallies are meant as a show of force just two days before the Electoral College meets to formally elect Joe Biden as the next president. Trump refuses to concede the election, citing baseless claims of fraud.The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a lawsuit to overturn Biden’s election victory, ending an attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation’s highest court.One of the rallies will be at Freedom Plaza downtown and the other nearby on the National Mall. The event on the mall, dubbed the Jericho March, is described on its website as a several-hour “prayer rally” with a series of sermons and speakers “praying for the walls of corruption and election fraud to fall down.” Organisers of the Freedom Plaza rally seem intent on avoiding confrontations, telling demonstrators to avoid certain hotels and marking off large chunks of downtown Washington as a “no-go zone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-trump-supporters-to-rally-again-in-washington/story-ZRYQK3au14hxVJC6yXVhKK.html
12-12-2020||World||Leading pro-China news channel in Taiwan is taken off air||Employees and supporters rallied for a Taiwanese pro-China cable news channel as it was taken off air Saturday, after the government refused to renew its license, citing accuracy issues.CTiTV’s channel 52 broadcast a countdown and then went black after midnight. The cable network, whose non-news channels were not affected, plans to continue putting news on YouTube and other digital platforms.A large crowd chanted “Hang on, CTiTV” and held up signs reading “Thank you CTiTV, we will see you again.” Employees, some tearing up, sang songs and swayed in unison wearing matching blue windbreakers.Liao Chia-yu, a language teacher, said she would keep watching CTiTV on YouTube. “I also hope they don’t forget their ideals,” Liao said. “They should put out whatever they want, and report on the truth.” The National Communications Commission cited repeated violations of rules on accurate reporting in rejecting the renewal last month. The station has been fined 25 times in the past six years for spreading inaccurate information.The station is owned by the Want Want China Times media group, which also publishes one of Taiwan’s main newspapers. It has long been associated with a Beijing-friendly political view, attributed partly to its extensive business interests in China.China regards democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province that is part of its territory and has been upping its threats to bring the island under control by force as economic and political enticements bear little fruit.In its ruling, NCC Chairperson Chen Yaw-shyang made no specific allegations of a pro-China bias, but said the channel appeared susceptible to outside influence.“The biggest problem is external interference into the TV station’s news production and broadcasts,” Chen said in announcing the denial of the renewal.CTiTV appealed the denial unsuccessfully and accused the Taiwanese government of endangering media freedom.Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog group, said in a statement that the decision did not go against press freedom, but expressed regret over its impact on the station’s staff.CTiTV owner Tsai Eng-meng, addressing the crowd, said, “To each who support us, CTiTV, maybe after we soon switch to become a new media, there will be things that we need to improve. But I feel that we will slowly become better and better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-pro-china-news-channel-in-taiwan-is-taken-off-air/story-NBFJQINgBAUJgeFWYconiP.html
12-12-2020||World||US top court rejects outright GOP suit to overturn poll outcome in 4 states||The US Supreme Court on Friday delivered a devastating blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting a lawsuit filed by his Republican allies seeking to overturn election outcomes in the four battleground states that swung the White House race in favour of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and joined by Republican counterparts from 18 other states, 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives and the president himself in his capacity as a candidate for re-election. The case was not even allowed to be filed, let alone be admitted and argued. It was rejected outright.“The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing,” the apex court said in a curt one-page order.“Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.”The unsigned order noted that two of the nine justices — Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, both conservatives — had differed. They said “we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction … (we) would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.” They had differed only on a procedural point, that they would have allowed the lawsuit to be filed as it fell within the “original jurisdiction” of the court to hear disputes between states outside the appellate process.The remaining six justices, including the three conservatives appointed by Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — concurred with the dismissal, as did Chief Justice John Roberts, also a conservative, and the three liberals Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.The Texas lawsuit had asked the Supreme Court to overturn election results in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — the key states that gave Biden the presidency — arguing that election rules that were changed there in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, essentially to make voting more convenient, were unconstitutional.In a blistering response, these states had argued among other thing that Texas had no standing — ground to sue — to challenge elections in other states because one it was not harmed or injured and, two, elections are conducted independently by states (unlike in India where elections are held by the Central Election Commission, a federal body).This was the second time this week that the apex court had spurned an attempt to overturn the election mounted by Republican allies of the president at his behest.Trump had pinned his hopes on this case to win back the presidency that he lost decisively to Biden, by 232-306 electoral college votes and more than 7 million popular votes. And he tweeted it up in anticipation. “If the Supreme Court shows great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our Electoral Process will be respected again,” he posted shortly before the order.Trump’s baseless claims and lawsuits alleging election fraud, echoed by his Republican allies, have been rejected by multiple courts — more than 50, by one count — but he has pressed on unperturbed. He has also tried to persuade Republican-led state legislatures to reject the poll outcome.All 50 states and the District of Colombia certified the election results on Tuesday, as required. And electors of the Electoral College will vote on Monday to declare Biden the victor. Trump’s Republican supporters in the House of Representatives will try and use the next stage in the process — the lower chamber’s endorsement of the electors’ vote — to change the outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-court-rejects-outright-gop-suit-to-overturn-poll-outcome-in-4-states/story-64ytr0tdHNRBIOfpOdIAYP.html

Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately,’ Pompeo tweeted. Hong Kong’s National Security Law makes a mockery of justice. @JimmyLaiApple’s only "crime" is speaking the truth about the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarianism and fear of freedom. Charges should be dropped and he should be released immediately.Jimmy Lai is set to appear in West Kowloon Court on Saturday after being charged with colluding with foreign powers under the Beijing-imposed national security law, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, reported South China Morning Post.Earlier, Lai, the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper was reported to have been charged with fraud and then denied bail. In August 2020, the tycoon was arrested under the new National Security Law.The charge stems from comments Lai purportedly made on Twitter and in interviews asking foreign countries to sanction the city.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian National Security Law was imposed on the city by Beijing.The law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-slams-china-for-charging-jimmy-lai-under-national-security-law/story-hflSj4ymTNnrZWLRN4UCeN.html
12-12-2020||World||President Trump says US Supreme Court ‘let us down’ by rejecting lawsuit||President Donald Trump tweeted late Friday night that the Supreme Court “really let us down” by rejecting a lawsuit to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory. He added that the justices showed “No Wisdom, No Courage!” The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!The Supreme Court’s order on Friday ended a desperate attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation’s highest court and subvert the will of voters. It was a stark repudiation of a legal claim that was widely regarded as dubious, yet embraced by the president, 19 Republican state attorneys general and 126 House Republicans.Friday’s order marked the second time this week that the court had rebuffed Republican requests that it get involved in the 2020 election outcome and reject the voters’ choice, as expressed in an election regarded by both Republican and Democratic officials as free and fair. The justices turned away an appeal from Pennsylvania Republicans on Tuesday.Trump had insisted the court would find the “wisdom” and “courage” to adopt his baseless position that the election was the product of widespread fraud and should be overturned. Trump had called the lawsuit filed by Texas against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin “the big one” that would end with the Supreme Court undoing Biden’s substantial Electoral College majority and allowing Trump to serve another four years in the White House.In a brief order, the court said Texas does not have the legal right to sue those states because it “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.”Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who have said previously the court does not have the authority to turn away lawsuits between states, said they would have heard Texas’ complaint. But they would not have done as Texas wanted — setting aside those four states’ 62 electoral votes for Biden — pending resolution of the lawsuit.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the justices “dodged. They hid behind procedure. None of those justices gave a view on the facts of the case.” Appearing Friday night on Fox News Channel’s ”Hannity,” McEnany said the legal fight would continue in state courts.On Monday, the Electoral College meets to formally elect Biden as the next president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-says-us-supreme-court-let-us-down-by-rejecting-lawsuit/story-XGR3yDaqc3UOcoiXgg2hFI.html
12-12-2020||World||After FDA nod, Trump says US vaccine roll-out in ‘less than 24 hours’||The US regulator of drug and food safety on Friday approved the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, the third country to do so after the UK and Canada.Soon after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the vaccine, President Donald Trump said the shots will begin to be administered “in less than 24 hours.”“The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours,” Trump said .Assuring that he had “made sure that this vaccine would be free to all Americans,” Trump said the administration has already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country.“Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle -- we have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives and soon end the pandemic once and for all,” he said in a video shared on Twitter.“When the China virus invaded our shores, I promised that we would produce a vaccine in record time before the end of the year. They said it couldn’t be done but with today’s announcement (by the FDA), we have achieved that goal,” he said.US President-elect Joe Biden urged Americans to have confidence in the vaccine developed by first-rate scientists without political influence.“These are first-rate scientists taking their time and looking at all of the elements that need to be looked at. Scientific integrity led us to this point. We know the payments challenges and hard work ahead,” Biden told reporters at Wilmington in Delaware on Friday.“As tough as things are now, I firmly believe better days are ahead. We got some good news yesterday. The FDA committee I should say recommended emergency use authorisation for Pfizer’s BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, but we are grateful for the scientists at these--not only there, but of their great organisations, researchers who developed this vaccine and several others on the way and we are just as grateful to the scientists and the public experts who evaluated its safety and efficiency free from political influence,” he said.Stephen M Hahn, FDA commissioner, said: “The FDA’s authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world.” “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorisation.”Before the FDA’s nod to the vaccine, Trump had posted an angry tweet, calling the agency a “big, old, slow turtle”.“Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.” The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing sources.As Biden noted, this week marked more than 3,000 deaths Covid in a single day in the US, the highest single death count during this pandemic.That’s more deaths in a single day than the US saw on 9/11 or at Pearl Harbour. According to the Johns Hopkins data, the US has recorded 15,834,965 Covid-19 cases and 294,874 deaths.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-fda-nod-trump-says-us-vaccine-roll-out-in-less-than-24-hours/story-012jlC7vHGiw6Jm1tiXJ6N.html
12-12-2020||World||Joe Biden urges people to have confidence in Covid-19 vaccine||US President-elect Joe Biden has urged Americans to have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine developed by first-rate scientists without political influence, after it was allowed for emergency use in the country, worst-hit by the pandemic.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday issued emergency use authorisation (EAU) to the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, paving the way for its use in the country.“I want to make it clear to the public you should have confidence in this. There is no political influence,” Biden said amid the reports of White House pressure on FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.“These are first-rate scientists taking their time and looking at all of the elements that need to be looked at. Scientific integrity led us to this point. We know the payments challenges and hard work ahead,” Biden, a Democrat, told reporters at Wilmington in Delaware on Friday.“You know, as tough as things are now, I firmly believe better days are ahead. We got some good news yesterday. The FDA committee I should say recommended emergency use authorisation for Pfizer’s BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, but we are grateful for the scientists at these--not only there, but of their great organisations, researchers who developed this vaccine and several others on the way and we are just as grateful to the scientists and the public experts who evaluated its safety and efficiency free from political influence,” he said.On Friday, President Donald Trump, a Republican, sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a “big, old, slow turtle”, adding: “Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.” Trump has not yet conceded defeat to Biden in the November 3 US presidential election.The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing sources.Biden said that earlier this week, he had announced that his Covid response team will scale up the manufacturing, distribution, and injection of the vaccine.“We set a bold and doable challenge in my first 100 days, 100 million shots in 100 days, asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of our administration. If we get the necessary funding from Congress, we can get most of our schools opened in 100 days, but we need the help from the Congress and the funding,” he said.“The first 100 days won’t end the Covid-19, but meeting those goals can slow the spread, save lives and get us back to our lives with the people we love the most; and we will also be getting the right people confirmed during this period of time and in place to manage this robust aggressive plan to contain the virus, help us build back better than ever and make sure everyone is included,” said the president-elect.This week marked another tragic milestone in our fight against Covid-19, more than 3,000 deaths in one single day, the highest single death count during this pandemic, Biden, who is set to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20, said.That’s more deaths in a single day than the US saw on 9/11 or at Pearl Harbour. “This is serious business, and the current director of these CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said yesterday we can expect similar numbers of deaths or more every single day for the next 60 to 90 days,” he added.“We are in the teeth of a crisis right now, and this nation needs presidential leadership right now, presidential leadership that is willing to model the steps we should be taking for our--to save our own lives and the lives of our families. You know we can wish this away, but we have to face it head-on. We have to take it head-on using every power available to me as president. We will have a national coordinated strategy that will--that will beat this virus,” Biden said.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said that they have brought together a healthcare team that will help contain this pandemic once and for all, an economic team that will help build an economy that works for working people and all those looking to work and a national security and foreign policy team that will help keep the nation safe and restore and advance American leadership around the world.According to the Johns Hopkins data, the US has recorded 15,834,965 Covid-19 cases and 294,874 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-people-to-have-confidence-in-covid-19-vaccine/story-QP1HU4miXTWLXXXQoJ6h6N.html
12-12-2020||World||Iran executes journalist who encouraged 2017 protests||Iran on Saturday executed a once-exiled journalist over his online work that helped inspire nationwide economic protests in 2017, authorities said, just months after he returned to Tehran under mysterious circumstances.Iranian state television and the state-run IRNA news agency said that Ruhollah Zam, 47, was hanged early Saturday morning. The reports did not elaborate.In June, a court sentenced Zam to death, saying he had been convicted of “corruption on Earth,” a charge often used in cases involving espionage or attempts to overthrow Iran’s government.Zam’s website AmadNews and a channel he created on the popular messaging app Telegram had spread the timings of the protests and embarrassing information about officials that directly challenged Iran’s Shiite theocracy.Those demonstrations, which began at the end of 2017, represented the biggest challenge to Iran since the 2009 Green Movement protests and set the stage for similar mass unrest in November of last year.The initial spark for the 2017 protests was a sudden jump in food prices. Many believe that hard-line opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani instigated the first demonstrations in the conservative city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran, trying to direct public anger at the president. But as protests spread from town to town, the backlash turned against the entire ruling class.Soon, cries directly challenging Rouhani and even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could be heard in online videos shared by Zam. Zam’s channel also shared times and organizational details for the protests.Telegram shut down the channel over Iranian government complaints it spread information about how to make gasoline bombs. The channel later continued under a different name. Zam, who has said he fled Iran after being falsely accused of working with foreign intelligence services, denied inciting violence on Telegram at the time.The 2017 protests reportedly saw some 5,000 people detained and 25 killed.The details of his arrest still remain unclear. Though he was based in Paris, Zam somehow returned to Iran and found himself detained by intelligence officials. He’s one of several opposition figures in exile who have been returned to Iran over the last year.France previously has criticized his death sentence as “a serious blow to freedom of expression and press freedom in Iran.”A series of a televised confessions aired earlier this year over his work.During an interview on July, Zam said he has lost some 30 kilograms (66 pounds) since his arrest in October 2019. He said following the arrest that he could meet his father after nine years and his mother and sister after some six years.Zam is the son of Shiite cleric Mohammad Ali Zam, a reformist who once served in a government policy position in the early 1980s. The cleric wrote a letter published by Iranian media in July 2017 in which he said he wouldn’t support his son over AmadNews’ reporting and messages on its Telegram channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-executes-journalist-who-encouraged-2017-protests/story-bSOFDX2OdUStiouz7iodWK.html

12-12-2020||World||Canada ready to start vaccination as doses make way from Belgium||Canada will begin its Covid-19 immunization campaign as early as Monday, with 30,000 initial doses of the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE vaccine making their way from Belgium.Provincial governments are awaiting shots that will be distributed to 14 sites, a sign of progress against a second wave of infections that has killed about 100 people a day in Canada over the past week.Quebec, which has suffered the majority of Canada’s more than 13,000 virus deaths, said it expects inoculations to start Monday. Ontario is targeting Tuesday and will give priority to health-care workers.“In a marathon, the last kilometers are the hardest,” Quebec Premier Francois Legault said during a press conference Friday. “We are seeing light at the end of the tunnel.”The country of 38 million people is closely following the UK, which this week became the first nation to roll out the Pfizer vaccine. The US appears close to authorizing emergency use of the shot.“This is the good news we all needed,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday. “But remember, this is only the first step in what will be a massive project over a long winter.”‘Fired Up’“There are going to be some bumps in the road. Please be patient with us. We are going to work through those bumps,” General Rick Hillier, head of Ontario’s vaccine distribution efforts, told reporters. On the ground, health-care workers who will administer the vaccines “are fired up, they can’t wait to start this program,” he said.Canada, which has secured more doses per person than any other country, has struggled to contain an autumn resurgence of the virus. With intensive care units filling up, provinces were forced to impose fresh lockdown measures that closed restaurants, retailers and churches in many parts of the country. Quebec’s Legault said he’ll decide early next week whether to announce still more restrictions.Canada’s health authorities warned on Friday that more efforts will be needed to slow the spread of infections as the holidays near.By Christmas day, deaths in Canada could rise to as many as 14,920, or 39 per 100,000 people, according to new projections released by Trudeau’s government. The ratio is 1.1 per 100,000 for South Korea, 25 for Germany, and 89 for the USSanofi SetbackCanada is due to receive 249,000 Pfizer doses by the end of the month. After an initial focus on the most vulnerable residents, the government hopes to get the population covered by the end of next year.That will depend on approval of other vaccines. Canada has secured 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. It is currently reviewing three other vaccine candidates, including one by Moderna Inc.But there have been setbacks. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, which also have a supply agreement with Canada, said Friday they’re delaying advanced trials of their Covid-19 shot after it failed to produce a strong enough response in older people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-ready-to-start-vaccination-as-doses-make-way-from-belgium/story-crJwNNfQnl7LmqXLlYiqMI.html
12-12-2020||World||Joe Biden considering New York governor Andrew Cuomo for attorney general||President-elect Joe Biden is considering New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to be his attorney general, a person familiar with the matter said Friday night.Cuomo, a former attorney general of New York State, joins a small list of other candidates who Biden is weighing, including Alabama Senator Doug Jones, US Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.If Cuomo were selected and confirmed, it would be his second stint in a presidential cabinet, after serving as Housing and Urban Development secretary during the Clinton administration.The Associated Press first reported that Biden is considering Cuomo.If nominated, Cuomo would face a difficult path to confirmation with opponents likely on both sides of the aisle.Cuomo has been governor of New York since 2011 and has signed into law same-sex marriage, a $15 minimum wage and restrictions on guns. But he has enemies on the left, who say he’s been insufficiently progressive.He drew national attention this year for his televised daily briefings on New York’s handling of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreak. Critics pin responsibility on Cuomo for mishandling the state’s response and for creating unnecessary obstacles in New York City because of his strained relationship with Mayor Bill de Blasio.By contrast, Jones, who lost his re-election race in November, would likely draw bipartisan support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-considering-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-for-attorney-general/story-s33iFYKKzJ1JtTItLtbF8J.html
12-12-2020||World||California files to join US antitrust lawsuit against Google||California asked to join the US Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Google on Friday, making the state’s attorney general the first Democrat to openly support the litigation.The department in October accused the $1 trillion California-based company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, and was joined by 11 other states when it was filed. “California is not making substantive changes to the complaint. In particular, California is not seeking to add any new facts or claims,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in the filing, adding that it would not delay the case.Google has denied wrongdoing, and the company has said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.“People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” a Google spokeswoman said. “We’ll continue to make our case in court.”The company must respond to California’s request to join the lawsuit by Dec. 18, said the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta.The Justice Department welcomed California’s entry to the case, which says Google broke antitrust law to build and maintain dominance in search and search advertising.“This landmark antitrust case reflects broad and bipartisan concerns that Google ... has maintained its monopoly power by cutting off its competition,” said spokesperson Brianna Herlihy. In November, Reuters reported a separate bipartisan group of states plan to file a related lawsuit. The group, made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah, plans to combine its case with the federal government’s case.California’s Becerra has been picked by President-elect Joe Biden as his nominee for secretary of health and human services - a prominent member of the health team to lead the response to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-files-to-join-us-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google/story-dfSq6VT8qTcurIUFBKK6JN.html
12-12-2020||World||With US now in hand, BioNTech looks for more vaccine production||The chief executive of Germany’s BioNTech SE said the biggest challenge facing it and partner Pfizer Inc now that their Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for use in the United States will be to scale up manufacturing to meet huge demand.“We need to solve the manufacturing challenge,” Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an interview. “It is very clear that more doses are needed. And we are dealing with that question - how to produce more doses.”The companies have said they will produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine next year.The US Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Friday, after Britain became the first country to begin deploying the shot outside of clinical trials earlier in the week.Sahin said he expects the companies will receive conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency by the end of the month and can begin rolling out vaccine in European countries early next year.One way he hopes to boost supply would be by bringing on earlier than projected the 750 million-dose-a-year plant BioNTech bought from Novartis AG in Marburg, Germany. BioNTech had said it would begin making the vaccine there in the first half of 2021, and Sahin said they are working to get it up and running on an expedited timeline.“The baseline plan is 1.3 billion doses,” Sahin said. “And we are working on an extended plan. I can’t tell you at the moment what is possible and how much we can expand the scale but we will try to do it significantly.”Supply of the vaccine will be limited at first in the United States, which has a population of roughly 330 million. The U.S. government has ordered 100 million doses of the two-dose vaccine and could negotiate for more. Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.In data released this week, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients even before they received the second shot. It seemed to begin to show some efficacy around 12 days after the first shot.Sahin said he was surprised by the data: “We know that the immune response is heavily boosted after the second dose.”He said the companies have not decided yet whether to evaluate a single-dose version of the vaccine. “This will be a discussion that we will certainly have with our partners Pfizer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-us-now-in-hand-biontech-looks-for-more-vaccine-production/story-x9IKNARNvuzXl8olIxNwBJ.html
12-12-2020||World||US has authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine. What happens next?||The US authorized the first Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE , making it available for emergency use to patients aged 16 and older. In clinical trials, the vaccine was 95% effective at preventing illness and showed no short-term safety issues. The federal government plans to release the nation’s first 2.9 million doses within days of the authorization to 64 states, US territories and major cities, as well as five federal agencies. Although the federal government is coordinating distribution efforts, states have the final decision over who gets the first shots. The federal government is sending the first shipments to more than 600 locations. Who will get the vaccine first?States are prioritizing healthcare workers and elderly long-term care residents for the first vaccinations. There are about 21 million healthcare workers in the United States and 3 million nursing home residents. Most states anticipate they will be able to vaccinate only between 13% and 18% of their healthcare workers with the first distribution, a Reuters analysis found. The federal government has said it will continue to send out millions of doses each week but has not released exact figures. Who will get the vaccine after that?States have broad discretion over who will get the vaccine next. So far, a panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has only issued the guidance that healthcare workers and nursing home residents should be first. The CDC has laid out a possible framework of three distribution phases, suggesting essential workers and people aged 65 and older as the next priority. Some states have indicated they plan to give essential workers priority after healthcare workers and nursing home residents receive the vaccine. Will there be enough vaccines for everyone?Pfizer has said it would make 50 million doses this year - enough to inoculate 25 million people - about half of which would go to the United States. Pfizer has an agreement with the US government to supply a total of 100 million doses, enough for 50 million people to be vaccinated. The United States has an option to buy an additional 500 million doses. An panel of expert advisers to the FDA will review a second Covid-19 vaccine from Moderna Inc next week. If that vaccine is authorized, federal officials have said they will be able to vaccinate 20 million Americans in December, 30 million in January, and 50 million in February. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc also have vaccines in late-stage trials. If those vaccines receive authorization early next year, officials said there would be enough doses to vaccinate about 75 million Americans a month by about March or April. Officials said by the middle of next year, the United States will have distributed enough vaccines for most Americans who want the vaccine to be inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-authorized-the-first-covid-19-vaccine-what-happens-next/story-BDHgwE4O2NvZQN1QHG0aGP.html
12-12-2020||World||Mexico approves Pfizer vaccine for emergency use as coronavirus surges||Mexico’s health agency Cofepris approved Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at a press conference Friday night.The health agency began reviewing data on the vaccine Nov. 26 and a 24-member committee voted unanimously to approve its use, according to a statement. Mexico joins the UK, Canada and the US as countries that have granted emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine. It’s the first country in Latin America to do so.Lopez-Gatell made the announcement moments before presenting numbers that show Covid-19 is still spreading rapidly in Mexico, especially in its capital. The Health Ministry reported 12,253 new cases, bringing the total to 1,229,379, and making it the fourth day straight the country has seen infections rise by more than 11,000.Deaths rose by 693 to 113,019. Mexico has the fourth highest number of Covid-19 fatalities after the US, Brazil and India, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Hospitalizations in the capital of Mexico City have been accelerating, Lopez-Gatell said. Occupancy of beds with ventilators, used to care for patients with the most serious cases, has reached 62%. While Mexico has avoided enacting strict lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus, Lopez-Gatell implored Mexico City residents to stay home except for essential activity and avoid parties and gatherings.“Stay home, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out,” Lopez-Gatell said. For those who do go out, they should wear a mask and maintain social distancing, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-approves-pfizer-vaccine-for-emergency-use-as-covid-surges/story-MV4zRTg0YLbxHC1J2rkleO.html
12-12-2020||World||Trump signs bill averting government shutdown; fight on coronavirus aid drags on||President Donald Trump, facing a midnight deadline on Friday, signed a one-week extension of expiring federal funding to avoid a government shutdown and to provide more time for separate talks on Covid-19 relief and an overarching spending bill.The Republican-led Senate passed the bill on Friday afternoon after the Democratic-majority House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the measure on Wednesday.Without this legislation, an array of government programs faced partial shutdown, ranging from some airport operations to national parks and State Department activities.With only a week before its next deadline on Dec. 18, Congress now will focus on passing a $1.4 trillion bill to keep federal operations running through September 2021.If it fails to reach an agreement by then, Congress would either have to pass another stopgap funding bill or trigger government closures.Meanwhile, negotiators were trying to reach a separate agreement on a new coronavirus aid bill, which they want to attach to the massive spending bill.Months of deep disagreements remained between the two political parties over the size and shape of such a bill, which would help stimulate the U.S. economy and bolster efforts to battle Covid-19.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has been pushing for a provision to shield businesses from lawsuits, which he argued are growing in the midst of the pandemic.Democrats largely oppose that measure as they fight for new federal funds for state and local governments that face laying off police, fire and public health officials due to decreased revenues. Many Republicans are balking at this initiative.Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Republican Senator Josh Hawley on Friday threatened to block another stopgap funding bill next week -- if one is needed -- unless they got votes on legislation providing direct payments of $1,200 for adults and $500 for children to ease economic burdens during the Covid-19 pandemic.Such onetime direct payments occurred earlier this year as part of emergency coronavirus relief legislation enacted in March.Last spring, after approving more than $3 trillion in emergency aid, lawmakers had hoped that might be enough to address the worst public health crisis in modern history.Instead, Covid-19 cases are now running rampant throughout the United States, which has the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world, currently topping 293,000.Sanders described in a speech on the Senate floor the long lines of people seeking food donations in his home state of Vermont and elsewhere. “Economists tell us that working families today are in worse shape right now than any time since the Great Depression,” Sanders said, adding that millions of families “are scared to death that they are going to be evicted from their homes” because of joblessness during the pandemic.At the end of this month, a moratorium on such evictions expires, as well as supplemental federal unemployment benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-bill-averting-government-shutdown-fight-on-coronavirus-aid-drags-on/story-8ntFoVM89jMiyxmyBI1v2N.html
12-12-2020||World||UK navy to help protect fishing waters in case of no-deal Brexit||Four Royal Navy patrol ships will be ready from Jan. 1 to help Britain protect its fishing waters in case of a no-deal Brexit, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was likely to complete its EU exit in three weeks without a trade deal.The Ministry of Defence “has conducted extensive planning and preparation to ensure that defence is ready for a range of scenarios at the end of the transition period,” a spokesman said.“This preparation includes a standby package of 14,000 personnel to ensure that we are ready to support other government departments and authorities over the winter period, including with the EU transition, COVID-19 and potential severe weather events,” the spokesman said in an email to Reuters. The 80-metre-long vessels will have the power to stop, check and impound all European Union fishing boats operating within Britain’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which can extend 200 miles (320 km) from shore.The Guardian newspaper reported earlier that two vessels will be deployed at sea with two on standby in case EU fishing boats enter the EEZ.Britain quit the European Union in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.There are concerns about possible skirmishes between British and foreign fishing if no trade deal is reached, with existing transitional rules that give EU boats access to British waters set to expire at the end of the year.A French minister said on Thursday that France would compensate its fishermen and take other measures to help them if talks for a post-Brexit trade deal collapse, in an effort to avoid skirmishes at sea between French and British boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-navy-to-help-protect-fishing-waters-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit/story-kVKrHdfpdeDTdmq1fdUivL.html
12-12-2020||World||Canada could issue order to avoid tariffs on UK products||Justin Trudeau’s government expects to take stopgap regulatory measures to prevent the imposition of tariffs on UK products as it waits for Canada’s parliament to ratify a new trade pact with the European country, according to a senior government official.Britain and Canada announced a transitional trade agreement in November to cover more than C$29 billion ($22.7 billion) worth of bilateral trade. The accord would adopt the same terms as the EU-Canada free trade agreement, however Canadian lawmakers rose for holiday recess on Friday before the proposed deal could be passed.The most likely option available to Canada’s government is a so-called remission order, said the Canadian official, who isn’t authorized to speak publicly about the plans and asked to remain anonymous. That would allow Canada to exempt from tariffs any goods or services that are set to trade duty free under the new agreement.The UK government said Thursday it was concerned that if its post-Brexit agreement with Canada couldn’t be finalized before the year end, exports from both countries would be forced to trade under rules set out by the World Trade Organization. Without the new accord, the UK and Canada would face tariffs on trade from Jan. 1, when the Brexit transition period ends.Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng introduced the bill in the legislature on Wednesday, leaving just two days for parliamentarians to debate the matter.“We have been actively working to ensure that there is a smooth transition, and that Canadian businesses don’t experience any disruptions,” Youmy Han, spokesperson for Ng, said by email.The House of Commons resumes sitting on Jan. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-issue-order-to-avoid-tariffs-on-uk-products/story-IFVzERIWXmxmYrUTWwYM6M.html

12-12-2020||World||US allows emergency Covid-19 vaccine in bid to end pandemic||The U.S. gave the final go-ahead Friday to the nation’s first Covid-19 vaccine, marking what could be the beginning of the end of an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to discuss it publicly.Shots for health workers and nursing home residents are expected to begin in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of what promises to be a strongly protective vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech.Initial doses are scarce and rationed as the U.S. joins Britain and several other countries in scrambling to vaccinate as many people as possible ahead of a long, grim winter. It will take months of work to tamp down the coronavirus that has surged to catastrophic levels in recent weeks and already claimed 1.5 million lives globally.While the FDA decision came only after public review of data from a huge ongoing study, it has also been dogged by intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has accused the agency of being too slow and even threatened to remove FDA chief Stephen Hahn if a ruling did not come Friday.The move sets off what will be the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history -- but it also has global ramifications because it’s a role model to many other countries facing the same decision.The world desperately needs multiple vaccines for enough to go around, and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is the first based on rigorous scientific testing to emerge from that worldwide race -- a record-setting scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.“I don’t think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.The U.S. is considering a second vaccine, made by Moderna Inc., that could roll out in another week. In early January, Johnson & Johnson expects to learn if its vaccine is working in final testing.Europe is set to make its own decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots later this month, an important step as some other candidates that multiple countries were anxiously awaiting have hit roadblocks. Friday, Sanofi and GSK announced a months-long delay after early tests showed their vaccine didn’t work well enough in older adults.And China and Russia didn’t wait for final-stage tests before beginning vaccinations with some homegrown shots.About 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected in the first shipments around the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s vaccine development program. A similar amount is to be held in reserve for those recipients’ second dose.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee is poised to recommend who’s first in line. Expected to follow health workers and nursing homes are other essential workers, older adults and people at high risk because of other health problems. U.S. authorities don’t expect enough for the general population before spring, and that’s assuming there are no manufacturing glitches.In a still unfinished study of nearly 44,000 people, the FDA found the vaccine was safe and more than 90% effective across recipients of different ages, including older adults, races and those with health problems that put them at high risk from the coronavirus.Emergency use means the vaccine still is experimental. Most important for would-be recipients to know:--Some protection begins after the first dose, but it takes a second dose three weeks later for full protection. It’s unclear how long protection lasts.--The vaccine protects against Covid-19 illness, but no one yet knows if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for roughly half of all cases. The ongoing study will attempt to answer that but for now, the vaccinated still will need to wear a mask and keep their distance.--Expect a sore arm and some flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and chills after the second dose. While uncomfortable, those reactions only last about a day. “That’s just your immune system working. It’s a good thing,” Offit said.--Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by people with a history of severe allergies. Offit said it is routine in the U.S. for the vaccinated to stick around for a half-hour so they could get prompt treatment if such reactions appear.If emergency use of Moderna’s vaccine also is authorized, the U.S. expects to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of December. They hope to have enough for another 30 million people in January and 50 million in February.Getting shots into arms is the big challenge, especially as a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found only half of Americans want the vaccine when it’s their turn. About a quarter say they won’t get it and the rest aren’t sure.Political interference has complicated health authorities’ message that the testing was rigorous and cut no corners.President Donald Trump bashed the FDA, again, Friday for taking too long, complaining that the agency “is still a big, old slow turtle.” One of his deputies even pressed Hahn to clear the shots by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.The FDA is unique in analyzing drugmakers’ raw data, a process that takes longer than many other countries’ regulatory reviews. In addition, the FDA insisted that large Covid-19 vaccine studies track at least half the participants for two months to look for side effects, a time period when historically any vaccine problems appear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allows-emergency-covid-19-vaccine-in-bid-to-end-pandemic/story-w7toqY24Up7QJSBw5ch5WL.html

The World Health Organisation (WHO) last week again stressed on the importance of wearing masks and following the Covid-19 guidelines after warning people that not everyone will be able to receive the vaccine early next year.“Vaccines do not equal zero Covid. Vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus too cautioned against the “growing perception that the pandemic is over.”Click here for full Covid-19 updatesMeanwhile, nations are gearing up for a massive rollout to tackle the surging infections. According to the Union health ministry, eight vaccine candidates are at various stages of trials in India and are in the line for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA). EUA is a mechanism by which regulatory authorities facilitate the availability and use of unapproved medical products such as vaccines during public health emergencies.Here is a list of vaccine candidates that are under regulatory review for emergency useor are likely to get a nod for it:Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine   The vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech was submitted for emergency use authorisation in the US on Friday. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would work quickly to authorise the vaccine for emergency use after an advisory panel voted in favor of it, after endorsing the vaccine on Thursday, according to news agency AP. In India, VK Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for Covid-19 that advises India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told Reuters that the country may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator.Also Read: India’s daily Covid tally falls below 30k for second time in 3 days, recoveries nearing 9.3 millionOxford/AstraZenecaSerum Institute of India (SII), which is conducting trials of Covid-19 vaccine Covishield in India, has said it expects approval for emergency use in the next two weeks. UK’s drug regulator Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has already given a nod to the vaccine candidate. ModernaUS drugmaker Moderna applied for emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine on Monday. It had announced its plans to request the US FDA for an EUA for its Covid-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, in November end.Bharat BiotechBharat Biotech has been told by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on emergency use authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine that it needs to submit more data on its candidate Covaxin before it can be granted approval for emergency use. “While considering the application of Bharat Biotech company, the SEC after detailed evaluation recommended that the pharma major should submit the safety and efficacy data from its ongoing phase 3 clinical trial in India for more analysis,” a source told ANI.

The incident occurred just after 4 p.m. at the corner of 39th Street and Third Avenue in the Murray Hill neighborhood adjacent to Midtown Manhattan, police said.None of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, and the motorist involved remained at the scene, police said. Few other official details were immediately available.Local media reports said six people were struck by the car, but it was unclear as to how many people were taken to hospitals.Some accounts on social media described a chaotic scene around a stopped car surrounded by protesters, before the vehicle lurched into the crowd, sending some people and bicycles tumbling. Those reports could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters.Police and several local media outlets said the protest was sponsored by the racial justice group Black Lives Matter.A Reuters photographer at the scene and at least one media outlet said that demonstration was held in solidarity with nine undocumented immigrants staging a hunger strike in a New Jersey lockup, in custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plows-into-manhattan-protest-injuring-several-driver-detained/story-mAeETxAx1XTvdQJsXwF8pK.html
12-12-2020||World||Moderna says US to buy 100 million more vaccine doses||Moderna Inc. said the U.S. government exercised its option to buy 100 million additional doses of the company’s coronavirus vaccine candidate, doubling the amount of the shot it initially committed to purchase and easing concern that the U.S. could be left with a vaccine shortfall.Moderna said Friday that the order, worth $1.65 billion, would be delivered during the second quarter of 2021. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker will be able to provide a continuous supply of vaccine doses through the end of June, according to the U.S. government.Worry emerged this week that the U.S. might not have sufficient supply of Covid-19 vaccines following reports that the government had passed on an offer from Pfizer Inc. for more of the shot it developed with BioNTech SE, which is expected to gain authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.U.S. officials have said they have confidence the government will be able to meet nationwide demand, having secured supply agreements for six different experimental candidates.As part of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. initiative to rapidly develop and secure vaccines for Covid-19, the U.S. has the option to buy another 300 million doses from Moderna at a fixed price of $16.50 per shot, the company said. The experimental messenger RNA vaccine, which is administered in two doses, is being evaluated by the FDA, and could receive an emergency-use authorization before the end of the month.“This new federal purchase can give Americans even greater confidence we will have enough supply to vaccinate all Americans who want it by the second quarter of 2021,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in the statement.Moderna shares gained 2.6% in late trading in New York. So far this year, the stock has surged in value by more than eightfold.Moderna has said it expects to produce 500 million to 1 billion total doses of its vaccine in 2021. It is currently making U.S. supply at its plant in Massachusetts and another factory in New Hampshire owned by manufacturing partner Lonza Group AG. Lonza Group is also producing supply for other countries at a plant in Switzerland.The company has agreed to supply shots to the European Union, the U.K., Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Israel and Qatar, among others.HHS and the Department of Defense have provided $3.2 billion to expand the manufacturing capacity reserved for Moderna’s two-dose vaccine regimen, known as mRNA-1273.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-us-to-buy-100-million-more-vaccine-doses/story-Syogc4ozVmYAGu17nrekiP.html
12-12-2020||World||Donald Trump pushes for fast Pfizer approval as other vaccines hit snags||President Donald Trump on Friday piled pressure on the US drug regulator to quickly approve the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine as America readied to roll out mass immunizations. The Washington Post reported that the White House told the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Stephen Hahn to submit his resignation if the agency does not clear the vaccine by the end of the day.Hahn later disputed the characterization of the call, but the alleged threat came as Trump tweeted that the agency was a “big, old, slow turtle” and told Hahn to get the “dam” vaccines out immediately.An expert committee had already voted to grant an emergency use authorization, which was expected within days, as the FDA worked to iron out last-minute details with Pfizer. These included a fact sheet for doctors. The FDA has said it wants to warn people with severe allergies to avoid the shots for now.Trump’s intervention reinserts politics into the scientific process, which could undermine vaccine confidence in the world’s hardest-hit country, where the death toll is nearing 300,000.It was also not clear whether having an EUA a day or two earlier than expected would change when the first Americans -- nursing home residents and health care workers -- would get their injections, which is expected Monday or Tuesday.The country hopes to have 20 million people inoculated this month. The government also said Friday that it is buying 100 million more doses of the Moderna vaccine candidate, amid reports the government passed on the opportunity to secure more supply of the Pfizer jab.The purchase brings its total supply of Moderna doses to 200 million, enough to immunize 100 million people with the two-shot regimen, which is yet to be green-lighted by authorities.Two other vaccine candidates stumbled Friday. France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said on Friday their vaccine would not be ready until the end of 2021.New results showed a low immune response in older adults, researchers said.And in Australia, the development of a vaccine at The University of Queensland was abandoned Friday after clinical trials produced a false positive HIV result among subjects involved in early testing.The mixed news on the vaccine front comes as infections accelerated fast in North America and parts of Africa but started to stabilize in Europe and drop in Asia and the Middle East.Around the world more than 1.58 million lives have been lost to Covid-19 since it emerged in China a year ago, according to an AFP tally from official sources.The World Health Organization warned Friday that Christmas celebrations could turn to tears if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season.- Sputnik mix -Britain this week became the first Western country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved.The first vaccine shipments to 14 sites across Canada are scheduled to arrive Monday with people receiving shots a day or two later.Israel, which accepted its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, is targeting a rollout on December 27.And Hong Kong said Friday it had struck deals for two vaccines -- one from Pfizer and the other from Beijing-based Sinovac -- with plans to launch a campaign in early 2021.A new combined approach is also being tested by AstraZeneca, whose Russian operation said it would mix its shot with the locally-made Sputnik V vaccine in clinical trials.Russia and China have already begun inoculation efforts with domestically produced vaccines that have seen less rigorous vetting, while EU countries are eagerly awaiting clearance on two options. The EU’s watchdog said it would deliver decisions on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in late December and early January respectively.Yet many lingering questions about the vaccines remain.Key issues include whether more side effects will emerge with longer follow-up, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients.- Carbon down -As Europe’s surge eases off slightly, France is planning to lift a six-week-long lockdown from Tuesday but impose a curfew from 8.00 pm, including on New Year’s Eve.Greece also announced new plans Friday to slash quarantine time for incoming travelers and reopen churches for Christmas.But Switzerland, which is seeing a sharp resurgence in cases, announced a 7.00 pm curfew for shops, restaurants and bars.“Our hospitals and our health workers are being stretched to the limit. We couldn’t wait any longer,” President Simonetta Sommaruga said.While lockdowns have brought economic pain, boredom and myriad other woes, the effect on the environment has been more positive. Carbon emissions fell a record seven percent in 2020 as countries imposed lockdowns, according to the Global Carbon Project.The biggest drops were recorded in the US, down 12 percent, and the European Union, down 11 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pushes-for-fast-pfizer-approval-as-other-vaccines-hit-snags/story-kll84o9FammgRwWs4aNAyO.html
12-12-2020||World||Number of Covid-19 vaccines growing but volume of doses remains concern, says WHO Adviser||The World Health Organization (WHO) is encouraged by the growth in the number of vaccines against COVID-19 that have performed well in clinical trials, although the organization remains concerned by the limited number of doses currently available, Bruce Aylward, a senior WHO adviser, said on Friday.A handful of candidate vaccines against Covid-19 have reported efficacy levels of greater than 90 per cent in clinical trials, and Aylward noted that multiple vaccine platforms have shown strong results.“If you look week by week at the number of companies that are announcing positive results in terms of the efficacy of vaccines, that number is increasing and what’s important is it’s increasing not just in terms of the number of products, but also the different technology platforms that they are being built on. As we’ve seen now, there are three different sorts of technology platforms, as we call them, that have reported very positive efficacy and safety data,” the WHO senior adviser told a media briefing.Over the past week, US media outlets reported that Pfizer is unlikely to meet its original supply targets for its vaccine against Covid-19, which is produced in conjunction with German firm BioNTech, due to supply chain issues.GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi also announced earlier on Friday that their candidate vaccine will likely not be available until the end of 2021 due to disappointing trial results, and Aylward noted the WHO’s concern over the actual number of available vaccine doses.“But at the same time ... there are real challenges with volumes. These are still very, very scarce products. And just as some companies are announcing successes, there are others - and we’ve had two over the last few days - that have said they have had challenges with their products either in terms of the volumes they can produce or in terms of some of the trial results,” the WHO senior adviser said.At the same media briefing, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his belief that more countries will begin their mass coronavirus disease vaccination programs in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-covid-19-vaccines-growing-but-volume-of-doses-remains-concern-says-who-adviser/story-6UBFglnaVr0vsCI1P0UGJN.html
12-12-2020||World||White House threatens FDA chief’s job over vaccine approval||White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Friday pressed Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or face possible firing, two administration officials said.The vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech won a critical endorsement Thursday from an FDA panel of outside advisers, and signoff from the agency — which was expected this weekend — is the next step needed to get the shots to the public.Meadows spoke to Hahn by telephone Friday, according to a senior administration official who was familiar with the call but was not authorized to discuss private conversations.The chief of staff also told Hahn his job was in jeopardy if the emergency use authorization was not issued before Saturday, said a second administration official familiar with the conversation.Hahn signaled that he would tell regulators to allow the vaccine to be issued on an emergency basis, the official said.Friday’s threat marked the latest attempt by the Trump administration to override government scientists working to combat the deadly pandemic. Even with an FDA decision expected within hours, President Donald Trump and his deputies proved unwilling to let regulators work through their careful review, which includes drafting safety warning labels and instructions for physicians.It was unclear if authorizing the vaccine Friday night would meaningfully expedite the vaccine’s rollout.Trump tweeted directly at Hahn earlier Friday, complaining that FDA “is still a big, old, slow turtle.” Trump has publicly bashed the pace of the FDA’s vaccine review process.“Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn,” Trump tweeted Friday. “Stop playing games and start saving lives.”Hahn disputed characterizations of his conversation with Meadows.“This is an untrue representation of the phone call with the Chief of Staff,” Hahn said in a statement. “The FDA was encouraged to continue working expeditiously on Pfizer-BioNTech’s EUA request. FDA is committed to issuing this authorization quickly, as we noted in our statement this morning.”The FDA said earlier Friday that it “will rapidly work” to grant emergency use of the vaccine.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s school of public health, called the pressure an “unforced error” by the White House that could chip away at public confidence in a vaccine.“It creates a veneer of political meddling,” Jha said. “Every time you see the president get involved, you see vaccine confidence drop by 10%.”Hahn and other top health officials have been working for months to boost public confidence in the government’s vaccine effort, which will eventually need to reach most Americans to suppress the virus.Recent polls show only about half of all Americans are ready to roll up their sleeves for a shot. Many have safety concerns and want to wait and see how the initial rollout fares. But concerns that a vaccine was rushed due to political pressure could further undermine the unprecedented vaccination effort.“The last thing this process needs now is to undermine the public’s faith in the vaccine with political pressure to hurry up an already rushed process with threats of firings,” said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia.Jha added that FDA officials don’t need the added pressure. “They already feel the weight of what’s happening in our country,” he said.Trump’s frustration with the FDA has been mounting, particularly as other countries have beaten the U.S. in issuing emergency approvals for the vaccine. Meadows issued the ultimatum to Hahn at Trump’s direction, a senior administration official said.The FDA decision — when it comes — will kickstart an unprecedented vaccination campaign needed to eventually defeat the virus, now blamed for nearly 300,000 deaths in the U.S. And the agency’s greenlight of the vaccine was virtually assured after Thursday’s positive vote by agency advisers.The FDA’s review is critical to assuring the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine that will eventually be given to many millions of Americans..Among the final issues facing FDA scientists are whether to authorize the shot for use in pregnant women and teenagers, who were not extensively studied in Pfizer’s trial.The agency’s careful approach is unique around the world in that the FDA actually reanalyzes all company data to verify its accuracy. That’s different from the abbreviated process used by the U.K. and other countries, which rely on summary data produced by manufacturers.Hahn has stated for months that “science, not politics” would determine when the agency gives the vaccine the go-ahead.More than 150 FDA staffers have been working in shifts over nights, weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday to review tens of thousands of pages of Pfizer’s application.Hahn told The Associated Press earlier this week that his agency had already teed up authorization by prefilling all the necessary legal paperwork.“We’re doing everything we can to cut down on the red tape, which I think is really important,” Hahn told the AP.Trump has been livid with the FDA for not moving faster to approve the shots, blaming the fact that a vaccine was not available before the Nov. 3 election for his loss. Trump also has leveled unfounded claims that drug companies deliberately delayed vaccine development to hinder his reelection chances, though there is no evidence to suggest that took place.As he has refused to accept his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, Trump also has told close confidants that he believes the vaccine is still being slow-walked in a bid to undermine his efforts to challenge the results.If the vaccine were shipped out sooner, he has argued, it would rally public opinion to his side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-threatens-fda-chief-s-job-over-vaccine-approval/story-w3131Pi3Z8ER5sYQI80dwO.html

The University of Michigan’s measure of sentiment unexpectedly increased in early December, with a gauge of current conditions hitting the highest level since March.EuropeMost Europeans want the economic recovery from the pandemic to promote growth that prevents climate change, the European Investment Bank found in a survey.A one-off 5% tax on wealth in the U. could raise more than 260 billion pounds ($348 billion) to help fix the coronavirus-hit public finances, according to a panel of experts.AsiaAsia’s head start in the economic recovery from Covid-19 is sending a warning to the rest of the world: inequalities exacerbated by the virus are unlikely to be reversed any time soon.China’s consumer prices fell for the first time in more than a decade in November, dragged down by a slump in pork prices after supplies recovered from last year’s swine disease.Japan expects its latest stimulus package will boost the economy by 3.6%, but analysts warn that the number should be approached with caution.Emerging MarketsBrazil’s central bank signaled it may be unable to fulfill its pledge to keep interest rates at a record low for long due to rising inflation expectations.South Africa’s economy may only get back to pre-Covid 19 levels by 2025 and remains vulnerable to a local resurgence of the pandemic, even after exiting its longest recession in 28 years.WorldWall Street’s biggest banks are predicting the coronavirus-hit world economy will crawl through the early days of 2021 before bouncing back. Vaccines and more fiscal stimulus will help fuel an expansion after the unanticipated shock of the deepest recession since the Great Depression.In the slow march toward equality over who wields global economic power, 2020 has seen more progress for women storming bastions of hitherto male-only dominance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/charting-the-global-economy-inflation-debate-picks-up-in-us/story-VDrM0G1BMVzxZlxk17Db5I.html
12-12-2020||India||Hope to have serious discussions on trade issues with Biden administration: Jaishankar||There was a fairly serious negotiation between India and the Trump administration on resolving the outstanding trade issues as well as to clinch a trade deal, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday while hoping to have talks over it with the Biden dispensation.The external affairs minister said the focus of the talks was to address the “differences” before moving towards “something bigger”.Participating in an interactive session at the annual general meeting of industry body FICCI, Jaishankar said the US economy was largely a “complementary” one and that there was “no fundamental clash of interests” between the two sides though there are some areas of overlap.“There was a fairly serious negotiation between our government and the Trump administration on resolving the outstanding trade issues. I think the general thinking on both sides was ‘let’s deal with differences before we think of something bigger’,” he said.The external affairs minister said a lot of discussions had taken place over the proposed deal.“For a variety of reasons, they didn’t close it out. I can tell you on our side, we were dead serious. We wanted to deal with those issues because we thought there was something much bigger that was in store for the relationship. But it didn’t happen. And often when it comes to trade discussions (they) are like business discussions between two governments,” he said.In such discussions, the devil is in the details, he said, adding, “If you do not close out a deal, it is not a deal.” “We made a very focused serious persevering effort, it didn’t get done this year. I do believe that in a very very basic way, the US is a complementary economy,” he said.The external affairs minister further said: “I certainly hope that we have serious discussions once the (Biden) administration comes in. I know our minister is very focused on it, and it is something which is rightly very important on his agenda.” The Trump administration last year terminated India’s designation as a beneficiary under the key GSP trade programme on the ground that it has not provided the US equitable and reasonable access to its markets.Export of certain goods to the US were previously allowed in duty-free category under a special trade scheme called the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The US has been seeking greater access to India’s huge poultry and dairy markets. However, India has some reservations over it.Asked about the outcome of the US presidential election, Jaishankar suggested that the ties between the two countries will continue to expand.“If I were to sum up my takeaway from the Biden administration coming into office, I would say vis-a-vis the world, quite apart from the security issues and the political influence issues, one big question for them is how do they keep America competitive. And the other big question is really, how do they deal with the climate change challenge,” he said.Jaishankar said the Indo-US relationship is at a “different level” now and that cooperation in security and defence will continue to be key aspects of it.“When it comes to economic issues, especially competitiveness, I think India can make a big difference. Because we are actually doing today much more on global issues and global challenges than we have done before, even on something like climate change if you look,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-to-have-serious-discussions-on-trade-issues-with-biden-administration-jaishankar/story-0bO7ZZ03qLCJg9vmvnr54O.html

Last week, the Tamil superstar said on Twitter that he will launch his political party in January next year to contest in the upcoming Tamil Nadu Assembly elections and the date will be announced on December 31. Birthday wishes poured in for the megastar, including one from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin and a host of celebrities from the film fraternity, industrialists, cricketers shared their photos with the star. The Rajnikanth fan club put out messages on social media that it was now or never for him to take political plunge and said they were all ready to ensure his political success. Rajinikanth’s political debut brings a new dimension into Tamil Nadu’s politics which has been dominated by the DMK and the AIADMK. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying hard to make its presence felt in the state and has favoured Rajinikanth. Also in the fray is Rajinikanth’s contemporary Kamal Haasan, whose Makkal Needhi Maiam comes with an experience of contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In the last three days, Rajinikanth held consultations with Tamilaruvi Manian, the supervisor for the yet to be launched party, and R Arjunamurthy, who was made party coordinator after he quit the BJP.“We discussed how to strengthen the party at the ground level,” said Manian. Rajinikanth will leave for Hyderabad where shooting resumes on December 15 for his upcoming film ‘Annatthe’ produced by Karunanidhi’s grandnephew Kalanidhi Maran under the Sun Pictures banner. “I’ve made a commitment and I’ve 40% shooting left to be completed,” Rajinikanth had said earlier. He will return to the city to announce on December 31 the date of his party’s launch. Several fans gathered in front of the actor’s house in Chennai dressing up as Rajinikanth-look alikes and wearing shirts with his image. A political extension of his fan club, Rajini Makkal Mandram, which engages in party work, will partake in charity work on his birthday as they do annually.The Tamil actor’s cult following transcends borders with a fan base across the world who have waited for him to make the political plunge for decades. Three years after Rajinikanth said that he will enter politics, he is yet to launch his party. He underwent a kidney transplant in 2016.The actor has now confirmed that his party will contest in all 234 seats in Tamil Nadu’s assembly. But questions remain if Rajinikanth will enter the fray as the chief ministerial candidate. So far, his stance has been that while he governs the party, he would pick a young and educated candidate for the top job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajinikanth-s-birthday-cake-spells-out-his-political-intent-to-those-waiting/story-0Z9bLapkWFhLh2Hz99hHMP.html

We should avoid large public gatherings for this program too,” he said.The memorial commemorates the 1818 battle of Bhima Koregaon in which British forces, which included soldiers from the Dalit `Mahar’ community, defeated the Peshwa’s army.Dalits look upon the battle as the beginning of self-assertion by the oppressed classes.There were caste riots in the area during bicentenary celebrations of the battle on January 1, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-appeal-for-low-key-programs-at-bhima-koregaon/story-X82EoiPCenb1eIpdZKy2XL.html

He also urged the PM to help with the financial assistance to the state government towards flood-relief work in the rain-ravaged areas of Hyderabad.KCR, as the chief minister is known, had a half-an-hour meeting with the PM and is reported to have discussed all pending issues with the Centre. The meeting between the two comes after a gap of more than 14 months – the last time the meeting took place was on October 4, 2019.Unlike in the past, there was no official release from the chief minister’s office this time, but a Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader familiar with the development said it was purely an official meeting without any political significance.“The chief minister explained to the Prime Minister how the state’s economy had suffered heavily due to Covid-19 pandemic and how Hyderabad suffered heavy damages during the recent heavy rain and flash floods,” the TRS leader said.The chief minister requested the PM to release additional grants to the state to take up restoration works in flood-hit Hyderabad, besides GST compensation and funds due to the state under finance commission devolutions.He also reiterated the demands for granting national project status to Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme on Godavari river, besides central assistance to Dindi and Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift schemes on Krishna river.In the afternoon, KCR met civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and requested him to approve the establishment of five more airports in Telangana. He appealed to the minister to help the state finalise the sites apart from getting all statutory clearances on a single-window basis for the airports.In his representation to Puri, the chief minister said that once the statutory clearances were given, the state government can commence the infrastructure work at the earliest for starting the non-scheduled operator’s permit (NSOP) operations with its own funds.KCR, who landed in New Delhi on Friday evening, met Union home minister Amit Shah the same day and requested him to release adequate financial assistance for modernisation of police forces. He also explained how the state capital had witnessed heavy damages during the recent floods.Earlier, the chief minister also called on Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat to explain the state government’s stand on Krishna river projects.On Sunday, the TRS chief would visit the site allocated by the Central government for construction of the party office in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-chief-minister-kcr-in-delhi-calls-on-pm-modi-amit-shah/story-GibM0YmKUTzFT8BILlzHvO.html
12-12-2020||India||Israel, Bhutan establish formal diplomatic relations||Bhutan and Israel established formal diplomatic relations on Saturday, and the tiny Himalayan nation now has diplomatic ties with 54 countries and the European Union. Notes verbale on the establishment of diplomatic relations were exchanged by Bhutan’s ambassador Vetsop Namgyel and his Israeli counterpart Ron Malka during a ceremony held at the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. “The establishment of diplomatic relations would not only build upon the existing close ties but open the path to greater cooperation and further strengthen relations between the two countries and peoples,” said a joint statement issued by the two countries. The development came a little more than a fortnight after Bhutan established full-fledged diplomatic relations with Germany on November 25. It also came against the backdrop of fresh Chinese claims on parts of Bhutan’s territory near the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. During Saturday’s ceremony, the envoys of the two countries “recognised the growing engagements between Bhutan and Israel and welcomed the establishment of diplomatic relations”, according to the statement. Namgyel and Malka reiterated the shared desire of the two countries to further strengthen bilateral cooperation for the benefit of their people. “In addition to deepening cooperation in areas including economic, technological and agriculture development, the two ambassadors highlighted that the ties between the peoples through cultural exchanges and tourism would also be further enhanced,” the statement said. Following the ceremony, Bhutan foreign minister Tandi Dorji and his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi sent mutual congratulations. Israel and Bhutan have “enjoyed cordial relations marked by friendship and cooperation, even in the absence of diplomatic relations”, the statement said. Israel supported Bhutan’s human resource development since 1982, especially in agriculture development that has benefitted hundreds of Bhutanese youth. The establishment of diplomatic relations will create new avenues for cooperation between the two countries in water management, technology, human resource development, agricultural sciences and other areas. The statement didn’t say whether the two countries will open embassies in each other’s capital. Bhutan’s capital Thimphu hosts only three foreign missions – those of India, Bangladesh and Kuwait. As part of domestic reforms introduced by late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, who ruled from 1952 to 1972, Bhutan gradually established relations with a small number of countries and joined the UN in 1971. There was no formal reaction from the Indian side to Saturday’s development. However, India welcomed the establishment of full-fledged diplomatic ties between Germany and Bhutan last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-bhutan-establish-formal-diplomatic-relations/story-Ipu61jdGWFXqmDrhwxmQtO.html
12-12-2020||India||Centre should not decide Covid-19 vaccination based on voters’ list: TMC MP||The Trinamool Congress on Saturday said the Centre should not go ahead with Covid-19 vaccination “on the basis of voters’ list”, but facilitate inoculation for every person in the country.TMC MP and Indian Medical Association (West Bengal chapter) president Santanu Sen said there are reports that the Centre is firming up guidelines to begin a vaccination drive based on voters’ list of persons aged over 50 years.“How can vaccination be done on the basis of voters’ list? What about the citizens whose names may not figure in it, but who have other documents? Will they be left out,” Sen told a press conference.He said the TMC demands that every bona fide resident of the country be extended the benefit of vaccines.Sen alleged that while the West Bengal government spent Rs 5,000 crore to build Covid-19 medical care facilities, there was no significant financial help from the Centre, which “forcibly” sent teams to “find lacuna in our Covid fight and one of the teams, instead, praised our infrastructure at Beleghata ID Hospital.” He also blamed the Narendra Modi government for “waking up late to the emerging Covid situation in February”.“... The Union government did not have any prior planning in the first few months about the ways to cope with the situation, though the first coronavirus case was reported in the country on January 30,” Sen said.Despite all this, West Bengal has achieved remarkable success in the fight against the contagion, as the “declining death rate in past two months proves”, he said.The death rate in the state will be 1.4 per cent in the coming days, the TMC leader said.“The festive season didn’t result in spike in Covid-19 cases. That speaks volumes about our battle yielding success,” Sen asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-not-decide-covid-19-vaccination-based-on-voters-list-tmc-mp/story-Ho4guRkgTM2Un6a3BPwXqK.html

Naxals create an atmosphere of fear and that is why the farmers’ leaders could not gather the courage to talk about the issues,” the minister told news agency ANI.The Union minister, who was part of the meetings between Centre and the agitating farmers to break the impasse, said the December 8 Bharat Bandh wasn’t successful even as 18 opposition parties backed it. He also blamed the opposition parties for supporting the nationwide strike, which he said had “failed miserably” as India did not shut down. “Bharat chalega, Bharat aur tez chalega, daudega (India will progress, it will progress at a faster pace)’,” Goyal added.He said people understand that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working towards a new and self-reliant nation. They know he is working to double the income of farmers and create employment opportunities, especially for the youth, Goyal added. He reassured farmers that the agricultural reforms do not change or hamper none of the existing arrangements. The aim of the new legislation is to free the farmers from any past shackles and bring new opportunities for them, he added.Meanwhile, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said a group of “progressive farmers’ leaders” have submitted a memorandum backing the three farm laws liberalising agricultural markets. Also, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala met the Union minister earlier in the day and said he was hopeful that the next round of talks between the Centre and the farmers will be held “in the next 24 to 48 hours” and will lead to a conclusive result.The three contentious laws - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 - have triggered protests across the country, with thousands of peasants camping at Delhi’s borders to demand their scrapping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-get-over-the-influence-of-maoists-and-naxalites-piyush-goyal/story-2atNCBTd9Aql8UijjHK97K.html
12-12-2020||India||‘Use election-like process for Covid-19 vaccination drive’: Centre tells states||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination drive will be similar to the election process in the country, Union health ministry stated in its operational guidelines for Covid-19 vaccines sent out to states. It said that the latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly election should be used to identify population aged 50 years and above who would be given the vaccine on priority along with health care and frontline workers.The remaining population will be offered the vaccine based on the disease epidemiology (pattern) and the vaccine’s availability.“While most of the healthcare and frontline workers would be vaccinated at fixed session sites, vaccination of other high-risk populations may require outreach session sites, and mobile sites/teams. State/UT can identify specific days for vaccination,” the government guidelines said.Only pre-registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated following the prioritization, with 100 registered beneficiaries vaccinated per session. There will be no on-the-spot vaccination of beneficiaries at the vaccination site.Covid-19 vaccine will be introduced once all trainings are completed at the district, block, and planning units.Also read: People in Kerala to get free Covid-19 vaccine, says chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan“As demonstrated during recent experiences with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction and polio rounds conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, national and state training of trainers may be successfully conducted on virtual platforms and cascaded to district and sub-district levels using a mix of virtual and face-to-face trainings.”The constitution of a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) has been the key in guiding all aspects of Covid-19 vaccine introduction in India. Twenty-three ministries and departments, and numerous developmental partners are involved in planning for Covid-19 vaccine introduction in the country.“The Covid-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to people above 50 years of age, followed by those younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities based on evolving pandemic situation, and finally to the remaining population based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability,” the guidelines mentioned.“The priority group of above 50 years may be further subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 to 60 years of age for purposes of phasing of vaccine’s rollout based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability. The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly election will be used to identify population aged 50 years or more,” the guiding document stated.The vaccination team will consist of five members. There will be a vaccinator officer, who could be a doctor (MBBS/BDS), staff nurse, pharmacist, auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), lady health visitor (LHV). Anyone legally authorized to give injection will be considered as a potential vaccinator. Then there will be vaccination officer 1 with at least one person from the police, home guard, civil defence, National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme or Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan who will check the registration status of beneficiary at the entry point and ensure guarded entry to the vaccination session.The vaccination officer 2 will be the verifier who will authenticate or verify the identification documents while the vaccination officer 3 and 4 will be the two-support staff responsible for crowd management, information education and communication, and support the vaccinator.The Covid-19 vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system, a digitalized platform, will be used to track the enlisted beneficiaries for vaccination and Covid-19 vaccines on a real-time basis.Also read: Bihar youth’s arduous journey from working at snack factory to becoming Army officerThe existing adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system will be utilized to monitor adverse events and inform the understanding of the safety profile of the vaccines. The reporting of AEFI through SAFEVAC is being integrated with Co-WIN software and every AEFI to be reported at the district level and further the referral mechanisms in case of any AEFI needs to be put in place.SAFEVAC is an app-based capture of adverse effects after influenza vaccinations. Experts say it is a good idea to make use of the existing platform used for universal immunisation in India to conduct Covid-19 vaccination drive.“To be able to effectively reach the target population for the Covid-19 vaccination, India will need to utilize its existing national immunization network, including the infrastructure (production, storage, transport, delivery facilities) as well as the human resources (vaccinators, supervisors, etc). However, given the scale of the vaccination effort required for Covid-19, the effort will need to take the existing network and build on it. This needs to be planned for, budgeted, and efforts made to put this in place ahead of a vaccine being available for widespread immunisation,” said researcher Anant Bhan, who specializes in bioethics and public health.There are 9 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in different phases of development in India, of these 3 are in the pre-clinical phase whereas 6 are under clinical trials.According to the statements made by the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, India aims to vaccinate 250-300 million people against Covid-19 in the first phase on priority by July next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-election-like-process-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-centre-tells-states/story-rwfQPRVXRoaBZ4osGd1GdK.html

The premier investigation agency was probing a complaint against Dinesh Bhatia, associate professor at NEHU (North Eastern Hill University) and head of the department of bio-medical engineering in Shillong, who had allegedly taken a bribe of Rs 40,000.Complainant Raghuvendra Pratap Tripathi is in the docks for being involved in the whole process, as uncovered by the agency’s investigation.Bhatia was arrested by the CBI in 2018 under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 40,000 from Tripathi, who was pursuing his PhD under his supervision.“We are confident that justice will prevail and that my client will win this case,” Dinesh Bhatia’s legal counsel M Haque told HT.When contacted, Prof Bhatia told HT, “I have faith in the judicial system of our great nation. I knew I was innocent.” In its chargesheet, the CBI said Tripathi was complicit in the crime along with Dr Dinesh Bhatia and one Ranjeet Kumar Gupta. In fact, Tripathi also requested Gupta to help him and Bhatia to assist in committing the crime, the agency claimed, adding that the money trail clearly implicates the trio.Further, Bhatia’s counsel informed that while all three accused were asked to appear before the Special CBI Court on Friday, only his client adhered to the directive which has been duly noted by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complainant-in-bribery-case-is-one-among-accused-reveals-cbi-probe/story-sZVgGBFEqfYvURqFluMulK.html

We hope he will respond positively,” the CM said, listing out how central agencies targeted political opponents in various states. He took names of many leaders like former union minister P Chidambaram, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, late Ahmed Patel, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and asked state Congress leaders whether they share the same perception in cases against these leaders also. Coming down heavily on the Centre, the CM said once leaders facing cases cross over to the BJP camp, charges against them disappear in no time. Elaborating his point, he took names of Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy, former Congress leader Narayan Rane and former Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy. “It was at my initiative a central agency probe was ordered in the smuggling case and we all welcomed it wholeheartedly. Now probe is not into the smuggling case but many other things,” the CM alleged, adding a section of media and opposition leaders were engaged in a slanderous game to weaken the government. He said voters will give a befitting reply to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-agencies-working-to-weaken-kerala-govt-cm-vijayan-complains/story-cnSBkAkwMB6htK4nsp4mqL.html

Singh said that in the last one year, there is a visible change in governance and the good governance practices followed by the Centre are also being gradually implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, one after the other.“This has also led to a conspicuous change in the work culture in the government setup which was grossly lacking in the past,” he said. The minister said the setting up of DDCs will bring further accountability, transparency and outcome-oriented approach in the working of the government. “When the District Councillors and the District Council Chairman work in coordination with the District Deputy Commissioner and his administration, they will not only supplement each other’s efforts and initiatives, but also exercise the necessary checks and balances,” he said.Singh said DDCs will herald a new era of democratisation with accountability in the administration and, therefore, it is everyone’s responsibility to make this initiative successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-370-allowed-rampant-corruption-in-j-k-minister-jitendra-singh/story-Erf8f1FVePSjSWhu2SXwxN.html

He urged people above 65 years of age and children not to visit the temple because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Unlike the previous years, the temple would remain shut on January 1 and 2 as the administration would not be able to handle the rush of the devotees.The opening of Jagannath temple is expected to set the stage for the opening of rest of the temples across the state next month. Over the last couple of months, priests across hundreds of temples have been protesting the closure of temple by beating gongs. Opposition BJP has been demanding the opening of temples, stressing that priests who depend on the donation of the devotees have been in a precarious state ever since the temples closed down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagannath-temple-to-open-its-door-to-devotees-from-december-23/story-dZfCwO47ptbiHDN5zP1A7H.html

We have given a memorandum to all districts,” Prakash told reporters after the meeting.  He also sought to know why the previous government did not implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission till 2014.“Everyone has a right to protest. They have, so do we. We are in support of the three laws, but this protest is being led by Leftists and those who are violent,” he said.Claiming that the ongoing farmers’ agitation is no longer a peasant movement, the BKU leader said, “It has taken a political colour. Farmers will get real freedom through these three laws.” This was the second group of farmers from Haryana that met Tomar and extended support to the farm laws. The first group had met the minister on December 7.No breakthrough has been achieved during the six rounds of talks between the Centre and the agitating farmers so far, as the farmers have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the laws, despite the government sending them a draft proposal to amend specific issues without abolishing the legislations.The three laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and scrap the mandis (wholesale markets), leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has maintained that the MSP and the mandi system would continue and would rather be improved and strengthened further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-group-in-support-of-new-laws-meet-agri-minister-threatens-to-protest-if-repealed/story-QDUUi6NjjKqFwk13IsJTsL.html

Counting of votes to the 40 seats in the council, which administers four districts Kokrajhar, Chirang, Udalguri and Baksa collectively called Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), began at 8 am on Saturday and till 7:30 pm, the BPF candidates had won in 8 seats and were ahead in 9 others. Nine seats had been bagged by the UPPL and it was leading in 3 others. The BJP, which ran an aggressive campaign in the council polls for the first time, had won 7 seats and was leading in 3 others. Congress was leading in one seat. Voting for the BTC election had taken place in two phases on December 7 and December 10. The election is seen as a semi-final before the assembly polls due in the state in March-April next year. In 2015, the BPF had come to power for the third time in the BTC by winning 20 seats, Independent candidates had bagged 15 seats, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) bagged 4 and BJP had won one seat. Also read: Farmers’ leaders to go on hunger strike on Dec 14 as protests intensifyWith no party looking to cross the halfway mark of 20 seats on its own, the BTC could witness a coalition rule for the first time. Since the BJP and the BPF ran a bitter campaign against each other, there are indications that the saffron party could tie-up with the UPPL to come to power. Polling for 40 seats in the council, which comes under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, scheduled in April, was postponed due to Covid-19 and the area was placed under the Governor’s rule. Since its formation in 2003, the BTC had been governed by Hagrama Mohilary, a former rebel who now heads the BPF, a partner in the ruling coalition headed by the BJP with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as the third partner. But relations between the BJP and the BPF started souring after the BTC was placed under Governor’s rule. Both parties contested the BTC polls separately. The BPF had fielded candidates in 37 seats while the BJP contested in 26 and supported Independent candidates in the other seats. Apart from the BJP and the BPF, opposition Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which have a tie-up for the assembly polls, contested 20 seats. The UPPL contested all 40 seats and Gana Surakha Party (GSP) of Kokrajhar MP Nava Sarania fielded candidates in 35 seats. The BTC polls was the first election in Assam since the Covid-19 pandemic started and polling was conducted following all safety protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-way-race-among-bjp-bpf-and-uppl-to-wrest-control-of-bodoland-territorial-council/story-NNJMwZE9WoOAcEywLYIfWL.html

If that is not the case, both of them, mostly the women, approach the police,” Nayak was quoted saying by ANI.Nayak’s remarks come after the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report on ‘Crime in India’, released on September 29, which painted a grim picture of Chhattisgarh. The NCRB report said that of the 1,036 women raped, 683 were between the ages of 18-30 and in 96% cases, the accused were known to the survivors. In 473 rape cases, the accused was a live-in partner.The NCRB report also made special mention of domestic violence in its report and said it was the reason behind most of the crimes against women. “Majority of cases under crime against women under IPC were registered under ‘cruelty by husband or his relatives’,” the report stated.Nayak, who is also a Congress party leader, said women must be careful. “I would like to request you to adjudge your relationship and status first. If you enter into any such relationship, the result will always be bad” Nayak told ANI.Nayak, whose Twitter bio describes her as a Reiki grandmaster and the former mayor of Raipur amongst other things, compared the women’s commission’s role in settling domestic disputes to that of a counsellor. “Our efforts through the commission are to ensure that we settle as many domestic disputes as we can. For this, we often scold women and men, and try to convince them, in a way its counselling,” she saidShe asked young adult women to not fall into the trappings of a moviesque romance as it has the potential to ruin their and their family’s lives. “These days, there is a new trend that people prefer, to get married off at the age of 18. After a few years, when the couple has kids, they both find it difficult to survive,” she added.Chhattisgarh chief minister Baghel, on being asked about Nayak’s remarks, refused to comment but added they must have been made on the basis of her experience and data. “I would not like to make a comment on it. This is a constitutional post. If she has said anything then it must be on the basis of her experience and on the basis of the data.” he said to ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-rape-cases-lodged-after-relationships-go-sour-chhattisgarh-women-s-panel-chief/story-2a2Y8gjCaLWeUVnfCEhjjN.html
12-12-2020||India||Against involuntary methods of family planning, Centre tells SC||The Central government has submitted before the Supreme Court that it is against the involuntary methods of family planning for population control and added that Family Welfare Programme in India is voluntary in nature.The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in its affidavit filed on December 7, said the Family Welfare Programme in India is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt the family planning methods, best suited to them, according to their choice, without any compulsion.The affidavit was filed on a petition moved by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay to control the population explosion in India by introducing a population control law.In fact, the government said 2001-2011 witnessed the sharpest decline in decadal growth rate among Indians in 100 years, the Centre said in its affidavit.It said India was a signatory to the Programme Of Action (POA) of the International Conference on Population and Development, 1994, which was unequivocally against coercion in family planning.It added that international experience shows that “any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter-productive and leads to demographic distortions.” The government also explained that India had been witnessing a “constant decline” in the total fertility rate (TFR).The Central government referred to the Census statistics, according to which it said, “2001-2011 was the first decade in the last 100 years which had not only added lesser population as compared to the previous one, but also registered the sharpest decline in the decadal growth rate from 21.54 per cent in 1991-2001 to 17.64 per cent in 2001-2011”.The Total Fertility Rate, which was 3.2 at the time when National Population Policy 2000, was adopted has declined substantially to 2.2 as per the Sample Registration System of 2018.The government asserted that “the wanted fertility in India as per National Family Health Survey IV is only 1.8 as against the actual fertility of 2.2 prevailing at that time, indicating thereby that couples on an average do not want more than two children. Also, as many as 25 out of 36 States/UTs have already achieved the replacement level fertility of 2.1 or less.”It told the apex court that there is a National Health Policy (NHP) 2017, which provided for policy guidance to inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritise the role of the government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions. It added that the NHP sets out indicative, quantitative goals and objectives, which includes the achievement of TFR of 2.1 by 2025.The Centre also said public health is a state subject and it is of the view that the state must lead the process for health sector reforms in a suitable and sustainable manner to protect the common individual from health hazards.Earlier, the top court had sought Ministry’s response on the plea, which highlighted the problem of population explosion, terming the same as being more potent than a bomb explosion.“Population explosion is more dangerous than bomb explosion and without implementing effective population control measures, Healthy India, Literate India, Prosperous India, Resourceful India, Strong India, Secured India, Sensitive India, Clean India and Corruption and Crime-Free India campaign won’t succeed,” the plea said.The appeal was filed before the apex court after the Delhi High Court dismissed Upadhyay’s plea in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/against-involuntary-methods-of-family-planning-centre-tells-sc/story-8JoQb5AYrs3X5ti0R8TY1J.html

During the meeting, Chautala asserted that minimum support price (MSP), among the key demands of agitating farmers against the farm laws, will be ensured to each farmer as long as they are a part of the state government.Chautala also said that he is hopeful that the next round of talks between the Centre and the farmers will be held “in the next 24 to 48 hours” and will lead to a conclusive result. “The way Centre is holding talks, they also want a resolution of the issue,” he also said, according to news agency ANI. “It’s my responsibility as a representative of farmers to secure their rights. I discussed the matter with Union ministers, I’m hopeful that a way will be found with mutual consent and the standoff will be resolved. The Centre is positive,” ANI quoted Chautala as saying.The meeting comes as farmers have intensified their agitation against the farm reforms enacted in September. On Saturday, farmers blocked Delhi-Agra and Jaipur highways and held demonstrations at various places.While the government has assured the farmers over MSP, the agitating farmers are demanding an act for the scheme instead of a “written guarantee,” promised by the Union agriculture minister earlier. “We want MSP of all our produce including potatoes, sugarcane, grains, vegetables and milk. We don’t want this guarantee in written form but we want a law for MSP now,” ANI quoted Dungar Singh, a farm leader from Uttar Pradesh, as saying.Meanwhile, farmers announced they will hold a hunger strike on December 14 as they gave a call for nationwide agitation. They also announced to take out a tractor march on Sunday from Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan and said they will block the Jaipur-Delhi main road.The farmers are protesting the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopeful-centre-will-talk-to-farmers-in-next-24-to-48-hours-haryana-deputy-cm-after-meeting-agriculture-minister/story-Dg1IGTQcJlEZJpHMQBDiIK.html

Rescue operations are still underway with four more fire tenders rushed to the spot, apart from the four already present, they added.The blast inside Vindhya Organics was supposedly due to the explosion of a reactor, divisional fire officer V Srinivas said. “A solvent was kept for some reaction after which it caught fire,” news agency ANI quoted the police as saying.In the afternoon, Srinivas had told reporters that the situation inside the factory couldn’t be ascertained as it was difficult to enter premises. “We are making attempts to go in while dousing fire gradually,” Srinivas had said.Officials also evacuated workers from adjacent factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-workers-at-lunch-major-tragedy-averted-at-hyderabad-explosion-site-trs-legislator/story-KKkJtM8mvbKBlzKJpmafuK.html

It is unfortunate that if one disagrees with them they call them anti-nationals. Ministers giving such statements must apologise publicly. We condemn Centre’s attitude and such statements,” said the SAD chief.“It is unfortunate that Centre is trying to stifle the voices of the farmers, instead of listening to them. Farmers don’t want the farm laws. Why is Centre showing tyranny when the section of the society, for whom laws have been formed, doesn’t want it? I request the Prime Minister to listen to farmers,” he added.Badal said the farmers are not happy spending their nights in the streets in this fierce cold but are helpless, and added “it has been the policy of the central government that anyone who raises voice against them is defamed by being called anti-national.”The farmers’ agitation on the borders of Delhi, against the three farm laws passed by the Central government in the last monsoon session of Parliament, entered the 17th day today, with the farmers’ unions now threatening to block railway tracks.According to their earlier plan of blocking the Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Agra highway by December 12, more farmers are likely to join the protests on Friday. Police have stepped up vigil on the border areas to ensure the protesters cannot block highways.On Thursday, the Centre said channels for more talks are open. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to the protesters to stop their agitation as talks are still going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-who-called-farmers-khalistani-must-apologise-sukhbir-singh-badal/story-09E4j5vwixUqLB8yYhdOJL.html

The present YSRCP government has completely ruined the state’s economy and development has come to a grinding halt,” senior BJP leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh said, addressing party functionaries of the state through virtual mode.The temple town was chosen as the venue for the state executive committee meeting, keeping in mind the by-elections to Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, which has fallen vacant due to the sudden demise of YSRCP MP Balli Durgaprasada Rao due to Covid-19. The BJP has been consistently raising the issues concerning the Tirumala temple, including attempts to dispose of temple properties and diversion of TTD funds for other activities, etc.Raman Singh alleged that the YSRCP government had been hijacking the centrally funded schemes and claiming them as its own. “The state government is just renaming the central schemes and claiming credit for the same,” he said.He lashed out at the YSRCP for blaming it on the Centre for non-completion of projects like Polavaram, besides raking up non-issues like special category status to AP.Union minister and BJP in-charge of Andhra affairs V Muralidharan and several senior party leaders addressed the state executive committee meeting of the party at Tirupati.The state executive committee of the BJP discussed the strategy to be adopted by the party in the by-elections to Tirupati seat. The party also organised a Shobha Yatra in Tirupati town in the evening to put up a big show.A senior BJP leader said there was a clear political vacuum in Andhra Pradesh due to weakening of the Telugu Desam Party and the BJP could easily fill it and emerge as a potential force by 2024. “Hitherto, we had no opportunity to grow as a force in AP, as we had an alliance with TDP in 1999 and 2014. Now, we have a chance to grow independently,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-bjp-believes-there-s-opportunity-to-grow-independently-in-andhra/story-a2SRIbka5a42dNV91CmuRL.html

The district administration constituted a conciliation board under the new law, and the company agreed to purchase rice at the higer rate, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-agri-law-used-to-compel-firm-to-abide-by-contract-says-mp-govt/story-0ZkvWhQDo1XO9cosIMOCdM.html

The major projects she has done so far all have a strong Uttar Pradesh connect. “In my very first show ‘Kya Haal Mr Panchal’ I played a Meerut girl. In ‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay-2’ I played an NRI who had a UP origin. For Box Cricket League I was playing for Azamgarh Royals and my ongoing show ‘Prem Bandhan’ is again an UP-Bihar based show. Besides, I have styled for movie ‘Guns of Banaras’ shot in Varanasi. I guess maybe my looks, body language and accent goes well with portraying an UPite,” said the young actor. Talking about her UP connect Ariah said, “My mother (Beena Agarwal) hails from the state capital and used to work in Doordarshan as a producer. My parents were working in Luknow and then we shifted to Mumbai where I completed my studies. My relatives still live here and we come down frequently.” Ariah switched from the field of fashion to acting. “After my course in fashion designing from Singapore, I joined Bollywood as a stylist and did lot of films, ads and web content. I was styling for a TV show for the first time where I was asked to audition. And luckily got the show ‘…Mr Panchal’.” In her current show, Ariah plays a negative role for the first time. “It’s thrilling to play what you are not. Playing a negative role is challenging and fun.” Her elder brother Ayush Agarwal is an actor-producer and has played Mohit in ‘Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai.’ He has worked in a couple of films too. “He too was surprised when I cleared the audition and started shooting in a week. Probably, my working as a stylist in the industry helped me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-thrilling-to-play-what-you-are-not/story-o5AjZXGCpb34E5ekWCB8bO.html

I can’t give up on life for career! Each has its own importance, so I have been choosy in taking up projects that demand leaving home and family for a long time,” said the ‘Balika Vadhu’ actor. Talking about her journey, Neha said, “My early days were like that of any other Marwari family girl but learning classical Indian dance changed me a lot in terms of getting right exposure. I enrolled for ‘Boogie Woogie’ from my hometown Kolkata and won three seasons of the dance show till I was banned to participate (laughs). Then, I got a show where my acting skills were bashed in media and I cried over it for months. My mother gave me all strength to stand up again and resume work.” Neha has played strong women characters throughout her career. “It was never a planned move to take up shows like ‘Balika…’ or ‘Doli Armaano Ki’ where women characters were seen taking a stand and fighting for their rights. Thankfully, these shows worked brilliantly but the sad part is that the condition of young women in our society is no good and violence against them has intensified over the years,” she said.Neha has been married over eight years and visits Varanasi-based in-laws frequently. “I love my spiritual connect with the city. I have got so much love and affection there that now, I feel, I wholly belong to Benaras,” said Neha who will next be seen in the show ‘Kyun Rishton Main Katti Batti’ playing strong-willed mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/violence-against-women-has-intensified-over-the-years/story-WmdA9iryozct4Wk2vA1uzN.html

We must work for it. The real stakeholder is the voter and they’ll contribute to it,” Dhankhar said, according to news agency ANI. In an apparent swipe at the ruling Trinamool Congress, Dhankhar also said, “I am concerned when unauthorised people take control of political power without legal authority. It is then I make an appeal, sanitise power corridors of intruders. Otherwise, whoever does politics, is their lookout, not mine.”On Friday, Dhankhar had submitted a report to the Centre over the “extremely disturbing developments that do not augur well for democratic values.” He alleged that violators of law in the state have the protection of police and administration.The law-and-order situation in the state has been a matter of concern for quite some time and the subject has come to spotlight again following an attack on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) convoy that included the party’s national president JP Nadda, who was on a two-day visit to the state in view of the upcoming assembly elections.The BJP has blamed chief minister Mamata Banerjee led-TMC for the attack on its convoy in South 24 Parganas district on Thursday. Several BJP workers and frontline leaders sustained injuries, the party also alleged.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) later summoned the state’s chief secretary and police chief to New Delhi on Monday over the law-and-order situation in the state. However, the ministry was informed about the top bureaucrats’ refusal to appear before it through a letter.Earlier on Saturday, MHA also called three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers responsible for Nadda’s security back on central deputation from West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanitise-power-corridors-of-intruders-west-bengal-governor-appeals-ahead-of-2021-polls/story-gFagNmt298OVawIWcmmMqL.html
12-12-2020||India||‘Like protests in Delhi’: Amaravati farmers’ plan against 3-capital move||Inspired by tens of thousands of farmers gathered at several points on Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh protesting against the three agricultural marketing reform laws, the farmers of Amaravati, the present capital city of Andhra Pradesh, are planning to intensify their agitation against three-capital plan of the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Starting Saturday, the farmers, under the umbrella of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi joint action committee, launched a six-day long agitation, which would culminate in a massive public meeting on December 17 at Uddandarayunipalem village, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid foundation stone for Amaravati on October 22, 2015. The public meeting marks the completion of one-year of agitation by Amaravati farmers, as it was on this day last year that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy announced the formation of three capitals for Andhra Pradesh in the state assembly. “After the public meeting, we shall come out with a concrete action plan to mount pressure on the Jagan government to drop the three-capital plan,” JAC convenor A Siva Reddy told Hindustan Times. Reddy hinted that the farmers of Amaravati would take out rallies and block the national highways. “Our movement will be on the lines of ongoing farmers’ agitation in Delhi. How we shall go about it shall be decided after the December 17 meeting,” he said. On Saturday, more than 5,000 farmers took out a silent padayatra (foot march) from Shubham Function Hall to Dr BR Ambedkar statue in Guntur town highlighting their demand for retention of Amaravati as the state capital. On December 14, the JAC would hold a “Kisan Sammelan,” where the farmers would come out with a charter of demands. This would be followed by another silent padayatra in Vijayawada city on December 15. “It is a do-or-die battle for us. In the last one year, the Jagan government has used all tactics to crush the Amaravati protection movement. Hundreds of farmers were booked in false cases, arrested, hand-cuffed and physically assaulted. What is worse, the government itself is instigating counter-agitation by paid artists from other regions in support of three capitals,” the JAC leader said. Several opposition parties, including Telugu Desam Party, the Congress, Jana Sena, CPI and CPI (M) have extended their support to the week-long agitation of the Amaravati farmers. TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu called upon the party cadre to take part in the week-long agitation of farmers. “They have sacrificed 34,000 acres of land for the construction of a world-class capital city at Amaravati. Their sacrifices should not go to waste,” Naidu said. He asked the TDP cadres to explain to the people how the YSRCP government had ruined Amaravati project and stalled the development completely. “We shall stand by the farmers who are putting up a spirited fight for the capital,” he said. Meanwhile, the state high court has been continuously hearing over 90 petitions filed by JAC and other individuals challenging the legislations enacted by the state government to abolish AP Capital Region Development Authority and formation of three capitals. “The hearings are expected to be completed in January and we are hopeful of getting a favourable judgment by then. Under any circumstances, we shall fight till the end to see that Amaravati is retained as the capital of Andhra Pradesh,” the JAC convenor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-protests-in-delhi-amaravati-farmers-plan-against-3-capital-move/story-snkcMqV0OZ3z7TnQa4G77L.html
12-12-2020||India||Not accountable to home minister: TMC hits out on summons over JP Nadda’s convoy attack||Senior Trinamool Congress lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday, saying that West Bengal’s chief secretary and director-general of police were summoned to Delhi over the attack on BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy with “political motive”, asserting that law and order is a state subject.Banerjee, the chief whip of the TMC in the Lok Sabha, alleged that the Centre was resorting to coercive means to intimidate the state administration, and the top officials were summoned at the instance of the Union Home Minister.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, however, said that everyone saw how Nadda’s convoy was attacked by alleged TMC workers on December 10 and Banerjee’s letter to Bhalla has “little merit”.“We want to inform you that law and order is within the domain of the state under 7th Schedule of the State list.... How in respect of the law and order situation you can call both the officers for any sorts of discussion?” the TMC MP said in the letter.“It appears that with a political motive and at the instance of your minister, who is a political person belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party, you have issued the said letter.You are trying to coerce the officers of West Bengal with political vindictiveness. It appears you are interfering with the federal structure,” Banerjee added.He said that in respect of law and order, the state government is accountable to the legislative assembly “but not to you or to your home minister”.The TMC leader also claimed that a person, who is a convict in a case and named in 59 other criminal cases, was in the convoy of Nadda on December 10 and “made provocative gestures” to the TMC supporters standing on the roadside.“Laws have been thrown out in river by your action at the instance of Shri Amit Shah, BJP leader and Union Home Minister,” the lawmaker said, adding that indirect attempts were being made to impose emergency in West Bengal.Banerjee said that with Parliament not in session, he was voicing strong opposition to the move by the Centre through the letter on behalf of his party.In response to the letter, Vijayvargiya said, “Everyone saw what happened on December 10, how the convoy was attacked by TMC men.” “There is little merit in Kalyan Banerjee’s letter.His comments don’t have any significance to us,” the BJP’s Bengal minder told reporters at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district.The MHA had on Friday summoned Chief Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra asking them to present themselves on December 14 for an explanation on the law and order situation in the state, following Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s report on the attack on Nadda’s convoy by alleged supporters of the ruling TMC in South 24 Parganas district on December 10.The chief secretary wrote to the Union home secretary, saying that he has been directed to request to “dispense with the presence of the state officials” in the meeting convened on December 14.Nadda’s convoy was pelted with stones by alleged TMC activists when he was going to attend a party programme at Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency on December 10.Though Nadda, who was in a bullet-proof vehicle, was unharmed, several BJP leaders including Vijayvargiya Vijayvargiya suffered injuries in the attack, the party claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-accountable-to-home-minister-tmc-hits-out-on-summons-over-nadda-s-convoy-attack/story-E9kqnjIMmwuJMFuY1ZSFkL.html
12-12-2020||India||India’s active Covid cases drop below 3,60,000. Lowest in 146 days||India’s Covid-19 recoveries have outnumbered new cases over the past fortnight, which has led to the number of patients with current infection dropping below 3,60,000 as on Friday, according to data from the ministry of health. This is the lowest number of active cases in 146 days since July 17, when just over 359,000 active cases were recorded. The decline is being mimicked by the six states that have been contributing the highest number of cases to the country’s total. Maharashtra, which had the highest burden of the disease, also showed the highest decline in the number of daily cases being reported. The seven-day rolling average of new cases reported reduced from 21,982 in mid-September to 4,596 as on December 10. Delhi, on the other hand, saw an increase from 4,156 cases in mid-September to a peak in November and then a decline to a seven-day rolling average of 3,036 new cases a day as on December 10. Not only has there been a decline in the number of cases, the number of deaths due to the viral infection across the country has been fewer than 500 for seven days in a row. At its peak, the total number of deaths being reported across India in a day had touched over 1,200 deaths in September. There were 442 deaths due to the infection on Friday, with 78% of these deaths being reported from 10 states and union territories. Maharashtra accounted for almost 20% of the total, with 87 deaths reported on Friday. This was followed by Delhi with 60 deaths and West Bengal with 50 deaths. The data from the health ministry also showed that only 10 states and union territories recorded 74% of the new cases reported on Friday. Kerala had the highest number of cases with 4,748, followed by West Bengal with 2873 cases and Maharashtra with 2,778 cases. “The number of cases is on the decline across the country. However, no one can say whether there would be another peak in cases or not; we still do not know everything about Sars-CoV-2. We do not know whether herd immunity through natural infection works,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at Indian Council of Medical Research. “Countries like Spain, where it felt like almost everyone had been exposed to the infection, still had another peak of the infection. From a study in Iceland, we know that the antibodies reduce and become undetectable over time. Only after the vaccine becomes available will the virus start behaving in a predictable pattern,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-active-covid-cases-drop-below-3-60-000-lowest-in-150-days/story-QTjbpZtkVSCxasV0vutoTN.html

The PIL, filed under Article 226, seeks the court’s intervention to pass necessary directives with regard to “illegal taxation” collected by various government departments, Naga political groups etc. The petition mentioned that a representation dated November 25, 2020, was sent to the respondents for necessary action, but till date, no action was taken to resolve the public grievances highlighted in the representation.The petitioners maintained they were not challenging the Goods & Services Tax or any other tax imposed legally in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. However, they stated the menace of “illegal taxation” prevailing in the state was creating fear and resentment amongst the business community and the public, thus violating the fundamental rights of the people to live with dignity, to live without fear, freedom to profess any profession and the right to equality and equal protection of law guaranteed by the constitution as well as by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Also read: On Ladakh standoff with China, Jaishankar says ‘India being tested’On Friday, a two-judge bench of the Gauhati High Court in an order served notices on the respondents, returnable within five weeks. While the senior government advocate accepted the notice on behalf of all the respondents, the petitioners were asked to take steps to serve notice to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes within three days.Friday being the last working day of the court, the matter is to be listed again after the winter vacation.When contacted, consumer rights activist and ACAUT legal cell convener, advocate Kezhokhoto Savi said the three organizations had filed the PIL due to rampant taxation by both government and non-governmental bodies.“For example, there is a standing government order on closure of all tax booths at check gates since 2017, but unauthorised tax collections are still continuing in those places,” Savi said. With the matter being listed for further hearing, he was hopeful for a positive outcome which would help the public at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-issues-notice-to-nagaland-government-on-illegal-taxation/story-gr5K9BRQ2nHHGvxLRa988I.html

I have every confidence we will rise to the occasion and meet the national security challenge. But beyond that, at this time, I would really frankly keep my own counsel,” the Union minister said during an interactive session at the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).Also Watch | ‘Events along LAC very disturbing…’: Jaishankar on border standoff with China Jaishankar called the events along the LAC very disturbing that have raised some very “basic concerns’’, adding “what has happened in eastern Ladakh was not actually in China’s interest as it has significantly impacted public sentiment in India.”Recalling the ties between India and China when he was younger and how the relationship has evolved over the years, Jaishankar said, “Professionally, I have seen the evolution of how the Indian public feels about China over the last many decades and I am old enough to remember much more difficult days, especially in my childhood and in my teens,” he said.”The minister expressed concern over the future of bilateral ties between the two countries and said the events of this year have not helped at all. “In fact, I think the real danger is that the goodwill which was so carefully developed will dissipate,” he added.When asked about when India and China are likely to arrive at a resolution, Jaishankar said, “I would not go into the prediction zone at all whether it is going to be easy or not, and what will be the timelines and so on.”For almost eight months now, the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a tense border standoff in the Ladakh region with no breakthrough yet despite multiple rounds of discussions between top authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-ladakh-standoff-with-china-jaishankar-says-india-being-tested-will-meet-national-security-challenge/story-4pIZlEnWfeYiBloLIt4e3O.html

Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin and a host of celebrities from the film fraternity, industrialists, and cricketers shared their photos with the star, who is set to launch his political party in January ahead of the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in early 2021. All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) party coordinator and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam wished Rajinikanth a day earlier on Friday evening. Following Rajinikanth’s announcement of a political foray, Panneerselvam had said that there are possibilities of an alliance, but AIADMK leaders quickly distanced themselves from his comment, saying that it was his personal opinion. Several fans gathered in front of the actor’s house in Chennai dressing up as Rajinikanth lookalikes and wearing shirts with his image. A political extension of his fan club, Rajini Makkal Mandram, which engages in party work, will partake in charity work on his birthday as they do annually.Rajinikanth’s political debut is set to bring a new dimension into Tamil Nadu’s politics which has been dominated by the DMK and the AIADMK. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is playing all its cards to make its presence felt in the state where it is an AIADMK ally and has favoured Rajinikanth. Also in the fray is Rajinikanth’s contemporary Kamal Haasan, whose Makkal Needhi Maiam comes with an experience of contesting the 2019 parliamentary elections. In the last three days, Rajinikanth held consultations with Tamilaruvi Manian, the supervisor for the yet to be launched party, and R Arjunamurthy, who was made party coordinator after he recently quit the BJP.“We discussed how to strengthen the party at the ground level,” said Manian. Rajinikanth will leave for Hyderabad where shooting resumes on December 15 for his upcoming film “Annatthe”, produced by Karunanidhi’s grandnephew Kalanidhi Maran. “I’ve made a commitment and I’ve 40% shooting left to be completed,” Rajinikanth had said earlier. He will return to the city to announce on December 31 the date of his party’s launch. The Tamil actor’s cult following transcends borders with a fan base across the world who have waited for him to make the political plunge for decades.

12-12-2020||India||Farmer agitation no longer remains farmers’ movement; infiltrated by Leftist, Maoist elements: Piyush Goyal||As the farmers’ protest against new farm laws entered its 17th day, Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said the agitation no longer remains a farmers’ movement as it has been “infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements” demanding the release of those put behind bars for “anti-national activities”. This, he said, was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government. Goyal, however, did not say if the government had or is planning to take any action against any person belonging to banned outfits seen at the protests. “We now realise that the so-called farmer agitation hardly remains a farmers’ agitation. It has almost got infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements, a flavour of which we saw over the last two days when there were extraneous demands to release people who have been put behind bars for anti-national (and) who have been put behind bars for illegal activities,” Goyal, the Minister for Railways, Commerce and Industry and Food and Consumers Affairs, said at FICCI’s annual meeting.Also Read | Farmers’ stir: Forces deployed to deal with anti-social elements, says UP ADGThe demands being raised on a farmers’ platform to release so-called intellectuals and poets clearly demonstrate that the effort to derail farm law improvements is probably in the hands of certain elements who are not good for India, he said. “I would urge all well-meaning business leaders and all well-meaning intellectuals who are involved with Ficci, who are on this webcast, to talk about the benefits of these farm laws, to understand the law. Should you have any apprehension, please talk to us,” Goyal said. The minister assured that these laws are for the benefit of nearly 100 million farmers across the country. He said this is a government that has been committed to farmer welfare, which has almost doubled procurement under minimum support price or MSP, which is “wrongly sought to be portrayed as being under danger”. “This is a government that has ensured that farmers get 50 per cent over their cost of production. “This is a government that has increased the agricultural budget nearly six times, never before increased to today nearly USD 20 billion, Rs 1.34 lakh crore invested in the agricultural sector,” said the minister. Goyal urged industry leaders to educate the farmers in their sphere of influence. He urged them to “explain the benefits, explain how these laws without...in any way touching the past systems, open up new opportunities to do trade and commerce and business for our farmers so that they can go in for more investment”.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Several Delhi borders closed as stir intensifies Explain them how these reforms will spur investment in rural India, there will be R&D, more opportunities for value addition and, therefore, farmers can increase their income, Goyal urged industry leaders. Responding to Goyal’s comments, Former Ficci president and Vice-Chairman of Bharti Enterprises Rajan Bharti Mittal said, “Clearly, you can see when you do the tough reforms like the farm bills, please don’t step back. The industry will back you up.” Besides, talking about reducing compliance burdens, Goyal said efforts were on to create the first genuine single-window system in terms of compliances, ease of approval process. “We intend to come up with a much easier process to meet with compliances, while simultaneously working across ministries to see if we can reduce the burden of compliances,” he added. Speaking about the proposed Brand India initiative, the minister said it is an idea where the government and the industry will partner with each other and develop both on the Make in India side and overall Brand India side. “We are also looking at branding India. It is time now that India demonstrates to the world its leadership position and commitment of quality,” said the minister. He observed that under the Brand India initiative, consumers both in India and internationally will be educated about products which are made in India. “We are pushing all industries to certify the Make in India products,” Goyal added. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked tirelessly and inspired the nation with his vision, simplicity and courage to think beyond the past limitations and willingness to embrace change. The minister said the government will identify areas where the country has competitive and comparative advantages, where we can become global players and contribute to global trade in a bigger way. Observing that the tyre and rubber industry can become a great business leader in the years to come, he said the Centre will encourage rubber plantation through the support of private investment and give adequate support to the tyre industry so that it can grow and flourish. “We have identified another 24 sectors on which work is going on by industry leaders who are working together to come up with actionable agenda to add nearly 200 lakh crores worth of manufacturing in India in the next 10 years,” Goyal said. Describing start-ups as the backbone of the New India, Goyal said start-ups and their ecosystem are encouraging innovation and promoting young entrepreneurs. He urged the industry to support start-ups by providing them financial support, hand-holding, opportunities and mentorship. Referring to Aatmanirbhar Bharat, he emphasised that “we are not at all suggesting that we are anti-imports”, and that it is about India improving its quality and scale of production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-agitation-no-longer-remains-farmers-movement-infiltrated-by-leftist-maoist-elements-piyush-goyal/story-d5nuSF9TCps1ayKAFlM0nI.html
12-12-2020||India||China faces ‘real danger’ of losing goodwill created by decades of good ties: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday refused to set a timeframe for resolving the border standoff in the Ladakh sector but said China faces the “real danger” of losing the goodwill created by positive relations with India in recent decades. Jaishankar’s remarks, made during an online interaction organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), came a day after the external affairs ministry blamed China for tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and called on the Chinese side to deliver on promises about abiding by border agreements and settling the boundary issue through talks. “I wouldn’t get into the prediction zone at all, whether it is going to be easy or not, and what will be the timelines and so on,” he said in response to a question on whether India is in for the long haul in the border standoff or a breakthrough is expected. Jaishankar described this year’s events along the LAC as “very disturbing”, and said they had raised “very basic concerns”. These events occurred because China “has not abided by agreements that we have had with them about respecting and observing the LAC and not bringing forces to the LAC”, he said. He added, “I think a lot of work had gone into the relationship on both sides. And I don’t believe the events of this year have helped at all. In fact, I think the real danger is that the goodwill, which was so carefully developed, will dissipate.” Jaishankar likened China’s actions to a “very substantial” violation of the terms of a contract, and said such moves were not “in the interests of China, because what it has done...has significantly impacted public sentiment”. Acknowledging that India is being “tested” by events along the LAC, he said: “I have every confidence that we will rise to the occasion, we will meet that national security challenge. But beyond that at this time, I would really keep my own counsel.” On Wednesday, Jaishankar had said that China has offered “five differing explanations” for deploying thousands of soldiers on the LAC and pushing bilateral ties into their most difficult phase ever. A day later, China’s foreign ministry said responsibility for the situation “totally lies with the Indian side” but this was rejected by the external affairs ministry. The two countries haven’t been able to push ahead with disengagement at friction points on the LAC despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, and tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the winter in Ladakh sector. Asked whether India’s relations with the US would change under the Joe Biden administration, Jaishankar said: “Today the relationship is at such a different level, that the only place for it to go is up.” Much will depend on where India stands in the US’s priorities such as security and trade, but New Delhi is now doing more on global issues and challenges such as climate change, he said. Talking about India’s efforts to reach a trade deal with the Donald Trump administration, Jaishankar said there were “fairly serious negotiations” between the two sides on resolving outstanding trade issues and differences. “For a variety of reasons, [the US] didn’t close it out. I can tell you on our side, we were dead serious. We wanted to deal with those issues because we thought there was something much bigger that was in store for the relationship,” he added. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said Jaishankar’s remarks about not predicting the resolution of the standoff mirrored recent comments by defence minister Rajnath Singh. “The big question for Indian diplomacy in 2021 is what path the relationship with China will take. Over the next six months, will it be status quo on the LAC or will there be a functional resolution? Clearly, no one is betting on things going back to where they were in April 2020,” he said. “In Delhi’s view, it will all depend on how Beijing takes things forward,” Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-faces-real-danger-of-losing-goodwill-created-by-decades-of-good-ties-jaishankar/story-45GSuHU540d6W9Npm0hlpK.html
12-12-2020||India||Farmers’ stir: Forces deployed to deal with anti-social elements, says UP ADG||Prashant Kumar, Additional Director General (ADG) of Law and Order in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday assured that adequate security arrangements have been made to deal with anti-social elements amid farmers’ protest. “We have deployed forces to check that no anti-social elements or miscreants join the protest. We are taking measures to see that public movement is not affected. We are ensuring that anti-social elements, who are trying to create trouble, are being dealt with,” said ADG Kumar told ANI.Further talking about the ongoing protest, the UP ADG said, “...So far the farmers’ protest has remained mainly peaceful. Even during the Bharat Bandh, everything remained well organised. Now the talks are underway with the farmers regarding the farm laws. With the arrival of Agriculture reforms, no farmers from UP or any other part of the country will face any trouble.”Issuing warning about the miscreants joining the protests, ADG Kumar said the UP police has informed farmers about the possibility of miscreants amid the protest. “And we have made police arrangement for the same. We have deployed as many as 130 company force,” he added.Meanwhile, traffic movement continued as usual across toll plazas in Agra district on Saturday amid farmers’ call to block Agra-Delhi Expressway to protest against the farm laws.“There are five major toll plazas here and we have no information of any one of them being blocked by farmers. We are monitoring the plazas as well,” Satyajeet Gupta, Assistant Superintendent of Police (West) Agra told ANI.Farmers have been protesting in and around the national capital since November 26 against three newly enacted farm laws. Farmers’ unions have so far held six rounds of talks with the government.After rejecting the Centre’s proposal to amend the recently enacted farm laws, the agitating leaders said that they would intensify their agitation by blocking railway tracks to put pressure on the government to repeal the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-forces-deployed-to-deal-with-anti-social-elements-up-adg/story-HGlllNVPpaUp0wvARltl4M.html
12-12-2020||India||After over 2 years, senior leader Ghanshyam Tiwari back in BJP||More than two years after resigning from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), senior leader Ghanshyam Tiwari returned to the party in Jaipur on Saturday. On June 22, 2018, Tiwari and his son Akhilesh floated a political outfit named “Bharat Vahini Party” to contest the assembly polls in Rajasthan later that year. Tiwari had joined hands with the Congress ahead of Lok Sabha elections in 2019. After joining party in presence of senior BJP leaders in Jaipur, Tiwari said: “After a long time I am getting a chance to speak from the platform. I thank the party leadership, which considered my letter to join the party.” He said that he is completely committed to the party’s ideology and never took the Congress party’s membership. Earlier, state party president Satish Poonia said that Tiwari joining the BJP is not an exception. “Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh, Babu Lal Marandi too had joined back after leaving the BJP. They had left the party for some reasons and have joined back,” he said. Reacting to Tiwari returning to the BJP, state Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said: “It was his (Tiwari) wish to extend support to Congress (in the 2019 elections), saying that he didn’t get enough respect from party and we welcomed him. He would know better why did he joined the BJP again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-over-2-years-senior-leader-ghanshyam-tiwari-back-in-bjp/story-a0PuLrxmbJetN2WOcOQa9M.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trailing with three seats only. As per the counting till 3pm, the UPPL has secured a lead on 21 seats, while the BPF is ahead on 10. Congress has grabbed one seat so far.The BPF has fielded candidates in 37 seats while BJP is contesting 26 and supporting Independent candidates in the other seats. Apart from the BJP and BPF, opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which have a tie-up for the assembly polls, are contesting 20 seats. The election for the 40 seats was held in two rounds of polling as 23,87,422 voters exercised their franchise to elect their representatives. Assembly polls in Assam are due in March-April next year and the BTC elections are being viewed as a semi-final contest among the parties prior to that.Since the coronavirus pandemic began in March, this was the first election to be held in Assam. The polls were scheduled to be held in April but were postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic. Subsequently, all the four districts under BTC were placed under governor’s rule. Since its formation in 2003, BTC had been governed by Hagrama Mohilary, a former rebel who now heads the BPF, a partner in the ruling coalition headed by the BJP with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as the third partner. But relations between the BJP and BPF started souring after BTC was placed under governor’s rule. Both parties are now contesting the BTC polls separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodoland-territorial-council-polls-uppl-bpf-in-close-fight-as-counting-of-votes-is-underway/story-7qaR14pd5bh90UgPBYYIeP.html
12-12-2020||India||HC directs Tamil Nadu CB-CID to trace ‘missing’ 103 kg gold in CBI case||The Madras High Court has directed the Tamil Nadu Crime Branch-CID police to probe into ‘missing’ 103 kg gold, which was seized by CBI in a raid from an importer here.The gold is part of 400.47 kg in bullion and ornaments confiscated by the CBI when it carried out searches at the office of Surana Corporation Ltd in Chennai in 2012.Justice P N Prakash on Friday directed the CB-CID to conduct an inquiry by an officer in the rank of superintendent of police to be completed in six months, while rejecting the CBI’s submission that its prestige would “go down” if the investigation was carried out by local police. The matter relates to a petition filed by the liquidator of Surana Corporation Ltd, seeking a direction to CBI to handover the remaining 103.864 kg gold.The yellow metal was kept in the safes and vaults of Surana Corporation Ltd under the CBI’s lock and seal.When the matter came up, the judge said, “This court cannot subscribe to this view because the law does not sanction such an inference. All policemen must be trusted, and it does not lie in the mouth of one to say that CBI have special horns, whereas, local police have only a tail.” The judge further observed that it may be an Agni pariksha (test by fire) for the central agency. “But that cannot be helped. If their hands are clean like Sita (wife of Ram in the epic Ramayanam), they may come out brighter. If not, they would have to face the music,” the judge said.The central agency submitted that it had handed over the 72 keys of the safes and vaults to the Chennai principal special court for CBI cases. During the seizure, the gold bars were weighed all- together but while handing over to the liquidator, appointed for a settlement of debts between Surana and SBI, it was weighed individually and that was the reason for the discrepancy, the CBI claimed.While prosecuting the case, the CBI accused officials of Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) of showing undue favour to Surana in importing gold and silver.Subsequently, the CBI came to the conclusion that the gold did not have a bearing on a corruption case, and that it had, however, been imported in violation of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP). Hence, a separate case was registered in 2013, and the seized gold was transferred to the file of the new case.Later, the CBI concluded the probe and filed a closure report, holding that the accused had not committed any offence, but, by issuing the nominated agency certificate to Surana, had violated certain circulars, for which departmental action was recommended against some officials.The agency also requested the special court to transfer the gold to the office of the director-general of foreign trade (DGFT) as the ownership of the gold was subject to the outcome of the departmental inquiry.Aggrieved, Surana challenged the transfer of gold to DGFT. Meanwhile, the SBI moved the National Company Law Tribunal seeking a direction the central agency to handover the gold to the bank as directed the special CB on December 27, 2019, the NCLT rejected the Union Commerce Ministry’s request for the gold and ordered that it be handed over to the liquidator in the presence of officials of all loanee banks.Accordingly, the CBI along with representatives of all banks and those from Surana broke open the seals of the vault and took inventory of the gold between February 27 and 29 this year and found that there was only 296.606 kg of gold.Subsequently, the liquidator approached the high court seeking a direction to the central agency to handover the remaining gold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-directs-tamil-nadu-cb-cid-to-trace-missing-103-kg-gold-in-cbi-case/story-meODT140nqlPhEUxpOWjcL.html

In his two-page letter Bandopadhyay wrote, “While further reports are being obtained and compiled, in the circumstances, I am directed to request you to kindly dispense with the presence of the State officials in the meeting, considering that the State Government is already addressing this issue with utmost seriousness.”As the row over the attack and the law-and-order situation in Bengal intensifies, Union home minister Amit Shah is planning a trip to the poll-bound state next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-calls-3-ips-officers-responsible-for-jp-nadda-s-security-back-on-central-deputation-from-bengal/story-Kq0l3AxxqVxkIYylsxuhiM.html

PM Modi, without directly referring to the farmers’ agitation, said agriculture reforms as part of government efforts are aimed at removing roadblocks, and the new laws will also bring in technology and investment in the sector. The government, he said, is committed to protecting the interest and welfare of farmers through its policies and actions.ALSO WATCH | More farmers head to Delhi from Haryana, Punjab; block toll plazas | Updates “Reforms will help draw investment in the agriculture sector and benefit farmers.

While mandis are being modernised, the digital platform is also available to farmers to buy and sell their produce. These efforts are aimed at raising incomes of farmers,” he said. “All these efforts are directed towards improving the farmers’ income so that they become prosperous. When farmers prosper, the country will prosper.”Security arrangementsA senior police officer said there has been no protest yet on Delhi’s borders with Gurgaon and at other points of National Highway-8 that connects the national capital with Jaipur. “So far, there is no protest at Delhi-Gurgaon border. There is no disruption in traffic movement. However, we have proper security arrangements in place to deal with any situation,” the officer said, according to news agency PTI.The increase in security arrangement comes as thousands of farmers have been protesting at various areas on Delhi’s borders for the last 17 days and demanding that the legislation be withdrawn. The police have said they have made adequate arrangements, including multi-layered barricading and deployment of personnel. Officials have said that measures have also been taken to ensure commuters do not face inconvenience at places where protest are being staged.Also read | How many sacrifices will farmers have to make, asks Rahul GandhiThe developments come after farmer leaders on Wednesday rejected a government proposal to amend the new agricultural laws and announced they would intensify their agitation by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Yamuna expressway by Saturday.Social activist Yogendra Yadav, who is part of the ongoing protests, said farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana are assembling on Saturday and their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march would begin on Sunday. “Farmers’ ‘Delhi march’ on Jaipur-Delhi highway will not start today and it will begin from Shahjahanpur border tomorrow.

They informed commuters about the closure of several borders and suggested that motorists take alternative routes. “The chilla & Gazipur borders are closed for traffic from Noida & Gaziabad to Delhi due to farmers protests. People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara & bhopra borders. Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari & Mangesh borders are closed.

Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders *Jharoda (Only Single Carriageway/Road), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders,” it added.Hundreds of farmers from states like Punjab and Haryana have blocked some of the highways leading to Delhi borders for more than two weeks now against the new farm laws which they fear will prompt the government to stop making direct crop purchases at minimum state-set prices or minimum support price (MSP). They have vowed to expand their protests across the country until the government scraps the new farm laws. The government has so far refused to heed to their demand but has promised to continue the MSP-based procurement.The three new laws remove restrictions on marketing farm products and allow cultivators to engage with private companies to sell their crops. The government says this allows farmers an alternate avenue to sell crops, raising their income and is aimed at making farming more competitive.The government had asked farmer groups to consider its proposals for amending the laws to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want. Farmers leaders on Thursday also announced they would block railway tracks across the country if their demands were not met by the government and would announce a date for that soon.The Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have taken part in at least five rounds of formal talks, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farmers’ union leaders, scheduled to be held on Wednesday morning, was cancelled.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-stepped-up-at-delhi-borders-as-farmers-protests-intensify/story-Wg64F0dIoPjRXGYwLLsvlI.html
12-12-2020||India||Pawar’s detractors in Congress conspired twice to deny him PM’s chair: Patel||NCP chief Sharad Pawar had two opportunities to become the Prime Minister of India but his detractors in the Congress party denied him the same, NCP leader Praful Patel has written in an article on the occasion of the 80th birthday of the NCP chief.The article was published by Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamna, on Saturday.“After Rajiv Gandhi’s unfortunate death during the Lok Sabha elections in 1991, the Congress party was in a state of shock. There was a demand to make Pawar party president to handle the situation but some drawing room politicians conspired to block this. They did not want a strong leadership for the party and hence made P V Narsimha Rao the Congress president,” Patel has written.ALSO WATCH | ‘Congress weak’: Sanjay Raut says will support Sharad Pawar for UPA chief post “After the results of Lok Sabha elections, Congress was close to winning a majority (in Parliament) and again there was demand to choose Pawar as prime minister. However, the same people got together and misused Sonia Gandhi’s name to make Rao prime minister,” Patel says in the article.“There has been a conspiracy against Pawar since 1989 when he was the chief minister of Maharashtra. I have witnessed how conspiracies were hatched against him in Delhi. I have seen how he lost the prime ministership when he was within a striking distance from the same,” Patel writes.He has also claimed that Rao was prejudiced against Pawar when the former was the prime minister.Later in 1996 Lok Sabha elections, Congress lost the elections. Patel says there could have been an opportunity for Pawar to get to the top office since there was a fractured mandate. “The Congress could win 145 seats. H D Deve Gowda, Mulayam Singh Yadav and leaders of the Left had shown willingness to be part of the government if Pawar replaced Rao as Congress nominee for prime ministership. Rao was not willing and as such Congress had to extend outside support to Deve Gowda,” Patel has claimed.Also Read: Sharad Pawar turns 80, Uddhav govt pays tribute with rural scheme launchLater in 1997, then Congress president Sitaram Kesari withdrew support from the Deve Gowda government. “125 Congress MPs had gathered at Pawar’s residence and extended their support to him but Pawar chose not to take any step to prevent a split in the Congress. It was the second time when he lost an opportunity to get the prime ministership,” Patel stated.Patel alleges that Pawar’s targeting by his detractors (in Congress) continued, leading him to float his separate party.The Congress is yet to officially react to Patel’s allegations.Also Read: Opposition must come together, strengthen UPA, says Sena’s RautA senior Congress leader and former Union minister said: “In 1991, party top brass wanted a nominee who had experience of handling central government portfolios. Rao and Arjun Singh were the front runners. As such Rao was chosen. Pawar had returned to the Congress just a few years ago so the top brass was not comfortable with him. Besides, they also considered the fact that the majority of newly elected MPs of the party were from the south.”The Congress leader also reasoned why Pawar was left out even in 1996. “In 1996, Congress lost the election and third front parties had more MPs than us so the party decided to respect the mandate and support Deve Gowda,” the leader said, without wanting to be named because the party has not officially reacted yet.Significantly, veteran Congress leader Ulhas Pawar, in another article, has surmised that Pawar would have reached the highest positions within the party had he continued with the Congress. He has also appealed to Pawar to return to the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-s-detractors-in-congress-conspired-twice-to-deny-him-pm-s-chair-patel/story-4rJDusUUnPRv6fJOtCseXM.html

In its affidavit in the top court, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) maintained that the Family Welfare Programme in India gives couples the right to decide the size of their family without any compulsion. Responding to a PIL by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, the ministry has rejected the need to have a mandatory two-child norm or frame a specific law on limiting the size of families in the country. After his plea was shot down by the Delhi High Court, Upadhyay has moved the Supreme Court for introducing a population control law. Upadhyay has said that population explosion is more dangerous than bomb explosion and that the constitutional rights to clean air, drinking water, health, livelihood and education cannot be secured to all citizens without controlling the population. But the MoHFW has sought dismissal of Upadhyay’s petition, stating that the central government cannot introduce or encourage authoritative or legislative methods to control population. “The Family Welfare Programme in India is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt the family planning methods, best suited to them, according to their choice, without any compulsion,” said the ministry’s affidavit. It said India was a signatory to the Programme Of Action (POA) of the International Conference on Population and Development, 1994, which was unequivocally against coercion in family planning. “In fact, international experience shows that any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter productive and leads to demographic distortions,” the ministry explained. It further pointed out that there has been a constant decline in the total fertility rate (TFR), suggesting that couples do not want more than two children in the family. The affidavit also placed reliance on the Census data of 2001-2011 to demonstrate the sharpest decline in decadal growth rate among Indians in 100 years. “2001-2011 was the first decade in the last 100 years which had not only added lesser population as compared to the previous one, but also registered the sharpest decline in the decadal growth rate from 21.54% in 1991-2001 to 17.64% in 2001-2011”, it emphasised. The ministry said the TFR, which was 3.2 at the time when National Population Policy 2000 was adopted, has declined substantially to 2.2 as per Sample Registration System of 2018. “The wanted fertility in India as per National Family Health Survey IV is only 1.8 as against the actual fertility of 2.2 prevailing at that time, indicating thereby that couples on an average do not want more than two children. Also, as many as 25 out of 36 States/UTs have already achieved the replacement level fertility of 2.1 or less,” added the MoHFW. The ministry held that the National Population Policy 2000 and the National Health Policy 2017 are guiding documents to prioritise the role of the government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions and achievement of TFR of 2.1 by 2025. On Upadhyay’s plea to issue necessary directive to the state governments, the MoHFW has said no such directions can be issued since “public health” is a state subject and it is the prerogative of the respective state government to implement the schemes envisaged by the Central government as per the prescribed guidelines. An SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, had in January sought a reply from the MoHFW, which has now been filed. There is, however, no next date of hearing as yet fixed.Upadhyay, speaking to HT, lamented the stand taken by the central government. “India now has a population of 150 crore and it is clear from the numbers of Aadhaar cards made. But this affidavit seems to be evading the real issues. Legally too, the affidavit fails to take note that Entry 20A in the Concurrent List specifically mentions population control and family planning. How can the Centre now say it lacks power to make law on population control?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-force-couples-to-have-only-two-children-centre-to-supreme-court/story-sfkoVwb8xyt0w50dvHuISK.html
12-12-2020||India||India readies for 600 million Covid vaccine jabs; to use standard cold storage, says top govt expert||India will deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, the expert leading the initiative said on Friday.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F), said V.K. Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for Covid-19 that advises India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India’s vaccine.“The four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines,” he told Reuters in an interview.Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca’s Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates. And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia’s RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine per year in India. The government expects the first approvals “very soon” from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said.“I am hoping at the earliest because we are ready.”The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said.“The Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price.” SUPPLIES AND STORAGEAt present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech.But, Pfizer’s limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure.“In a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so,” Paul said. Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna, which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage. India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul. “We would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well.”Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator.“As of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects,” he said.India has the world’s second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower. Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme. This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections.“The way it looks as of now, optimistically, it appears possible to cover the above population of 300 million in six to eight months’ time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-readies-for-600-million-covid-vaccine-jabs-to-use-standard-cold-storage-says-top-govt-expert/story-YFfOKdh7U2zCglKj1KlrKJ.html

12-12-2020||India||India’s mRNA vaccine candidate advances to human trial phase||India’s first mRNA vaccine candidate – developed by Pune-based Gennova in collaboration with the USA’s HDT Bio – has been granted approval to conduct human trials to determine whether it’s safe and produces immune response protective against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Subject Expert Committee under India’s apex drug regulator recommended that the vaccine candidate -- HGCO19 -- to proceed to human trials in a meeting on Wednesday. The candidate uses the messenger RNA platform to generate immune response just like the vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna, which have been found to be 95% efficacious. Currently, Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in India. Gennova’s candidate, HGCO19, has already demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and production of neutralising antibodies (antibodies that directly attack the virus) activity in animals. The neutralising antibody response of the vaccine in mice and non-human primates was comparable to the convalescent or recovered patients of Covid-19. In addition, the mRNA used in the vaccine is attached to a nano-lipid carrier that enhances the release of it inside cells. This self-amplifying platform means requirement of a lower dose of the vaccine. The vaccine candidate also solves one of the biggest problems with the Pfizer vaccine, which can be stored only at -70 degrees Celsius. Gennova’s vaccine is stable for two months at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is the temperature at which other vaccines used under universal immunisation programme in India is stored. Gennova has received a seed grant under the Ind-CEPI mission of Department of Biotechnology, which is aligned to the global Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). An mRNA vaccine uses a synthetic RNA (genetic material) encoded with instructions to make specific proteins of the Sars-CoV-2 virus so that the body can generate an immune response without getting the disease. When it comes to manufacturing, mRNA vaccines are synthetically made and do not need cell cultures, bacteria, or other hosts for growing it. This means it can be manufactured quickly and inexpensively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-mrna-vaccine-candidate-advances-to-human-trial-phase/story-euXWYNfRxfLKT84B7ntmjL.html

The draft bill will be tabled in the state legislature during the upcoming two-day winter session in Mumbai on December 14-15.Here’s everything you need to know about the Shakti act:1. The Shakti act is modelled on the lines of Andhra Pradesh’s Disha act, which was brought last year. A committee was set up to study the Disha act and prepare a similar law. After this, a cabinet sub-committee headed by PWD minister Ashok Chavan was set up to approve the draft act and put it before the cabinet for clearance.2. The draft bill will come up for discussion and approval in both houses of the legislature. After getting the house nod, the bill will be sent to the central government for approval and presidential assent. 3. The draft bill seeks to amend relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.4. It provides for completing probe in a case within 15 days and trial within 30 days. Therefore, there is a stipulated time frame for completing the investigation and trial.5. Stringent punishment, including the death penalty and heavy fines on the perpetrators is a key feature of the draft bill. The perpetrators will be punished with imprisonment for life for not less than ten years but may extend to the remainder of natural life or with death in cases characterised as ‘heinous’.Read more| Maharashtra government to launch a digital platform to help disabled6. Special police teams and separate courts will be set up for investigation and trial of cases against women and children under the new legislation.

They have unique life stories, linked to their families, communities and society.”Talking about LHMC’s history, the Health Minister said, “LHMC has been a symbol of women empowerment in our country. Today Lady Hardinge alumni occupy the position of pride in India and abroad and have made a laudable contribution in the field of health care and medical education and brought glory to the institution and the country.”“And this has also been ranked within the top medical colleges in the country and has been consistently producing outstanding medical professional,” he added.The minister further lauded LHMC for its role in battling the Covid-19 pandemic. “I am proud to acknowledge how the LHMC rose to the unprecedented challenge of the Covid-19 and excelled in their battle against this deadly virus,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said.“Lady Hardinge was among the first government institution in Delhi to establish a state of the art facility to conduct the RT-PCR test. As the pandemic spread and various treatment modalities were being tested against this little known virus, LHMC was one of the centres for conducting trials for evaluating the usefulness of convalescent plasma therapy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medicine-not-just-profession-but-vocation-harsh-vardhan-at-lhmc/story-iKjWhLGnMycarWsTkpvYsM.html

Speaking at the Economic Times Global Business Summit, Poonawalla said life is likely to become normal by September-October 2021 as by then there will be enough vaccines for everyone.“We might get emergency license by this month-end, but licence for wider use might come at a later date. But, we are confident that if the regulators give a nod, India’s vaccination drive can start by January 2021,” Poonawalla said.Pune’s SII is preparing to manufacture enough vaccines for the government as well as private makers. An expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has sought additional safety and efficacy data from Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech as their applications for emergency-use authorisation came up for review. From SII, the expert committee has sought an upgraded safety data of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials in the country, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India along with the outcome of the assessment of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine will be priced at Rs 500-600, Poonawalla had said during the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. “Emergency use authorisation will be for healthcare workers and other frontline workers, and by March- April, the vaccine should be available for use to general public. Emergency use licensure is based on the positive UK results. There is a good T-cell and antibody response but nobody at this stage can answer whether these vaccines can protect long-term,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-drive-in-india-may-start-in-january-says-adar-poonawalla-as-serum-institute-hopes-to-get-nod-by-december/story-hPRknomxmSHoUAuNXOPrAL.html
12-12-2020||India||SC slams Centre for not appointing mandatory legal member in CERC||Observing that executive acting in breach of judgments would be an “invitation to anarchy”, the Supreme Court has slammed the Centre for not appointing mandatory member (law) in the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).A three-judge bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy expressed its anguish on the development and said, “we have shown considerable restraint in this matter. Our restraint seems to be misunderstood!”The bench, in its order passed earlier this week, has observed that the government is, unfortunately, showing no anxiety about the interests of the consumers or the Commission as it is taking its own sweet time.“Government does not seem to be interested in coming to the aid of the consumers or making the Commission functional, which is not an unusual scenario seeing the functioning of the other Tribunals and Commissions, on account of lack of appointments to deal with the matter,” the bench said.The apex court had, through its April 12, 2018, order, held that it is mandatory to appoint a member (law) in its quorum. It had directed CERC and all state electricity commissions to appoint a member from the field of law with qualifications of a high court or district judge.Later, a contempt petition was filed before the court as directions of the apex court were sought to be breached on account of appointments made to the Central Commission on January 21, 2019, and thereafter on April 7, 2020, without appointing a member from the law, the bench noted.Observing that there is “prima facie willful disobedience” on the part of the government, the top court had in August directed two members of the CERC to go on leave until a ‘member (law)’ is appointed to the Commission.The order, passed earlier this week, read, “We have to express our anguish with the manner in which the Government sought to act, contrary to a judgment of this Court. It is the legislative function to pass the Acts and the administrative function to implement the provision of that Act. It is left to the judiciary to interpret the law. The law was interpreted by our judgment. The Executive cannot be expected to act nor permitted to act in breach of the judgment of this Court. This would be an invitation to anarchy! The mutual respect of the three pillars of democracy requires each of them to respect the role and functioning of the other.”“The passage of time also doesn’t seem to have awoken the Government to the problem at hand and almost four months have passed since then. We are unable to come to the aid of the consumers because the Government does not seem to be interested in coming to the aid of the consumers or making the Commission functional, which is not an unusual scenario seeing the functioning of the other Tribunals and Commissions, on account of lack of appointments to deal with the matters,” the order added.In the end, the apex court said that having expressed its anguish, it now specifically posed a question to the Additional Solicitor General as to when should we keep the matter, so that the government would have completed the task by then.The bench then posted the matter for further hearing on January 20, 2021, accepting the request of the Additional Solicitor General.The top court noted that as per the affidavit placed by the CERC 177 judgments were lying reserved from February to August 2020. However, it refused to lift the stay order to the extent of permitting the judgments to be pronounced by the Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-for-not-appointing-mandatory-legal-member-in-cerc/story-6IEuDNVJExOEXBJaOOf3hJ.html
12-12-2020||India||Farmers close toll plaza in Haryana’s Ambala, Karnal||Amid the ongoing protest in and at the borders of the national capital against the recently enacted farm laws, farmers closed two toll plazas in Haryana’s Ambala and Karnal late last night, letting the vehicles cross without paying the duty. “Vehicles are not paying the toll since midnight. Some farmers had come and forced us to close the toll plaza. We haven’t received any information yet as to how long this will continue but the farmers are saying that it will remain toll-free throughout the day till midnight,” said Ravi Tiwari, in-charge at Shambhu Toll Plaza in Ambala, on Saturday.Apart from Ambala, farmers also closed Bastara Toll Plaza in Karnal late last night, as part of their agitation.The farmers, who were mainly from Haryana and Punjab were adamant that until the government fulfills their demands to withdraw the laws, the movement would continue in a similar way.This would lead to huge losses for the toll plaza operators. Thousands of vehicles cross the Bastara Toll Plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh route everyday. Around Rs 200 is charged here.Scores of farmers across the country, including Haryana, are heading towards Delhi to join the agitation amid the deadlock with the central government over the new farm laws. They also planned to block the Delhi-Jaipur, and Delhi-Agra highways on Saturday.Besides, the farmers’ unions have threatened to block railway tracks if the laws are not repealed. Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has appealed to the protesters to stop their agitation as talks are still going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-close-toll-plaza-in-haryana-s-ambala-karnal/story-NX4vrld2cXR4q4IUz9f8MK.html

12-12-2020||India||Against forcing family planning, Centre tells SC after population control PIL||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that India is unequivocally against forcing family planning on its people and any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter-productive and leads to demographic distortions.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the health ministry told the apex court that the family welfare programme in the country is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt family planning methods best suited to them, according to their choice and without any compulsion.The submission was made in response to a PIL filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay challenging a Delhi High Court order that dismissed a plea seeking certain steps, including two-child norm, to control the country’s growing population.The ministry said that ‘public health’ is a state subject and the state governments must lead the process of health sector reforms in a suitable and sustainable manner to protect the common people from health hazards.“Improvement in the health sector can be effectively led by the state government with effective monitoring and specific intervention to control and regulate the implementation process of the guidelines and schemes in a proper perspective,” it said.“The answering respondent no. (ministry) plays a supportive and facilitative role in achieving the health care reforms and outcomes. It is reiterated that the answering respondent no. 1 merely acts as a facilitator for providing accessible and affordable health care through state-led reforms in the health sector,” it said. The ministry said that as far as implementation of the guidelines and schemes in the states is concerned, it does not have any direct role and it is the prerogative of the respective state governments to implement the schemes as per the prescribed guidelines.The ministry only allocates funds to state governments for implementation of the approved schemes, it added. The Ministry of Health And Family Welfare told the top court that India has adopted a comprehensive and holistic National Population Policy (NPP), 2000, with clearly articulated objectives, strategic themes and operational strategies.The National Health Policy (NHP), 2017 provides for a policy guidance to inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritise the role of the government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions, it said. The NHP sets out indicative, quantitative goals and objectives which includes the achievement of total fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 by 2025. The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, 1994, to which India is a signatory, is unequivocally against coercion in family planning.“In fact, international experience shows that any coercion to have a certain number of children is counter-productive and leads to demographic distortions,” the ministry said.India is witnessing a constant decline in TFR, the ministry said, adding that the fertility rate which was 3.2 at the time when NPP was adopted has declined substantially to 2.2 as per the Sample Registration System, 2018.The apex court had earlier sought the Centre’s reply on a plea challenging a Delhi High Court order that dismissed a PIL seeking certain steps, including two-child norm, to control the country’s rising population.   The appeal has challenged the September 3 high court order, which said it was for Parliament and the state legislatures to enact laws and not for the court.     The PIL said the high court failed to appreciate that the right to clean air, drinking water, health, peaceful sleep, shelter, livelihood, and education guaranteed under Articles 21 and 21A of the Constitution could not be secured to all citizens without controlling the population explosion. The plea in the high court had claimed that the population of India had “marched ahead” of China, as about 20% of Indians did not have Aadhaar and therefore, were not accounted for, and there were also crores of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis living illegally in the country.     It claimed that “population explosion is also the root cause of corruption”, apart from being a contributory factor behind heinous crimes like rape and domestic violence.It also held population explosion responsible for pollution and the dearth of resources and jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/against-forcing-family-planning-centre-tells-sc-after-population-control-pil/story-IJpqHhdep8jRwRHbfNt5wK.html

Police said that condition of two of them was critical as they had sustained multiple injuries. One person has been detained. According to the police, the local panchayat had installed a solar street lamp to light up a village road stretch that was prone to accidents. A garage owner, however, changed that direction of the lamp to illuminate the stretch where his garage was located. When villagers noticed it, they confronted the garage owner. An altercation broke out and the police had to intervene. Later when police went away, the accused, his brother and his father went to the garage’s terrace and started firing at the villagers. “The victims were rushed to a local hospital from where two of them were shifted to a state-run medical college and hospital. One person has been detained,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-3-shot-after-altercation-over-installing-solar-lamps/story-x9k2C5GQi7FQLQHeZxamdJ.html
12-12-2020||India||Govt committed to protect interest of farmers through its policies: PM Modi||Amidst protests by farmers over the new farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the government is committed to protect the interest of the farming community through its policies and intentions. The government has taken various initiatives to improve the income of people engaged in the farm sector, he said, adding that farmers now have options to sell their crops in mandis as well as to outside parties. Also Read: ‘Put them behind bars’: Farmer leader on Centre’s accusation of ‘anti-social’ elements in protestsThe government at any cost is committed to protect the interest of farmers through “its policies and intentions”, he emphasised. Expressing dissatisfaction over the limited participation of India Inc in the agriculture sector, the Prime Minister asked industries to show there interest and increase investment in the sector.  Frankly speaking, he said, unfortunately the India Inc “has not made adequate investments in agriculture and private players did not explore the sector to its full potential, rather they worked in limited fashion”. Citing an example, he said “the private sector’s participation is not as per the desired level in cold storage and fertiliser manufacturing”. Addressing the FICCI Annual Convention, the Prime Minister said tax terrorism and Inspector Raj are things of the past.Also Read: How many sacrifices will farmers have to make to get agri laws repealed, asks Rahul Gandhi India is now among the few nations which have implemented faceless assessment and faceless appeal with regard to tax matters, Modi said. Even the corporate tax in India is very competitive after the moderation effected last year, he added. It is to be noted that thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the new farm laws which they claim will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporate houses. The farming community has expressed apprehension that three new laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-protect-interest-of-farmers-through-its-policies-pm-modi/story-lp3nuiYCpNGzRZvSAtlhiO.html

Two batches in Uttar Pradesh attended the online ‘training-of-trainers’ sessions conducted by the union health ministry in the last two days.“These master trainers will train more master trainers who will then train vaccinators at district level,” said a senior health official. Training, he said, was being given on how to handle the vaccine, on bio-waste disposal and also on cold chain management for the vaccine.“Almost all the vaccinators are part of the routine immunisation programme. Hence, they just need some additional input regarding Covid vaccine, which is being arranged by the experts,” said officials.The number of vaccinators at district level is yet to be finalised but as the state will have 35,000 vaccination centres, the number of vaccinators will be more than that. “Vaccinators will be deployed at the vaccination centres along with the logistics,” said another health official.The inoculators will record the data of people vaccinated by them on an online platform—an app developed for the purpose. A certificate will also be issued to those getting vaccinated. This certificate may be used by the beneficiary wherever required.The officials said in the next 10 days, things will be in place. The vaccination centres will be identified and prepared with vaccinators deployed there. The vaccinators are being selected from among those conducting routine immunisation, pharmacists, staff nurses working at government and private hospitals and lab technicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/training-for-up-covid-vaccinators-begin/story-nmlhzawjBUgD0EDS1KpHbO.html

12-12-2020||India||Custody of a child can’t only be decided on monetary matters: HC||The Allahabad high court has held that every child has the right to be in care and company of both parents who, together, are a child’s world.The court also said that in cases of estranged couples fighting for the custody of their child, if one parent is given custody, then another parent should be given visitation rights so that the child can meet his other parent.The court further held that issues related to the custody of a child can’t only be decided on monetary factors, rather factors like intellectual guidance and moral training by parents, which are important facets of a child’s grooming, must also be considered while deciding the issue of child custody.Justice JJ Munir allowed the writ petition filed by a woman seeking custody of her four- year-old son, who was allegedly forcibly taken away by her husband.According to petitioner, she and her husband had married on April 20, 2014 and the boy was born on September 20, 2016.As her husband used to torture her for dowry, therefore, in June 2018, she returned to her mother’s house with her son.The petitioner’s contention was that on April 6, 2019, her husband forcibly took the child away from her custody. Therefore, she was entitled to get custody of her son.The father’s contention was that he was a farmer who earned around Rs 1.5 lakh per annum but the petitioner had no personal source of income and was fully dependant on earnings from her ancestral agricultural land.After hearing the parties concerned, the court observed, “The mother is an educated woman and a post graduate in education. She is far better educated than the father. The welfare of the young child is not dependent on material resources alone. It requires a lot more. Literal and then intellectual guidance, besides moral training are important facets of a child’s grooming. This court finds that all these would be better secured with the mother than the father.”The court directed the father to give the custody of the child to the mother. The court also directed the mother to allow the father to meet his son on the second and fourth Sunday of every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/custody-of-a-child-can-t-only-be-decided-on-monetary-matters-hc/story-vI4xY1w26uOK6JYE403I1M.html

It is the country’s very first photographic evidence of tiger sighting in the mountains of the eastern region,” a joint press release issued by the two departments read.After spotting tigers at the high altitude of the Himalayas in Nepal for the first time, both the departments stressed the need for special attention in the area where lynxes were also spotted lately.“This sighting demonstrates the importance of the Kanchenjunga Landscape in eastern Nepal, and it needs special attention since the forests provide connectivity to India’s Singalia National Park in north Sikkim and Dooars in North Bengal,” the release stated.Earlier, Bhutan had captured a tiger on camera at an altitude of 4,038 m in 2018, while India’s Arunachal Pradesh recorded a sighting at Dibang Valley at an elevation of 3,630 m.Sighting of the tiger at such elevations has raised concerns about the impact of global warming as well as possible depletion of habitats of the carnivore, which is enlisted as an endangered species.World Tiger Statistics released in 2016 had recorded a total of 2,226 big cats in India, 433 in Russia, 371 in Indonesia, 250 in Malaysia, 198 in Nepal, 189 in Thailand, 106 in Bangladesh, 103 in Bhutan, seven in China, five in Vietnam and two in Laos.On World Tiger Day on July 29 this year, Nepali Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli had mentioned that global warming is hampering tiger conservation.“Despite the efforts being made by the countries hosting the tigers, depletion of vegetation, increased human-wildlife conflict, poaching and hunting, illegal trade of animal organs, the danger of climate change and various diseases have increased the challenges in the field of tiger conservation,” Oli said.In the last census in 2018, Nepal counted a total of 235 tigers. As per the latest census, there are 93 tigers at Chitwan National Park, 87 in Bardiya National Park, 16 in Shuklaphanta, 21 in Banke and 18 in Parsa.The number had increased from the preceding five years. In 2013, the Chitwan National Park had recorded 120 tigers, Baridya 50, Suklaphanta 17, Parsa seven, and Banke four tigers, taking the number to 198.In 2009, the number of tigers was recorded at 121. At the end of the last decade, Nepal, along with 13 other countries, had agreed on a framework to double the number of the carnivore.Nepal has set a target of taking the number of tigers to 250 by 2022 when the next tiger census takes place. Currently, tigers are found in five national parks in the Tarai Arc Landscape covering 18 districts and seven biological corridors in the plains of Nepal.The Royal Bengal Tiger is listed as “Endangered” in the International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and protected in Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-spotted-above-3-000-m-altitude-for-first-time-in-nepal-raises-concern-about-impact-of-global-warming/story-noYcaDhPfGvqqUepMvUvMP.html

GSTR-3B is a summary statement of business transactions filed by a registered entity every month.In Ahmedabad zone alone, 11,048 GST registrations have been cancelled. In Chennai zone, 19,586 suo motu cancellations have been done so far in respect of GST taxpayers who have failed to file returns for more than six months, he said. “Further, 28,635 registered entities who have not filed their GSTR-3B returns for more than six months as December 1, 2020 have been identified and the tax authority has suo motu initiated cancellation process in these cases,” he added.The tax authority has last month launched a massive crackdown against fake entities indulging in issuing bogus invoices to fraudulently usurp ITC. Within one month, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Central GST Commissionerates have so far arrested 132 persons, including four chartered accountant and a woman for availing or passing on ineligible ITC fraudulently and have booked 1,430 cases against more than 4,586 bogus entities, a second official said. “The tax authority is also scanning newly registered entities that have not provided correct details at the time of registration. Out of 720 deemed registrations granted between August 21 and November 16 this year, where Aadhaar authentication was not done, 55 deemed registrations have been identified for discrepancy and the process of cancellation was initiated in these cases,” the first official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-cancels-gst-registration-of-163k-biz-entities-over-non-filing-of-tax-returns/story-v8C77I7c5Pk2WBw05GdqNJ.html

Central intelligence agencies should catch them, he said. “Central Intelligence should catch them. If people of a banned organization are roaming amid us, put them behind bars. We haven’t found any such person here, if we do we’ll send them away,” Tikait told ANI.Amid the ongoing stalemate between the Centre and farmers, which went a notch higher on Saturday with protesters, Union railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal brought direct charges of the protest getting derailed.“People of India are watching, seeing what is happening, observing how across the country Leftist-Maoists are not finding any support and therefore they are trying to hijack this farmers agitation and trying misuse this platform for their own agenda,” Goyal tweeted.The farmers have maintained from the beginning that their protest is apolitical though their call for Bharat Bandh garnered massive support from most of the opposition and regional political parties. No politician has been allowed to speak at the stage at the key protest site at Singhu. However, on December 10, many supporters at Tikri border — another site of the protest — displayed posters of Umar Khalid and Susha Bharadwaj. Some supporters were observing Human Rights Day, union leaders have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/put-them-behind-bars-farmer-leader-on-centre-s-accusation-of-anti-social-elements-in-protests/story-7k1qGq97CfspIIcFLulZDN.html

12-12-2020||India||Gehlot says BJP spreading lies on Congress performance in rural body polls, presents data||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has accused the BJP Union ministers of spreading lies regarding performance of the Congress in rural local body elections to discredit the ongoing farmers’ protests at Delhi borders on the directions of saffron party high command.“The BJP is displaying these results as its big victory, which is proven wrong in the analysis of data,” the CM said in a statement. He said the Congress got higher vote share than the BJP in the elections held on 222 Panchayat Samitis in 21 districts, whose results were announced on Wednesday. The Congress got 40.87% votes, while the BJP got 40.58% votes-- 0.29 percentage points less than the Congress.In the 222 Panchayat Samitis, Congress and BJP won 98 chairperson posts each and 26 went to independents and other parties. In 2015, on these Panchayat Samitis, the BJP had won 112 and the Congress had 67. The number of chairperson posts with the Congress has increased by 31, while the BJP’s numbers have reduced by 14, he said. In 21 district council or Zila Parishad posts, the BJP had received 48.87% votes in 2015 which has come down to 43.81% votes this year, a fall of 5 percentage points. Congress has got 42.76% votes, which is just 1.05 percentage points less than the BJP. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP’s vote share in these districts was 61.05% of the votes polled, which Gehlot said had come down by 18 percentage points. In 2015, the BJP had won 14 district council heads in these 21 districts, which has come down to 13 now, he added. Also Read: With another win, BJP gets 13 pramukh seats in 21 zila parishads in Rajasthan“The entire focus of the state government was on containing the pandemic and therefore did not send state and central level leaders to campaign in these elections to avoid gathering of crowds and curb the spread of infection. The BJP Union ministers such as Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Kailash Chaudhary and Arjun Meghwal along with state leaders such as leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and his deputy Rajendra Rathore campaigned and violated corona guidelines,” he said. When 2,500 people and two MLAs of the state have lost their lives due to Corona, it is our responsibility to take the infection seriously but the BJP leaders did not, the CM said, alleging that in order to win the elections, BJP leaders presented the wrong example of breaking the corona protocol in front of the common man. Also Read: Rajasthan forms panel to probe death of 12 infants“The BJP is misleading the media over the election results and trying to create an illusion as if the Congress has been wiped out. The farmers of Rajasthan have supported the farmers’ movement by giving the BJP 18% less votes in 18 months. The farmers of Rajasthan are completely against the new farm laws, and have voted against the BJP,” the CM said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the CM was presenting wrong facts and figures to hide Congress party’s alleged failures. “It is clear that the BJP has won 13 Zila chairperson posts and we will win Jhalawar also, whose result is pending,” Pareek said. He claimed that despite being in the government and misusing the government machinery, the Congress lost in rural areas, which the party claimed to be their stronghold.“Leaders of BJP and Congress campaigned in the election and maintained social distancing but levelling charges against the BJP is unfortunate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-says-bjp-spreading-lies-on-congress-performance-in-rural-body-polls-presents-data/story-uebI3o2XLEwJ4urxF4RFoN.html
12-12-2020||India||Lancet introduces Commission for universal health coverage||The Lancet on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens’ Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System, which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage (UHC) in India. The work of the commission will begin on Friday with an aim to publish a final report of its findings and recommendations in the next two years.The Lancet, a global health journal, and the Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University, together formulated the commission which will be led by four distinguished health and business leaders—Gagandeep Kang, a professor at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory of Christian Medical College, Vellore, and one of India’s leading scientists; Tarun Khanna, Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor, Harvard Business School; Lakshmi Mittal And Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University and Director, Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute; Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD, Biocon Ltd and Vikram Patel, Professor in the Department of Global Health and Population at Harvard Medical School and founder of Sangath. They have brought together 13 experts from academia, the scientific community, civil society, and private healthcare to serve with them on the Commission.The mission of the Lancet Citizens’ Commission is to lay out the path to achieving UHC in India in the coming decade. The commission will take a participatory approach with engagement of all sectors engaged in healthcare and citizens. “We expect that the commission will formulate a roadmap for realising a resilient health system that offers comprehensive, accountable, accessible, inclusive, and affordable quality health care to all citizens in India. Although we recognise the important role that social determinants have in influencing health, the focus of the Commission will be on the architecture of India’s health system…”a commentary in Lancet India said on Thursday.The commentary also said that despite progress in health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality, disease burden in India is disproportionately high and that less than two-thirds of children were fully immunised in 2017–18, malnutrition and other risk factors for disease and injury are widespread. The commission observed that the Covid 19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of India’s health system ranging from inadequate medical supplies and shortage of health care workers in public hospitals to profiteering by private hospitals. “Out-of-pocket payments for health care in India continue to be among the leading causes of poverty for many households… An estimated 400 million people could fall deeper into poverty. In the coming year, as India’s gross domestic product contracts by a projected 10·3%. The pandemic could worsen health disparities since much of the public health system has been redeployed in the Covid-19 response,” the commentary said.Data from India’s National Health Mission showed there was a 64% decrease in child immunisation, a 50% drop in BCG vaccinations, and a 39% fall in oral polio immunisation in April, 2020, compared with January, 2020.The commission organised a webinar on Monday where Dr Vinod Paul, member Niti Ayog said Ayushman Bharat and Digital Health Mission have laid the path towards UHC. “A few significant big tickets steps have been taken in the past few years. On the human resource front, I assure you that we will achieve a doctor patient ratio of 1 per 1000 which is the WHO norm by 2024. Our public spending has to increase we made a commitment to go to 2.5% of GDP by 2025 which we will follow through. Our 15TH Finance Commission has also put weight behind it. Two-thirds of spending on health comes from state governments. State spending should be disaggregated,” said Paul, adding: “We have a chronic problem of human resources. Our specialist scarcity is huge. The Commission should think about that granularity. We have 20 to 25% of what we should have. We need five times the number of paediatricians we have today. We cannot do without specialists. The Commission also needs to work on infrastructure. We have just about one bed per 1000 population. Under the national health policy, we aspire to be 2 beds per 1000 population.”WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said “the index that’s now used was developed years ago which looks at 14 indicators focused on process indicators. We wanted to measure UHC by looking at health outcomes and impact. So instead of focusing on distribution of ORS in primary health centres as a management of childhood diarrhoea, let’s look at mortality incidence ratio for diarrhoea. India could innovate in the measurement system to move ahead. We have proposed a new UHC measuring index.”Gagandeep Kang said that all stakeholders will be consulted. “Engagement must start with listening to issues, perspectives, goals and preferences of all stakeholders which includes the designers, providers and recipients of healthcare services. In the next year or so we will make sure we use every opportunity to listen and engage so our framing of a reliable, efficient and accountable healthcare system can be realised in ten years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-introduces-commission-to-discuss-health-care-in-india-make-suggestions/story-SIADvIXdssT6MYUlFqw1MM.html
12-12-2020||India||Farmers will get new markets, options and more benefits of technology: PM Modi on farm reforms||Amid the ongoing standoff between the Centre and the farmers who are agitating against the three new farm laws for the last 16 days, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday championed the ongoing reforms and said these will open new avenues in front of the farmers. “We had seen walls between the agriculture sector and other areas associated with it - be it agriculture infrastructure, food processing, storage or cold chain.We don’t want walls. We want bridges. All walls and obstacles are being removed now. After reforms, farmers will get new markets, options and more benefits of technology. This in turn will bring in more investment,” Modi said delivering the keynote address at the 93rd Annual General Meeting of FICCI.“The cold storage infrastructure will be modernised. This will result in more investments in the agriculture sector. Farmers will be benefitted the most out of it,” Modi said. His comments come at a time when thousands of protesters have laid siege to Delhi demanding an immediate withdrawal of the farm laws as they fear the new laws will corporatise farming and will benefit corporates at the cost of farmers.Batting for the involvement of all stakeholders in all sectors, PM Modi said, “If the government is confident, then it does not get threatened to make space for other players. This has been happening in India for the last six years.”This is not the first time after the massive agitation of the farmers began that PM Modi touched the issue of farm laws. In his last Mann ki Baat speech, PM Modi had said, “Parliament has recently passed farm reform laws after rigorous brainstorming. These reforms have not only broken shackles of farmers but have also given new rights and opportunities to them.”The theme of FICCI’s annual convention this year is ‘Inspired India’, the Prime Minister’s Office’s (PMO) said on Friday. PM Modi also launched the FICCI Annual Expo 2020. This will provide an opportunity to exhibitors from across the globe to showcase their products and advance their business prospects, the PMO had added.Over the three days of the convention, more than 10,000 delegates from across the world and Union ministers Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal, S Jaishankar and Ravi Shankar Prasad will address the conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-get-new-markets-options-and-more-benefits-of-technology-pm-modi-on-farm-reforms/story-LewN97PzJMUHHAwew7MH0K.html
12-12-2020||India||India, Iran, Uzbekistan to hold first trilateral meet on Chabahar port use||India, Iran and Uzbekistan will hold their first trilateral meeting on joint use of the strategic Chabahar port next week against the backdrop of reports that the incoming Joe Biden administration in the US will re-engage Tehran on the nuclear issue. The first trilateral working group meeting will be held virtually on December 14, and will be jointly chaired by deputy ministers of Iran and Uzbekistan and a secretary from India, the external affairs ministry said on Saturday. The announcement came a day after Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev proposed during a summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that a trilateral meeting should be held with Iran to promote Chabahar port. India currently operates one of the terminals of Chabahar port that it has developed. The strategic project has been given a waiver from sanctions imposed by the US on Iran in view of its importance in shipping cargo and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. “India welcomes the interest of Uzbekistan to use the Chabahar port as a transit port,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “This would open up economic opportunities for the traders and business community of the region. Besides Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries have also shown interest in using the port. India seeks to cooperate closely with regional countries on this issue,” the statement added. US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and re-imposed crippling sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. However, president-elect Joe Biden has said he will offer Iran a “credible path back to diplomacy” since dealing with Tehran’s nuclear programme is the best way to achieve stability in the region. The US, in consultation with allies and partners, will engage in “negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints”, Biden told The New York Times in an interview this month. Biden also said he will insist on Iran agreeing to new demands if it wants the US to return to a nuclear deal and lift sanctions. These developments had resulted in renewed interest in Chabahar port, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Following the India-Uzbekistan Summit on Friday, Adarsh Swaika, joint secretary (Eurasia) in the external affairs ministry, said the two sides had discussed how to overcome lack of overland connectivity. Mirziyoyev gave his in-principle concurrence to joining the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), when Modi reiterated a proposal on Uzbekistan’s participation in the project. “We as a principle would welcome any initiative that increases connectivity between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan or with other Central Asian countries,” Swaika said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-iran-uzbekistan-to-hold-first-trilateral-meet-on-chabahar-port-use/story-Dcxn4uNUPR7MI5rNuW4dzI.html
12-12-2020||India||‘World’s faith in India built over 6 years, strengthened in past months’: PM Modi at FICCI’s AGM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India was able to prioritise saving lives during coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and as a result, the situation has changed for the better. The world’s faith in India, which was built over the last six years, has strengthened over the past few months, he said.“The faith that the world placed in India in the last 6 years has further strengthened in the past few months. Be it FDI or FPI - foreign investors have made record investments in India and are continuing to do that,” PM Modi said at the inauguration of FICCI’s (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) 93rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Annual Convention.Further, the PM said that reforms introduced by the current government are aimed at breaking the walls between different sectors. “We have introduced some reforms with the aim of breaking walls between various sectors. These walls hamper development,” the PM said, adding that the Farm laws is one such example. “We’d seen walls between agriculture and other areas associated with it - be it agriculture infrastructure, food processing, storage or cold chain. All walls and obstacles are being removed now. After reforms, farmers will get new markets, options and more benefits of technology,” he said.Another example of the government’s planned and integrated approach towards building bridges between different sectors is that of reforms introduced in the banking sector, the PM said. “We have ensured everyone’s financial inclusion through changes in the banking sector. We joined banks and made cheap mobiles and mobile data available to poor. Today, direct benefit transfer (DBT) system, that aims to transfer subsidies directly to the people through their bank accounts, is working in our country,” he said.“At the time of Covid-19, when other nations were dependent on cheques and postal services to transfer money, India could send thousands of rupees to its citizens with a click. This was happening even at the time of lockdown, when the banks were shut. We have received global appreciation for this model and experts have advised other nations to learn from it,” he said.The theme of the annual convention this year is ‘Inspired India’, the Prime Minister’s Office’s (PMO) said on Friday. PM Modi also launched the FICCI Annual Expo 2020. This will provide an opportunity to exhibitors from across the globe to showcase their products and advance their business prospects, the PMO had added.Over the three days of the convention, more than 10,000 delegates from across the world and Union ministers Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal, S Jaishankar and Ravi Shankar Prasad will address the conference.Finance commission chairman NK Singh and NITI aayog chairman Amitabh Kant will also address the FICCI AGM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-built-globally-over-6-years-strengthened-over-past-months-pm-modi-in-inaugural-address-at-ficci-s-agm/story-jGks35VYwyJmvhnfrBBw3J.html

12-12-2020||India||Pandemic threatens India’s children with child labour rising||A boy who cried out when he was beaten for complaining of stomach pains drew attention from a passerby, who alerted police in the central Indian city of Agra.Officers broke a padlock on the gate of the illegal shoe factory where the boy was working and found a dozen children, aged 10-17.With classrooms shut and parents losing their jobs in the pandemic, thousands of families are putting their children to work to get by, undoing decades of progress in curbing child labour and threatening the future of a generation of India’s children.In rural India, a nationwide lockdown imposed in March pushed millions of people into poverty, encouraging trafficking of children from villages into cities for cheap labour. The pandemic is hampering enforcement of anti-child labour laws, with fewer workplace inspections and less vigorous pursuit of human traffickers.“The situation is unprecedented,” said Dhananjay Tingal, executive director of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, a children’s rights group whose founder, Kailash Satyarthi, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.“These children are made to work 14-16 hours a day and if they refuse to work they are beaten. One beating sends the message down the group, which suits the owner,” said Tingal.Tingal’s organization has rescued at least 1,197 children between April and September across India. In the same period last year, it helped 613.Childline, a nationwide helpline for children in distress, received 192,000 distress calls between March and August, most of them related to cases of child labour. It handled 170,000 such calls in the same period of 2019.The 13-year-old boy who was working in the illegal shoe factory in Agra cannot be identified by name because Indian law forbids naming suspected victims of child labour and trafficking.He was working 12-14 hours a day attaching the rubber soles of shoes with glue in a small cramped room, with little food and water when police rescued him and other children in September.He was sent home to Bahraich, a rural town in India’s heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, some 460 kilometers (285 miles) from Agra, with help from the Children’s Welfare Committee, a government body that provides care and protection for children in need.But with schools closed and his father struggling to feed his four children, the boy went back to work, this time on a farm in his village.In India, children under 14 are not allowed to work except in family businesses and farms. They are also barred from dangerous workplaces such as construction sites, brick kilns, and chemical factories.The country has made serious gains in combatting child labour, but more than 10 million Indian children are still in some form of servitude, according to UNICEF.At the height of the pandemic, which has infected more than 9.5 million Indians and killed more than 138,000, the 13-year-old’s father, Sukhai Ram, a landless farmer from the lower end of India’s unforgiving caste system, was jobless and worried.One day, he met a man who promised to give Ram’s son a job paying about $60 a month. Ultimately, the family only got one month’s pay for the two months the boy worked there before he was rescued.“I was swayed by those words and allowed him to take my son to the city,” Ram said.In many cases, families know the child traffickers, said Surya Pratap Mishra, a children’s rights activist.In some Uttar Pradesh villages, traffickers distributed free food to impoverished families during the pandemic lockdown, which lasted 68 days. Having earned the confidence of the villagers, they offered to give their children jobs in big cities.“As the villagers knew these people, they agreed and sent their children with them,” said Mishra.Many did not return for months and were sent home only after being rescued by the authorities and nonprofit groups. Some have not yet been found.In July, India’s Home Ministry redoubled its fight against the resurgence of child labour, issuing guidelines for urgently setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units in every district. Many Indian states have flouted that advisory.Ajit Singh, a child rights activist in Uttar Pradesh, said the government’s efforts to protect children since the pandemic began have been abysmal.Most of India’s elementary and middle schools are still closed because of the pandemic, affecting more than 200 million children. Teachers visit families to check in with students, but online learning is beyond the reach of millions of families that can’t afford smartphones or laptops.One recent morning in a suburb of the capital, New Delhi, Mohammad Shahzad watched with concern as his 14-year-old son shouldered a heavy bag of sand at a construction site.“Keep your body stiff. Else it’ll fall,” Shahzad shouted as the boy, a seventh-grader, headed barefoot into the building. At least four other children were working alongside their parents.With schools closed, the boy will keep working, Shahzad said.“There is already very little work. If he won’t help us in these trying times, we won’t have enough to eat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-threatens-india-s-children-with-child-labour-rising/story-430qFwNJShHxjeOLNYpXJJ.html

The digitisation process of the Elector’s Photo Identity Card (EPIC) could begin before the next round of assembly elections to be held in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, which are due before May next year. The EPIC is presently available in form of a hardcopy and may now be available as a PDF file. The modalities of how the scheme will work are still being finalised, the people said, requesting anonymity. The digitisation of the card will help do away with printing costs. The proposal will have to be approved by the chief election commissioner, Sunil Arora, and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar before it is implemented. There are nearly 911 million eligible voters registered with the Commission, according to 2019 data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-considers-proposal-for-digitisation-of-voter-ids/story-pNgryYFJSwEi5h2KgHzy8H.html

12-12-2020||India||5 years on, where India stands in its commitment to Paris Agreement||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the landmark Paris Agreement. The virtual summit is being hosted by the United Nations (UN) and the United Kingdom and is being co-hosted by France in partnership with Chile and Italy. This will be an opportunity for countries to show their commitment to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change which was adopted by 196 parties at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris, on December 12, 2015, and was enforced on November 4, 2016.Here’s everything you need to know about India’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement: 1. While addressing a side meeting on climate change at the G20 Summit, PM Modi said India is not only meeting targets set at the Paris Agreement but is also exceeding them while calling for “an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way” to tackling climate change.2. In the G20 summit, Modi also said that India aims to restore around 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.3. Ahead of the Paris climate summit, environment minister Prakash Javadekar said, “Climate change hasn’t happened in a day. It is the result of historical emissions over one hundred years. US has 25% of historical emission; EU has 22% of historical emissions; China has 13% and India has only 3%. We haven’t caused this problem but as a responsible nation, we will be a part of the solution.” 4. Currently, India is contributing only 6.8% of global emissions and its per capita emissions are only 1.9 tonnes (per capita). 5. India’s nationally determined contribution (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement is 2 degree compliant. The country is also likely to meet and possibly overachieve its NDCs under the Paris Agreement, the emissions gap report 2020 noted. 6. The Modi government has repeatedly touted schemes as national plan on climate change; National clean air programme; Swachch Bharat mission; Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana; Namami Gange policy, etc, saying that they are helping India reach its climate goals. 7. India’s installed capacity of renewable energy has also increased by 226% in the past five years to over 89 GW now and India has a target of increasing installed renewable energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030.8. India is projected to meet its pre-2020 climate pledge, also called the Cancun pledge, made in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-years-on-where-india-stands-in-its-commitment-to-paris-agreement/story-M31plpICVbCP264U3q2h5L.html

12-12-2020||India||After a year’s break, fresh anti-CAA protests begin in Assam||After a year-long hiatus, a fresh round of protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was launched in Assam from Friday, months ahead of the next Assembly polls in the state. Protests against the legislation, which seeks to grant citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, had turned violent last year and five persons were killed in police firing. Many indigenous groups in Assam and other states in the region feel CAA would lead to an influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, which in turn could hurt indigenous communities. The fresh round of protests have been supported by 18 organisations including North East Students Organisation (NESO), All Assam Students Union (AASU), Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS). All student organizations in the seven northeastern states which are affiliated to NESO marked Friday as a Black Day. The organization had also observed Black Day on December 11 last year, the day CAA was passed by Rajya Sabha. “We won’t accept CAA at any cost. NESO had observed Black Day in all states in the region on December 11 last year and this year too we are registering our protest in the same manner on the same date,” said NESO chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya in Guwahati. KMSS, which had spearheaded the anti-CAA protests last year along with AASU and AJYCP, started their fresh round of protests on Thursday. The organization staged a large protest in Sivasagar on Friday which will be followed by a state-wide protest on Saturday. Also Read: Memorial for those killed in Assam Agitation, CM Sonowal lays foundation stoneFounder of KMSS, Akhil Gogoi, who was arrested on December 12 last year for allegedly fanning violent anti-CAA protests, continues to remain in jail. AASU’s protests began on Friday with a ‘gana hunkar’ (mass outcry) and torch rallies against the CAA while AJYCP also organised a rally against the legislation. The anti-CAA protests last year led to curfews across the state and suspension of mobile internet services for 10 days. But thousands defied restrictions and came out to voice opposition to the legislation. This year, AASU and AJYCP joined hands to form a new political party called Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) while KMSS launched another party called Raijor Dal. Both parties will be contesting the coming assembly polls in March-April next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-year-s-break-fresh-anti-caa-protests-begin-in-assam/story-8BFmVl25qUsClPMOLtk3AP.html

A faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union has moved the Supreme Court demanding the laws be rolled back. “The impugned legislations corporatise agriculture and usher in unregulated and exploitative regime because Indian farmers, of which most are illiterate, would not have the knowledge to negotiate the best terms with a private company and due to this [will] lead to unequal bargaining position in negotiating the farm agreements with corporates,” the plea said.5.

12-12-2020||India||India set to ask Pak for info on 7 Pulwama perpetrators||India has decided to formally ask Pakistan to share details of the terrorists behind last year’s Pulwama attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy, people familiar with the development said. The suicide bombing attack killed 40 Indian troopers and brought the two countries to the brink of a war. A formal judicial request or Letter Rogatory (LR), prepared by National Investigation Agency (NIA) seeking information about seven perpetrators, four based in Pakistan — Maulana Masood Azhar, his brothers Abdul Rauf Asghar and Ibrahim Athar, and his cousin Ammar Alvi — and three Pakistanis who came to India to execute the attack, Athar’s son Umar Farooq, Kamran (both killed in encounters with security forces after the Pulwama attack) and Ismail alias Saifullah, is currently being fine-tuned in the ministry of home affairs (MHA), the people added on condition of anonymity. Ismail is believed to be hiding in Kashmir. Also Read: Local explosives used to trigger Pulwama attackOnce MHA finalises the document, which the people said will be done by the end of the month, permission will be sought from the court to send the judicial request to Pakistan. “It’s first such judicial request being sent to Pakistan in the Pulwama attack seeking its cooperation,” said one of the people,a senior government official. Apart from whereabouts of Azhar, Asghar, Athar and Alvi, India is seeking details of communications between them and the others, including WhatsApp chats, voice notes and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls made from and to Pakistan, and information on persons seen in photographs and videos recovered from the phone of Umar Farooq , showing different stages of preparation of the Pulwama attack, the official added. Also Read: Pulwama case accused seeks bail to give NEET examFarooq was sent to India in April 2018 to supervise the February 14, 2019 Pulwama attack, which triggered the Indian Air Force (IAF) action against a Jaish terror camp deep inside Pakistan 12 days later, and resulted in a dogfight between fighter jets of the two nations on February 27. In its official request, the Indian government is also seeking information on the GPS locations extracted from Farooq’s phone as well as details of payments worth Rs10 lakh made into his accounts in Meezan Bank and Allied Bank in Pakistan, recovered by NIA during investigation, said a second officer. The NIA filed on August 25 a detailed 13,500 page charge sheet naming all seven Pakistanis including JeM chief, Masood Azhar, and 12 others for the Pulwama attack. “A strong judicial request, equipped with irrefutable technical, material and circumstantial evidence, is being sent to Pakistan. We hope that instead of sheltering them, Pakistan provides evidence and takes action against the Jaish chief and his family members,” said a second person, a MHA official. India has earlier sent judicial requests to Pakistan in 2016 Pathankot IAF base attack and 26/11 Mumbai attacks but to no avail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-ask-pak-for-info-on-7-pulwama-perpetrators/story-DfOzHxc6BDQngKPX2KtXDN.html

However, the government has maintained that it is still open to discussing the issues farmers have with the laws and address them.Also Read: Farm union moves SC seeking repeal of lawsThe protesting groups, which appear to have hardened their position, have said that on Saturday, December 12, farmers will block the Delhi-Jaipur highway.

12-12-2020||India||Top kabaddi players, wrestlers lead sporting twist to farm agitation||To get to the main stage at the massive farmer’s protest at the Singhu border between Haryana and Delhi, one has to go through a formidable man called Sukhjeet Singh. Built like a tank, with a neck as thick as a truck tyre, Sukha Bhandal, as he is better known, is one of India’s most celebrated Kabaddi players. In rural Punjab and Haryana, he is a household name. Songs are written about him. His other moniker is “sher” (lion) and he has sprawling lion tattoos on his back and arms. His annual earnings from tournaments easily makes him worth millions.“I was part of the protest from Day 1, when farmers started agitations at the district and state level,” he said. “Later, when they decided to march to Delhi on November 26, I joined them.” Sukhjeet is not the only sportsperson who is a part of the agitation; among the protesters at this border is a large contingent of some of the biggest stars of rural sports in northern India; kabaddi exponents and wrestlers who draw crowds in their thousands at dangals, the traditional kushti competitions.Vijender Singh, India’s first Olympic medallist in boxing, also went to the protest site on December 6. Unlike many of the other athletes at the site, he has clear political ambitions, but the man from a village called Kaluwas in Haryana is also intimately connected to farming. “There is no way that anyone from our rural areas would not be part of the protest,” Vijender said. “My grandfather was a subedar in the army and the one who brought boxing to our village. My brother Manoj fought in the Kargil war. My father was a driver with Haryana Roadways and I am into sports. But our entire family is linked to one common profession -- farming.” The protests have seen participation from several other mainstream sportspersons. On December 6, Kartar Singh (wrestling), Gurmail Singh, Rajbir Kaur and Ajit Singh (all hockey Olympians) and boxer Jaipal Singh shared the stage with Vijender and announced their intention of returning their Padma Shree, Arjuna, Dhyanchand and Dronacharya awards. Like Vijender, Sukhjeet, too, is deeply rooted to the land. Two decades back, when he was 14, he lost his parents in the space of a year. One of three siblings, he found himself alone at the family’s farm in Bhandal Dona village in Kapurthala. His sister had married and left, his brother had migrated to Germany. Despite their requests to join either of them, Sukhjeet decided to stay back and try his hand at managing the farm. It also allowed him to pursue his passion, kabaddi. “Farming has given me everything,” he said. “So how can I not be here?” If there’s one thing sportspeople know well, it’s organisation and team work. At the Singhu protest site, which sprawls nearly 15km along the highway, that collaborative discipline has been critical. When the protesters’ plan to march to Delhi was blocked, and the highway became the site of protest, the kabaddi players were involved in arranging for tents. “We entered Haryana on November 26 evening and our night halt was near the Panipat toll plaza. Next day, in the morning, we moved towards Delhi, but as the border was sealed, we had to stop at the Singhu border,” said Mangat Singh aka Mangi Bagga, who is as well-known as Sukhjeet. At the inaugural Circle Kabaddi World Cup (circle kabaddi is the more popular rural version of the sport in Punjab) in 2010, Mangat was the Indian captain. “We took help from our kabaddi friends in Haryana and arranged for tents and material for the stage.”Kabaddi players and wrestlers from Sonepat (Singhu border falls in Sonepat), India’s pre-eminent wrestling belt, also pitched in with public address systems. Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian, who came to Singhu with his colleague Sultan Samspur, driving a truck packed with fruits meant for distribution at the protest site, said “senior kabaddi players have made an appeal to all the players to join the protest. At any given time at Singhu and Tikri borders, you would see more than 100 kabaddi players and other athletes giving their services to the movement.” Athletes from the famed wrestling village of Mandothi, near Haryana’s border with Delhi at Tikri, which has turned into another protest site, are running a kitchen. “It’s a fight for a common cause,” said kabaddi player Viney Khatri, 23, whose village Kharak Jatan in Rohtak is 80km from Tikri border. Wrestling and kabaddi enjoy immense cultural popularity and a thriving socio-economic niche in rural northern India. The overseas (Canada, England, US) and domestic circuit of circle kabaddi is valued at approximately Rs100 crore just in terms of the prize money on offer, according to Sandhu and several athletes. This year, both the season and its robust economy was left in tatters by the pandemic. The foreign season was cancelled in its entirety, while the domestic season limped into action late in October with a heavily reduced calendar. The farmer protests have meant that even this diminished season has been further curtailed. “If the farmers prosper, then the village will prosper and only then can we (athletes) earn well,” said Mangat. “So, the economic cycle begins with the farmers, We have requested the players and organizers to put a hold to tournaments. Right now, this movement is more important than kabaddi.” Jaskanwar, who is a mountain of a man with a full beard and a luxurious moustache upturned at the ends said that with his entire family involved in protests, he found it hard to think about sports.“I have sent my refusal to many dangals,” he said. “We can earn later, but for us, this is a revolution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-kabaddi-players-wrestlers-lead-sporting-twist-to-farm-agitation/story-oDHLn4o7YNrbI2Q1Taq1dO.html
12-12-2020||India||Farm union moves SC seeking repeal of laws||A faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), one of the farmers’ groups at the vanguard of the protests against three Central laws enacted to open up agricultural trade, has moved the Supreme Court demanding that the laws be rolled back, citing concerns that they would give multinational companies a free handto exploit poor and illiterate farmers.In an application and a separate petition filed on December 9, BKU (Bhanu), led by Bhanu Pratap Singh, said the laws will make farmers vulnerable to the corporate greed of multinationals, as the central government on Friday made the second appeal in two days to farmers groups to resume talks to end the standoff. “The impugned legislations corporatise agriculture and usher in unregulated and exploitative regime because Indian farmers, of which most are illiterate, would not have the knowledge to negotiate the best terms with a private company and due to this [will] lead to unequal bargaining position in negotiating the farm agreements with corporates,” said the plea.The recent laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers. The petition by BKU Bhanu to repeal the laws are among a clutch of other petitions already pending in the Supreme Court against the farm laws, including one moved by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (CMK) MP Tiruchi Siva and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Jha. BKU Bhanu has sought the court’s permission to be impleaded as an “intervener” in the petition already filed by Siva against the three farm laws. Thousands of farmers who are camping on Delhi’s borders said on Friday that they were in the process of intensifying their agitation, and will block the Delhi-Jaipur highway on December 12 as well as occupy toll plazas, even as Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar made a second appeal in 24 hours to farm unions to resume talks with the government. “Any law is never entirely bad or good. Therefore, we have come out with amendments on provisions which during discussions the farmers had apprehensions about,” Tomar had said on Thursday. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the common platform under which several farm unions are protesting against the farm laws and recently held talks with the Centre, said the BKU Bhanu faction was not one of its constituents and its decision to approach the SC was its independent decision. But its leaders indicated that they were not against the idea of the faction moving court.“We are with [petitioner] Bhanu Pratap Singhji. Everybody has a right to move to court,” said Rakesh Tikait of the BKU’s Tikait faction, which is part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.“The BKU’s Bhanu faction is not one of our constituents and we are not associated with their legal processes. They are against the farm laws and have sought to be impleaded in an ongoing case. That’s their choice,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, another prominent leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.In its plea, BKU (Bhanu) has compared corporate entities with “unscrupulous money lenders who would twist the words in their contracts, making it unfavourable for farmers.” The plea added that implementation of the three laws in their present form will spell disaster for the farming community by opening a parallel market that is unregulated and leave room for exploitation of Indian farmers. Supporting the continuation of agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) as a “protective shield” around the farmers, BKU Bhanu maintained that without APMCs, the market would ultimately fall to the corporate greed of multinational companies that are profit-oriented. The Bhanu faction holds influence over sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh as well as agriculturists in Rajasthan, one of the largest growers of millets and spices. “The government is saying [let’s find a] ‘middle path…middle path’. What middle path? The government is there because we voted them. We voted the Congress out. So, they have to listen to us,” said Bhanu Pratap Singh, the leader of BKU Bhanu. Singh said the farm-reform laws would lead to a collapse of the notified markets and these “markets would fall to the greed of MNCs who are profit oriented”. A large number of supporters of the BKU Bhanu faction are camping on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. The recent laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. The government has deregulated farm markets, giving more space to private traders, to spur investments in a farm sector dependent on subsidies. Thousands of farmers are protesting the new changes, saying they will be swallowed up by big corporations. Offering to make concession, the government had sent out a written proposal to amend The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 to bring parity between so-called free markets and notified markets controlled by state governments. Another key offer is to bring additional legal safeguards for farmers’ rights engaging in contract farming “if needed”, including a bar on any confiscation of farm land to recover dues, and possible immunity to farmers from penalties for crop-residue burning, which causes pollution. The government had also proposed to keep farmers out of a law to impose penalties for stubble burning. It has also said that the existing mode of subsidising electricity for agricultural use will continue as demanded by the farm unions. The government in its written proposal had also said it was willing to issue a written assurance that the current system of minimum support prices would continue as usual. “The courts will obviously take a view, whatever that is. How far it will go in matters of policy execution is not clear now. There were similar petitions in Supreme Court against some decisions taken during the economic reforms in 1991,” said K Mani, a former economist at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Talks between the government and farmers union have broken down, with farmers calling off the sixth round of negotiations slated for December 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-union-moves-sc-seeking-repeal-of-laws/story-cxTcvq2MvwlrY9dYShTirM.html
12-12-2020||India||Cannot cure all ills of system, says top court||The Supreme Court on Friday said that the responsibility of curing all the ills of society doesn’t rest solely with the judiciary, and appeared to suggest that the executive and legislative wings were not always keen on stronger laws to control corruption.A bench headed by justice Sanjay K Kaul added that it was not possible for the judiciary to take over all the roles and entertain petitions with “Utopian” prayers. “You are all asking for a Utopian situations, and Utopia doesn’t exist. For every person getting illicit money, there is one person distributing it,” said the bench, as it took up two separate public interest litigations filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay relating to corruption. In the first petition, Upadhyay pressed for life imprisonment in cases of black money, corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, food adulteration and cheating. Arguing for the plea, senior advocate Gopal Sanakaranarayan rued the lack of will on the part of the government to come up with more stringent measures, pointing out that the target of corruption appears to be within the executive wing. The bench responded that there could be some substance in what the lawyer has to say, but it is not for the court to ask Parliament to frame a specific law on punishment for a certain category of crimes. “You may be right in saying it that the executive wing might not be keen to frame stringent laws but can we be entertaining a petition such as this? This court administers law. It is for Parliament to make laws. We cannot issue a mandamus to Parliament to make a law,” it said. When there is no vacuum in law, said the bench, it is not for a constitutional court to entertain “all-encompassing” prayers in a petition asking for a declaration in the nature that all is not well in the country. “Curing all the ills in the system does not prevail only with the judiciary. There are executive and legislative wings too with specific roles. You cannot expect judiciary to take over all roles and do everything. It is impossible. It is never envisaged in the Constitution nor desirable,” commented the bench. Sankaranarayan chose to withdraw the PIL with the liberty to go to the Law Commission for examining the issue of enhanced punishment in corruption-related cases. Upadhyay’s second PIL before the same bench was listed as the next matter. It pleaded for a direction to the Centre for handing hand over the 1993 report of the Vohra Committee to various Central agencies for a comprehensive probe. Upadhyay complained there has been no follow-up on the report submitted by then Union home secretary NN Vohra on the alleged link between crime syndicates, politicians and bureaucrats. “...You are making these kinds of prayers. Write a book on it. Don’t file petitions like this. One can understand cases where a nudge can be given to government authorities but not with such Utopian prayers,” said the bench, as Upadhyay opted to withdraw the PIL with liberty to approach Law Commission first. Vineet Narain, a noted anti-corruption activist, said, “The Supreme Court is right in saying that judiciary can’t change everything by itself. When the majority of politicians and bureaucrats seem to be shirking their duties in tackling corruption and have rather become a cause of it, one cannot expect judiciary to do wonders. These changes must begin as a society and then we can demand stronger laws...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-cure-all-ills-of-system-says-top-court/story-RKE5TmnnSEA4ByAWXqPclK.html

12-12-2020||India||In memoir, Pranab blames Manmohan, Sonia for Cong’s defeat, says Modi govt’s first term autocratic||A soon-to-be-released autobiography by former President Pranab Mukherjee blames Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the party’s devastating loss in the 2014 general elections, and contends that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed an autocratic style of governance during his first term in power, the book’s publisher announced on Friday. Mukherjee, who was a senior minister in the United Progressive Alliance government and the Congress party’s chief troubleshooter before his term as President between 2012 and 2017, died in August. His new book, The Presidential Years, is the fourth volume of his memoirs and will be released in January 2021. The statements attributed to Mukherjee are from a statement released by Rupa books on Friday. HT has not seen a copy of the book or directly verified the excerpts, which are yet to be released.“While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary,” he wrote, according to the statement. “Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government.”According to the statement, the former President — whose 85th birth anniversary was celebrated on Friday — wrote in his first-person account that he believed the moral authority to govern was vested with the PM and the state of the nation was always reflective of the functioning of the PM and their administration. Mukherjee, who was a senior leader of the Congress party for five decades and held almost every senior position in the party and central government, had strong words for his party’s functioning. “I do believe that the party’s leadership lost political focus after my elevation as president. While Sonia Gandhi was unable to handle the affairs of the party, Dr Singh’s prolonged absence from the House put an end to any personal contact with other MPs,” he wrote. In the 2014 general election, the Congress slumped to its worst performance and won only 44 of 543 Lok Sabha seats. He wrote that there was section of leaders who believed that if he was elevated as PM in 2004 — when the Congress stitched together a coalition to snatch power with an unexpectedly strong showing in the general elections — the party’s poor performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls could have been averted. But, he added, he did not subscribe to this view.Mukherjee’s memoir comes amid a firestorm raging within the Congress over its internal processes as senior leaders publicly express their displeasure following a series of electoral reverses. In August, a group of 23 leaders wrote to party chief Gandhi demanding internal reforms. Leaders from the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to comment. In the book – replete with rare photos and handwritten notes, according to Rupa – Mukherjee also touched on the diplomatic tension that apparently flared up during the visit of US President Barack Obama in 2015 when the US Secret Service insisted Obama travel in a specially armoured vehicle brought from the US, and not in the car designated for use by the Indian head of state.“They wanted me to travel in the same armoured car along with Obama. I politely but firmly refused to do so, and requested the MEA to inform the US authorities that when the US president travels with the Indian president in India, he would have to trust our security arrangements. It cannot be the other way around,” he said, according to the statement.The memoir, the publisher said, also focused on his journey from a remote village in Bengal to Rashtrapati Bhavan, and how he reshaped the presidency, the Rupa statement added. The book also recollected the challenges he faced as President, the difficult decisions he made and the tightrope walk he undertook to ensure that both constitutional propriety and his opinion were taken into consideration.“If he were still alive, he would have been thrilled to note the widespread excitement among readers to read this extremely well-written autobiography. It’s so personal in tone that to me it almost seems like the former President is sitting in his study with a cup of tea (and shingara) and narrating his story,” said Kapish G Mehra, managing director, Rupa Publications India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-memoir-pranab-blames-manmohan-sonia-for-cong-s-defeat-says-modi-govt-s-first-term-autocratic/story-58tKPX7Nq6ROstKc08CDeO.html

12-12-2020||India||‘Independent ties with countries’: India pushes back against Russian minister’s comments||New Delhi on Friday pushed back against the Russian foreign minister’s stand that the West’s Indo-Pacific policies were aimed at enmeshing India in “anti-China games”, saying the country has an independent foreign policy based on its national interests.India’s long-standing ties with Russia, including in the sphere of military-technical cooperation, stand on their own merits and New Delhi doesn’t perceive the Indo-Pacific as an exclusive club directed against any country, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov had created a flutter in diplomatic circles by telling a meeting of state-run think tank Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday that Western powers were promoting the Indo-Pacific strategy and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad to engage India in “anti-China games”. At the same time, Lavrov said, the West is trying to undermine Russia’s partnership with India.Asked about these remarks at a weekly news briefing, Srivastava said, “India has always pursued an independent foreign policy based on its national interest. India’s relationship with each country is independent of its relations with third countries.”Also read: Situation at border over last 6 months result of China’s actions - IndiaHe added, “We hope that this is well understood and appreciated by all our partners.”India’s position on the Indo-Pacific had been “unequivocally outlined” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018. “India does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a strategy or as a club of limited members or as a grouping that seeks to dominate. It is not directed against any country. It stands for a free, open and inclusive region,” Srivastava said.While addressing the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow, Lavrov had also said that the “very tough pressure” from the US on India concerning military-technical cooperation is part of the efforts to undermine the partnership with Russia. The remarks were apparently a reference to the US threat of imposing sanctions on India under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems. However, Srivastava said India’s long-standing relations with Russia were characterised as a “special and privileged strategic partnership”, and 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of this strategic partnership. “Our relations with Russia stand on their own merits, including in the sphere of military-technical cooperation,” he said. Russia currently accounts for more than 60 per cent of the inventory of India’s armed forces despite New Delhi’s efforts to acquire weapon systems from more diverse sources, including the US, Israel and France. The US has pushed India in recent years to acquire more American military hardware.While India has acquired platforms such as Chinook and Apache helicopters and C-17 heavy lift aircraft and leased MQ-9B Sea Guardian drones from the US, it has also inked big-ticket deals with Russia for acquiring the S-400 systems and assault rifles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-ties-with-countries-india-pushes-back-against-russian-minister-s-comments/story-bseCNBUpPiNP29AUPgdRNP.html
12-12-2020||India||‘It’s a blessing to be known by your character’s name’||Actor Shaji Choudhary became a household name playing Maqbool in ‘Mirzapur’ but when he was offered the role he had refused it point blank. “I was fed-up with playing right-hand man in films as well as shows. So, I did refuse but its co-director Gurmmeet Singh convinced me that the character has a lot of potential as the show proceeds. And today I’m happy that it became my most successful show,” said Shaji. He has been seen playing Saurabh Shukla’s bodyguard in ‘PK’, Manoj Bajpai’s right hand in ‘Tevar’ and Kabir Bedi’s aide in ‘Mohenjo-daro’. The ‘Jodha Akbar’ actor recently wrapped shooting for Sanjiv Jaiswal’s next film ‘Bagawat’ in Lucknow. “For an actor, the biggest feat is when people remember him with his character’s name — Mogambo, Shakal... I feel blessed to have witnessed something similar. Many may feel that it’s an overnight fame but actually it’s a result of 17 years of hard work — first as a model and then as an actor,” he shares. Talking more about his journey he tells, “I was born in Dodwari village in Tonk, (Rajasthan). Bitten by acting bug, I started with local Ram Lila before shifting to Jaipur. Due to my personality, people encouraged me and I took up modelling. I came to Mumbai in 2003. A year later, I got a role in ‘Main Hoon Na’ and then my most noticeable role was of Adham Khan in ‘Jodha Akbar’ (2007) which helped me survive.” In between he did TV shows like ‘Phulwa’, ‘Doli Arman Ki’, ‘Shani Dev’, ‘Vikram Betal’ along with films ‘Thugs of Hindostan’ and ‘Kabil’. In ‘Bagawat’ Shaji plays a negative role, “I’ll be seen playing Ahem’s (Sharma) father. In 2010 I have shot ‘Shudra’ film in Lucknow, then I shot ‘Mirzapur’ here and now ‘Bagawat’ I was here for a month. It was good fun as once again I got a chance to try horse riding. Being in Lucknow feels as if I’m in my hometown because it’s culture is very close to my state. God-willing, I may come for another project soon.” Post lockdown Shaji has shot for ‘Mirzapur-2’ teaser and is currently shooting for a mega project in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-a-blessing-to-be-known-by-your-character-s-name/story-HX1d3a1pgS8LkISuNcy6nL.html
12-12-2020||India||Extreme weather events impact 75% of India’s districts: Report||A new report has found more than 75% of India’s districts are hot spots of extreme climate events. With an unusual spike in extreme events since 2005, these districts are bearing the effects of changing microclimate with loss of property, livelihoods and lives.Coming on the heels of United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report 2020 that warned on Wednesday that the world was heading for a temperature rise of over 3 degree C this century, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) report has highlighted that even with a 0.6 degree C rise in temperature over the past century, India is facing devastating consequences.While India witnessed 250 extreme climate events (drought, floods, cyclones and compounding events like floods and cyclones) between 1970 and 2005, it recorded 310 extreme weather events after 2005. The report released on Thursday also found a shift in the pattern of extreme climate events such as flood-prone areas becoming drought-prone and vice-versa in over 40% of the districts.The pattern reflects what’s happening globally: Extreme weather events resulting from climate change led to 495,000 human deaths across the world in 1999–2018. More than 12,000 extreme weather events led to losses worth USD 3.54 trillion (measured in terms of purchasing power parity or PPP) during this period.The CEEW report titled: Preparing India for Extreme Climate Events has estimated that 97.51 million people are exposed to extreme floods in India. There has been an abrupt surge in the number of extreme flood events since 2005. Between 1970 and 2004, 3 extreme flood events occurred per year on average, but after 2005, the yearly average rose to 11. Similarly, the annual average for districts affected by floods until 2005 was 19, but after 2005 it jumped to 55.The year-wise analysis shows how changes in microclimate processes have altered the frequency and pattern of extreme flood events. Six of India’s eight most flood-prone districts in the last decade -- Barpeta, Darrang, Dhemaji, Goalpara, Golaghat, Sivasagar -- were in Assam.Also read | Low carbon recovery from Covid-19 slowdown can solve climate crisis, says reportAfter 2005, the yearly average number of districts affected by cyclones tripled and the cyclone frequency doubled. In the past decade, 258 districts were affected by cylones with hot spot districts being Chennai, Cuttack, East Godavari, Ganjam, Nellore, North 24 Parganas, Puri, and Srikakulam – all along the eastern coastline. The east coast’s warming regional microclimate, land-use change, and degrading forests are triggering the region’s cyclonic activity, the author has said.The analysis shows that the decade 2000–2009 showed a spike in extreme flood events and in associated flood events, which affected almost 473 districts. The compounding effects of land subsidence, the urban heat island phenomenon, and sea-level rise due to glacial melts are leading to the intensification of cyclonic disturbances, thus increasing the number of flood events experienced during the decade and making it an outlier.Some of the extreme events are also associated with the weakening of monsoon. “The empirical evidence generated from our analyses coincides with the weakening of monsoons due to rising micro-temperatures. This further can be validated by the fact that states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh saw severe water scarcity during 2015 due to record-breaking temperatures during summer and weakening monsoons,” the report states.An interesting trend that the report has highlighted is swapping of the nature of extreme events in some districts. Several traditionally flood prone districts such as Cuttack, Guntur, Kurnool, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Paschim Champaran, and Srikakulum are becoming drought prone in recent years. Coastal southern Indian states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka are increasingly witnessing more droughts. Further, floods and droughts coincide during the same season in several districts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu.“I agree with the findings of the report. I will not be able to comment on the exact numbers immediately though. In general, there is a spike in extreme weather events particularly extreme rainfall and heat wave events. Changes are being seen in the spatial pattern of extreme weather events also. Our climate models are showing that these trends will continue for the next few years so we need to worry,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.“These changing patterns are due to micro-climatic changes across the Indian subcontinent that are triggered by local climate change drivers such as land-use-surface change, deforestation, encroachments upon mangroves, and wetlands,” the report adds.The author of the report, Abinash Mohanty has coupled information available from globally validated data sheets with data from other sources like the India Meteorological Department, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and Press Information Bureau (PIB). The team has then developed a gridded exposure sheet of climate events; and a geospatial analysis of extreme climate events using coarse grain resolution temporal maps.Mohanty recommends micro-level hazard assessment of climate extremes in India and comprehensive risk assessments at the localised level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-weather-events-impact-75-of-india-s-districts-report/story-x2YiYDP0JbapvhXpmaIlOK.html
