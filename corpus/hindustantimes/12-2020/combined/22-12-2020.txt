22-12-2020||News||The next step for Quad: A dialogue on high tech||T-12 is the new G-7. We are not talking about your airport boarding gates. T-12, Tech-10, Democracy-10 are some proposed multilateral mechanisms to enable international cooperation in technology governance. Cooperation, however, won’t be easy because there is significant dissonance even amongst democracies on issues such as competition in the digital economy, privacy, and data governance. The European Union (EU) prefers a regulation-heavy approach centred on protecting users’ data; the United States (US) prefers a less-restrictive approach allowing technology companies to gain scale; and India is considering data localisation measures. Such divergent outlooks run the risk of derailing collaboration.From an Indian perspective, a more useful way of structuring these collaborations is to extend an existing politico-military arrangement such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) to the technology sphere, starting with securing the semiconductor supply chain first. Negotiations are more likely to bear fruit since Quad countries have a clear political end goal — to resist China’s not-so-peaceful rise. Building a semiconductor supply chain as the first initiative matters for three reasons. One, the semiconductor industry underlies all critical technologies. Two, it is perhaps the most globalised high-value supply chain and no country can become entirely self-resilient. And three, all four countries have complementary strengths in the semiconductor supply chain.The US is a dominant force in chip design — a stage responsible for specifying how transistors are placed inside a semiconductor chip. Four of the world’s top 10 fabless chip makers are American. Further, chips designing requires electronic design automation (EDA) tools, the market for which is quite concentrated because of high R&D requirements. Here again, all three major EDA players are located in the US. The next primary stage in the process, semiconductor manufacturing, requires a high degree of precision and capital investment. True to their reputation, a few Japanese companies dominate the global market in crucial semiconductor manufacturing equipment and chemicals. These companies are renowned for their high-quality products, and their expertise is not easily replaceable.Australia does not have a significant semiconductor industry but it is set to play a vital role in the high-tech electronics industry of the future. It is the world’s largest producer of lithium, an element used for making rechargeable batteries present in electric vehicles, phones, and laptops. Australia is also one of the world’s leading suppliers of Neodymium, used in powerful electromagnets that are critical for electric vehicles. And India is one of the major global hubs for chip design. Annually, 3,000 chips are designed in India. Most top foreign semiconductor companies have established their design and R&D centres due to the availability of a large talent pool. India also has proven excellence with electronics end-product assembly. For instance, Foxconn recently announced its intent to invest in India while Samsung this year built the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Delhi.None of these countries can build a self-resilient semiconductor supply chain, but as a collective, the Quad is a force to reckon with. The missing ingredient is a foundry that can manufacture advanced chips below the 5-nanometer process node. Building such a foundry requires significant risk capital, between $12bn-$20bn. Here too, Quad countries can form a consortium to fund a semiconductor foundry in one of the four countries, de-risking the considerable upfront investment.Realising the potential of the Quad also needs agreement on some trade issues. Encouraging movement of skilled professionals, building confidence in each other’s judicial settlement mechanisms, developing common standards, and allowing knowledge transfer on sophisticated technology issues are crucial for success. Our colleague, Nitin Pai, likens these initiatives to creating “bubbles of trust”. Democratic states have come to the right conclusion that going it alone in the realm of high-tech geopolitics is unrewarding. India should use this change in thinking to expand its role in the global high-tech value chain. A Quad Silicon Dialogue can be one such start.Pranay Kotasthane and Rohan Seth work on high-tech geopolitics at the Takshashila Institution.

22-12-2020||Mumbai||Protests staged in Mumbai to oppose Center’s farm laws and express solidarity with farmers||Over 35 social, political, farmer organisations, trade and labour unions on Tuesday organised a peaceful protest at the suburban collector’s office in Bandra, to show solidarity with farmers protesting in Delhi for the past three weeks. Tuesday’s protests, called Lok Sangharsha Morcha, were directed at corporate conglomerates, alleging the Central government has passed the three farm laws for the benefit of these corporates. Political outfits such as the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) and Prahar Janshakti Party also participated in the protests, with leaders including member of legislative Council (MLC) Jayant Patil and former member of Parliament (MP) Raju Shetti from Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna leading the protests, along with members from Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) Maharashtra and Narmada Bachao Andolan. Over 5,000 people are estimated to be present at the protests, according to the organisers and police estimates. Representatives of farmers from Punjab and Haryana were also present at the protest.The march commenced from the suburban collector’s office at Bandra at 3pm on Tuesday, preceded by a public meeting. The massive farmers’ protest in Delhi was set off by three controversial laws pushed through Parliament by the government in September. These allow agri-businesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale, and lay down new contract farming rules. Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business, gut the mandi system and gradually end the regime of minimum support prices (MSP) that acts as a protective net for cultivators. “We organised Tuesday’s protests to show solidarity with farmers protesting in Delhi. This issue not only affects Delhi’s farmers but farmers all across the country. The government is not keen to even initiate dialogue with protesting farmers, so we are now channelling our protests to the root of the issue – the corporates who will benefit from the three laws,” said MP Shetti.Farmers and labourers from various parts of Maharashtra – Dhule, Nashik, Parbhani, Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara, Latur, Aurangabad, Thane, and Palghar – were present for the protest. “It is very difficult to reach Mumbai as trains are not working. These farmers have organised their own vehicles and busses to reach Mumbai for the protests,” Shetty added. Trade unions have also decided to issue a notice to corporate firms. On December 29, press conferences will be held at six industrial centres in Maharashtra – Nagpur, Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Mumbai, and Nashik – to urge corporates to relay the farmers’ demands to the government. Vivek Montero, Maharashtra secretary of CITU, said, “Since the Prime Minister (PM) listens to corporate monopolies, we believe that if the request goes from them to the PM, he is likely to listen to the demands. These three laws were passed to facilitate businesses of large corporates looking to expand into the agriculture sector.” Other farmers from Maharashtra-led by the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), which started the vehicle march to Delhi from Nashik on Monday afternoon, were on Tuesday joined by leaders from all political parties including the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Shiv Sena, the Samajwadi Party, the Janata Dal (Secular), the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Ashok Dhawale, president of AIKS said, “On Tuesday, all parties except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) joined us at Dhule, Malegaon and Shirpur. Local leaders from these parties marched with the farmers.”The farmers entered Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday morning and will reach the Rajasthan-Haryana border on December 24, after covering a distance of 1,266km by road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/protests-staged-in-mumbai-to-oppose-center-s-farm-laws-and-express-solidarity-with-farmers/story-bihY2M4XpJk02j0HWpUMpI.html

22-12-2020||Noida||Protesters block Delhi-Meerut e-way at border for 10 hours, inner lanes jammed||Ghaziabad: Protesting farmers at UP Gate blocked carriageways between Delhi and Ghaziabad of the Delhi-Meerut-Expressway (DME) on both sides, and the National Highway 9 for about 10 hours on Tuesday, which resulted in massive traffic jams and inconvenience to local residents and commuters. The blockade started at 7am and ended by 5pm, while the carriageway has continued to remain blocked since December 3.Thousands of farmers have been camping at UP Gate in Ghaziabad, near the Delhi border, since November 28 demanding complete rollback of the three new farm laws. Their leaders for the past couple of days have been alleging that farmers coming to join the protest in tractor-trolleys from Uttarakhand and other parts of Uttar Pradesh were stopped midway, and demanding that they be allowed to proceed. On Tuesday morning, protesting farmers blocked the carriageways by placing tractors. As the road was empty, some could be seen playing cricket over the empty lanes. After a marathon of discussions with officials, the blockade was lifted by 5pm from the carriageways. “The carriageway was vacated by the protesters and we have assured that all their issues will be taken up. They were demanding that their vehicles must not be stopped from approaching the UP Gate site from other areas in the state. However, we have to check vehicles in order to ascertain that no anti-social element gets in. We held discussions with other officers and got the issue resolved. The carriageway was vacated around 5pm,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range).The carriageway has been blocked thrice now –December 8, 14 and 21.Leaders of the farmers, however, denied blocking the highway. “We did not put any blockade; it was blocked by the police and this is causing inconvenience to our vehicles as well as to local commuters. Our tractor-trolleys are being stopped in different areas of UP. Our protest is going on peacefully and it is up to the government to pick a date, place and time for talks. We are waiting but we have not received any communication so far,” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that vehicles coming towards Ghaziabad were diverted through the Anand-Vihar/Kaushambi border route by the Delhi traffic police. “As part of the ongoing diversion, vehicles going to Delhi from Ghaziabad have been using the Kaushambi border route. On Tuesday, however, those coming to Ghaziabad from Delhi also had to use the same route as the carriageway was blocked by farmers,” he said.Delhi Police’s public relation officer, Anil Mittal, said that the carriageway going to Ghaziabad from Delhi was closed for vehicles after farmers blocked roads at the UP Gate border. “So, traffic was diverted from Nizamuddin Khattha, Akshardham and Ghazipur chowk for onwards journey towards Ghaziabad, via Anand Vihar, Apsara and Bhopra borders,” said Mittal. UP Gate – a border area between Ghaziabad and Delhi – sees about 80,000 passenger car units pass through every day, as per official estimates of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The authority’s officials estimate that the blockade on Tuesday could have affected about 50% of the traffic.The blockade resulted in massive jams at the Kaushambi border. Local residents said that even the internal lanes of Kaushambi Township were choked till 12.30pm on Tuesday. “On normal days, when there is a traffic diversion here, the jams last up to 11am but the volume of traffic increased manifold on Tuesday and there was chaos till 12.30pm. Due to the diversion, Kaushambi is already facing jams as people going to Delhi take any lane they can find,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartment residents’ welfare association.“Initially, I and some colleagues proceeded to Kaushambi border but we had to turn towards Sector 62, Noida due to heavy traffic, from where we headed to the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway to reach Delhi. Many commuters from Indirapuram faced traffic issues due to the blockade and some used the Hindon canal road to reach Ghazipur to enter Delhi,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a resident of Indirapuram who uses the stretch daily. The NH 9 starts from Akshardham in Delhi and goes up to Lucknow, while the inner six lanes of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) overlap the highway lanes up to Dasna in Ghaziabad. From Dasna, the DME goes up to Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/protesters-block-delhi-meerut-e-way-at-border-for-10-hours-inner-lanes-jammed/story-jcQUXqnEcKrCQ6LyQiSt3I.html
22-12-2020||Noida||Leaders want more farmers to be able to reach UP Gate, say agitation will be prolonged||Ghaziabad: Farmer leaders on Tuesday said that they want more volunteers to come to the UP Gate protest site, alleging that the authorities have been trying to prevent their farmers in tractor-trolleys making it to the site, a claim that the authorities have denied.The issue has been brewing for the past several days as farmers’ leaders at UP Gate resorted to blocking the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageways on both sides, on National Highway 9 on two consecutive days – Monday and Tuesday.The farmers, led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), came to UP Gate on November 28. In the following days, hundreds more joined them from Uttarakhand and Punjab. According to official estimates, initially the gathering was about 300-400, which has now swelled to about 1,200-1,500 or more, as more people come in during the day time. “Our vehicles are being stopped in areas like Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and others, and we raised the issue with officials several times. We want that more people should come here while the authorities have plans to not allow more people to gather here. It will be a long, peaceful protest and will go up to January 26. We have told our people back home to harvest the crop and sow the next one. We have come prepared for about three months,” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the BKU.At UP Gate, the protest area was initially confined to below the flyover, but it has now spilled on to the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway – from Hindon canal to the upper portion of the UP Gate flyover, which is a distance of about one kilometre. There are several kitchens, besides hundreds of tractor-trolleys and tents at the site, while farmers have started erecting newly-acquired tents over the UP Gate flyover. According to sources, about 50 more have come up since Monday.“These tents are designed to accommodate people in temperatures below five degrees Celsius. We have about 1,000 blankets in stock, as well as tents designed to provide a comfortable stay in temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius. All these have come as part of donations,” said a volunteer at the site.Police officers, meanwhile, said that they are in touch with other officers in the state to ensure that movement of farmers’ vehicles is not hampered. However, they said that they have to be on lookout for anti-social elements, which necessitates inspections.“There is a huge gathering at UP Gate and there are several leaders who are leading the protests. On our part, we have to ensure that no anti-social element gets in and creates unwanted situations. So, the gathering has to be in a manageable proportion. Otherwise, their leaders will blame us. We are ensuring checks but their numbers are on the rise,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). Protesters at UP Gate are demanding rollback of three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP) for crops.“All the pillars to support farmers have to be built anew. There is no question of accepting any amendment. We would like to know from the people who are supporting the laws how they are not being affected (by what is happening). We have also issued appeals that people should not use products of certain corporate houses who side with the government, and should even terminate contracts with them,” Rakesh Tikait, said adding that no “goonda” (unruly) element will be allowed at the UP Gate site.“Instead, people should use “desi” products. We know that this agitation is difficult but we will continue peacefully and for long,” he added. Tikait, a couple of days ago, had at UP Gate issued appeals to volunteers to come to site in rotation, so that work in fields does not get hampered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/leaders-want-more-farmers-to-be-able-to-reach-up-gate-say-agitation-will-be-prolonged/story-O3C65j2shQP1pWWbgBIp1J.html
22-12-2020||Noida||Noida farmers march in support of new bills, traffic comes to a halt at Greater Noida Expressway||Noida: Hundreds of local farmers from Dadri and Jewar on their way to Delhi to show their support for the three new farm laws on Monday afternoon were stopped near Mahamaya flyover, causing traffic to stall at the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.A group of over 250 farmers was on its way to the Noida-Delhi border when it was stopped by the police. Barricades were put up in the area and traffic was diverted internally towards the Kalindi Kunj route.“We had prior input about their movement so we diverted traffic from the Charkha cut. There was congestion on the expressway from around 2pm till 3.30 pm. But it was cleared steadily. We were constantly sharing updates with the public via social media. The delay was due to traffic spread over four lanes being constricted to two lanes because of the diversion,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.A senior police official said that the group had blocked off the main roads after they were stopped from proceeding towards Delhi.“More than a kilometre-long stretch of the expressway remained congested for over two hours. The farmers handed over their memorandum once they were stopped, after which they dispersed. But the group said that they will return soon. Traffic was affected but there was no law and order situation,” said the official, requesting to remain anonymous.Meanwhile, status quo was maintained at the Chilla border where farmers protesting the new laws are camped, blocking traffic from Noida to Delhi. Traffic in the area continues to be re-routed via the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway.Farmer leaders have urged the authorities not to stop their supporters from reaching Delhi.“With tomorrow being farmers’ day, our local representatives will hand over our memorandum of demands to officials. We are requesting authorities to not stop our people from reaching us in solidarity and until our demands are met, we will continue to protest,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Bhanu.Members of BKU’s Lok shakti faction are also camped at the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 2 and are being steadily joined by farmers from various districts in Uttar Pradesh.The Chilla border first closed on December 1 and opened on December 13, only to be closed again on December 16 after farmers alleged that their supporters were being illegally detained and harassed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-farmers-march-in-support-of-new-bills-traffic-comes-to-a-halt-at-greater-noida-expressway/story-mfUa222adCC4YnOnqTP5UK.html
22-12-2020||Noida||Noida forms committee to address local farmers’ demands over land compensation||NOIDA: Noida authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari has assured farmers that issues of farmers will be looked into and their grievances related to land compensation, Abadi area and residential plot allotment, among others, will be addressed.For this, the CEO has also formed a committee, headed by the additional CEO, which will suggest ways to make amends in the building regulation bylaws so that issues of Abadi (residential buildings) of farmers can be addressed.The move comes after a group of farmers protested against the authority at its administrative building in Sector 6 on Monday morning. They alleged that the authority has failed to address their genuine grievances that include Abadi areas in villages, hiked land compensation, residential plots against their acquired land, and development work in villages. Following the protest, the authority met with the farmers’ delegation and also discussed the issues with Noida MLA Pankaj Singh.“The authority will take up the issues of farmers on a priority basis with the state government so that a solution can be reached at the earliest. It will carry out developmental work in villages at par with urban sectors and also allot them residential plots in a new Sector 146,” said Maheshwari in a press statement.However, the farmers’ group said it is not satisfied with the authority’s assurances.“The authority is trying to destroy the villages as well as villagers who gave their land for the development of Noida city. Our demands are very simple – the authority must leave our houses (Abadi) without troubling us in the name of getting map approvals; pay land compensation to all farmers; allot residential plots uniformly; and allow registry in villages, as it was allowed earlier on all floors of a house, among others,” said Sukhbir Yadav, who led the protest against the authority.Yadav said that if the authority continues to demolish their houses in villages and label them unauthorised constructions then their agitation will continue.“We protested for a day against the authority on Monday and if they continue to harass us, we will protest once again,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-forms-committee-to-address-local-farmers-demands-over-land-compensation/story-hRlbAaXQ48glFPNaKLWs1N.html

22-12-2020||Noida||Akshay Kalra murder case: One more suspect arrested||Noida: A 28-year-old man, wanted in the murder of an engineering graduate in September in a carjacking incident, was apprehended by the Noida police on Monday night. With this, eight persons have been arrested in the murder case. The police said that one more suspect, the last one, is still at large.The eighth suspect, who was arrested from near a private hospital in Sector 62, has been identified as Ravi Singh, a native of Meerut. Incidentally, the victim, Akshay Kalra, was a resident of a high-rise in Sector 62. The murder had taken occurred on the intervening night of September 2 and 3, when Akshay Kalra, a resident of a high-rise in Sector 62, had left his home to visit a street food shop nearby in his Hyundai Creta. Kalra, the 24-year-old engineering graduate, was critically injured while resisting the car robbery near his house on the intervening night of September 2 and 3. The carjackers had fled with his SUV, a white Hyundai Creta. He was found barely a 100 metres from his home half an hour later in an injured state and was rushed to a private hospital where he succumbed to injuries on September 4. A case of robbery (section 394 of IPC) had been registered at Sector 58 police station against the unidentified suspects. Seven people had been arrested in connection with the murder on October 27. According to police officials, Ravi and his accomplice were living in Ghaziabad near the house of Vasukinath Tiwari, one of the suspects who was nabbed earlier. “Ravi and his accomplice were involved in the sale of stolen vehicles. Tiwari had approached them with the plan of a car theft. The deal for the Creta was done for Rs 1.3 lakh in Meerut,” said Anil Rajput, station house officer, Sector 58 police station.But the deal fell through because of disagreements in price and by then Tiwari and the other suspects had been nabbed by the Noida police, the police said. “Ravi’s accomplice is still on the run and is the last suspect in the case. We are working on nabbing him,” said the SHO.According to the police, Ravi has gone to jail in 2019 in connection to an abetment to suicide case in Meerut. He was booked for criminal conspiracy at Sector 58 police station before being produced in front of a magistrate and being sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/akshay-kalra-murder-case-one-more-suspect-arrested/story-SzHufMt9ydXgVKmLMM8kAM.html
22-12-2020||Noida||Noida road rage incident: Two held for death of 14-year-old boy||Noida: Two men in their late twenties were nabbed by the police on Monday in connection with the assault on a 14-year-old boy who succumbed to injuries on Sunday. The incident was reported on December 18 from the Naya Gaon area under Phase 2 police station. The victim, Rohit who was a class 8 student, was helping his elder brother with their vegetable cart at the time of the incident, the police said.The suspects were identified as Likhit Raghav and Ashish Singh, natives of Bulandshahr and Bijnore, respectively.According to the police, the suspects were on their motorcycle purchasing vegetables when Rohit’s cart hit their vehicle. This resulted in the duo abusing and manhandling the teenager, but after the intervention of other local vendors, they left the spot only to return a few minutes later armed with sticks, the police said.Police officials said that the two hit Rohit brutally with the sticks and fled the spot when other vendors called the police.“The boy was taken to a nearby primary health centre from where he was rushed to the district hospital in Sector 30. He was then referred to a higher centre in Delhi where he died during treatment on Sunday,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2.He said that the suspects were living in the same area and absconding since the incident.

The case pertains to the acquisition of agricultural land in Noida Extension, now known as Greater Noida West, for industrial use and allotment of the same to builders for residential purposes in 2009 without the approval of the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB).The irregularities had caused ₹7,000 crore loss to the Greater Noida authority, officials said, adding that the authority has asked the personnel department to take action against the 21 employees who were involved in changing the land use in violation of rules. “After the probe established irregularities, the UP industrial department has taken a decision to take disciplinary action that includes imposition of penalty and giving adverse entry to 21 officials, who were involved in the wrongdoing. We have directed the department of personnel to implement the state government’s order immediately,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.As per the state government’s order, these 21 employees will be deprived of annual 3-4% increment in their salary, fail to get promotion for rest of the job period and also get adverse entry in their confidential report.“Getting adverse entry in confidential report causes repercussions in career and it is considered a punishment for government employees,” said an official at the Greater Noida authority.These 21 employees include town planners, senior town planners, architects, and clerks, and most of them are still serving in the Greater Noida authority. These officials were posted at the Greater Noida authority during this land-use change and subsequent allotment to the developers.In 2011, the Allahabad high court had directed the then UP chief secretary to order a probe into the authority’s decision to implement its Master Plan 2021 without the approval of the NCRPB. However, the probe did not reach any logical conclusion and no action was taken in the eight years, the authority officials said.On June 11, 2019, the UP government appointed the Greater Noida authority additional chief executive officer KK Gupta to investigate this case. Gupta submitted the final report to the government on October 11 last year. On receipt of the final report, the UP government’s industrial and infrastructure department issued notices to 21 officials involved and asked them to file a reply in a week’s time. Now, the state government asked the Greater Noida authority to act as probe established irregularities, the officials said.The government had directed the authority to reinvestigate the case after Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh demanded action in the UP assembly against officials responsible for the ‘Noida Extension mess’. “During previous regime, no action was taken against the corrupt officials. It is good that after my demand, the probe established irregularities and fixed the onus to give a message that the corrupt will not be spared,” said Singh.Greater Noida West entrepreneur association president Vivek Raman said, “The irregularity shattered the image of this industrial town and also delayed dozens of housing projects. Now the government has taken disciplinary action only, that too after nine years. There must have been termination of job and criminal action against the officials involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-extension-mess-21-officials-face-disciplinary-action-as-probe-indicts-them-for-irregularities-in-change-of-land-use/story-EGos52ZLbJT5R6aVKaNcWN.html

The firms are mostly from steel manufacturing, information technology parks, logistics, chemicals, renewable energy and battery manufacturing sectors.With this, the state has managed to bring in investment of over ₹1 lakh crore in this year, a target set by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, said state industries minister Subhash Desai at the MoU event.In November, the state government signed MoUs worth ₹34,850 crore with 15 national and international firms. Earlier, in June it had signed MoUs worth ₹16,300 crore with 12 major companies, while inaugurating Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0 – the second instalment of the global investors’ summit, held in February 2018.CM Uddhav Thackeray and Desai used the event as an opportunity to take veiled potshots at Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath over his recent Mumbai visit to attract investment for the state.Without mentioning his name, the industries minister said, “Nowadays, we can see many hawkers coming to Maharashtra asking ‘UP lelo, Bihar lelo’ (take UP, take Bihar) but people end up investing in Maharashtra and it is being proven once again, even during the ongoing health pandemic.”Yogi Adityanath had recently faced a lot of flak for allegedly making attempts to lure the Hindi film industry to UP.“Some people come to make investments here, and some people come to take investments from here. However, this is not easy, as investors in the state and we [government] have a relationship almost like a family. Nobody would like to go from Maharashtra to other states. We would be there together with you [investors] at every step of the way,” Thackeray said.Desai also highlighted how the state was now appointing relationship managers for each investment project who would facilitate and liaison with government officials for various clearances till the entire project is realised.The biggest investment deal signed was with JSW Steel that is planning to expand its existing plant at Dolvi in Raigad district to the country’s largest steel plant, to a capacity of 14 MPTA (million tonne per annum) with an investment of ₹20,000 crore. Another steel manufacturer, Kirtikumar Steel Udyog, has proposed a ₹7,000 crore plant at Wada in Thane. Indian Corporation Logistics plans to make an investment of ₹11,049 crore at Bhiwandi in Thane, Inspira Infra Limited will invest ₹7,500 crore at a plant in Aurangabad, K Raheja will invest ₹7,500 crore in the IT industry at Thane, and Exide batteries is planning to invest ₹500 crore in a plant at Phaltan in Satara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-signs-mous-worth-61-042-crore-with-25-national-firms/story-fIzI2iPY6xLe7PYgJbxGgK.html

22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Senate elections: HC puts Panjab University on notice||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday put Panjab University on notice on a plea from seven ex-senators demanding senate election.The high court bench of justice Fateh Deep Singh acting on the plea by Keshav Malhotra and six others has sought response by January 12. The plea demands direction for holding senate polls and quashing August 15 orders of the PU vice-chancellor, whereby elections were deferred indefinitely. It also demands that the October 16 communication of the UT administration, asking PU to defer election, be set aside.The senate is the apex governing body of PU with 91 members, out of which 36 are nominated by the varsity’s chancellor. Its term ended on October 31.The plea alleges that certain individuals from the ruling political dispensation at the Centre in order to avoid an unsuccessful contest for polls initially pressurised the varsity to defer the elections and have now started another agenda for abolishing the senate. The plea says it should be examined whether the V-C can defer the senate elections without the syndicate’s approval, and further whether the affairs and governance of the varsity can be vested in the V-C in the absence of the two bodies.They have also demanded that record pertaining to this issue be summoned, and till the time elections are not held, the senate and such other bodies, including the syndicate, be allowed to function as they were before the expiry of their term. It was also demanded that the V-C be issued direction to convene ordinary meeting of the senate as prescribed in the law, as complete governance and superintendence of affairs of the varsity are vested with the senate and PU cannot be left without the apex governing body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/senate-elections-hc-puts-panjab-university-on-notice/story-ubOR6kzmVBGV39ZBPOUy6J.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||After objections, Chandigarh delimitation panel to rejig boundaries of some wards||Acting on objections raised by residents in a few areas, the ward delimitation committee has decided to reorganise boundaries of some of the newly proposed municipal corporation wards in Chandigarh.The UT administration on December 9 notified the draft notification for delimitation, increasing the number of wards from 26 to 35. In the committee’s meeting on Tuesday, around 180 objections made to the draft notification were examined and discussed. “We have proposed that certain urban-planned areas like Modern Housing Complex (Manimajra) and Sector 38 West be shifted out of the wards that mainly include rural and semi-urban areas,” said a UT official privy to the development.A final report will be prepared by the committee and it will be submitted to the administration for its final approval.Residents of Modern Housing Complex (MHC), duplex houses, Rajeev Vihar and Uppal Marbel Arch in Sector 13 (Manimajra), having a combined population of around 13,000, had objected to be clubbed with rural areas of Kishangarh and Bhagwanpura under the proposed ward number 4.“We had contended that there is no contiguity in the proposed ward. Urban and rural areas, which are non-contiguous, have been mixed up,” said Col Gursewak Singh (retd), president, resident welfare association (RWA), MHC.Another proposed ward, number 26, is likely to see its boundaries reworked. RWA of Sector 38 West had objected to being combined with Dadumajra Colony, Dadumajra village and Shahpur Colony. RWA president Pankaj Gupta said: “Sector 38W is currently with adjacent urban areas in ward number 8. It would lose its urban character if mixed with the semi-urban areas and rural areas.” “As delimitation exercise has been done keeping in mind similar nature of electorates in a ward, the delimitation committee has tried to maintain homogeneity of the population in a ward, keeping urban areas and rural areas in different wards,” said the UT official, on the condition of anonymity. “The sanctity of the nature of the population has been tried to be kept as much as possible. The demand of these areas were considered in sync with this and so changes are being proposed in the boundary of some of the new wards.”Currently, there are 26 wards in the MC, which cover the urban sectors and nine villages. The process has become crucial in the wake of the addition of 13 new villages under the jurisdiction of the MC.“All wards currently don’t have uniform population. This is being corrected through the latest delimitation process. But to keep the urban character of the city intact, the population in some wards will still be higher than in the other wards,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-objections-chandigarh-delimitation-panel-to-rejig-boundaries-of-some-wards/story-YEwfN3mmf1YAPDJlZ2qhYJ.html

It will enable those travelling towards Ludhiana from Chandigarh to use the flyover. “The entire flyover to Ludhiana side will be opened from December 25, which was earlier scheduled for December 31,” said Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain. “The Rupnagar link will be opened by January 15.”The 1-km Balongi stretch (called the Balongi flyover) was the first to be opened in October. With two links of the flyover now open, the project is 96% complete. The ₹368-crore project, being executed by Larsen & Toubro, was initiated in November 2015 and has missed six deadlines, after initially slated to be completed in three years by December 2018. It entails widening of the road between Balongi and Kharar T-point and construction of two flyovers and three minor bridges. The total length of the flyovers (divided into three parts) is around 10km. The national highway where the flyover is located connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab, besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck, as about 50,000 vehicles cross the stretch daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-kharar-flyover-sunny-enclave-underpass-to-be-opened-on-december-25/story-EyuGcZUGO2CtCLwm5s2GnM.html
22-12-2020||City||Covid impact: All 30 outlets shut up shop at Chandigarh airport||Even as Chandigarh International Airport resumed its operations for domestic flights post lockdown on May 25 this year, in the past seven months all 30 outlets on its premises, including of high-end brands, have ceased operations owing to huge losses. The company which was subletting the shops at the airport has pulled back, citing a loss of nearly ₹5 crore due to the pandemic. Now, the airport authorities are planning to rent out the shops directly, for which security clearance is awaited. Some of the brands that have shut up shop are British multinational toy retailer Hamleys, footwear maker Tresmode, clothing brands Toscee, Pehnawa and Manyavar and ayurveda brands Patanjali and Kama. Even Sindhi Sweets owned two stores at the departure and arrival. “Even we have suffered a loss of nearly ₹40 crore on various accounts in the past nine months. We will be renting out the shops directly and are waiting for security clearances,” said Ajay Bhardwaj, airport’s chief executive officer.Before the lockdown was imposed in March this year to contain the Covid-19 pandemic spread, the airport saw at least 12,000 passengers, both at arrivals and departures, daily. The number has since come down to around 5,000, even as around 40 domestic flights have already resumed operations.The airport was generating a total revenue of around ₹30 lakh daily, with the main source being the aeronautical category, whereby ₹800 per passenger is charged from the airlines. For instance, a Delhi-bound flight with 80% occupancy fetches about ₹65,000 to the airport. The other sources of revenue are retail shops, office spaces, vehicle parking, and advertisements. Dubai, Sharjah flights resumeIn some good news, international flights have resumed operations at the Chandigarh airport. IndiGo’s Dubai flight is scheduled every Monday, while Air India Express’ Sharjah flight will operate every Saturday. The Dubai flight will land here at 2:20pm and take off on its return journey at 5:10pm. The Sharjah flight is one-way for the time being, and will arrive here at 3pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-all-30-outlets-shut-up-shop-at-chandigarh-airport/story-gk4IhIDYEgZZ2Z0wsrO0gN.html

He further alleged that the Goyals’ had engaged ATIPL in business despite being aware of the financial crisis faced by the airline, which shut operations in April 2019 and had accumulated debt of nearly ₹8,500 crore.After conducting a probe, MRA Marg police filed a closure report in March, having found no evidence of cheating; and sought closure on the grounds that it was a civil case.The magistrate court on Tuesday rejected the protest petition of ATIPL and closed the case by accepting the closure report.ATIPL’s lawyer, advocate Dharmesh Joshi, said that they would appeal against the ruling, once a detailed order becomes available.The order comes a day after the HC rejected the plea of the ED to intervene in the case before the magistrate and oppose the closure report.It was on the basis of the MRA Marg case that ED had initiated the probe into money laundering allegations against the Goyals. But neither the magistrate court nor the sessions court allowed ED to intervene in the case to oppose its closure. On Monday, HC upheld the order, observing, “The petitioner [ED] is an independent investigating agency, empowered to investigate offences under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) and FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) and in the facts, cannot be termed as a victim or aggrieved/injured person interested in the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jet-airways-case-court-shuts-case-against-naresh-goyal-his-wife/story-3uomBNXPTzYSd0kk9L45SL.html

The initiative involves the formation of 84 WhatsApp groups, which will include women railway police officers, commuters and members from non-government organisations to alert the officials in case of an emergency.While 59 of these WhatsApp groups will cover 1,774 suburban railway services, 21 WhatsApp groups will be formed for important stations along the route like Thane, Mulund, Ghatkopar and Kurla. These stations will also have women railway protection force (RPF) staff round the clock.KK Ashraf, senior divisional security commissioner of the Mumbai division said, “Once a commuter posts a message in the group, railway officials will be alerted immediately. We expect the response in case of a mishap in around two minutes.”Apart from this, the Mumbai division will also form four WhatsApp groups for ladies special trains. All of these special trains will also be escorted by three lady police officers, Ashraf said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday.Shalabh Goel, divisional railway manager, Mumbai division said, “Women safety is one of the most important issues for us and this initiative is a form of community policing to ensure commuters’ safety.”CR caters to around 4.5 million passengers, of which around 30% or 13.5 lakh are women commuters. In 2018, Maharashtra recorded the most number of criminal offences on trains, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). In November 2020, two women were assaulted and robbed in two separate instances, though railways are currently operating for a limited category of passengers. Meanwhile, CR on Tuesday inaugurated a video surveillance system at 17 railway stations. The system will help in enhancing security within railway premises, which is a challenging job, a statement released by the CR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-railway-to-form-84-groups-on-messaging-app-to-ensure-women-safety-in-mumbai/story-XEZlV1CsN79z60LpnJE5yH.html

Police later detained a few people in connection with the attack. The department said that they would lodge a criminal complaint in the matter with the police. RS Bhath, the district town planner who led the team, said that the drive started around noon. They had just demolished an under-construction illegal building, he said, when a crowd of around 100 people gathered and started pelting stones on them. “We were taken aback and were forced to retreat into an open field to save ourselves. It was only after half and hour that the situation was brought under control by the police, which took effective action and chased away the violent protesters,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that despite the attack, the team continued the demolition drive till 6 pm. Around 20 large illegal houses, which were under-construction over 15 acres were demolished along with several boundary walls and plinths.

The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Tuesday.On Wednesday, the minimum temperature is expected to settle around 4 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature may stay around 22 degrees Celsius, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast. IMD officials said that a fall in minimum temperature by 1-3 degrees Celsius might be recorded in some parts of the plains in northwest India and central India during the next three days. “Cold wave conditions are likely to prevail tomorrow in Delhi-NCR tomorrow in isolated pockets. The sky will remain clear while moderate to dense fog might prevail in the morning hours. The maximum and minimum temperature might settle around 24 and 4 degrees respectively,” said an IMD official. Air quality in the city deteriorated and entered the very poor category on Tuesday, with a reading of 377 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was up from Monday’s reading of 271, which put the city in the poor category. Experts attributed the deterioration in air quality to the accumulation of airborne pollutants, on account of poor wind speed. However, Gurugram was the least polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR) on Tuesday, as the AQI in the neighbouring Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad spiked to the severe categories on Tuesday. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 270.38 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Tuesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in severe to the very poor category on Wednesday. The air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category on Thursday as well. Subsequently, air quality is expected to stay in the very poor category over the next five days since surface winds are likely to remain light, due to which ventilation will be poor. “Due to low wind speed and thermal inversion, the air pollutants are not being dispersed. The mixing height is also at the lowest right now,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. Panwar said that the wind direction is expected to change around December 25, which would aid the dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mercury-set-to-dip-dense-fog-likely/story-eFnzZJ058mW0BeBmwotDTJ.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||As Delhi fines, residents rush to register for HSRP, fuel stickers||With Delhi Police imposing ₹5,500 penalty on vehicles without high security registration plates (HSRP) and colour coded stickers, vehicle owners in the city are rushing to the regional transport authority office in Gurugram to fall in line with the rules. To deal with this, the Haryana government has taken the entire process online. This has also allowed those who registered their vehicles outside the district to get the HSRP and stickers delivered to Gurugram. Alternatively, residents could go to government approved private dealers and get these markers quickly; however, this will be more costly.“Just apply for the HSRP and colour coded stickers on www.hsrphr.com, make the payment also online, track its progress and get it delivered to their nearest HSRP point. Earlier, people had to visit government offices for this, which has now been done away with,” said Ravi Bharadwaj, state head of link Utasav, the company which has a contract for installing HSRP in Haryana. Bhardwaj said earlier they were issuing HRSP to only those vehicles which are registered in that district. In Gurugram people could have got HSRP for the vehicles registered in city only. “Now all the districts are linked under one platform and one can apply for HSRP from anywhere and get it delivered at the place of choice,” he said. Officials said another national-level website www.bookmyhsrp.com has been launched for HSRP. “At present in Gurugram people can get HSRP for the vehicles registered in Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh,” he said adding that the idea is to allow people to get HSRP anywhere in the country irrespective of the place of vehicle registration. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary Gurugram RTA, said adequate arrangements have been made for installation of HSRP. “Now process has been made online wherein people make an application for HSRP through a website, pay the fee online and track their application,” said Yadav. Officials said those who have the HSRP plate but don’t have laser coded sticker then need to apply for the full plate and those who have the laser sticker with HSRP , they require only the colour sticker. Blue stickers are for petrol and orange are for diesel vehicles, said officials HSRP has become mandatory from October 2018 in view of Supreme court order and often people who migrate from one city to another for a job, faced difficulty in getting high security number plates. Delhi police has started imposing fine from the beginning of December 2020 triggering a rush among people to get HSRP not only in Delhi but also in NCR districts. While new vehicles registered in the city, particularly those registered from beginning of 2018, come fitted with high-security registration plates, most of the older vehicles don’t have these sophisticated and tamper-proof plates. After an order from NGT now colour coded sticker (blue sticker for petrol vehicle and red sticker for diesel vehicle) has also become mandatory. Those who are now applying for HSRP will also get colour coded stickers while those who have HSRP can apply for colour coded stickers after paying a charge online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-delhi-fines-residents-rush-to-register-for-hsrp-fuel-stickers/story-m1VrhOESryAsrtXUub9OjK.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||Software engg’s death throws up dark side of ‘easy loan’ apps||Four days after a 28-year-old software engineer in Hyderabad allegedly took his own life, police suspect he may been a victim of harassment by mobile phone app companies in Gurugram that offered micro loans. If the borrower failed to pay, these companies would extract information from the phone and brand the person as a fraudster to their contacts, said police.Hyderabad Police, which is investigating the case, raided two offices in the city on Monday, arrested five persons and booked them for abetment.According to police, the victim had borrowed ₹8 lakh from an app that promised quick loans. When Covid-19 hit the country, the man lost his job and could not meet the repayment deadlines. With interest, the man owed the app company ₹11 lakh. Police said he was harassed with many calls demanding repayment and soon got to know that several of his contacts had received messages branding him a “fraudster”.Hyderabad Police had received other similar complaints too and their investigation revealed there were around 30 such apps owned by four companies operating from Gurugram and Hyderabad, but registered in Jakarta, Indonesia. The police investigation said that often, users would unwittingly provide these companies access to contacts, pictures, location and the device memory that would be a pre-condition to using the app. On Tuesday, police raided two call centres in Udyov Vihar Phase 2 that was staffed by nearly 100 people. Police seized systems to recover data and to establish if the apps were misusing customer’s data. Similar raids were conducted in Hyderabad call centres tooGurugram Commissioner of Police (CP) KK Rao said they were not involved in the investigation but provided support to Hyderabad police. “These app aggregators start calling the victim’s family and friends, demanding repayment leading to harassment,” he said. Police said they could not comment on any regulatory mechanisms over these apps.Hyderabad Police could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/software-engg-s-death-throws-up-dark-side-of-easy-loan-apps/story-wAmQutVFROnr7tGev42ANP.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||92 new Covid infections, 1 more death in Gurugram||Gurugram reported 92 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the lowest rise in nearly four months. The district had last reported fewer than 100 cases on August 24, when 77 new infections of Covid-19 were detected. In early November, new cases had peaked when it touched 964 new cases in a single day. “As we have said before, it’s hard to pinpoint the precise reason behind this slowdown. The most likely is that a large portion of the community has already been exposed to the virus and have acquired immunity. A proper serosurvey is needed to test the validity of this argument,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.The district also reported 129 new recoveries on Tuesday, along with one new Covid-related death. The total number of Covid-19 cases to emerge from Gurugram now stands at 55985, of which 54304 patients have recovered. The number of active patients stands at 1340, the lowest in at least a month. Of these, 120 people are presently hospitalized, while 1217 patients are under home isolation, while another three patients are under observation at district Covid care centres.Gurugram tested 4024 new samples for Covid-19 on Tuesday, with the daily test positivity rate dropping to 2.2 percent, the lowest in over four months. The World Health Organization’s guidelines state that a desirable test positivity rate is under five percent, seen successively over a period of at least 10 days. Tuesday marked the fifth consecutive day that the positivity rate was below five percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/92-new-covid-infections-1-more-death-in-gurugram/story-sQ5ByMTAML1TgE7iQHlv1M.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||Nylon fishing nets removed from Najafgarh to safeguard migratory birds||The district wildlife department has confiscated nearly 40 nylon fishing nets from the Najafgarh wetland in two raids this month. Officials said the step has been taken in order to protect the area’s substantial winter bird population that may face a threat from commercial fishing activities prevalent in the area.“Fishing activities have been taking place in Najafgarh for a few years now. We cannot prevent it since the area is not a protected wetland or national park, like Sultanpur. But we have spoken with the fishermen and asked them not to use nylon wire netting as visiting birds may get trapped. If an endangered bird specie or a rare migratory species gets caught, it will become a legal issue,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector.As per the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), conducted by Netherlands-based Wetlands International, last winter, 54 species of waterfowl, including six species red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were recorded in a census at the Najafgarh jheel in Gurugram. The number was up from 31 species, including four red-listed birds, recorded the year before that. “Since we have been noticing more birds visiting Najafgarh every year, we have taken this as a precautionary step and will continue to monitor the area to prevent fishing,” Chahal said.Chahal cited the example of a black-necked stork, which, in 2018, had caused a flutter among the birding community after it was found in Basai with its beak trapped in a rubber tube. The bird was finally rescued in Najafgarh after several days. The subsequent year, a darter was seen with polythene-like substance wrapped around its beak in Sultanpur. “The danger with fishing nets is heightened because the birds may get tangled while trying to feed on fish. Environmentalists have also raised this issue with us,” said Chahal.Pankaj Gupta, a veteran birder with the Delhi Bird Foundation, said that commercial fishing has been a common sight at Najafgarh for nearly eight years now. “It will certainly attract attention if a rare bird happens to come in harm’s way. I can’t recollect any instance where we have actually witnessed a bird in danger due to these nets, but the birds are definitely at risk, at least in the canal portion of the wetland where fishing is most prevalent,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nylon-fishing-nets-removed-from-najafgarh-to-safeguard-migratory-birds/story-AWjvIdeZhGMTFoDXeZ31kL.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||Six black spots on expressway on transport authority radar||The regional transport authority (RTA) of Gurugram on Tuesday held a meeting with stakeholders involved, including the district administration, on ways to reduce fatalities on National Highway-48. The officials identified six black spots — Rajiv Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Khandsa crossing, Shankar Chowk, Bilaspur Chowk and Sidhrawali crossing — and discussed ways to make commute safer at these spots. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, said that the meeting focussed on discussing solutions to checking road violations and improving safety and security measures, such as road signage, to reduce confusion. “After two meetings, we have identified six black spots across the city, where the maximum number of accidents are reported. We have studied those areas and have recommended changes to departments concerned,” she said. During a site visit, officials found various issues — the lack of pedestrian infrastructure, crossings, refuge island and speed calming measures — at the black spots. “We have written to NHAI to mark lanes on the service road. Also, we have asked them to display warning signs, including merging and diverging lanes, and mandatory signs of speed limits at all intersections,” she said. In many areas, officials said motorists are not aware of pedestrian zones and when to slow down. Rajiv Chowk is very unsafe for both motorists and pedestrians, said officials. An analysis of the year-long survey of accident-prone spots by the traffic police shows that most accidents in the city took place because of jaywalking, speeding, incorrect parking of vehicles, including trucks along the national highway at night, and non-functional traffic lights. Another important reason that led to accidents was faulty road engineering, the traffic police said. The RTA has also started a drive against overloaded vehicles and unauthorised vehicles plying on roads. Since November, they have penalised 868 drivers and have collected penalties of Rs 3.5 crore. Yadav said they have penalised 269 drivers for overloading goods, which comprised of mined stones in most cases. Officials of the GMDA had also stated that there are 568 CCTV cameras at 137 locations across the city, to monitor road safety.Yadav said they have asked for information provided on accidents in each jurisdiction and intervention required from the district road safety committee. “We have written to the civil surgeon to provide us data on a total number of accidents calls received by them on 108 helpline and the time taken to provide first aid to the patient and total time taken to ferry the patient to the hospital,” said Yadav. Officials said they have also sought for information on time lapse between road accidents and the death of victims, so as to improve response measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-black-spots-on-expressway-on-transport-authority-radar/story-q92SJmDt0ZSLJT5FRhpj6I.html
22-12-2020||Gurugram||Suspension of senior MCG officials hits daily operations, developmental works||The suspension and temporary withdrawal of charges from senior officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), the city’s primary civic agency, has started affecting its daily operations and developmental projects in the city over the last month.Approvals for localised civic projects, the sanction of funds under Rs 50 lakh and multiple enforcement measures have all taken a hit due to officials holding multiple charges. On Tuesday, the demolition of six shops in Nathupur was just the first demolition drive the MCG has carried out in more than a month.At least four of the 10 executive engineers (XENs) in the MCG are suspended for issues such as discrepancies in the issuance of tenders for GPS-enabled smartwatches, missing key MCG meetings and for irregularities in the issuance of work satisfactory certificates on the behalf of councillors.In the smartwatches matter, tenders were not allocated as per norms to the final contractor, while at least 12 work satisfactory certificates, based on which MCG disperses funds to its contractors, allegedly had forged signatures of councillors. Further, a XEN of the horticulture wing had missed a key MCG meeting earlier this month without any clear reason, leading to his suspension.Of the remaining six XENs, one XEN, responsible for civil engineering, is due to retire by the end of this month, which will leave MCG with half its strength of XENs.Besides the XENs, a large number of junior engineers and assistant engineers are also under suspension for various discrepancies, including constructions in the 900-metre restricted area of IAF depot. A subdivisional officer (SDO) was also suspended in the work satisfactory certificate matter.The charge of MCG’s city project officer has also been withdrawn for negligence in the MCG’s street vending zone project.Due to the staff crisis, officials are holding multiple charges, public dealings have reduced, and there is a lack of clarity regarding the official responsible for approving or sanctioning civic matters.“Nearly every senior MCG official working full-time is having to hold dual or more charges. With time and attention divided into multiple aspects, the MCG’s output is getting seriously hit. MCG contractors are not receiving money on time, thereby, delaying developmental projects, while public redressal is either not being executed or being done after a long delay. The MCG has never been in such a staff crisis before,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.To make matters worse, the position of senior town planner (STP) one of the two main positions in the MCG’s planning branch, besides chief town planner (CTP), has also been lying vacant for nearly three months, after the previous STP was transferred to the town and country planning (TCP) department.“If officials are disobeying norms and rules, and are also guilty of violations or negligence, action had to be taken by the mayor or the MCG commissioner accordingly. While we understand that this has led to a few officials being overburdened and also resulted in work being delayed, our bigger objective is for the MCG to work in a transparent and corruption-free manner,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG.Azad also highlighted that the XEN of the horticulture wing, who had missed a key MCG meeting earlier this month, will resume his charge from next month onwards, after serving his suspension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/suspension-of-senior-mcg-officials-hits-daily-operations-developmental-works/story-AweG4PJVwVxHXgrpJMYMKN.html

Following successful trials, inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) will be conducted as per rules before clearance is obtained for running commercial services in the section, the official said. The country’s first underground railway extends from Noapara to Kavi Subhash station on the busy north-south axis of the city over a length of 27.22 kms, with 15.70 kms of underground section. The 4-km stretch between Noapara and Dakshineswar is mostly on elevated structure, the official said.The Metro Railway has also decided to offer nine of its stations across its north-south axis and the East West Metro for branding to generate more non-fare revenue, he said The stations which have been offered for branding are Belgachia, Sovabazar-Sutanuti, Chandni Chowk, Phoolbagan, Bengal Chemical, City Centre, Central Park, Karunamoyee and the soon-to-be-inaugurated Baranagar. Salt Lake Sector-V and Salt Lake Stadium have already been co-branded, he said. Earnings of the loss-making Kolkata Metro have decreased owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and related health protocols, which have led to lower footfall compared to ordinary times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-metro-to-increase-services-on-dec-25-to-tackle-commuter-rush/story-LIqX7p2lg6pZHXheQ7pPJO.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Cops taking precautions while probing cases of honey trapping, HC told||The Delhi police has informed the Delhi High Court that it has issued a standing order in September directing the IOs and the SHOs to take extra precautions while investigating the cases of Honey Trapping while stating that the accused should not be tortured and harassed.The directions were given in compliance to an earlier court order where the judge had directed the police to look into the complaints of Honey Trapping while hearing the plea of a man who had been allured and later accused in a false rape case.In September, Justice Suresh Kait had directed the Delhi Police to call for reports from all police stations in cases of ‘’honey trap’’ or extortion and issue standing orders for taking action. Pursuant to the court’s September 23 direction, the police on December 21 said “a circular has also been issued to all police stations and units with the instructions that in all cases of honey trapping, action may be taken as per law without harassing the accused persons”.The high court had also directed the police to find out whether the complainant in the instant case and her neighbour/associate were involved in any other similar cases.The court’s September order had come while granting anticipatory bail to a businessman, accused in a rape case, who claimed that he was trapped and tricked under a well-designed, meticulously planned and thoroughly woven racket of extortionists. The businessman was represented by senior advocate Vikas Pahwa.The police have told the court that according to reports received from other districts and units, three cases having similar modus operandi as the instant case were found in Rohini and in all three, the complainants were another set of two women.The police have also told the court that the complainant’s associate in the instant case had herself lodged a similar complaint in 2016. It further told the court that in the instant case, all endeavours would be made to complete the investigation within three months.According to the prosecution, in the instant case, the woman and the man were strangers till August 24, and as she was looking for a job, she got the man’s number and texted him. The man replied that he was looking for a “hot personal assistant” and a meeting was fixed and the woman sent her location where the man came with a wine, it had alleged.It had also alleged that after drinks, the man raped her and she called her neighbour for help. When she came, she saw the man running away from the woman’s house and the matter was reported to police.However, Pahwa had argued in court that as per the WhatsApp chat, the woman had got the man’s number through an online job portal and she asked him whether he was looking for any personal assistant. When the man answered in affirmative, the woman, instead of sending pictures in professional suits or attire, sent her sensuous pictures in bathing suits or bikinis, he contended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cops-taking-precautions-while-probing-cases-of-honey-trapping-hc-told/story-biHBXDge84l9VhEecrKFCM.html

22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Bring gangster Lawrence Bishnoi to Chandigarh in handcuffs, under watch of 20 policemen: HC||After fears expressed by incarcerated gangster Lawrence Bishnoi that he could be eliminated in a ‘fake police encounter,’ during transit to Chandigarh and Haryana for interrogation in various criminal cases, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday directed Chandigarh police to bring him to the city in handcuffs and “under the watch of 20 policemen,” with videography done of the entire transit. The directions were issued by high court bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill after Bishnoi, currently in a Rajasthan jail, pleaded that he would be killed in a “fake encounter” similar to criminal Vikas Dubey’s “elimination” by Uttar Pradesh police. The court directed that the Rajasthan jail to Chandigarh transit be supervised by deputy inspector general (DIG), UT, Omvir Singh Bishnoi, with the escorting team led by a deputy superintendent of police with two inspectors and 17 policemen.Escort details Laying out precise movement instructions, the court said the convoy would have a pilot vehicle followed by the prison van carrying Bishnoi and the escort vehicle. The DSP travelling in the last vehicle would be in charge of the transit.Bishnoi will travel in a bullet proof or armoured vehicle duly escorted by trained commandos, armed with sophisticated arms and ammunition, the court directed. After he is interrogated by Chandigarh police, Bishnoi will be handed over to a Haryana police team supervised by Inspector general (IG), Hisar, Sanjay Kumar. If Haryana fails to get production warrant for the case in which Bishnoi has to be presented in court, the gangster will be taken back to Chandigarh with the same protocol to be followed.Officials to be held responsible for lapsesOfficials concerned will be held personally liable and responsible in case of default, the court warned. Bishnoi has imprisoned in Bharatpur for two years, with a custody period of almost five years.Haryana police is probing his role in a July 2020 FIR on the murder of two persons in Dabwali, Sirsa. In Chandigarh, police is investigating his role in four FIRs registered this year, most of them involving use of weapons. Bishnoi has pleaded that he be allowed to appear in court through videoconferencing or be handcuffed if brought in transit,He has also alleged being framed in criminal cases in Punjab (where he was named in 16 FIRs at one point), Haryana and Chandigarh. While denying Bishnoi’s videoconferencing plea, the court observed that the police could not be deprived of its right to interrogate an accused and that physical interrogation was necessary in a case where he had place a background role in the criminal cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bring-gangster-lawrence-bishnoi-to-chandigarh-in-handcuffs-under-watch-of-20-policemen-hc/story-l77suDSNd7kkWWN3A1MKMK.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Vehicles to collect segregated waste flagged off in Chandigarh||With the municipal corporation all set to start door-to-door collection of segregated waste in the city from Wednesday, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore flagged off newly purchased waste collection vehicles here on Tuesday.Badnore said these vehicles have been deployed to reduce the problem of mixed garbage collected at the garbage plant. He appealed to all residents of Chandigarh to put segregated waste in these vehicles so that the garbage can be processed easily. He also asked all councillors to create awareness in their respective wards so that the system can be implemented successfully.Municipal commissioner KK Yadav said that these vehicles will carry the segregated waste from households to transfer stations from where the waste is transported to the garbage plant in loaders.The segregated waste ie wet, dry and hazardous waste from the domestic generators, will be collected everyday by the 97 newly-deployed vehicles, which will ply on the streets of Sectors 1 to 30.“All vehicles used in the collection and transportation system are monitored by a GPS enabled tracking system. The GPS system is constantly monitored by the monitoring cell. Any route deviation by drivers will be penalised and multiple deviations are also grounds for termination,” added Yadav.Residents left confusedMeanwhile, residents were left confused as the new vehicles came and collected garbage in some sectors, but were just used to spread “awareness” in others. Residents said that in some areas like Sector 13, neither the trucks nor rehris came to collect waste.Kuldip Singh Gill, president of Bright RWA, Sector 21B, said, “The trucks came but didn’t pick up the garbage. There were no regular garbage collectors manning the trucks. We have to see what happens tomorrow.”Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said, “MC should immediately involve the residents and at least inform them about their plans. There was total confusion today and even for tomorrow we are not clear how the civic body will go about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vehicles-to-collect-segregated-waste-flagged-off-in-chandigarh/story-cymNCsjXmWM50c0kt7OitK.html

22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Gujarat firm to set up new sanitary landfill in Chandigarh||chandigarh@hindustantimes.comA Gujarat based company has been awarded the contract for setting up a new sanitary landfill (SLF) site at Dadumajra for dumping of non-recyclable solid waste generated in the city.The decision to award the contract to the lowest bidder, Varun Constructions, was taken by the board of directors of Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) on Tuesday. Work is expected to start in a month.The site, which lies next to the current dumping site in Dadumajra and the waste processing plant, will be spread over eight acres and developed over a year at a cost of around Rs 12.40 crore.The municipal corporation (MC), through CSCL, has already begun the Mining of Legacy Waste and Recovery of Land Project at the dumping ground.Nearly five lakh metric tonnes (MT) of ‘legacy’ waste that has collected over 20 years is being bio-mined and processed scientifically. MC intends to reclaim the entire 25 acres for scientific waste disposal and treatment.Used for dumping non-recyclable dry waste“The landfill is a crucial component of achieving total waste segregation in the city, in its entire cycle, from collection to processing and disposal. The site will be used specifically for dumping non-recyclable dry waste, which will neither be reused nor processed at the waste processing plant,” said a CSCL official.Scientific development of the site will ensure that no damage is caused to the environment and people living nearby are not inconvenienced. “The site will be surrounded by a 4.5m tall and 10m deep boundary wall and waste dumped there will remain covered. The site design incorporates systems that will leave no scope for seepage of water into the dumped waste or the ground beneath and no foul smell will generated,” the official added.The city’s urban and the rural areas generate about 450 metric tonne (MT) of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day, which is estimated to increase to 788 MT by 2036.The treatment plant for resource recovery is able to divert only about 20% as refuse-derived fuel (RDF), while the rest is dumped in the open.RDF is a fuel produced from various types of waste such as MSW.Almost out of capacityMC is currently operating Phase 1 of the SLF, which was set up in 2007 and commissioned in 2012. The site covers 10 acres and will reach, as planned, an average height of about 10m. Given the large quantity of waste arrival, this phase has almost run out of capacity.“Considering the proximity of habitations, the adverse impact on public health and environment, and the urgency of compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, it is imperative to expand the capacity of the SLF for safe waste disposal for a foreseeable period in the future,” said a senior MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gujarat-firm-to-set-up-new-sanitary-landfill-in-chandigarh/story-VrzaiTd4st1XVn98tprxqJ.html

Under the LTD system, buses will stop at only specific stops on its routes, thus enabling it to reach its eventual destination faster. The system will be launched on a trial basis from December 25. “We are introducing this specialised new modification on existing long-distance bus routes. It is called the ‘LTD’ service, which will have only important selected stops along the routes. The intention is to minimise journey time and improve speed to reach the destination faster,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD). “As of now we are starting this service on a trial basis with only 11 routes. The actual bus service will be implemented from December 25. We will be using the smart e-buses for this service. Frequency of one LTD bus will be every 30 minutes or 60 minutes on that particular route. The fares will remain the same. Also, this is an attempt to create and improve upon specialised services to bring in more ridership,” added Jagtap. While commuters have welcomed this new bus service with limited stops, Manohar Khandade a regular commuter said, “I regularly travel by PMPML and there are some routes where travel time is long due to the number of stops. This new bus service with limited stops will certainly benefit commuters.” Routes where LTD system will be in operation Katraj to Nigdi Bhekrainagar to NDA gate Bhekrainagar to Nigdi Bhekrainagar to Nigdi (from different route) Bhekrainagar to Alandi Bhekrainagar to Chinchwad Bhekrainagar to Hinjewadi Phase 3 Bhekrainagar to Katraj Nigdi to Wagholi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-to-reduce-stops-to-improve-bus-punctuality/story-SxeKrMoEOSsEgI4lVmHSSN.html

22-12-2020||Kolkata||Attempts being made to create false narrative about Bengal: TMC||Rejecting Union home minister Amit Shah’s accusation that West Bengal had fared abysmally on development indices under the present dispensation, the ruling Trinamool Congress said on Tuesday that attempts are being made to create a false narrative about the state. Ruling out the charges levelled by the Union minister, senior TMC leader Saugata Roy mentioned the state’s impressive performance in GDP, industrial output, per capita income, construction of rural roads among others.At a press conference in Bolpur on Sunday, Shah had accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the state of failing to deliver, claiming that West Bengal lags behind most states in the country on various parameters, except on corruption and extortion.Countering the charge levelled by Shah that TMC workers had misused funds meant for Amphan relief, Roy said, the state was yet to receive Rs 32,310 crore earmarked for the SDRF (State Disaster Relief Force) from the Centre.Claiming that election strategist Prashant Kishor has so far helped politicial parties win polls in five states, Roy said, the TMC believes, the figures predicted by the poll consultant in his tweets on Monday that the BJP will not cross the two-digit figure in the West Bengal assembly elections are correct.Kishor has been roped in by TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee to boost her party’s prospects in the state assembly polls likely in April-May next year.“We support his tweets, he is the election strategist of our party,” Roy told reporters at the TMC headquarters here.Asked whether Kishor was taking crucial decisions about the TMC’s affairs, Roy said that he is an advisor and gives his opinions as a consultant, while decisions are taken by the party leadership.“Prashant Kishor had similarly advised Narendra Modi during his campaign in 2014 Lok Sabha polls,” the TMC MP quipped.Speaking on the performance of West Bengal, Roy said, the state’s GDP has increased by 53 per cent, from Rs 4.51 lakh crore to Rs 6.9 lakh crore in the last 10 years.Contrary to Shah’s claim that industrial output in the state has decreased to 3.5 per cent, it has increased by 60 per cent, the TMC leader said.The per capita income in West Bengal which was Rs 51,543 in 2010 has increased to Rs 1.09 lakh in 2019, Roy said, noting that it is higher than Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Roy also rubbished the union minister’s claim of the jute industry of the state passing through bad times.“Most of the mills are open and the state government has decided to buy 7 crore gunny bags and use of such sacks have been made mandatory for storing rice,” he said.The TMC MP mentioned that industrial development of the state is 3.1 per cent, which he said, is five times that of the national average in 2019-20.“In the service sector, they pointed out that the state’s growth stood at 5.8 per cent, while we are saying that it has increased by 62 per cent,” Roy said.The TMC MP claimed that since 2011, electricity connection has reached 90 lakh households.“In the last one decade, 1.18 lakh kilometre rural roads have been built,” he said, denying Shah’s assertion about lack of growth in village road infrastructure in the state.Roy claimed that FDI in the state has increased 24 times between 2016 and 2018.The budgetary expenditure in the health sector has increased three times from Rs 3,442 crore in 2010-11 to Rs Rs 11,280 crore now, denying Shah’s assertion that healthcare infrastructure in the state was in poor condition.The health portfolio is held by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.“West Bengal ranks on the top in the country in terms of the number of hospital beds at 85,627, while the number of doctors has increased from 4,800 to 15,338, registering a 219 per cent jump,” he said, adding that the number of nurses have also increased by 51 per cent.In the education sector, he said that 30 new universities have been set up during the TMC regime since 2011, taking the total to 42 such institutions, while 50 new colleges have also come up.Roy claimed that more than 1.87 lakh new classrooms have come up in the state since 2011.With regard to the accusation that people of the state are losing health care benefits under the central government’s Ayushman Bharat project, he said that under the state’s Swasthya Sathi programme, 1.4 crore families in the state get an annual health insurance benefit of Rs 5 lakh.On the allegation that criminal activities have been institutionalised in West Bengal, the TMC MP said that crime against women has decreased by 21 per cent between 2014-2019 in West Bengal.“NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) has declared Kolkata as the safest city in the country for two consecutive years,” Roy said.He claimed that the BJP is speaking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Viveknananda with an eye on the coming elections in West Bengal.“The RSS or the Hindu Mahasabha did not have any role in the nation’s freedom struggle. Even Syamaprasad (Mookerjee) did not go to jail during the freedom movement,” the TMC MP said.Documents relating to Netaji, which are in the National Archives, have not yet been released by the central government despite the chief minister’s demand, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/attempts-being-made-to-create-false-narrative-about-bengal-tmc/story-xJW09VrxM6X87otO09C24H.html

22-12-2020||Pune||‘We have been struggling with basic facilities for more than 10 yrs’||Wagholi is one of the highest populated and most urbanised areas of the 23 village areas being included in the PMC limits. Sanjivkumar Patil, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association, tells Siddharth Gadkari why merger with the PMC is long overdueWhy was the Wagholi Housing Societies Association formed in the first place? We formed the association in the wake of popular sentiment coming from residents of housing societies to drive the solitary aim of “Making Wagholi a better place to live”; also, to seek better coordination between authorities and residents and encourage office accountability. Does Wagholi get all the basic facilities now? No. We were hoping that the local authority will provide us with basic facilities, but, it was not done. There is development of some internal roads. We are purchasing tanker water as there is no other alternative. We have to pay private agencies to clear our sewage. There is no proper garbage collection and disposable system. We have invested our saving to purchase a house. And we have been struggling with these basic facilities for more than 10 years. Why do you think this is so? Can something be done about it?There is something wrong with the system. It is possibly inadequate to cope with the growing needs and infrastructure demands. I settled down in Wagholi village a decade ago. The population is now two lakh. We are demanding that this village be included in the PMC as the gram panchayat has absolutely failed to cater to the basic needs of the residents. We want a strong civic body, with reasonability and accountability. It may be the Pune corporation, or PMRDA. I think, Pune corporation is the only choice for us. After inclusion, we will get what we want for our area’s development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/we-have-been-struggling-with-basic-facilities-for-more-than-10-yrs/story-AMsWaWeiVa0aHwKCQfewfP.html
22-12-2020||City||Oppn terms ruling party proposal to fix members of medical college trust “illegal”||PUNE At a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) general body, held on Monday, the opposition parties termed as “illegal” a ruling party proposal to appoint members from all political parties to a trust that will run the PMC’s first medical college. Despite multiple proposals on the table, only this single proposal was discussed, and then passed. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, only emergency proposals are being discussed at the GB’s emergency proceedings. The opposition questioned the urgency to pass a proposal regarding the medical college. A special meeting is to be conducted before the year ends, wherein all party members are to be made part of the college trust. The trust would be responsible for the recruitment and admission to the medical college, which will be set up at Kamala Nehru Hospital. Congress leader Avinash Bagwe said, “We are still not clear on issues regarding payments which will be made to trustees and employees. The corporators do not have any information and so a detailed discussion is needed at the General Body meeting itself.” Leader of the house, the BJP’s Ganesh Bidkar, said “This decision was unanimously approved by all party leaders at a previous meeting and this proposal was just a formality to appoint party leaders to the trust. However, if opposition leaders have an objection then we will discuss this in the special meeting that is to be held.”Except for Covid-19 expenditure, which is considered an emergency, all major decisions are now on hold. At the Monday GN meeting, most proposals were postponed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/oppn-terms-ruling-party-proposal-to-fix-members-of-medical-college-trust-illegal/story-cgf8vhCxLXHIdplahNiXIL.html
22-12-2020||Pune||Expanding Pune: It’s PMC or bust for lakhs of new Punekars||PUNE For far too long, residents from 23 areas –in the government records referred to as villages – have suffered a lot. While five lakh residents from these parts surrounding Pune city have been crying for amenities like roads, water supply, sewage and garbage management, they now finally see hope after the latest decision by the state government to include these 23 areas in Pune’s municipal limits. These areas have also seen maximum real estate development in the past 15 years, considering the relatively cheaper land rates. For the residents of these 23 areas, one hurdle, so far, for not getting basic amenities is that these areas are under gram panchayats, which have not been able to carry out developments due to a shortage of funds. Aditya Kumar Gupta, an IT professional and resident of Sarathi Souvenir society in Mhalunge, says, “We want water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage pipeline and street lights. These are basic amenities we need.” For over two decades, there has been a pattern for fringe areas to demand its inclusion in PMC limits. Due to affordability of land, people settle down in projects located in these fringe areas. Wagholi, one of the highest populated and urbanised areas among the 23 villages, is one such example. Despite being located adjacent to the Pune-Ahmednagar highway, residents of Wagholi are fighting to get basic facilities like road, water and a drainage system. Finally, they founded the Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) to push for their demands. Narendra Hagwane, architect and resident of Kirkitwadi, said, “Gram panchayats don’t have planning and money to carry out facilities. In our area, there is only one road which connects to the main road. Due to a lack of a development plan and negligence of the Pune Metropolitican Development Authority (PMRDA), there is no road network. Water supply and garbage is another major issue which we are facing now. We hope the corporation will solve it with better planning and funds.” Basic facilities For real estate developers, Sus-Mhalunge, which is next to Baner, has been on their radar considering its proximity to the Hinjewadi IT park. Around a decade ago many among IT professional bought flats in Baner, Hinjewadi, Aundh, Balewadi, and Kothrud. As a result, these areas witnessed high urbanisation even as amenities eluded most parts. Pankaj Damale, president of the Sus Mhalunge Association which represents 20 big housing societies, said, “In Sus and Mhalunge, there are 350 residential societies. Water, drainage, road, and street lighting is not available in this area. It is an absolute undeveloped area. There is a lack of proper planning this area. We have to pay to get water, drain the sewage, pick up garbage.” Lokesh Sharma, who lives in a rented house in Khadakwasla, said, “I am working in the Nanded city area. Rent rates are high so I shifted to Khadkwasla, where I live in a one BHK. The area is connected to the city, but narrow roads and water are a big problem. Though there is the dam located in Khadkwasla, we don’t get regular water.” Bad roads Sailesh Rao, an IT professional living in Manjari said, “Manjari is not a village. There are so many big housing schemes. But, basic infrastructure is almost zero.” Located on the eastern part closer to Hadapsar, water scarcity in Manjari and adjacent areas is a major problem, besides the lack of roads. The Serum Institute of India, which is currently producing Covishield, India’s Covid-19 vaccine, is based here. “We have to buy big jars of drinking water. At the same time, due to bad roads, we are facing huge traffic problems and accidents. I take almost an hour to reach my office, which is located in Hadapsar,” said Rao. With a population of 5000, Sus on Pune’s western part is an upcoming residential destination for most IT employees working in HInjewadi. There are educational institutes like Symbiosis, whose students and staff use the Sus roads, to reach the campus. Vijay Shinde, a resident of Wagholi living in Shriman Apartments said, “Traffic is one of the biggest problems after water. There is no road network. We cannot drive four-wheelers properly as roads are narrow and encroached upon.” Unauthorised construction In 2018, the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) had identified 16,938 unauthorised constructions in its area with most falling in these villages. While the PMRDA served notices to those responsible for unauthorised constructions, not much happened. Rajesh Ranjan, a resident of Holkarwadi, which is on the eastern part closer to Urali Devachi, said, “Besides garbage and weak water supply, unauthorised construction is another major problem in our area for which no action has been taken.” Like Holkarwadi, Kirkitwadi, which has population of 8900 and is located adjacent to Sinhgad road on the western side of Pune, also similar issues. Balasaheb Hagwane, a resident of Kirkitwadi and one of the petitioners for the inclusion of 34 areas (23 areas now, and 11 areas which have already been merged) said, “Roads, garbage and water are major problems in Kirkitwadi. Due to lack of development funds, basic infrastructure is not adequate. The urbanisation has been increasing. Builders are developing a scheme due to the lower rate of lands, as compared to city areas. There is good connectivity with Pune city. Rent rates are low. People now own properties in these fringe villages.” Merger is not the solution Pravin Gedam, a former corporation official who recently retired said, “Merger is not the solution to urbansation. During my service, I have seen two mergers 1997 and 2007. Corporation is not able to give basic infrastructure to villages. Corporation cannot take on the responsibility of a fringe village’s development. Actually, Pune Metropolitan Regional Authority (PMRDA) should take the lead and develop these villages, applying the town planning scheme. Corporation cannot take the burden.” Residents want ‘Pune development’“Pune Mahanagar Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) sanctioned big housing projects in the Manjari and Shewalwadi area. After completion, the population will increase and the gram panchayat will not be able to provide basic facilities to residents. So, a merger is the only solution for proper planning and development of villages.” RAHUL SHEWALEresident, Shewalewadi “Gram panchayats don’t have planning and money to carry out facilities. In our area, there is only one road which connects to the main road. Due to lack of a development plan and negligence of the Pune Metropolitican Development Authority (PMRDA), there is no road network here. Water supply and garbage is another major issue. We hope the corporation will solve it with better planning and funds.”NARENDRA HAGAWANEarchitect, resident of Kirkitwadi“We want water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage pipeline and street lights. These are basic amenities we need. There are no streetlights here. We are also paying huge amount of ₹2 lakh per month to get drinking water through tankers.”ADITYAKUMAR GUPTAIT professional and resident of Sarathi Souvenir society, Mhalunge“We are missing basic facilities like roads, water, drainage and street lights. We are facing these problems for six years. We are located on the border of the Pune, Mhalunge and Sus village. Government had inaugurated the Mhalunge High Tech city, but, nothing has changed. We just want basic things like any common citizen.”ASHISH BHARGAVIT professional and resident of Teerth Towers in Sus “In Sus and Mhalunge, there are 350 residential societies. Water, drainage, road, and street lighting is not available in this area. It is an absolutely undeveloped area. There is a lack of proper planning this area. We have to pay to get water, drain the sewage, pick up garbage.. We welcome the state government’s decision to merge our area with the Pune corporation.” PANKAJ DAMALEpresident, Sus Mhalunge Association||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/expanding-pune-it-s-pmc-or-bust-for-lakhs-of-new-punekars/story-KTnxdoX2q1ctfvkzSVqR4J.html
22-12-2020||Pune||Schools get the Christmas spirit going with Nativity plays, Santa Claus||The schools in Pune will go into Christmas vacation beginning December 23; however, before holidays, teachers and staff at the St Joseph high school, Ghorpadi enacted the nativity play to spread a message of love, hope and positivity to students. The nativity play is the enactment of the story of Jesus Christ’s birth. As many as 45 staff members of the school recreated the scene depicting an infant Jesus, Mother Mary, Joseph, shepherds, angels and various animals. “It is our school’s tradition to perform the nativity of Lord Jesus Christ play.Every year before we break for the Christmas vacation, the students enact the nativity story. In the physical absence of the students in the school, we decided to enact the play. All teachers and support staff were really excited to take part in this,” Shanti Devidas, headmistress of St Joseph School said. “There were adverse conditions when Lord Jesus was born and he showed us the light of hope. We are going through turmoil due to pandemic. We wanted to tell our students that this too shall pass. There will be normalcy again” said Father Rajesh Bansode, principal of St Joseph High School. Even if students could not be physically present for these Christmas celebrations in the school, they attended the event virtually. Only the representatives from class 10 were present in the school to attend the event. Edward Clint Decosta, a lab attendant in the school played the role of Joseph. “It was a different experience. When I was told that I would get to play the role of Joseph, I wasn’t confident if I would be able to perform it well but when we started to practice, my confidence boosted,” he said. “We were really happy when we came to know that our teachers were going to perform for us. Each year students start to practice the nativity play almost a month before this day,” recalled Aditya Gaikwad, a class 10 student who had come to school to attend the celebrations. The holiday break of the schools will begin from December 23, 2020, to January 3, 2020. Other schools in the city are also celebrating Christmas while dealing with the pandemic situation. Clara Global School moved the Christmas celebrations completely online. “Our teachers and students celebrated Christmas events online. Last week, we decided the dates and dedicated those days for the virtual Christmas celebrations. The students performed the nativity play online. Our teachers draped into Christmas costumes and sang Christmas carols online for the students,” Akash Thombre, Clara Global School administrator said.The staff members of Rewachand Bhojwani Academy in camp decided to give a personal touch to the Christmas celebrations. “We received a very good response from the students. We had informed them when would we be giving them the gifts. Before our staff reached there, students had decorated their homes,” said Roxaane Quadros, principal, Rewachand Bhojwani academy, Pune.“We hadn’t seen our students for many months because of the pandemic. So, we went to their homes, sang carols in front of them and gave them chocolates as a gift. One staff member dressed up as Santa Claus. We have a total of 500 students. Our target was to reach 50 homes per day. We have reached the homes of maximum children,” said Ajay Sarwan, admin head at the Rewachand Bhojwani Academy Pune in the Camp area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-get-the-christmas-spirit-going-with-nativity-plays-santa-claus/story-jUlxEyyCxDkO0sQCr90dLN.html

They will talk to college principals and understand various issues related to the reopening of colleges. Accordingly, we will need permissions from several government bodies. And in next five days this committee will submit their report about the same,” said Prof Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU.“The safety of students is the most important factor. We will study the overall situation of Covid in all the three districts Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar where our colleges are affiliated and accordingly further decision will be taken,” he said.On November 5 the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued guidelines regarding reopening of colleges to all the universities. So to take a review of the colleges affiliated with SPPU a two-day interaction programme was conducted by SPPU in November where the vice-chancellor interacted with principals of various colleges from Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts.Dr Ravindra Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said, “We do not want to risk the safety of students and so it is important to analyse the local situation and then decide. We agree the classes should start, but the safety of students should always be the top priority.”Rohan Nalawade, a second-year science student, said, “We have now become used to the new normal of Covid situation and as we are doing our other day to day activities with safety measures colleges should also reopen. I hardly understand anything which is taught online by teachers, nothing can replace the classroom teaching and so it is important to reopen the colleges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-forms-committee-to-initiate-college-reopening-process/story-2lvuXn5Y9oxMKf1UEPCXUN.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC’s women legal forum to fast tomorrow in solidarity with protesting farmers||A forum of women lawyers, social Group of Lawyers of Delhi High Court have decided to fast on Wednesday in solidarity with the ongoing “Satyagrah” by farmers demanding to roll back the recently passed farm laws.Lawyers associated with the forum demanded to repeal the three farm laws on December 23, the day which is observed as Kisan Diwas.“It is our belief that while the issue of the Constitutionality of the farm laws being enacted by the Center when agriculture is a state subject is subjudice before the Supreme Court and the issue of the legality of the enactment by a voice vote in the Rajya Sabha is also being heard by the Supreme Court, implementation of irreversible and far-reaching farm laws would render these petitions infructuous and could cause irreparable damage to the farm sector in India,” the forum said in a press statement on Tuesday.The forum includes senior advocates Indira Jaising, Mahalakshmi Pawani, Biswajit BhattacharyaMohan Katarki, Anand Grover and advocates Shadan Farasyat, Prashant Padmanabham, Ritu diwan, etc. It also includes members Shweta Kapoor, Zeba Khair and Iram Majid among others.It said that the forum lawyers are against dismantling the regulatory mechanism of minimum support price (MSP) and permitting big corporates to negotiate with small farmers, who it said lack the means to enforce or negotiate contracts especially due to the absence of effective legal aid and judicial infrastructure in rural India.“The decisions of corporates driven by profit would also affect the food security if India and cropping patterns would be determined not by local needs but by international market forces.While the Indian and global economy, especially urban employment is badly hit by covid, 80 per cent of the country is dependent for its sustenance on agriculture, imposing such far-reaching legislation upon a vulnerable citizenry in such an unconstitutional manner is a matter of grave concern,” the statement said.“The father of our nation, Mahatama Gandhi said that if you silently watch injustice, it is as good as perpetrating it. We, therefore, have decided to observe a one-day fast in keeping with the moral practice of Satyagrah observed by Bapu against the injustice and haste of imposing the New Farm Laws, in solidarity of farmers,” it added.This comes as thousands of farmers have been protesting at the borders of the national capital against the three farm laws, recently passed by the Central government. While farmer leaders and the Centre are engaged in several rounds of talks, discussions have remained inconclusive so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-s-women-legal-forum-to-fast-tomorrow-in-solidarity-with-protesting-farmers/story-VlLU5RMFhnQadqGiPgWTdP.html

22-12-2020||Pune||Jumbo facility staff to meet PMC, PMRDA officials over salary woes||Staff working at the COEP Jumbo Covid-care facility, after facing months of delay for their salaries, will now meet PMC and PMRDA officials to plead their case. The staff has alleged salary cuts and delays from the agency that runs the facilities. The agency has said that a reduced work load and unpaid dues from the PMRDA is the reason for the delay. The PMRDA, on Monday, maintained that it has released all payments from its end and that the agency must resolve all issues by Thursday. The facility was opened on COEP grounds in August, built by PMRDA and part payment for the same was made by PMC. The staff had, last week, staged a protest, where they alleged that they were paid only a part payment since September. Payment of the balance has been delayed repeatedly, is the allegation. A staff member, requesting anonymity, said, “After much negotiations and discussion with the agency Med Bros, we are forced to seek help from outside including local politicians and also the PMC and PMRDA. We were recruited on a Rs 35,000 salary per month, but have been paid Rs 18,000-20,000.” The PMC has clarified that there is no payment pending from its end. Suhas Diwase, CEO and commissioner, PMRDA, said, “There is no payment pending from our end in fact whatever payment we got from the PMC we have transferred it to the agency on the same day. We have now asked the agency to reconcile all pending payments and resolve the issue by Thursday.” Dr Shreyansh Kapale, dean at the facility, said, “The work order which was earlier for 800 Covid-19 patients has been reduced to 600 beds. We have verbal communication with the staff that their salaries would be renegotiated, which is what we are follwoing. Even the salaries of senior doctors have been reconciled, including me. However, we have sought time till Thursday to check the records and attendance of the staff and then take a call.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/jumbo-facility-staff-to-meet-pmc-pmrda-officials-over-salary-woes/story-KtojLPqf2GntM4j86ZdAdJ.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjabi actor protesting at Delhi’s Singhu border is poster boy of Punjab BJP||The Punjab BJP’s campaign to promote the new farm laws and assurance on the minimum support price (MSP) has failed to impress many, least of all its “poster boy”. Punjabi actor, director, producer and photographer Harpreet Singh, popularly known as Harp Farmer, who is participating in the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s farm laws at Singhu border, was shocked to find his photo making the rounds on social media on a poster of Punjab BJP’s official Facebook page. The 36-year-old Hoshiarpur-based actor criticised the BJP for using his picture without his consent and reiterated his support to the farmers’ agitation. In the poster, the BJP has used a photo taken six years ago, which shows Harpreet Singh in a farmer’s attire along with a figure of purchase of crops on MSP. The post says in this Kharif season, the purchase of crops on MSP is continuing. “Government agencies have bought rice worth Rs 77,957.83 crore at the price of MSP so far and 49% of the purchase is from Punjab alone. But some forces are misleading farmers and running their agenda,” the post said. In a video message, the actor warned of sending a legal notice to the party. “They have been shameless by using my picture in their poster, while I’m protesting against the farm laws at Singhu border. They have made me a poster boy of the BJP without my permission. I oppose the farm laws and can never be a part of their promotion. They have used my Sikh identity to show people are happy but that’s not the case. They should come to Singhu to know how many farmers are really happy. MSP is not the only issue, there are collective demands. Punjab is at Delhi’s border and we will return only after the laws are repealed,” he said. When contacted, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Kumar Sharma said he was not aware of the matter. “I’m not active on social media and IT wing handles these days but I will inquire about this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjabi-actor-protesting-at-delhi-s-singhu-border-is-poster-boy-of-punjab-bjp/story-dHbsMxCr363vnFY0PwcOaP.html

The forest officials, police and ResQ team carried out various measures to ensure the wild animal does not enter city areas.Two weeks after a gaur (Indian bison) strayed into a residential area in Pune, and died after being captured, another gaur was spotted on Tuesday morning in the city, a forest official said.“A gaur has been spotted in the western part of Pune and forest officials along with the police rushed to the spot in an effort to capture the animal,” said the forest official.The bison, according to forest officials, is a 4-5 years old male spotted at the defence land beyond High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), on Sutarwadi, Pashan.As early as 8.45 am, the Pune – Bengaluru highway was abuzz with amateur photographers crowding near the odha (canal) near Sutarwadi, Pashan, where a few passers-by spotted a bison on the side of the highway. Few people from Bavdhan also spotted the wild animal along the boundary wall of HEMRL. “I was returning from walk when I spotted the huge animal, which looked like a bull, but was of much bigger built. I alerted the police,” said Kiran Dagade Patil, corporator, Bavdhan.“The bison is running near the canal trying to find its way back to the forest along the HEMRL boundary wall, but is lost,” said Sujay Dodal, chief conservator of forests, who along with many forest officials and ResQ team members at work, is trying to find ways to send him back.According to Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Pune, “We are not going to use tranquiliser guns. Instead will try to find ways to send him back to the forests. We have done a recce of the old natural adivasi track and tried to see the openings for leading the bison towards the forest.”The forest department, along with ResQ, NGOs like Wild Animals and Snakes Protection Society, is working to ensure that the bison does not run towards city and highway and have put up barricades made of wire mesh and cloth.Bhimrao Tamdar of Suresh Mandap Kendra is busy helping the officials. “The officials have hired 80 metres of wire mesh (thick one) almost 8 feet in height hoisted over iron stands to hold it in place and covered with a red cloth to scare the wild animal.”Many villagers from Sutarwadi claim that it is not the first time that gaur/bison is seen in the odha. “There is a break at the boundary wall and we often see gaurs grazing in odha. Today, this young one strayed further down towards the highway and was spotted,” said B Sutar, owner of the open plots on the side of odha. On December 9, a gaur had strayed into a residential area in Pune city triggering panic among residents. It died after being captured by a forest team. Following the death of Gaur, which attracted criticism, forest officials had on Monday held training for staff on how to rescue animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-indian-bison-strays-into-residential-area-in-pune-capture-attempt-on/story-sC4SRczKLcW6Li0zZHt15L.html
22-12-2020||Pune||Gaps in 39 crash barriers on e-way; free-for-all major cause of accidents||The highway police have identified at least 39 crash barrier punctures (gaps) on both sides of the Pune-Mumbai expressway, where stray animals and motorists were found intruding, leading to mishaps.According to highway police, 24 crash barrier punctures have been identified on Mumbai to Pune lane of the high-speed corridor while 15 crash barriers were found punctured from Pune to Mumbai lane of the highway.The highway police under the superintendent of police Sanjay Jadhav has submitted a report to the state government stating that some villagers had broken the security fencing at different places to reach to the highway, where only four-wheelers are allowed as per guidelines.The breaches were facilitating the movement of cattle, buffaloes, human being and two-wheeler riders and possibilities of fatal accidents cannot be ruled out, the report stated.In 2019, between January and October, 56 fatal accidents claimed 65 lives on the expressway while this year during the same time span, 53 fatal accidents were reported in which 58 people lost their lives. While the total number of accidents is comparatively less than last year — in 2019, 255 accidents were reported from January to October and 121 accidents were reported in 2020 during the same period.“We have conducted the inspection of the most vulnerable points on the expressway for the first time. These areas need to be repaired and necessary communication has been conveyed to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) for action. These places might see accidents and I have personally inspected, visited and verified each of the spots on the expressway,” said Jadhav.According to Jadhav, Wadgaon division of the highway police have communicated it to MSRDC to immediately carry out repairs of the said breaches to prevent future accidents, the highway police report states.Similarly, the highway police have been carrying out regular programmes aiming at creating awareness about the road safety measures and dangers of breaching on the expressway.The locals of the adjoining villages were summoned for the briefing programme on road safety taking place at regular intervals. The report further mentions that the MSRDC had assured the police that the punctures will be repaired at the earliest.According to Rakesh Sonawane, executive engineer MSRDC, the punctures are closed from time to time. “Local villagers in order to save time carry out these breaches. We have tried to convince through dialogues about the dangers of trespassing on the highway. Even the local policemen have been urged to take strict action in these cases. While trying to explain the risks of punctures, the locals do pick up quarrels,” said Sonawane.Independent researcher and activist Tanmay Pendse, whose brother and Marathi actor Akshay Pendse, and nephew died in an expressway accident in December 2012, said, “ Human behaviour has changed since the outbreak of Covid-19. Commuters have taken to wheels after a long time and stress levels have gone high. Now is the right time to pay attention to highway safety. Commuters are overspeeding and the median punctures are dangerous and can lead to more fatalities. MSRDC must take up the repair work at the earliest and make it safe for commuters,” he said.Nine injured in two separate accidents on December 19Nine persons were injured in two separate accidents on the Pune-Mumbai expressway and the old Pune-Mumbai highway on Saturday because of poor visibility.In the first accident three passengers in a car were injured after it rammed into a truck ahead of it at the Bhor gate on the Pune-Mumbai expressway near Khopoli.In the second accident, six persons travelling in amini bus were hurt after the bus lost control and toppled near Khopoli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/gaps-in-39-crash-barriers-on-e-way-free-for-all-major-cause-of-accidents/story-6fJzyPrAXtB3IpHOE04YvK.html
22-12-2020||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Talk the talk, and ensure our city walks the walk||Late at night, last week, I listened to ‘Conversations’, a fusion jazz music piece by L Subramaniam and Stephane Grappelli. The violinists play in turn, their melodies responding to each other to make a harmonious whole. The music reaches a peak, and then seems to start another, quieter, more reflective strand of conversation.Our public conversations are hardly like that. TV is driven by TRPs, social media is troll prone, isolating and limited by the digital divide. NGOs and social movements do organise public debates and discussions, but we can and must go further.I mean democratic forums where ordinary citizens can come together on issues they care about, to have well-informed deliberations, the results of which influence public decision-making.One may say that we elect representatives to discuss civic issues and make public decisions. But, around the world, we are seeing that representative democracy is just not enough!The problem is not only that the typical elected representative is more focused on winning the next election. The problem is in thinking that a few people, just because they were elected on the basis of some promises made, actually know best on all issues.What a responsibility to leave to elected representatives, and what a burden for them to carry!Civic issues, such as air quality, green zones, traffic, waste, housing, are complex. They have more than one side, since people in different situations experience them differently. The collective situation is changing over time and has impacts that may go unnoticed and disregarded in public decisions.A young woman travelling 20 km on a bike to a factory, a plumber cycling house-to-house for work, and a person on crutches crossing the road – each have different views on how to make their journey more comfortable.Scientists point to the increasing number of private vehicles taking up more road space; more accidents, air pollution, and climate change.Experts recommend walking, cycling and public transport. Such issues need talking through, so that we understand them better and figure out how to address them here in our own city and neighbourhoods.But, we don’t have forums for people from different walks of life to deliberate on the most important issues of our lives and times.In 2017, through the Centre for Environment Education, we conducted street surveys in Pune, on how people viewed current civic governance, their opportunities for participation, and their interest in and ability to participate.About half the respondents were dissatisfied with government decisions. Most people were interested to participate in civic affairs, but felt that they did not have opportunities to do so.Citizens’ Assemblies are in fact happening in many parts of the world. Participants in these assemblies are selected through a lottery system. In Melbourne, recommendations from a mini-public on the entire municipal budget were actually implemented.In Ireland, a citizens’ mini-public recommendations were included in constitutional reforms. Over the last few months, climate assemblies have been convened in the UK and France on country commitments. I would like to see our local government arranging citizens’ forums that include people from different walks of life in democratic dialogue and deliberation.A citizens’ jury that can examine different views, scientific evidence, and good practices in a structured way, will likely yield highly relevant recommendations that are better for people, our local environment and the planet.Such a deliberative democracy forum does not replace, but enriches representative democracy. I think it is time to practice democracy in the true sense with well-structured inclusive public forums. Let’s have civil, civic conversations!(Author: Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education. She writes on urban sustainability and participatory governance.

A body was found in an open ground along the Bangalore-Mumbai highway stretch in Hinjewadi at 11am on November 29. The investigation began with identification of the unknown body, After following his last known whereabouts, the identity of the deceased man was found to be Sandeep Pundalik Mainkar, a resident of Mhada Society in Sant Tukaram Nagar area of Pimpri. Before it was identified, Mainkar’s body was found to be half burnt with a half-burnt document which helped the police ascertain his identity. A case under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Hinjewadi police station. While investigating the case, the police were checking if there was a missing case registered by his relatives. However, his relatives told the police that he was never in one place and was habitual of consuming alcohol. “Upon conducting technical analysis, the police found that he came to Shivbhojan thali near Vallabhnagar ST Stand every day to have a meal and found his picture in the eatery,” read a statement by Balkrushna Sawant, senior police inspector of Hinjewadi police station. While looking for whereabouts of the deceased person, the police came across an active missing person’s case registered by Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The police identified this missing person as Shaikh. The police traced the real estate agent to be in Delhi along with his second wife. However, as the police reached Delhi, they found that he had left from there and has come back to Pune. Several teams of local police stations and Unit 4 of crime branch were formed to track him and he was found in a train at Daund railway station. Having run himself in debt worth multiple crores, the real estate agent had found a homeless man, killed him, attempted to burn his dead body, and tried to show it as his own death. After his arrest, the police found a Rs 100 bond paper made by Shaikh which claimed that he was dying by suicide due to his debt and that his body was to be found on the location where Mainkar’s body was found.

Under this project in 408 Talukas across the state, one model school will be started by the state education department. The government schools built under this scheme, will be equipped with new technology and modern infrastructure making it the first of its kind. “We are now planning to develop model schools in the state, and one model school in each taluka. It will be a school with very good infrastructure, would also start catering to needs of smaller schools around. We have 408 talukas or blocks we can say in each district of our state. It will be in both rural and urban areas where these model schools are being planned and we are shortly finalising the list of schools selected for this project,” said Vishal Solanki, state education commissioner. According to Solanki, along with good infrastructure other investments will be made in these model schools with the help of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and local community support. “So that these schools will really become vibrant in those particular talukas and attract and help other schools catch up. Even the new education policy is talking about school complexes and many new things, so we are moving in that direction. We are also trying to implement recommendations made by the national education policy in this project,” he added. Through this project, the education department will be trying to make education system easier and simpler for students with BPL. One existing school from each talukas will be selected for this project and will be turned into a completely new model school and would start from next academic year. Welcoming this decision of the state government, Rakesh Zhanje, an education activist working for the rural area children education said, “The condition of schools especially in the rural parts of our state is not so good, starting from basic infrastructure and facilities it needs to be improved. Now, if the state government is planning to come up with these model schools for each taluka it is welcomed.” However, Zhanje said, it is necessary to turn each and every school in rural parts into a model school to give quality education to our students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/model-schools-with-modern-amenities-infrastructure-planned-in-all-talukas-in-the-state/story-PoasYoPTv9pRubI3lcBhwI.html

22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Passengers from Heathrow stuck at Amritsar airport for over 12 hours due to Covid-19 testing||The 242 passengers and 10 crew members on board the Air India flight from the United Kingdom that landed at 12.05am on Tuesday were stuck inside the terminal of Sri Guru Ram Das Jee international Airport in Amritsar for more than 12 hours as their RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 were being conducted. The alleged delay in testing led to tension at the airport as the passengers and their relatives waiting in the chill outside since midnight raised anti-government slogans. The aircraft had departed from Heathrow airport in London before India decided to suspend flights from the UK till December 31 to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across England. The RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid-19 was made mandatory for the passengers on arrival and they would be allowed to exit only after they test negative. The passengers who test positive would be taken to hospital or quarantine centres. Also read: 2 test positive for Covid-19 in Kolkata after arriving from LondonPASSENGERS PROVIDED FOOD, MILK: AIRPORT DIRECTOR Airport director VP Seth said that food and milk was being provided to the passengers and the reports of the tests were expected anytime. Amritsar assistant deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal said the sampling process started as soon as the flight landed. “Each passenger and crew member has to undergo the RT-PCR test.” He said the airport authorities had already informed their relatives about testing. Asked about the protest by some passengers, Aggarwal said, “Usually, it takes five to six hours for clearance of all international passengers. But today it will take a few hours more and everybody should bear with us.” Punjab Police personnel were deployed to ensure the situation remained peaceful. OUT IN COLD, RELATIVES ON TENTERHOOKS The administration had shared a communiqué on Monday evening to intimate the recipients that the passengers would be kept inside for eight hours but the procedure took longer, leading to the protests. Ankush, a resident of Faridkot, said his brother Ankur had arrived on the flight. “All our family members have been waiting for him for the past several hours,” he said. Amrik Singh, whose son Sukhwinder arrived from the UK, said, “I have enquired from the airport authorities about the test report of my son for a number of times but they keep saying that it will take two hours more.” “I got a message from inside that several passengers have protested for the delay in the sampling and testing process. I fail to understand why all passengers have been detained there for more than 12 hours on the pretext of testing,” he said.

After two incidents, the forest department on Monday held a daylong session on rescuing wild animals in city limits in order to prevent their lives. This training programme, held at the Rescue Transit Centre, Bavdhan was organized by the department of forest and rescue centre and focused on Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) to capture the wild animals along with crowd control management. The death of the bison last week had attracted criticism from various quarters. Around 150 people from the department of forest, police personnel, veterinary doctors and NGO’s working in the rescue attended the training programme. “We had arranged a theory and practical session for people who are part of the rescue missions in the past. This latest session was arranged in a retrospective of the two incidents that took place recently where an Indian bison which lost its way in Kothrud died of exhaustion. In another incident, a leopard, which reportedly killed eight persons, was shot dead at Karmala in Solapur district due to a man-animal conflict,” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Pune. The training was in-depth and also important as a step to minimize the man-animal conflict which is increasing day by day, said forest officials. “We should be ready with mitigation measures, at least the front-line staff should be ready,” said Patil. The participants had brainstorming sessions with HS Prayag, senior veterinary, from the Karnataka Veterinary Animal and Fisheries Sciences as well as practical sessions where they discussed tranquillizer dosage for every animal which has a different dosage, how to handle a tranquillizer gun. The participants also practised rescue on a bull at the treatment centre. “We plan to upgrade the department with sessions every three months and create a standard protocol of how to handle such incidents,” said Patil. The training also included how to handle animals in distress, keeping distancing and using tranquiliser guns||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/indian-bison-s-death-prompts-forest-dept-to-conduct-training-on-rescue-operations/story-TmCh0a96BxO0BC5vgdLmOL.html

22-12-2020||Kolkata||Will BJP leaders quit if party fails to get 200 seats in WB, asks Prashant Kishor||A day after claiming that the BJP will not cross double digits in the West Bengal assembly polls, election strategist Prashant Kishor on Tuesday challenged its leaders to say on record that they will quit their positions if the party failed to get 200 seats.“BJP will struggle to cross double digits and will get less than 100 seats in West Bengal. Will quit my work if they do,” Kishor told PTI, reiterating his assessment.He also clarified that if the saffron party does any better than what he has predicted, he would quit his work.Kishor, who managed Narendra Modi’s successful campaign for prime ministership in 2014, has been roped in by TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee to boost her party’s prospects in the West Bengal assembly polls likely in April-May next year.On Monday, he tweeted that the BJP would struggle to cross double digits in West Bengal, setting off a war of words with BJP leaders on the microblogging website.His remarks came after senior BJP leader and Union Minister Shah’s visit to West Bengal during which political heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, nine MLAs and a TMC MP joined the saffron party.Shah, considered the architect of the BJP’s resurgence in West Bengal, had asserted that his party will win over 200 seats in the upcoming polls.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, the party’s pointsman in the state, took a swipe at Kishor, saying the country will end up losing a poll strategist after the West Bengal elections.“Given the ongoing BJP tsunami in Bengal, once the new government is formed, the country will have to lose an election strategist,” Vijayvargiya quipped in Hindi on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/will-bjp-leaders-quit-if-party-fails-to-get-200-seats-in-wb-asks-prashant-kishor/story-FfpwFelMzzejT2eAyXfJqN.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Gurbani of no use if it does not change a person’s thoughts: Shiv Sena on PM Modi’s gurdwara visit||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday wondered what will be the outcome of the ongoing farmers’ protest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited a gurdwara and sought inspiration from Guru Tegh Bahadur, whose followers are among those protesters.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ was referring to Modi’s visit on Sunday to Gurdwara Rakabganj in Delhi where he paid tributes to Guru Tegh Bahadur for his supreme sacrifice.Guru Teg Bahadur, whose death anniversary was observed on Saturday, was cremated at the Gurdwara Rakabganj.Thousands of farmers, including Sikhs, have been protesting near the Delhi borders since November 26 against the Modi government’s three new farm laws.The editorial in the Marathi daily said farmers from Punjab did not flinch even when Modi reached the gurdwara, “turning his back towards the Sikh peasants protest”, and continued with their demonstration. “Prime Minister Modi sought inspiration from Guru Tegh Bahadur. Happy about it. Thousands of Sikh fighters are also fighting (protesting) from the same inspiration near Delhi border. Hence, it is a question what will be the outcome of the battle,” the editorial said.It said ‘gurbani’ was being played when the prime minister reached the gurdwara.The gurbani says services and devotion towards God will be of no use if one does not change his/her thoughts, the editorial noted.The gurbani says reading holy religious book several times will be of no use if one does not understand its teachings, and also asks what will one do when his/her time comes and an account of his/her deeds is checked, it said.The gurbani mentions that none could defend himself from time, it added.It is “not right” that Modis political opponents criticise him for anything he does, the editorial said in a cryptic remark and asked what is there to be restless if he visited the gurdwara.Modis opponents are alleging “politics” behind the prime ministers visit to the gurdwara and asking why are the farmers from Punjab protesting in the cold if he loves Sikhs so much, it said.“...but none should question Modi’s faith. Guru Tegh Bahadur was a great saint. The Guru accepted martyrdom for humanity, principles and ideals...he was the protector of religion. Hence, not only Sikhs, everyone on this land should bow before Guru Tegh Bahadur,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gurbani-of-no-use-if-it-does-not-change-a-person-s-thoughts-shiv-sena-on-pm-modi-s-gurdwara-visit/story-59KK5bqyCuhtryQwvvAifM.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Passengers arriving from UK protest at Amritsar airport over delay in Covid-19 testing||Passengers who arrived at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ramdas Jee International Airport from the UK protested against the authorities over the alleged delay in carrying out their coronavirus tests. Their family members on Tuesday claimed that they have been made to wait for hours. The authorities, however, said the clearance may take some more time as every passenger and crew member will have to be tested for coronavirus. The Air India flight from the UK with 250 passengers and 18 crew members had landed at 12.30 am last night. India has suspended all passenger flights from the UK till December 31 in the wake of the emergence of a mutated variant of coronavirus there, joining several other countries that have imposed a similar flight ban. Moreover, passengers coming from the UK through flights till Tuesday midnight will be tested for Covid-19 on arrival at airports. Relatives of passengers told the media that several passengers protested at the airport due to the delay in testing for the infection. Ankush, a resident of Faridkot in Punjab, said his brother Ankur has arrived from the UK on the flight. “All our family members have been waiting for him for the past several hours,” he said, accusing the authorities of not informing them about the time to be taken for his clearance. Amrik Singh, whose son Sukhwinder arrived from the UK, said he could not meet him yet. “I have enquired from the airport authorities about the test report of my son for a number of times but they keep saying that it will take two hours more,” he said. “I got a message from inside that several passengers have protested for the delay in the sampling and testing process. I failed to understand why all passengers have been detained there for more than 12 hours on the pretext of testing,” he said. A team of health authorities deputed at the airport took samples of all passengers and crew members. Amritsar Assistant Deputy Commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal said the sampling process started as soon as the flight landed last night. Each passenger and crew member will have to undergo a RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test, he said, adding that passengers were provided with food. He said the airport authorities had already informed their relatives about testing. To a question on the protest by some passengers, Aggarwal said, “Usually, it takes five to six hours for clearance of all international passengers. But today it will take a few hours more and everybody should bear with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/passengers-arriving-from-uk-protest-at-amritsar-airport-over-delay-in-covid-19-testing/story-nMwzVYEkU7Vhqu0MgjZrEO.html

The Congress, which has been one of the leading political forces in Jammu and Kashmir, was leading in only 26 seats, while the newly formed Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party has so far been able to manage a lead in only 10 seats.Another clear trend as of now is that the pre-existing political polarisation between the Hindu-majority Jammu and Muslim-majority Kashmir regions has continued in the latest round of elections.As of 1.10pm, the PAGD was leading in 64 of 111 seats in Kashmir, for which the trends were known, while the BJP managed to have a lead in only 2 seats.

He asked the state president to take action against all those who worked against the party’s candidates.The RJD emerged as the single-largest party in the elections with 75 seats but the alliance it led failed to get the required numbers to form the government. The National Democratic Alliance returned to power with a wafer-thin majority of 125 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly. The RJD-led alliance got 110 seats.Also Read: For the fourth time, Bihar policemen take oath against alcohol consumptionThe RJD has removed its Darbhanga district president after an audio of his campaigning against the party’s candidate went viral.“It is easier to fight the opponents but difficult to deal with back-stabbers in the party who damage the party intentionally,” said Yadav. “Everyone wants to contest polls. ...many sitting MLAs [members of legislative assembly] were also denied tickets. But party leaders should desist from sabotaging. Anybody who works against the party will face action.” Yadav also announced a divisional level review of the loss.Some RJD leaders blamed the party’s alliance partners for the loss but Yadav desisted from making any direct comments about that. “Many compromises need to be made in alliance politics,” he said.Yadav asked his party members to continue interacting with the people as elections might be held again as early as 2021. “Bihar may face election anytime. Even as early as 2021,” he said.Yadav announced a thanksgiving campaign after January 14 to express gratitude to the voters who stood by it. He said the RJD will speak about issues like irrigation, unemployment, education, etc during the campaign. Yadav attacked the Bihar government over the law-and-order situation and asked where is good governance. “Murder, rape, and loot have become the order of the day in Bihar.”He urged his party members not to be demoralised as the RJD-led alliance failed to form the government by a whisker. “We failed to form the government by just 12,500 votes. Voters gave us the mandate but the EC [Election Commission] failed us. We will go out to thank people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/tejashwi-yadav-warn-of-action-against-saboteurs-predicts-early-election-in-bihar/story-RZJFYhWNKUvQaAUGdwtkoI.html

The polling was held via ballot papers amid heavy security in eight phases—November 28, December 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19. Jammu and Kashmir comprise 140 DDC seats each. Apart from that, elections were also held for 935 panchayat halqas and 11,814 vacant panch constituencies in the Kashmir division.

The leadership of the alliance is closely watching the results and expecting to win a major chunk of DDC seats from Kashmir and some parts of Jammu region. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also hoping to win a good number of seats to portray as endorsement from the people for their policies, especially the revocation of Article 370.

22-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Delhi-Meerut Expressway blocked again||Vehicular movement at Delhi-Meerut Expressway completely stopped around 7.30am Tuesday as the farmers protesting against the three new farm laws at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border for the past 27 days blocked all its carriageways. At 7.37am, the Delhi Traffic Police used its Twitter handle to update the public about the closure of the carriageways at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh also confirmed the blockade at the border by the protesting farmers.Also Read: Govt open to more tweaks if farm talks resume: OfficialThe sudden blockade of the expressway has prompted the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police to divert traffic to alternate borders, such as the ones at Anand Vihar, Bhopra and Apsara. Keeping in view that the blockade may lead to traffic chaos during the morning office hours, officials from the Uttar Pradesh administration and Delhi Police are discussing the reopening of at least one carriageway with the protesting farmers. Farmers protesting at the UP Gate border have occupied the expressway’s carriageway and service roads going towards Delhi from Ghaziabad since they began their agitation last month.This is the second time since Monday afternoon that the expressway has been completely blocked by the farmers, who are alleging that several farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were stopped from proceeding to Delhi borders and join the agitation.The near hour-long blockade on Monday was cleared after the officials of the UP administration assured the farmers that nobody will be stopped from going towards the borders. The Singhu and Tikri borders where thousands of farmers are protesting continue to remain closed while one carriageway at the Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) border is open for vehicles entering Delhi from Noida. Motorists going to Noida are being diverted to other borders such as DND, Kalindi Kunj, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli, and Dallupura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-meerut-expressway-blocked-again/story-J3GZlUSrATodnUwi1tzikK.html

This was the lowest recording for the season. Scientists said that the spike in the temperature was because of the passing of a western disturbance in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. “This marginal rise in the temperature was an impact of the western disturbance in the hills. By Tuesday, however, the temperature will start falling again and we are expecting it to come down to around 3 degrees Celsius in the coming days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-pollution-increases-temperature-to-fall-further/story-PyOrBvZSN2IiMlGdAWNNjO.html

He said Singha Devi was an important village and the historical temple there was visited by thousands of devotees from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and nearby villages.Due to unavailability of a bridge over the rivulet, the temple would be cut off from main land during the rainy season.19-km roads to be repairedEarlier in the day, Tewari also laid the foundation stone of construction and strengthening work of 19 km of roads. He informed that arrangements had been made to make the road from Boothgarh village to Haripur an “all-weather road”. This road serves as the shortest route from Chandigarh to Ropar due to which heavy traffic passed over it. So, widening and strengthening of this road will be immensely beneficial, he said.Navagaon to Kane ka Bara to Tanda Karoran Pinjore road is an interstate road that will act as a shortcut for patients coming from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to PGIMER, Chandigarh. Widening/strengthening and new construction of the road will reduce the distance from Pinjore to PGIMER by 5km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mp-manish-tewari-lays-foundation-stones-of-high-level-bridge-road-repair-works-in-mohali/story-6NqGB339jGGeRtAnDLaKwO.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College eyes centrally-funded institute tag, fresh proposal to be sent to Chandigarh admn||With the Punjab Engineering College (PEC) eying the centrally-funded technical institute (CFTI) tag, a fresh proposal is being prepared that will be presented to the UT administration.In a recent communication, the UT education department had asked PEC to send a fresh proposal with the inclusion of more suggestions. The institution has already given up on its long-standing dream to get an IIT tag.PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi had made a presentation to the secretary education, UT administration, Sarpreet Singh Gill in October. It was first scheduled in March, but was postponed due to the pandemic.A letter sent to PEC earlier this month had asked the institute to incorporate more suggestions in the proposal. PEC is a grant-in-aid institution under the Chandigarh administration.The institution became a deemed university in 2003. It is said that the college was closer to getting an IIT tag in the late 1950s when many IITs were established in the country.CFTI tag game changer for PECPEC has not seen any major infrastructure revamp in recent years and getting a tag of CFTI is considered a game changer for the institution. The institution can hire more faculty and its budget will also increase.Sanghi said, “The institute will become more autonomous if we get a CFTI tag. It will improve our quality and we will attract students from all over the country.”“Some central government schemes are only for the central institutes,” he added. At present, over 3,000 students are enrolled at PEC, but the infrastructure and resources are lesser than what the institute needs for its student strength.PEC offers eight undergraduate programmes and 14 postgraduate programmes, besides PhD programmes in various disciplines of engineering, science and others fields.At 68, PEC went up by 10 notches in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) list for 2020. The institute is slated to improve more in rankings if it gets the central institute tag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-eyes-centrally-funded-institute-tag-fresh-proposal-to-be-sent-to-chandigarh-admn/story-8qkWgQOlSU92RTbLg1nmhO.html
22-12-2020||Kolkata||BJP vs TMC politics sparks family drama||A family drama starring a couple torn apart by politics, a likely divorce notice, the near-collapse of a 10-year-old relationship, an emotionally charged press conference beamed on live television, and tearful bytes to the media. Twists and turns straight out of a Bollywood movie played out on West Bengal’s political stage on Monday, shortly after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian’s wife joined the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state where elections are due in early 2021. The decision by Sujata Mondal Khan, wife of the BJP’s Bengal youth front president Saumitra Khan, resulted in some melodramatic exchanges between the two, aired on news channels. “I am heartbroken to see 10 years of companionship coming to an end in this manner. The Lakshmi (the Hindu goddess of prosperity) of my home has been stolen,” Saumitra Khan, 39, said at a press conference as tears rolled down his cheeks. “Sujata, I will send you papers for mutual divorce. Please sign them and do not use Khan, my surname, from today,” he added. About an hour later, it was Sujata Khan’s turn. “I married him going against the wish of my family. I love him and will always do so. I still have the red sindoor (vermilion) on my forehead (a sign of a married woman),” she responded in front of reporters. “Can a personal relationship end in divorce because of politics? No TMC leader told me that I have to divorce him to join the party.” Sujata Khan alleged that the BJP was filling its ranks with corrupt and ambitious leaders. She said she hadn’t been shown any respect in the BJP although she worked hard for it. The 32-year-old did not hold any significant post in the BJP. The move triggered unprecedented drama, with Saumitra Khan calling a media conference and declaring that he would send his wife divorce papers in 24 hours. Saumitra Khan is a former TMC leader who joined the BJP in January 2019. He was the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Bishnupur in Bankura district. He retained the seat by contesting for the BJP and was made president of the state BJYM about three months ago. Speaking at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata , before her husband reacted, Sujata Khan said: “I observed with pain that people who are corrupt and overambitious, those who can be called rotten apples, are being herded into the BJP. There is no place for hardworking people who fight for their principles.” Sujata Khan was welcomed into the TMC by Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh. “Sujata is like my daughter. We are happy to have her in the party,” said Roy. Her move came two days after seven TMC legislators, including prominent leader Suvendu Adhikari, and three others from the Left and the Congress joined the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah at a rally in Midnapore town. Jay Prakash Majumdar, state vice-president of the BJP, said: “Unlike Saumitra Khan, his wife does not have a history in politics. This does not have any political significance for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-vs-tmc-politics-sparks-family-drama/story-c2klJ5v1vD2bBL9Zu8ILUK.html

In view of the pandemic, the celebrations are expected to be subdued this time. While earlier, the extravaganza used to continue throughout the month, this time the celebrations will last for only a week. The government has also banned gatherings near the Brahma Sarovar, where the main events are to be held. However, all programmes will be livecast for the benefit of devotees. While inaugurating the event the Himachal CM said, “Gita is not merely a book, it is a treasure source of knowledge about life and a medium to learn the art of living.Gita teaches us how to counter stress, indecision and lack of happiness caused by the glitter of modern life based on materialism and mad-race for money. It also teaches us how to rightly conduct ourselves in different contexts of life.” Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya, who presided over the ceremony virtually, said, “The message of Lord Krishna delivered in Bhagwad Gita is about selfless action which is the base of all-round growth and welfare of humans, society and the entire world.” Main events to look forward to: Recitation of Gita verses in Jyotisar: December 21 to 26 Sant Seminar at Kurukshetra University: December 24, 2020.

22-12-2020||City||Veggie prices crash, Haryana farmers say unable to even recover input cost||Wholesale prices of several vegetables have seen a sudden slump in the past few days, with farmers claiming that they are not even able to recover the input cost. Traders say the dip is due to the glut in local mandis as they are not able to transport the vegetables to Delhi mandis due to the ongoing farmers’ protests.The prices of not just seasonal vegetables, but even cash crops, such as spinach, coriander and methi leaves, have reported a decline.Seasonal vegetables, such as cauliflower, carrots and radish are being sold at Rs 1 to 2 per kg. The rate of cauliflower was Rs 30 a kg last month. Farmers say they have no option but to plough the standing crop despite the falling prices as they have to prepare for the next crop cycle.“I had ploughed three acres of radish but there were no buyers in the open market so I had to settle with the wholesale rates as otherwise I would have had to dump the crop,” said Satish Kumar, a farmer from Yamunanagar. The slump has especially hit those farmers who had taken land on lease for cultivation. Nasib Singh, a farmer from Ladwa of Kurukshetra, said, “I had taken four acres on rent at Rs 53, 000 per acre. But now the prices of cauliflower have dipped to around Rs 1.50/kg. At this price, I will not get even the harvesting cost.” ‘No relief from govt scheme’Farmers, meanwhile, said the government’s Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana (BBY) too has failed to provide them any relief as the scheme comes with several conditions, including fixed schedule for sowing and harvesting. “The prices (to compensate farmers) fixed under this scheme are not enough to protect farmers from loss, and they also need a J form, which most buyers do not provide. Most famers are not even aware of the procedure to avail the scheme’s benefits,” said Om Prakash, a farmer of Indri of Karnal district. Officials of the Haryana horticulture department said the BBY scheme was launched to provide financial assistance to farmers if prices fell below a certain limit. “The prices under this scheme have been fixed to cover the input cost as the prices of vegetables keep fluctuating,” said a senior official of the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/veggie-prices-crash-haryana-farmers-say-unable-to-even-recover-input-cost/story-FbLanl3UOTvaBPByjkpmZL.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Airport in Sindhudurg to function from January 2021: Maharashtra CM||Flight operations from the newly-built Chipi airport in Konkan’s Sindhudurg district will commence operations from January 2021, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has announced on Sunday. Thackeray said that while the operations were to commence from May 1, 2020, it got delayed owing to the pandemic-ensued lockdown. In his address to the state on Sunday, the CM said, “The operations were to start from May. However, it got delayed owing to the lockdown as a lot of equipment was to be brought from outside the country. We will, however, start operations from January.”The airport, located close to the Goa border, will provide better connectivity to the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Goa, north Karnataka and western Maharashtra. It will further boost tourism and development in the Konkan region.In April 2019, the ministry of civil aviation had permitted Alliance Air, an Air India’s subsidiary, to operate flights from the new airport under the government’s regional connectivity scheme, Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN), which proposes to increase air connectivity to smaller cities. The airport has been built at an investment of ₹520 crore. The airport has a 2,500-metre long runway and a terminal building with a capacity to handle 200 departing and arriving passengers each. On Monday, BJP MLA Nitesh Rane said that the airport should be named after the late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/airport-in-sindhudurg-to-function-from-january-2021-maharashtra-cm/story-Ey0pq8IVqeVuMsRq9CaCZM.html
22-12-2020||Chandigarh||BSF, police fire at Pak drone sighted in Gurdaspur border village, 11 hand grenades recovered||The Border Security Force (BSF) troops and Punjab Police fired at a drone purportedly launched from Pakistan and recovered 11 hand grenades it dropped at a border village near Dorangla town of Gurdaspur district on Saturday night. The development comes five days after the police claimed to have busted a drone module in Amritsar district with international links and arrested two Delhi-based drone supplier-cum-assemblers. Four jailed smugglers are believed to have links with them. In a press release, director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said a search operation was started immediately after receiving information from the BSF about the drone movement along the border at Chakri border outpost (BOP) around 11.30pm. He said the BSF troops fired several shots to bring down the drone. “The BSF personnel alerted the Gurdaspur police and the Dorangla station house officer (SHO) reached the area and deployed his men to fire at the drone with AK-47 and SLR rifles,” he added. A combing operation was started in the area on Sunday morning, leading to the recovery of a plastic box containing the 11 grenades at Salach village, Gupta said. He said the box carrying the grenades was attached with a wooden frame and was lowered to the ground with a nylon rope. “The drone was not recovered and it is likely to have flown back into the Pakistan territory after dropping the payload. Technical investigation is on,” he said. A case was registered under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act at the Dorangla police station. The Austrian-made Arges-84 series hand grenades are designed to inflict massive damage against soft targets within their blast radius, spraying shrapnels out to a distance of 30 metres. Four drones, one partially constructed, a video transmitter system, drone hardware, etc were recovered recently and investigations have revealed key links between the Pakistan-based handlers actively involved in the latest drone module as well, the police said. The movement of drones from across the border is posing a fresh challenge to the Indian security agencies as spotting Pakistani drones has become a routine affair of late. In September last year, the police had busted a module of Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) that was receiving weapons from across the border using drones with the help of Pakistan agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bsf-police-fire-at-pak-drone-in-gurdaspur-recover-11-hand-grenades/story-L8BGqsQMq5uyTz9ec3hK9H.html
22-12-2020||City||Ready to face any action for supporting farmers: Birender||Former Union minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Birender Singh on Monday said he is ready to face any action for supporting the farmers agitating against the Centre’s agricultural reforms. Singh, who has been touring the state under the banner of Chhotu Ram vichar manch for the last couple of days in support of the farmers, said he wants their issues to be resolved. “Standing with farmers is not a case of crossing party lines or challenging the leadership. Even when I was a Union minister, I had openly cleared my stand in favour of Jat reservation in 2016. If my party takes action against me for standing with farmers, I will neither tell them to keep me in the fold nor ask them to throw me out of the party. I want the government and farmers’ representatives to come together to break the deadlock. The issue will be solved only after a dialogue,” he said.On being asked whether he is in touch with the central leadership to end the ongoing deadlock, Birender Singh said he has told the party’s national president JP Nadda, organisational secretary BL Santhosh and Haryana in-charge Vinod Tawde that the farmers of Punjab and Haryana are “different” from farmers of the rest of the country.“I had a meeting with Tawde today. I told him ye Haryana-Punjab ke kisan hain, inse panga mat lo. Abhi time hai iss masle ko hal krlo (I told Tawde not to mess with the farmers of Haryana and Punjab, there is still time, they should resolve this issue),” he said, adding, “I am in touch with the Central ministers too.”When asked if he wants the new laws to be repealed, he said he only wants the farmers’ income to increase. “I never held that these laws are good for the farmers. During the Baroda bypoll too, I had said that various stakeholders have been talking about reforms for the last 20 years but I had never spoken in favour of these three laws,” the former Uchana MLA maintained.He further said that he wanted to join the agitation sooner but the farmers’ leaders weren’t ready to let him do so. On the possibility of him switching parties, he said there was no question of joining any other party. “I retired from active politics when the party gave my son Brijendra a Parliamentary ticket from Hisar. I will do only farmer politics now; won’t contest on any seat.”When asked if his MP son would resign to stand with him, he said, “ Do you think he (Brijendra) was happy with these laws when these were tabled in the Parliament? Not at all. He has served as an IAS officer for 21 years. He knows what he has to do as he is also attached to Chhotu Ram’s legacy.” “After the anti-defection law came into existence, legislators and parliamentarians have had to face many situations where they had to go against their wishes,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ready-to-face-any-action-for-supporting-farmers-birender/story-F7pZd6JpQtTyk8XopXksjK.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: ATS unit arrests two for threatening witness in drugs case||Charkop unit of the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) took custody of gangster Harish Mandvikar and Sajid Electricwala from Arthur Road jail after Mandvikar threatened a witness to give false evidence in favour of Electricwala in another case.In June 2015, the Charkop ATS had busted a unit manufacturing mephedrone (MD), a narcotics drug, and had arrested seven persons from the unit at Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri (West). ATS had seized 155kg of raw and finished contraband substance from the unit.Electricwala was the prime accused in the 2015 case and was lodged in Arthur Road jail. The trial was scheduled to commence on November 26.However, a week before the hearing, the witness received threats and inducement from one, Sujit Padwalkar, to give false evidence favourable to Electricwala. When the threats continued for a few days, the witness approached the ATS Charkop unit and a case was registered under sections 195(A) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).ATS laid a trap and arrested Padwalkar while threatening and inducing the witness again on November 24. During the interrogation, Padwalkar revealed that he was threatening the witness at the behest of Sachin Kolekar alias Pintu, an associate of Mandvikar, who is also lodged in Arthur Road jail in a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) case.Subsequently, in the same MCOCA case, Kolekar was also arrested. During his custodial interrogation, Kolekar revealed that he had instructed Padwalkar to threaten the witness, as ordered by Mandvikar. The instruction was passed on to him by the gangster via a hand-written chit from inside the prison, according to an ATS release. Mandvikar has 13 criminal cases, including two cases of murder, registered against him. He has been convicted with a sentence of life imprisonment for his complicity in murdering matka king Suresh Bhagat in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-ats-unit-arrests-two-for-threatening-witness-in-drugs-case/story-0QJoBE3q52YTWc127q52yI.html
22-12-2020||City||Uniform farm laws not viable in a diverse country like India, says Punjab Agricultural University report||Uniform farm laws and policies are not viable in a country as diverse as India and legalising minimum support price (MSP) will help encourage crop diversification, said Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in a report released on Monday. Listing the recommendations in the report titled ‘Farm Sector Laws and their Implications for Punjab Agriculture’, the university says the views of states should prevail while enacting farm laws as agriculture is a state subject. “There are extremely diverse agro-ecologies in the country. Consider for instance cropping patterns and systems in three adjoining states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. States are in a better position to design and implement policies in sync with their strengths and weaknesses. Implementation of uniform policies across the country might be counterproductive,” the report reads. “The support being given to the farmers in the form of MSP and public procurement is just peanuts as compared to the incentives received by other sectors, especially the big corporate houses,” said PAU vice- chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon.Prof Kamal Vatta, head of the department of economics and sociology, said there should be a policy to narrow down the inequality between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors by generating income opportunities and raising earning of farmers rather than providing a free hand to big traders and corporate houses to flourish at the cost of poor farmers.“This is a major source of state revenue as industrial development got a major setback in Punjab due to huge tax rebates and incentives given to the industry in hill states. Thus, the state should be allowed to levy taxes on trade of agricultural produce outside the APMC markets also,” said Prof Vatta.Also, the report says the laws must have adequate safeguards for the farmers and the government should explore quasi-judicial forums for dispute settlement rather than leaving it to the bureaucracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uniform-farm-laws-not-viable-in-a-diverse-country-like-india-says-punjab-agricultural-university-report/story-PipflAvhbXhraxuTu3wBuJ.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||P Varavara Rao to stay at Nanavati Hospital till January 7: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state government and National Investigation Agency (NIA) to let Telugu poet and accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case, P Varavara Rao stay in Nanavati Hospital till the next hearing on January 7, 2021.The court, while taking note of the 82-year-old’s current health status asked the hospital to submit the latest health report before the next hearing, and also announced that it would hear the pleas on the next date of hearing as the same was pending for some time now.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the petition filed by Rao’s wife P Hemlatha, seeking transfer of her husband to a proper hospital and bail for him in light of his health condition, was informed by senior counsels Anand Grover and Indira Jaising that Rao had responded well to the treatment after he was shifted to Nanavati Hospital. Grover, however, said that the octogenarian was having fluctuation in his blood pressure which was above normal, and had bouts of shivering. Rao was being monitored and treated continuously by the hospital.In light of these submissions, Grover sought that Rao should be granted temporary bail as both JJ Hospital and the hospital attached to Taloja prison were overcrowded or did not have the wherewithal to treat Rao. However, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted that the hospital was awaiting an order of the court to discharge Rao as his condition was now stable. Thakare further added that if required Rao could be shifted to state-run JJ Hospital. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA pointed to the fact that Rao’s family had agreed that he had shown improvement and hence, there was no further need to keep him in the hospital.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that it was not keen on allowing Rao to be moved out of Nanavati Hospital till his wife’s application was not heard on merit. The court further directed the hospital to furnish the latest report on Rao’s condition before the next hearing and posted the petition for final hearing on January 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/p-varavara-rao-to-stay-at-nanavati-hospital-till-january-7-bombay-hc/story-4Y6nrxeHOWsVbUJjsznu5L.html

22-12-2020||City||Mumbai civic body prepares blueprint for Covid-19 vaccine drive||With the prospect of India beginning its Covid-19 vaccination drive as early as January 2021, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has prepared a vaccine administration, distribution and storage plan.The civic body has identified eight hospitals as Covid-19 vaccination centres — KEM Hospital, Sion Hospital, Nair Hospital, Cooper Hospital, Bandra Bhabha Hospital, VN Desai Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital and Bharat Ratna Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital.Presently, Cooper Hospital is being developed as a model centre for vaccination, so that other centres can replicate the plan. The vaccine will be administered in three phases.Over 1.25 lakh health care workers have been identified for the first phase, front-line workers will be given the shots in the second phase and people in the high-risk category above the age of 50 years will be administered shots in the third phase. The training of 2,500 people for vaccine administration is underway at BMC hospitals. Administrative management In Phase-1 of vaccination drive, health care workers will be administered the shots. For the purpose, eight hospitals – KEM, Sion, Nair, Cooper, Bhabha, VN Desai, Rajawadi and BDBA – have been identified. Each of these centres will further identify a minimum of three-five ideal vaccination sites. The deans and medical superintendents of the hospitals have been instructed to identify dedicated team members (five per site) for the smooth and effective administration of the vaccine. A model vaccination centre at Cooper hospital is being developed, which will be replicated at the other seven hospitals. Depending upon the vaccine availability and introduction of second phase for frontline workers, BMC will start additional centres. Phase-wise immunisation For the first phase, BMC has so far identified 1.25 lakh health workers, of which data of 80,000 workers has been uploaded on the Centre’s vaccine portal. In Phase-2, frontline workers will be given the vaccine. The maintenance department of BMC is collecting the data of frontline workers from public health, sanitation, waste management services, frontline engineers, vehicle drivers, BEST and cemetery staff for the vaccination drive. In the third phase, citizens in the ‘high-risk category’ above the age of 50 will be administered the vaccine. Management of AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) panel The eight centres have been identified as vaccination centres for management of adverse effects following immunisation. The existing AEFI committee will be expanded to include cardiologists, nephrologists and respiratory medicine specialists to strengthen the AEFI surveillance system for the vaccination drive. Vaccine storage facility Regional vaccine store (RVS): An area of 5,000 square feet on the first floor of BMC’s five-storey Parivar building at Kanjurmarg has been identified as the centralised spot for storing the vaccine. Administrative approval has been obtained for the building. The storage facility is as per the norms of the Union health ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO). The facility will have two walk-in coolers (WIC) and one walk-in freezer (WIF). The tenders for WIC and WIF have been invited. WIC will have a capacity of 40 cubic metres and will maintain temperature upto -80 degree Celsius, while WIF will have a capacity of 20 cubic metres and will maintain temperature between -15 and -250 degree Celsius. 17 ice-lined refrigerators (ILR), each with a capacity of 225 litres, will be supplied by the state government. Eight of these have been delivered to the eight identified vaccination centres. A technical committee for cold storage under the chairmanship of additional municipal commissioner of western suburbs, who is in-charge of the civic public health department, has been formed. The other members are technical experts from National Cold Chain Resource Centre. This committee will monitor the construction of the cold storage facility as per quality and safety norms of the Centre. A District Task Force (DTF) Committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the additional civic commissioner (western suburbs) for guidance and overall management of the entire process of introduction of Covid-19 vaccine in the district. The first meeting of DTF was held on December 11 and was attended by officials from the education, police, transport and solid waste management (SWM) departments as well as the vaccine administration partner agencies – WHO, UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) and UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). Distribution mechanism for the vaccine The distribution mechanism already existing under the routine immunisation programme shall be implemented for Covid-19 vaccine. Additional vehicles will be deployed for transporting the vaccine from the Kanjurmarg facility to the vaccine centres with the help of police. Deans and medical superintendents of the hospitals will identify dedicated persons (pharmacists or cold chain handlers) for maintaining the inventory of Covid -19 vaccine when it is made available from the central storage. Training for vaccinators A two-day state-level training was held on December 14 and 15 for vaccinators. Four senior officers from BMC’s epidemiology department, WHO, UNDP were trained as master trainers. The junior-level trainers are being trained at medical colleges, peripheral hospitals and special hospitals. These trainers will train the vaccination team members at their respective centres and field-level staff. All the trainings will be completed by January 7, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-prepares-blueprint-for-covid-19-vaccine-drive/story-neXMWC8qx5PTOHJ4S2HZxM.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects ED’s plea opposing closure of cheating case against Jet Airways||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday rejected a plea filed by the enforcement directorate (ED) for permission to intervene and oppose closure by the Mumbai Police of a cheating case against Jet Airways and its directors, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal.A single bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere on Monday upheld a magisterial order refusing permission to ED to intervene in the matter and oppose the closure report submitted by MRA Marg police.ED had moved HC after the Mumbai sessions court rejected its appeal against the magistrate court order.The case of cheating was registered with MRA Marg police station based on a complaint lodged by the chief financial officer (CFO) of Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL). The complainant alleged that in 2018-19, ATIPL had done business of ₹900 crore with Jet Airways, of which ₹21.31 crore was yet to be paid by the airline. In addition, the complainant alleged, they also made advance air ticket bookings of ₹23.87 crore for the airline, which too was due. The complainant, thus, claimed that Jet Airways had defaulted on payment of ₹46.05 crore to the company.The CFO further claimed that when he met the Goyals’ they assured about payment but to no avail. He also said that the Goyals’ made ATIPL do business with them despite being aware of the financial crisis.The police, after completing the probe, had on March 9 filed a closure report claiming that they found no evidence that the complainant was cheated. The police, in its report, claimed the case was of civil nature and sought closure of the case on that ground.ED had filed an application seeking permission of the magistrate court for intervening in the case to oppose the closure report, claiming police left out various crucial aspects in its probe and that it should be reinvestigated.ED claimed that the police did not properly investigate facts about three meetings between the complainant’s representative and Goyal’s, wherein ATIPL was assured of payment, and also did not record a statement of Goyal about his accounts with foreign banks.ED said police has filed the report with undue haste and claimed that during their probe, they unearthed numerous foreign bank accounts of Goyal and his wife Anita and related entities in the UAE, UK, Switzerland, Singapore, USA etc.ED also mentioned that Anita holds eight properties outside India while the couple has around ₹180 crore in one of their several accounts outside India.In the plea, the agency asked the court to not accept the closure report of the police and asked the court to direct the police to reinvestigate the complaint with regards to undisclosed accounts and assets of Goyal’s and his family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-ed-s-plea-opposing-closure-of-cheating-case-against-jet-airways/story-KTvvsrK94A8YWF62NyliQI.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Kanjurmarg setback: MMRDA writes to state for Goregaon land for Mumbai Metro-6||Following a major setback over the Kanjurmarg plot, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has written to the state government to grant the land parcel at Pahadi Goregaon to build the car shed for Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli).According to officials, the land is reserved under Development Plan (DP) 2034. However, it’s a part of the excluded part of the plan, which is pending for approval from the state government. “We have asked the state to allot the land parcel which is reserved for Metro,” said an official from MMRDA, who did not wish to be named.While the state is keen on building a common car shed for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz), 4 (Wadala-Kasarvadavali) and 6 at Kanjurmarg, the Bombay high court (HC) has ordered an interim stay on the transfer of 102 acres of land in Kanjurmarg by the suburban collector to MMRDA, after the Central government claimed ownership of the land.“We cannot let the project suffer owing to legal hurdles. It is better to keep an alternative in place,” the official added. Metro-6 is a 14.5 km under-construction line. For line-4, MMRDA was also looking at a land parcel in Mogharpada in Thane.The state has also indicated at looking at a land parcel in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) for the Metro-3 car shed which was allotted for the Centre’s Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. In an address to the state on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray slammed the Centre for creating hurdles in the project. He also said that the state is ready for a dialogue with the Centre over the issue.However, an official from the state urban development department (UDD) said that acquiring land in Goregaon will be an expensive affair. The official, who also did not wish to be named, said, “While Kanjurmarg is government land, the land in Goregaon belongs to a private party, which means that the acquisition will be a more expensive affair.” The official added that UDD will now examine the DP again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kanjurmarg-setback-mmrda-writes-to-state-for-goregaon-land-for-mumbai-metro-6/story-KbtmxhvR49sINA9xWZoFPO.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Congress leaders give Sonia Gandhi’s letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray||Days after Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, expressing unhappiness over alleged non-utilisation and diversion of funds allocated for welfare of the socially backward classes in the state, a delegation of senior Congress ministers and leaders met Thackeray on Monday to hand over its copy and requested him to act on the suggestions. State Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the Congress chief has made important suggestions regarding the welfare schemes for the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), as the party has always worked to give justice to them. He also said the chief minister responded positively. In her letter to Thackeray, Gandhi has advised the chief minister to ensure that the budget allocated for the SC and ST communities should be used for the same purpose. HK Patil, Maharashtra in-charge of the Congress, recently said the party had organised a conclave of leaders from socially backward classes, in which some problems were raised and suggestions were made. “The party chief specifically mentioned these issues, so that these sections could be protected from administrative lapses,” he said. For the first time since the government of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi – alliance of the Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – came to power a year ago, the Congress chief has expressed her discontent and it would be interesting to see if this will continue as the three-party government has completed just one year, said observers. “The party has got many complaints over diversion of funds meant for socially backward classes. The chief minister has assured us appropriate action in the matter. He also confirmed that he got the letter through a mail on Sunday,” said a senior Congress leader, who was part of the delegation. State energy minister Nitin Raut said the Congress president has expressed her concern and not unhappiness. “It is nothing but a misunderstanding that the Congress chief has expressed her unhappiness. She has only expressed her concern on a serious issue which needs to be treated as guidance for the MVA government as she is also elder to the chief minister. She has been writing such letters to the chief ministers of other states too on important issues that are brought to her notice,” Raut said. Thorat also said just like NCP president Sharad Pawar, the Congress president too is guiding the government. Even if no meeting is being held, this letter is a channel of communication with the chief minister. “Our alliance is strong and the state government is working on a common minimum programme. The coordination between the three parties is also good and the credit for it goes to all of them,” Thorat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-leaders-give-sonia-gandhi-s-letter-to-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-zQSIa8FQpCwf6qAKqqBS2N.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Are private healthcare providers entitled to PM insurance cover: Bombay HC asks Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) had last week directed the Central government to clarify whether private healthcare providers, who were forced to render services during Covid-19 pandemic, were entitled to insurance cover available to Covid warriors under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP).The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla has directed the Union health and family welfare ministry to clarify the stand by January 7, 2021.The court was hearing a petition filed by Koparkhairane resident Kiran Surgade seeking a direction to New India Assurance Company Limited to immediately disburse her claim of ₹50 lakh under PMGKP.In her petition filed through advocate Ajit Karwande, the woman said her husband, an Ayurveda doctor, was practicing locally in Navi Mumbai. As Covid-19 started spreading across the state, her husband Dr Bhaskar Surgade received a notice from the commissioner of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on March 31 asking him to keep his dispensary open and warned to prosecute him under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code if he failed to do so.She claimed that her husband had to open his dispensary in terms of the notice and treat patients, including persons infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Eventually, he contracted the infection and died on June 10.Following her husband’s death, she submitted a claim for compensation of ₹50 lakh with New India Assurance Company under PMGKP on August 2. However, as the insurance company rejected her claim on September 7 on the grounds that the deceased was not serving in any hospital designated to treat only Covid-19 patients and was a private practitioner, she moved the HC.Responding to the petition, assistant government pleader Kavita Solunke had, on December 17, pointed out that the state government on October 1 wrote a letter requesting the Union health and family welfare ministry to extend the benefit of insurance cover to private practitioners as well.Solunke pointed out that the request was made especially because the Government of Maharashtra had mandated opening of all clinical establishment and had also regulated rates of treatment for private healthcare providers as well.“In Maharashtra, considering the current scenario of Covid-19 situation, OPD (out-patient department) and IPD (in-patient department) services, screening, examination, treatment and follow-ups in field settings or private clinics and hospitals, all are associated with professional hazard of contracting Covid-19 and related fatalities,” stated the letter referred by Solunke.“So request you to please consider inclusion of all private healthcare providers/workers who have continued delivery of healthcare services during this pandemic, endangering their lives and many have died due to Covid-19 while serving humanity and nation,” the letter added.Noticing that the Union health and family welfare ministry has not responded to the letter till date, HC directed the secretary of the department to respond to the letter within two weeks. HC has now posted the petition for further hearing on January 7, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/are-private-healthcare-providers-entitled-to-pm-insurance-cover-bombay-hc-asks-centre/story-kmIMnu2OL4HTie4VcNqIaM.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Climate change is here, need to adapt to ways to handle it: Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray||As Mumbai became the sixth Indian city earlier this month to be chosen as a member of the C40 cities – a global network of cities committed to tackling climate change – state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in an exclusive interview to HT spoke about the roadmap and strategies to make Mumbai the most active city among the C40 group in South and West Asia region. The minister addressed key aspects for the most vulnerable districts in the state in the fight against extreme weather events, droughts, extreme flooding and annual sea-level rise. Being included as a member of the C40 cities allows Mumbai to be a part of an international conglomerate of leaders fighting climate change. What is your strategy to make Mumbai the most active city in the South and West Asia region? Mumbai has been at the forefront of fighting climate change and also has borne the brunt of climate change. We realise the need for climate change action and have been working on mitigation and adaptation measures. Our electric buses, (under construction) sewerage treatment plants, ongoing urban forestry are some of our mitigation measures. The pumping stations that we need now due to excessive monsoons, is one example of adaptation. However, we can’t just stop here and look inward. C40 will help us track global measures in various cities around the world to fight climate change. What are some of the other cities in Maharashtra that you plan to propose that could be part of the C40 cities and why? We may have Pune or Nashik or even Thane as a part of it soon. More so, the experience and knowledge-sharing by Mumbai would help us work towards making other cities better in terms of environment, and ideally carbon-neutral at some point, in the decade. Among the districts in Maharashtra, Mumbai has been identified as one of the most threatened ones according to the climate vulnerability index. How do you plan to reduce risks to the city? We have to realise that climate change is already in our backyards. It is no longer something that is restricted to the poles and glaciers. We will have to work on it on macro as well as micro levels. We have to adopt and adapt many lifestyle changes from governments working towards electric mobility and renewable energy, to citizens auditing their travel and carbon footprint, to solid waste management and waste reduction. Similar to the state climate action policy, will Mumbai get a city-specific climate action policy (compatible with the Paris Agreement goal as deemed by C40 cities)? Our state’s “Majhi Vasundhara” (climate change mitigation programme) actually focuses on local action for climate change. It [the programme] pushes for climate change action not just for Mumbai but also for each urban and rural local body, so that collectively we realise how important it is to curb our carbon footprint. Is there a need to revise existing development plans to be more climate resilient or curb future construction along the low-lying areas through sustainable development, factoring in issues such as coastal flooding, sea level rise and extreme weather events? It’s now time for us to move beyond just plans. We need to act. Plans for 2030 are too far away. With the number of climate change events occurring, it’s time for collective, quick action on mitigation and adaptation. How do you intend to keep the seamless balance between conserving the environment and wildlife while ensuring infrastructure development is not compromised upon? Both are needed and what brings both together is sustainable development. Every infrastructure work can be planned in a way that is sustainable. Infrastructure growth, urbanisation and industrial progress can go hand-in-hand with the environment. There are enough technologies, methods and incentives for that. For example, while Maharashtra will now cross over 1 lakh crore of investment this year itself, we have also protected a forest (Aarey) in a city like Mumbai, declared two sanctuaries and more than 10 conservation reserves. Similar to introducing climate mitigation and adaptation in the curriculum of school students, what would be your strategy to boost availability of more green, open spaces, and the city to adopt a more environmentally sensitive way of life? Awareness and action are important. Awareness can be generated through curriculum, elected representatives and common conversations. We also must encourage schools, industries, farmers and corporates alike to carry out certain green deeds and have some basic lifestyle changes. What is your vision for Mumbai from an environmental point of view by 2030? There’s a lot really to achieve in the coming years: better waste segregation at source, electric mobility, renewable energy dependence to be higher, more public transport options, sewerage treatment plants to help us re-use water, rainwater percolation and harvesting pits, urban forests, pro-sustainability infrastructure creation, formal housing from slums for a better lifestyle and pedestrian pathways to connect the last mile. The above is a list of the ongoing efforts and those that we need to strengthen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/climate-change-is-here-need-to-adapt-to-ways-to-handle-it-maharashtra-environment-minister-aaditya-thackeray/story-pP1xLgfmIahDezwbTmI3RP.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Realty check: Property sales in Mumbai Metropolitan Region down by 45%, launches by 61%||The Covid-19 lockdown has hit the real estate sector this year as both, the new launches as well as the sales of properties, have reduced drastically in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). According to a report by ANAROCK Property Consultants, new project launches had reduced by a staggering 61% as only 30,290 units were launched this year as compared to 77,990 launches in 2019. Similarly, the sales also came down by 45%. In 2019, 80,870 properties were sold in MMR last year, which fell to 44,320 units this year. According to ANAROCK’s chairman Anuj Puri, it was an unprecedented year, with the pandemic causing an all-round upheaval. “The ensuing lockdowns have caused the sector to come to almost a complete halt, with very few aspiring homebuyers making enquiries. Site visits were next to impossible, with buyers, developers and brokers uncertain of the [Covid-19] situation and remaining cautious. At the same time, all the development work came to a halt as migrant construction labourers made a beeline back to their hometowns. For a while, it seemed that Covid-19 was a death stroke to the sector,” said Puri. Around 7 lakh-9 lakh on-site real-estate workforce in MMR had returned to their home states after Mumbai emerged as one of the worst-affected Covid-19 hot spots in the country in April. His observations were backed by Nishant Deshmukh, managing director of real estate company Sugee Group. Deshmukh said it was one of the worst years for the realty sector. “It was a state of total paralysis,” he said. Experts said the return of the workforce to their home states and the monetary crises faced by the builders owing to loss of sales acted as a dampener for the sector. According to experts, the sales could have dipped further, but certain proactive steps such as reducing the stamp duty and cutting the interest rates gave some relief to the sector. Puri said the past few months even witnessed an improvement in sales. “The buyers were attracted by the ongoing discounts and offers, the prevailing lowest home loan interest rates and limited-period stamp duty cuts,” he said. The Maharashtra government on August 26 had decided to reduce stamp duty from 5% to 2% until December 31. The stamp duty from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2021, will be 3%. The revision in the stamp duty helped boost the sales, experts have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/realty-check-property-sales-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-down-by-45-launches-by-61/story-ZjxKq3fMDGR2QWAlRzCaZM.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks petitioner to justify claim of actor Kangana Ranaut exceeding her constitutional right||The Bombay high court (HC) observed that actor Kangana Ranaut has fundamental rights under article 21 of the Constitution and had a right to express her views through tweets. The court was responding to a case in which a Mumbai-based petitioner advocate sought suspension of the actor’s Twitter account to show that the reasonable restrictions on her freedom of speech as per Article 19(2) of the Constitution are violated by her allegedly offensive tweets. The state reiterated its stand that the writ petition was vague and the remedy lay elsewhere in the form of a public interest litigation (PIL) and hence sought dismissal of the petition. The court then sought to know from the petitioner the grounds on which it could exercise its powers in the case and posted the case for further hearing on January 7. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the criminal writ plea by Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, was informed that the actor had not only hurt the Muslim community but had also caused him mental agony. “Free speech and hate speech are different. In my petition, there are multiple examples of how she has hurt many feelings. There are many cases filed in various courts against her. There is personal mental injury that I have suffered through her tweets,” submitted Deshmukh.When asked to respond, additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik submitted, “This petition either needs to be converted into a PIL or else so many people will start coming to court stating that they are hurt. People will read newspapers and start coming to court. Constitutional right and constitutional remedy are different. This is a vague petition.” He sought dismissal of the petition. The court last week had directed a petitioner lawyer to justify how his plea seeking suspension of Ranaut’s Twitter account could be treated as a writ plea and not a PIL as his claims were not personal but involved an entire community. After hearing the submissions, the bench sought to know from Deshmukh how his right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution had been violated. “Any individual can have this account. She also has the fundamental right to have an account and has a fundamental right to express her thoughts. So you have to show how your fundamental rights are breached? Unless the case comes under the reasonable restrictions, can we accede to your request? If you have to judge, what will you do?” observed justice Shinde. Justice Shinde further said, “Word against word, how can we go into this issue? We are not in a hurry to dismiss your petition. Take your time. We don’t want to discourage a young lawyer like you.

A spokesperson for the varsity’s examination department said applications for examinations are submitted by the colleges to the university through an online portal. “A particular department or college may have asked students to submit applications physically,” said the official. Meanwhile, exams for undergraduate students are underway at colleges. Given the pandemic, the winter semester exams for both undergraduate and postgraduate students are being conducted online. According to the university’s instructions, exams for arts, science and commerce students are being held for 60 marks in multiple-choice question format.The official said exam forms were accepted offline by colleges and university departments only for those enrolled in old courses (annual pattern/CBGS pattern). “This is only for a few repeater students and few students of postgraduate/research courses. These students are required to submit the exam form at their respective college/departments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-allege-mumbai-university-asked-to-submit-pg-exam-forms-in-person-varsity-denies-claim/story-QMImETgT5RlvUWfkZMbzQM.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||UK flight ban: Stranded travellers from Maharashtra, other states worried||India announced a temporary ban on flights to and from the United Kingdom (UK) on Monday, leaving many Indian travellers in UK are worried about returning home. The ministry of civil aviation said all flights to and from UK would be suspended from December 22 to December 31. Last week, a new and more infections strain of Covid-19 was discovered in UK. At a press conference on Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that London and surrounding areas would come under strict lockdown, following which many countries banned flights and ferries to and from UK in an effort to restrict the spread of the new strain. On Monday, the Union ministry of civil aviation temporarily banned flights between India and UK. International flights had recently resumed on certain routes under the Indian government’s air bubble scheme. Norman Schofield, a Pune resident whose 25-year-old son is in Birmingham said, “My son, who has travelled abroad for the first time, has been there from November to explore universities for higher studies. We had booked his return ticket [on Air India] for December 29 from London to Mumbai, on Monday. As parents, we are worried for him as he is all by himself. If severe lockdown is imposed, it will be difficult to stay longer.” Schofield said the airline’s call centre has not been able to help them change the date of travel. Delhi-based film producer Sudhanshu Pandey is in London at the moment. “I have been here since November and was booked to fly to Delhi on December 28, but due to the announcement by the Indian government, I am willing to fly back to India on Wednesday itself,” he said. Film industry professional Dipesh Patel said, “I am in charge of the 80 [member] crew who travelled with me and we were to return this week. While most of us hail from Mumbai, a few belong to Delhi and Kolkata. We do not wish to wait until December 31 as we fear that this suspension of flights may be further extended.” Despite these concerns, experts say the temporary ban on flights to and from the UK will have a negligible impact on tourist traffic. “Due to the current environment and quarantine rules, off-season tourism to UK in any case had not picked up.We foresee an increase in international tourism only in the summer of 2021, with normalcy [expected] by winter of 2021,” said Nishant Pitti, founder of online travel company EaseMyTrip. “We’re seeing faster growth and demand for domestic tourism, especially when international options are limited. Travellers are aspiring to travel and take a break and the focus will be on Indian destinations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uk-flight-ban-stranded-travellers-from-maharashtra-other-states-worried/story-koX9yPdhXmgySzh0WR7XTO.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Tunnelling work for Mumbai coastal road to begin on Jan 7||After several delays, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will finally begin the tunnel-boring work for the ₹12,721-crore coastal road project from January 7, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Monday. He also said that 17% of the work for the project has been completed so far at three sites (Worli, Amarsons Garden and Priyadarshini Park) even though the civic body had set a target of completing 30% of work by December. The tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is said to be the largest in India, will be used to create a 3.45-kilometre (km) twin undersea tunnel from Priyadarshini Park to Girgaum Chowpatty. BMC has completed the assembling of the parts of the TBM, it had purchased from China last year, at the work site at Priyadarshini Park in Malabar Hill. The machine arrived in April this year and was taken to the site in many dismantled parts on 17 trailer trucks.The tunnelling work for the underground section of the coastal road was delayed owing to the Covid-19 restrictions and also because BMC refused to seek help from China to assemble the parts, amid tensions on the border. While the entire coastal road was slated to be completed by October 2022, Chahal said that the project will now be functional by July 2023. “Substantial work has happened in the past couple of months. About 400-metre-long TBM (diameter of 39.6 feet) now stands fully assembled on the reclaimed land, and the tunnel-boring commences from January 7,” he said.A senior civic official said 175 acres of land under the Arabian Sea has been reclaimed so far, while the remaining 102 acres is being reclaimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tunnelling-work-for-mumbai-coastal-road-to-begin-on-jan-7/story-XU6MVw5dkc5j22Wce7UwII.html
22-12-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena-BJP fight to delay Mumbai’s Metro, transport infra upgrade?||After a brief gap owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and a year ahead of the civic elections, the ally-turned-foes – the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – are again involved in a tussle, this time over the city’s infrastructure projects, which could delay the much-needed transport upgrade. The big fight The BJP, which came to power in the state in 2014 riding on the development plank, is not leaving any opportunity to show that the decisions of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government – an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – are anti-development, especially after the state’s decision to move the Metro car depot out of Aarey Milk Colony. The Thackerays and the Shiv Sena were invested in the ‘Save Aarey’ campaign and moving the car shed from the Aarey Milk Colony in Goregaon to save the wildlife and environment was one of the party’s poll promises. Over the past few weeks, the BJP-led Centre and state have been engaged in a legal battle over the ownership of the 45-hectare Kanjurmarg plot, the state’s alternative to Aarey for the car shed. The Centre moved court, terming the city collector’s order to transfer land for Metro illegal. The Bombay high court stayed allotment of the Kanjurmarg land for the proposed integrated Metro car shed project. In a tit-for-tat move, the Thackeray government then decided to carry out technical assessment to house the Metro depot on a plot in Bandra-Kurla Complex, which the state had given to the Centre for the bullet train project. Besides, Thackeray also met locals from Dahanu taluka in the neighbouring Palghar district, who are opposing the Centre’s Wadhawan port project, and expressed support for them. Change in stanceAmid this, Thackeray, in a public address on Sunday, softened his stance and called for a dialogue with the Centre and the Opposition BJP over the Kanjurmarg plot for the “larger public good”. Thackeray, in his address, said, “The unfortunate part is that the Centre has gone to court against the state about the Kanjurmarg land, saying it is a salt pan land. The state is only acting for the welfare of the city, and the Centre should do that too. These things can be sorted out through discussions…I am also ultimately a sevak of people, like PM Modi says he is pradhan sevak…You (the Centre) should serve the people instead of politicking and if you can’t do that you are not fit to be on the chair.” Political observers said Thackeray’s overtures to the Centre could have been triggered after the BJP painted the Sena as anti-infrastructure development and called its decisions ego-driven. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called the government’s move to look at BKC for car depot a “childish” idea. After Thackeray’s appeal, the Opposition said it was willing to support the government, provided it gave up its insistence on Kanjurmarg land, as it would delay the Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Metro project by three years and escalate the project cost. Fadnavis said a government-appointed committee itself has ruled out Kanjurmarg plot and it must follow its recommendation. “The project is at such a stage that changing [its plan] now will create issues. The Centre will fully cooperate... Today the CM said that in the future more space would be required [for Metro-3 depot in Aarey]. It is not so, the car shed has been designed considering maximum capacity of the corridor. The entire change should be kept aside and Mumbaikars must be given this Metro line this [coming] year. We are with the government; the chief minister should announce and finish the project. There is no question of any credit war. He should immediately take a decision and take full credit for it, we have no issue with it,” Fadnavis said. Prep for pollsWith an eye on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in February 2022, the BJP has begun work in Assembly segments and civic wards. The party had given a close fight to the Shiv Sena in the 2017 elections, bagging 82 seats in the 227-member BMC. After losing power in the state government, the BJP is expected to go strongly against the Sena to dislodge them from the BMC, where it has ruled for three decades. The BJP has the backing of non-Marathi, north Indian, and business-class voters and it could use the development agenda against the Sena’s Marathi manoos plank. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the ongoing issue is a “clash of corporate interests” through the two political parties. He said, “It can’t be said that development will happen if the car depot is made in Aarey and not in Kanjurmarg. However, the BJP will take advantage of this confusion created by the Sena-led government. It may not be the main issue, but development agenda could run parallel for the BJP. The Shiv Sena or the government needs to educate people why they took the decision to move the car depot.” He added that the BJP got “sensitive” after the government moved the car depot. “Aaditya Thackeray took a stand and stuck to it. The political leverage will be with the Shiv Sena,” Jondhale said. Infra needThe need for an additional mass transport system in Mumbai was identified in the early 2000s and action plans were drafted, chalking out a Metro network. In subsequent years, the city only has one 11.4-km functioning Metro corridor. With the construction of four Metro lines underway, it will still take a few years for Mumbai to fully recognise its dream of a Metro network. AV Shenoy, transport expert, said the political fight is only worsening matters. “There are only two ways to resolve the tussle. Either the Supreme Court can give directives to sort it out in a time-bound manner, keeping public interest in mind, or the state and Centre could back down from their rigid stands and find a middle ground. Maybe Sharad Pawar could mediate between the two entities,” Shenoy said. “People will not come out on the streets and put pressure. They may definitely show it in the civic elections. Ultimately, only people will suffer because of the fight,” said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-metro-dream-more-distant/story-prGyGaR4o2gvrjsmVpbHyL.html

An appeal has also been made to set aside the October 16 communication of the UT administration asking PU to defer the elections.The senate term ended on October 31, but elections were not held this year for the first time since Partition to PU’s apex governing body, which has 91 members, of which 36 are nominated by the chancellor. The petitioners have alleged that certain candidates owing allegiance to the ruling political dispensation at the Centre in order to avoid an unsuccessful contest initially pressurised the university administration and their political bosses to defer the elections. They have now started another agenda for replacing the senate with a committee comprising representatives of the ruling political party who would be nominated by the office of the chancellor, also the vice president of India, through the home affairs ministry, it was alleged. According to the petition the V-C did not have jurisdiction to defer the election and should have brought the matter before the syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/7-former-pu-senators-move-high-court-demand-polls/story-c6ybtzzO6FZouMrv9z0GaK.html

22-12-2020||Delhi||Lok Nayak doctors, medical students want resumption of non-Covid services||Doctors and medical students from Lok Nayak hospital and associated Maulana Azad Medical College launched a sit-in protest outside the director office demanding that non-Covid services be restarted. The 2,000-bed hospital was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility block by block March through April. With the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) under control in the city, only 166 beds were occupied in the hospital on Monday. The interns, postgraduate students, and resident doctors who are supposed to be trained in their respective fields have been managing only Covid-19 patients. “A student has three years for post graduate training, almost one year in gone without us receiving any education in their respective fields. Those from the medicine and anaesthesia sections have been treating the most serious Covid-19 patients in the ICU. The rest – even those studying surgery — have been included in a central pool or Covid duty in other parts of the hospital,” said Dr Keshave Singh, president of the resident doctors association of the hospital. The hospital has about 2,500 doctors undergoing training – 1,250 studying MBBS, 250 interning after it, 600 post graduate students, 300 senior residents who work with doctors in their field, and 50 super speciality students. “Even the college is not open for MBBS students, who do not even need practical experience in the hospital. We have demanded that it be opened as MAMC and the University College of Medical Sciences run by the Delhi government are the only institutes to not have started classes so far,” said Dr Singh. He added that the doctors have been raising this demand since September. “There were some discussions on letting the students work in other Delhi government hospitals, but no one has been assigned so far. Recently AIIMS and PGI Chandigarh held their PG entrance exam, three of the top 10 spots went to interns from MAMC but they haven’t been given an internship completion certificate, as they have been treating just Covid-19 patients and their training is incomplete,” he said. Dr Rajan Sharma, National President, Indian Medical Association said, “The doctors need to get holistic training, they are not here to become Covid specialists. The doctors are first taught the basics in MBBS, then they go on to do post-graduation, then work with senior doctors in the field to gain experience before working on their own. If they miss any of it, we will have doctors who are not properly trained.” In addition, the first year post graduate students from the hospital were posted at Covid Care Centres and dispensaries. “They were supposed to treat Covid-19 patients, but what they are really doing is clerical work. They are wasting their precious time needed for training. We want the government to bring them back to the hospital and start the training,” said Singh. “Other non-teaching hospitals can be converted into Covid-19 hospitals with Lok Nayak managing only the very sick Covid patients. This will ensure that the teaching of one of the most prestigious medical college is not hampered for an entire year,” he said. The director of the hospital Dr Suresh Kumar refused to comment. However, a senior official said that the decision rested with the government. “The hospital already has submitted a plan on how to partially open the non-Covid services. Now, the decision has to be taken by the government. The fear is if there is a surge in the number of cases, how will it be managed,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lok-nayak-doctors-medical-students-want-resumption-of-non-covid-services/story-w2xo2rAl8sSCwI36dyPrjM.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi L-G Anil Baijal calls for continued testing even as daily cases dip below 1,000||Chairing a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Monday directed the city administration to continue with the increased testing and aggressive contact tracing, even as the daily number of fresh cases of came down to 803 — the first time in 126 days that the count has dipped below 1,000 — on Monday.The number of active cases also dropped below 10,000 for the first time in 138 days, since 9,897 infections were reported on August 4. As many as 62,440 tests were conducted on Sunday, as reported on Monday, in comparison to the average of 82,490 tests a day over the last week. With the government scaling up testing since December beginning, the positivity rate in Delhi has remained below 2% for seven consecutive days and below 5% for 19 days, as per the data shared by the Delhi government.The positivity rate stood at 1.29% on Monday. The city also reported 27 more deaths due to the viral infection, taking the total toll to 10,304. The L-G was also informed that district officials in Delhi have surveyed over 17.2 million residents so far for Covid-19 symptoms to assess the spread of the infection. Of the total, over 39,500 had cough, fever and other indicators of the viral disease.The L-G, who is the chairperson of DDMA, also reviewed the city’s vaccination plan, which the Delhi government is preparing as per directions from the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). The L-G was informed that district officials in Delhi have surveyed over 17.2 million residents so far for Covid-19 symptoms to assess the spread of the infection. Of the total, over 39,500 had cough, fever and other indicators of the viral disease.“Reviewed the preparedness for the roll out of Covid-19 vaccination in Delhi and advised the officials to work in close coordination with the Union @MoHFW_INDIA in this regard,” Baijal said in a tweet.“Appreciated the exemplary effort put in by all the stakeholders in effective management of #Covid19 while stressing the need for continued and sustained efforts towards higher testing, aggressive contact tracing and strict compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour especially in view of the existing weather conditions,” the L-G said in another tweet.A senior government official, who attended the meeting, said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is the vice-chairperson of the DDMA, raised the issue of those coming from the United Kingdom. Earlier in the day, Kejriwal had urged the Central government to ban flights from the United Kingdom, where a new, infectious strain of the virus has been detected. “New mutation of corona virus has emerged in UK, which is a super-spreader. I urge central govt to ban all flights from UK immediately,” Kejriwal had tweeted.The Central government on Monday afternoon announced the suspension of all flights from the UK, starting midnight on Wednesday till December 31.“Medical teams have been deployed to conduct RT-PCR tests at the airport on the passengers who are arriving till Tuesday. Also, quarantine centres in hotels in Aerocity have been readied for anyone who tests positive,” said the official cited above, on condition of anonymity.A second official said training of healthcare workers is underway in Delhi for administering vaccine shots to the people. “Around 400 doctors from different hospitals in the city have almost been trained for the Covid-19 vaccination drive. Now, training for auxiliary nurse midwives and nurses, who would be the actual vaccinators, is beginning. ASHA and Anganwadi workers will also be trained in the next stage to spread awareness about the vaccine in their areas,” said the official, requesting anonymity.In order to check the spread of coronavirus in the national capital, the Delhi government had in November decided to expand the door-to-door survey to the entire city. The government had roped in several teachers of its schools to be part of the teams conducting the survey.“Till now, authorities have surveyed 17,210,020 people in Delhi, of which only 0.23% (39,583) had Covid-like symptoms,” the first senior official said.The L-G also directed officials to give priority to non-Covid patients and normal surgeries, as the coronavirus situation is improving in the city and most beds for Covid-19 patients are vacant. Orders to implement the L-G’s directive on non-Covid patients will be issued soon, a health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/l-g-calls-for-continued-testing-even-as-daily-cases-dip-below-1-000/story-yzjaWnikD7DvZea5zkO6SK.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Five held for duping customers of online shopping portals||Five persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating customers of online shopping portals of around Rs 27 lakh on the pretext of processing a prize for them, the police said on Monday.They posed as executives of online shopping platforms, told unsuspecting customers that they had won a car in a lottery, based on their shopping history, and cheated them of money on the pretext of seeking a processing fee for their prize, the Delhi Police said. According to Vijayanta Arya, the deputy commissioner of police (northwest), the gang purchased the data of customers from an online firm that maintains a database. “The gang purchased the data of each customer for anywhere between Rs 2 and Rs 10,” said the DCP. The police recovered eight mobile phones, 10 SIM cards, eight ATM cards and a database of customers from the gang of four men and a woman. The DCP said that the gang made about Rs 27 lakh in a month of operations. “We are trying to trace those who have been duped,” said the DCP. The officer said that the gang came under their radar after a man approached the Jahangirpuri police station earlier this month to allege that he had been duped of Rs 6,000 by a caller who posed as an executive of an online shopping portal. “The victim was told that on the basis of his previous shopping transactions, he had been selected for a lucky draw in which the reward was a car. The victim was given the choice of either collecting the car or getting a cash prize equivalent to the value of the vehicle. Either way, the customer had to pay a processing fee of R6,000,” said the DCP. The victim transferred the amount to the bank account number given by the caller, but could not seem to connect to the number again, following which he approached the police. The police pursued the bank account details of the suspect to crack the case. The DCP said that the arrested persons include those who lent SIM cards and that bank accounts were opened on fake identity proofs to carry out the crime. “The SIM card and bank account used in the fraud would not be used for a fortnight after each fraud,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/five-held-for-duping-customers-of-online-shopping-portals/story-RXWAkOyl21vEwDYXe2GWrJ.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||BJP to start outreach to pressure govt to pay Rs 13,000 crore dues||The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said they will launch a mass movement from December 25 to ensure that the state government releases the outstanding funds of the municipal corporations. According to BJP functionaries, party workers along with councillors and MLAs, will go door-to-door to tell the public about Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s efforts to “cripple” the civic bodies by not paying their dues. Some of the party’s MPs could also be present in the campaign. During the campaign, the party workers will demand payment of Rs 13,000 crore dues of the municipal corporations from Delhi government. The party said that the leaders of municipal corporations and BJP’s state unit leaders will stage a day-long “satyagrah” (protest) at the headquarters of the AAP on Tuesday for not releasing the dues. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said that BJP workers will go door-to-door to demand Rs 13,000 crore dues of the municipalities and ask Delhiites to join this movement. “This fight is in the interest of the corporation employees as well as in the interest of the people of Delhi. In view of the corporation elections, the state government is trying its best to cripple the municipal corporation by not releasing dues,” Gupta said. He added that for 13 days, mayors and leaders of the municipalities sat on a dharna outside the CM’s residence but Arvind Kejriwal did not come out of his residence to meet them. In the campaign that will start from December 25, around 15,000 BJP workers along with 185 councillors, will go door-to-door and distribute pamphlets among masses, the party functionaries said. Naveen Kumar, Delhi BJP spokesperson, said that they will campaign until the government releases the dues to the three municipalities. “We will now take the matter to the public and start a campaign to corner the AAP at the ward level. We will also apprise them that how development work, such as construction of streets, lanes and drains and sanitation services, were getting affected due to non-payment of dues to the MCDs,” Kumar said. Hitting out at the BJP, however, senior AAP leader and party’s MCD in charge, Durgesh Pathak said that the BJP stood completely exposed in the Rs 2,400 crore scam and was hence trying to divert attention. “The BJP has got completely exposed about the massive corruption at the MCD. Now, they are using the taxpayers money to mislead the citizens of Delhi,” Pathak said. He further said that the BJP has unsuccessfully tried to “hide their corruption” by installing hoardings and posters all over Delhi. “Salaries could have been given to civic employees by using these crores of rupees properly. The BJP should immediately release the salary of their employees and stop dirty politics,” Pathak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-to-start-outreach-to-pressure-govt-to-pay-rs-13-000-crore-dues/story-EOcOe8o9o63iK2hpubJC9I.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Mercury increases slightly, but cold respite may be short lived||Delhiites got a brief respite from the cold, as the minimum temperature in the city on Monday rose by around degrees Celsius. India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings show that on Monday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording of the city, was 5.5 degrees Celsius. This is three degrees below the season’s average. The maximum temperature was 22.4 degrees Celsius. On Sunday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory was 3.4 degree Celsius, five notches below the season’s normal and also the lowest for the season so far. Scientists said that the spike in temperature was because of the passing of a western disturbance in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. “This marginal rise in the temperature was an impact of the western disturbance in the hills. By Tuesday, however, the temperature will start falling again and we expect it to drop down to around 3 degrees Celsius in the coming days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. Srivastava also explained that even though the western disturbance did not bring any rainfall in Delhi and the neighbouring towns, the moisture content in the air had increased, which also caused the pollution levels to go up. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Monday was 332, in the ‘very poor’ category. This was a few points higher than the AQI recordings of Sunday, which was 321, also in the ‘very poor’ range. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that the air quality might deteriorate further in the coming days as the temperature dips. “A gradual rise in minimum and maximum temperature is likely in the Delhi region. However, surface winds are likely to slow down and surface inversion is likely to form. A sharp deterioration of ventilation condition is forecasted for the next two days,” Safar analysis said. It added, “The AQI is forecasted to deteriorate to the higher end of the very poor category on December 22 and likely to stay in the high end of very poor on December 23 and 24.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mercury-increases-slightly-but-cold-respite-may-be-short-lived/story-YcwFdMwlTchMZKAyFECOQM.html
22-12-2020||Education||Delhi scholars return to decrepit labs, ruined samples||Science research scholars and postgraduate students in the Capital, who have started to return to their institutions for the first time since March, have come back to find laboratories in disarray, equipment damaged, samples ruined, and their work severely set back — with financial losses possibly running into lakhs.Research scholars and postgraduate students of science and technology programmes started resuming, in phase, their work in labs after a nod from the University Grant Commission (UGC) in November. Earlier this month, PhD scholars from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) returned to the varsity after eight months, to find their laboratories in disrepair. For instance, in a TL/OSL lab (thermo luminescence/optically stimulated luminescence), used by research students of the Centre for the Study of Regional Development (CSRD), soil samples collected from different parts of the country have been rendered useless due to a termite infestation in the building.Ishita Manna, a PhD scholar who was working in the laboratory before the lockdown was announced towards the end of March, said the ruined samples may delay her thesis submission“Even though the UGC has granted a six-month extension for the submission of the PhD thesis, how will I manage to complete my research without the soil samples? We collect rare, varied soil samples from different landscapes such as the mountains, including the Himalayas, rivers, and desert, and find out their age. I had collected my samples from Beas Kund in Himachal Pradesh. We can’t go back there for at least the next few months because the roads are blocked due to snowfall,” she said.According to the students, the doors and cabinets in the lab are now infested by termites. “Moss and fungus have started growing on the walls. We don’t know how to resume our research work like this,” Manna said.Moshahid Alam Rizvi, who teaches in the department of Biosciences at Jamia Millia Islamia, said that the inaccessibility of labs in the earlier months of the lockdown had affected both equipments and research work. “In addition to damage to smaller equipments like CO2 incubator and Gel Doc System due to electricity fluctuation and absence of staff to monitor it, our ultra-deep freezers were also affected. These freezers are used to store sensitive chemicals, biochemicals and many live cell lines brought from other countries. The cost of financial loss can run into lakhs. A lot of ongoing research work shelved and frozen midway when the lockdown was announced have also been destroyed,” he said.The situation was no different at Delhi University. Ratul Baishya, who teaches at the university’s botany department said work was severely affected since all laboratories were closed till August at least.“While the postgraduate labs remained mostly unaffected due to because maintenance work after July, the lack of manpower affected individual labs running research projects. This caused a range of problems, from termites damaging books and furniture to the destruction of ecological samples that needed to be analysed within a fixed period. Researchers’ work has been set back by a year and now they have to repeat the entire process again,” he said.In June, a fire in the computer laboratory at Ram Lal Anand College destroyed around 40 computers. “Some of these computers were seven-eight years-old and needed to be replaced in any case. So, it is difficult to assess the losses incurred. Since there was no one in the college, there was thankfully no damage to life,” said Rajesh Gupta, principal of the college.A PhD scholar from the school of life sciences at JNU, requesting anonymity, said the students who returned a few months are still trying to repair the damage in their laboratories due to the prolonged closure, and desperately making attempts to recover their work.“Many scholars have lost their biological cell line samples (cells grown under controlled conditions) due to the breakdown of minus 80-degree Celsius freezers when the labs were shut. There was nobody to even check on them, so the students could not shift their samples to other freezers. It takes years to develop such samples. We don’t know how the students will do their research work now,” she said.While students have been alleging that their work has been destroyed due to the “callousness” of the university administration, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said lab supervisors are responsible for the maintenance of the labs. “The supervisors have been allowed to open the labs and take stock of the situation for the last few months. If there has been some damage then the supervisors are responsible for them.”Milap Chand Sharma, Manna’s supervisor and president of the JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA), said, “The supervisors have been writing to the administration about the condition of the labs but there has been no support. In September, we wrote to the administration to allow us to check the laboratories but there has been no response.”Acting vice-chancellor of Delhi University PC Joshi said, “When the lockdown was imposed in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our laboratories had to remain closed without the monitoring present during regular days. The closure of labs for a longer period combined with problems like powercuts affected research work and our laboratories. But, things are now getting back on track as we have people to maintain the equipment in these labs.” A senior official from Jamia also added that they were in the process of getting some of their equipment repaired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scholars-return-to-decrepit-labs-ruined-samples/story-ObWNIaoB1yW74FyXPNRprJ.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers start relay hunger strike, UP Gate border blocked briefly||A relay hunger strike at Delhi’s borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla – that the farmer unions had announced a day earlier, started on Monday as the protest against the three farm laws entered into its 26th day. Farmer leaders said they have also urged the people of India to “beat thalis and other utensils at their homes” on December 27 (Sunday) and to boycott Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Mann ki Baat”. “We also request everyone to skip one meal on Wednesday to show solidarity towards our movement. Between December 24 and December 26, farmers will take their protests to toll plazas in Haryana and will make them free for all. On Sunday, we will be beating thalis while the PM addresses the nation through his Maan ki Baat programme,” said Manjeet Rai, national president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba). Except Ghazipur(Delhi)-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border — where hundreds of protesting farmers blocked the entire carriageways of Delhi-Meerut Expressway and its service roads for nearly an hour in the afternoon — the agitation on Monday continued to remain peaceful.Farmers at UP Gate said that the blockade was done to protest against the Uttar Pradesh administration that, they alleged, was stopping farmers at various places in the state and in Uttarakhand from marching to Delhi borders. The sudden closure of the carriageways going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi triggered traffic jams on Monday. The blockade happened around 3.30pm, but was cleared an hour later, following a meeting of officials of UP administration with the famer leaders. The other carriageway — Ghaziabad to Delhi — is blocked by protesting farmers since Day 1 of their protest. The movement of only emergency vehicles is allowed through that carriageway. At the Singhu border, 11 farmers, mostly leaders of different groups from Punjab, started the hunger protest between 9am and 11am on the main stage that is being used by the leaders to address the gathering. The same number of farmers sat on the relay hunger strike at the other borders as well, declaring that another 11 will replace the first group after 24 hours of fasting and this strike would continue till the government accepts their demands. “Through our relay hunger strike, we want to convey a message that the country’s farmers “annadata” (food provider/farmers) are fasting for their rights. This strike will continue,” said Gurbaksh Singh Barnala of Jai Kisan Andolan. Since the temperature saw a marginal increase on Monday, it provided respite to the farmers from the biting cold that they had been braving for the past few days. At many places, elderly protesters, who had been staying inside tents or tractor trolleys to avoid the cold, were seen sitting in groups under the sun, sipping tea and raising slogans against the government. The Singhu and Tikri borders are completely blocked for any vehicular movement for the last 26 days. Hundreds of trolleys, trucks and four-wheelers are parked on both the carriageways as well as the service roads at the Singhu border. The fleet of vehicles and tents on the roads of the protesting farmers extends to nearly 6-7 kilometres into Haryana, while concrete and iron barriers with barbed wires atop, containers, and sand laden trucks have formed three layers of blockade put in place by the police to stop the agitating farmers from moving into Delhi. Farmers write letters in blood to PMOn Monday, two separate NGOs from Punjab’s Ludhiana set up blood donation camps at the Singhu border. Some of the farmers were also spotted writing their names with their blood on white papers. Many of them also wrote letters in blood addressing the Prime Minister and requesting him to repeal the three farm laws. “Nearly 70 farmers have donated their blood till afternoon and wrote their names and letters to the PM. The lists and the letters will now be sent to the PM either physically or through post. We hope the government will understand our pain, which they have described in the letters with their blood, and scrap the farm laws,” said Taranjeet Singh Nimana, who runs Bhai Ghanaiya Ji Misson Sewa Society, one of the two NGOs. The blood donated by the farmers will be sent to various hospitals in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to help the needy people, said Dr. Bhupinder Singh, who was leading a five-member team of doctors and nursing staff. Fire scareLater in the day, chief fire officer from Uttar Pradesh fire department Sunil Kumar Singh said that some dry grass and garbage caught fire in the forested area some distance away from the protest venue at the UP Gate border towards Delhi side in the evening. “We already have three-four fire tenders stationed at the protest venue. One of them was parked closed the place where the fire broke out. It doused the blaze within 10 minutes,” said the fire officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-start-relay-hunger-strike-up-gate-border-blocked-briefly/story-EuqDVKiyly7anYraVoIQEN.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Man cycles 470km from Tarn Taran Sahib to lend solidarity to protesting farmers||Dilbagh Singh,48, does not own a motorised vehicle or a piece of land. But he says he was extremely keen on joining the farmers protesting at Delhi borders. So, Dilbagh took his bicycle, packed some essentials and cycled 470 kilometres from his hometown in Punjab’s Tarn Taran Sahib to the Singhu border. “Mere paas jameen nahi par zameer to hai” (I don’t have a piece of land, but I do have a conscience). I was pained by seeing many of the famers from my hometown marching to Delhi in tractors and other vehicles. My conscience was not letting me sleep. So, I decided to join my brothers and sisters here at Singhu border. It took me four days to reach here on my bicycle,” said Singh, adding that he is a daily wager by profession and his family survives on his daily income.Standing next to his bicycle on which he carried his bedding, clothes, daily use items including utensils, Singh said that he only had R500 with him when he left his home for Delhi. The money, he said, was not enough for his long journey and he was concerned.“All my worries were gone because throughout my journey, many people extended their support by providing me meals and shelter free of cost, after they learnt about the cause for which I was cycling to Delhi. Most of those good Samaritans were farmers. Some gave me money as well to cover the journey’s expenses,” added Singh, who has been living with his mother and two children in Tarn Taran Sahib, after his wife passed away 11 years ago.A small banner tied around Singh’s bicycle mentioned his name, residential address, the kilometres he covered and the reason for his journey. Asked how his family members have been surviving back in his hometown since the sole earning member was at Singhu now, Singh said, “They will manage somehow. If they ate two rotis earlier, they can now cut it down to one. But I will not leave until the demands of the farmers are met,” he said.Four days ago, Satyadev Manjhi, a 60-year-old man from Bihar’s Siwan reached Tikri border after completing a journey of nearly 1,000 kilometres in 11 days on a bicycle to participate in the ongoing farmers’ protest against three new farm laws.On Sunday, three Punjab and Haryana-based biker groups also arrived at the Singhu border on their bikes to express their solidarity with the agitating farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-cycles-470km-from-tarn-taran-sahib-to-lend-solidarity-to-protesting-farmers/story-ib7CgwXcRCTxhU9ROUw37O.html
22-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC asks cops to trace ‘missing’ Hindu woman who eloped with Muslim man||The Delhi high court has directed the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of Delhi Police’s crime branch to trace a Hindu woman, a B.Tech student, who apparently eloped with a Muslim man in November and got married in West Bengal.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar expressed shock that the local police did not registered a first information report (FIR) that the woman was missing on a complaint by her parents . A Nikahnama (marriage contract) of the couple sent by post to the police could not be verified by the station house officer of the Naraina Vihar police station, it was accepted as genuine by the police.Police said they received the post from an unknown address and are in the process of verifying the address and the authenticity of the document.The bench also said it cannot accept statements attributed to the girl as having been made voluntarily and would want them to be verified. “To satisfy our conscience, we would like that she be produced before us,” the bench said, adding that in case the woman is traced, she shall be brought to Delhi and kept at Nari Niketan at least for four days before the next date of hearing so that she is not under influence of either the petitioner, or the persons with whom she is stated to have eloped and gone,” it said.The court was hearing a habeas corpus plea by the father of the woman, contending that his daughter had been missing since November 7. In his plea, the father said that a Muslim man took her to Kolkata by train. He said the father of the man had also been missing since.The SHO told the court that an FIR was not registered because a Nikahnama was produced to show that the woman married the man. A status report by the police said the woman also informed her family members that she did not wish to be disturbed and that she was happy and safe wherever she was.“During our interaction with the SHO, Naraina — who is also present during this hearing -- he states that FIR was not registered since the Nikahnama has been produced... On our query, he states that the said Nikahnama could not be verified despite efforts..“We are shocked that even in this background, he did not think it proper to register an FIR and proceeded on the bald statement produced before him...This is complete dereliction of duty on the part of the SHO concerned,” the court said in its order of December 18.The bench, while transferring the investigation to the AHTU, also directed the SHO of the area to look into a potential threat to the woman’s family and asked that they be provided adequate security. “The mobile phone number of the beat constable of the area shall be provided to the petitioner and family members, and any call received from them shall be attended to and actioned without any delay,” the court said.The matter will now be heard on January 4, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-cops-to-trace-missing-hindu-woman-who-eloped-with-muslim-man/story-cuCeRdSctWZa8nNXfSKiRO.html

22-12-2020||Bhopal||Protecting Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary: Gun licences to be issued only after forest dept nod||The district administration will now have to take no-objection certificates from the Chambal forest department before issuing arms licences in the 222 villages located within a 10km radius of Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhind and Morena. According to the district administration, 22000 people have gun licences in Bhind, while in Morena, the number is 27000. “A letter has been written to collectors and superintendents of police of both the districts in this regard to curb the activities of the sand mining mafia in the Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary. Even old licences will be renewed after clearance from the forest department,” said Amit Bansal Nikam, divisional forest officer, Morena. “The forest department will check the background of applicant, his understanding towards the environment and his association with the sand mining mafia before giving NOC. This will be an important step to make people aware about the environment as many people don’t have any idea about the impact of sand mining on flora and fauna of the river,” said the DFO. Also Read: Women from Chambal stitch a success story, turn crisis into opportunity“The decision was taken due to an increase in gunfire attack at forest officers in the past a few years. The illegal sand mining mafia terrorises locals and unarmed forest officials with arms and now it won’t continue,” he added. In the past five years, more than two dozen incidents of the sand mining mafia opening fire have been reported from Bhind and Morena, according to police records of both districts. Morena district collector Anurag Verma said, “We have received a letter from the forest department and we will act accordingly. Earlier, we used to take clearance from the police department to check the criminal history of the applicant and now we will take NOC from the forest department too.” As many as 2,200 applications for new arms licences are pending in the district collectorate of Morena while 1,200 are pending in Bhind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/protecting-chambal-wildlife-sanctuary-gun-licenses-to-be-issued-only-after-forest-dept-nod/story-fsMcDkZZnoBGVYoXG8TyPI.html
22-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s camp adds pressure on EU to hit brakes on China deal||The European Union (EU) came under mounting pressure to slow down its push for a major investment deal with China, as opposition grew to any agreement with Beijing that fails to tackle forced labour.Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to US President-elect Joe Biden, weighed in with a tweet late on Monday referencing a story on the proposed EU-China accord. He urged “early consultation with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.”The EU wants the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment to open up China’s market and eliminate discriminatory practices, but critics say that it would in turn reward Beijing with preferential access to European markets despite moves to crush dissent in places from Hong Kong to Xinjiang. A deal would be a “symbolic victory” for China, and could make it harder to forge transatlantic unity on China, according to Mikko Huotari, director of the Mercator Institute for China studies in Berlin.Both sides have set a deadline of the end of the year, but the negotiations could yet stumble if Beijing refuses to budge over key demands on how it treats its workers. The European Parliament passed a resolution on December 17 condemning China’s use of forced labour in Xinjiang, and called for the investment accord to include commitments to respect international conventions banning such practices.‘Totally Baseless’“There is no such thing as so-called forced labour in Xinjiang,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. “The relevant accusation is totally baseless. It smears and slanders against the Xinjiang region and the Chinese side.” Wang didn’t say what commitments China would be prepared to make on labour issues.Several European lawmakers and China analysts have expressed concern that the EU and especially Germany, as holder of the bloc’s rotating presidency and the EU nation with the deepest trade ties to China, may be prepared to set aside labour issues in its rush for a deal by year’s end. They urge holding off until talks can take place with the Biden administration on a common approach to China. The European Parliament will have a say in approving any EU-China deal.Bernd Lange, a German Social Democrat who chairs the European Parliament’s trade committee, said the fact an agreement was near despite such concerns was “clearly worrying.”“Trade policy does not take place in a vacuum,” he said on Twitter. “How the question of forced labour is addressed will determine the agreement’s fate.”No SurprisesChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi discussed the negotiations for an agreement during a working lunch on Monday with EU country ambassadors as well as Nicolas Chapuis, head of the EU delegation in Beijing. In a statement, the EU noted progress in the ongoing talks and said that both sides are in “continuous contact to address outstanding issues.”Human-rights activists say the so-called re-education centers and vocational training programs in the mainly Muslim Xinjiang region are de facto detention camps, while a recent report by prominent researcher Adrian Zenz claimed that slave labour is deployed to pick cotton in the region. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied such claims.Among the key items Brussels had been seeking from China was the ratification of International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, including the ability for Chinese workers to form independent labour unions.Communist CollapseChina has only one official trade union that covers all industries. Beijing has long been spooked by the prospect of organized labour and how it could evolve into a political force, much like the Polish labour union Solidarity did, eventually triggering the collapse of the Communist Party across the eastern bloc. At least one analyst at a Chinese think tank has described the EU’s demand on labour unions as “unlikely or impossible” for China to accept.“We believe as long as both can accommodate the other side’s concerns and meet each other half way, we will be able to achieve the targets set by our leaders,” the Foreign Ministry’s Wang Wenbin said on Monday, describing the talks as “in the final stage.”Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet, said he thinks it’s possible that a deal can be concluded soon but warned that any demands such as those on labour show a lack of understanding of China’s situation. “We have to be realistic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-camp-adds-pressure-on-eu-to-hit-brakes-on-china-deal/story-nm8oBpkj13CP3FJltvorLP.html
22-12-2020||World||Russia hits more EU officials with entry bans over the Union’s stance on Alexei Navalny’s poisoning||Moscow is expanding the list of European officials barred from entering Russia in response to the European Union’s (EU) sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.The move comes a day after Navalny, a longtime adversary of President Vladimir Putin, released a recording of a phone call he said he made to an alleged state security operative — who was identified by media as a member of a team that has reportedly trailed the politician for years. In the recording, the man indicated his involvement in covering up the supposed poisoning and revealed some details of the alleged operation.Last month, the EU imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over what German authorities said was a poisoning in Russia with a nerve agent.In a statement Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the sanctions “a confrontational political decision” and announced that it was expanding “the list of representatives of EU member states and institutions who will be denied entry to the Russian Federation.”The Ministry didn’t reveal either the names of the EU officials or the exact number who would be barred from Russia. But it did say that the list includes “those who are responsible for promoting anti-Russian sanctions initiatives” in the 27-member bloc.Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Diplomatic missions of the three countries, as well as the Delegation of the EU to Russia, have been notified of the measures taken in response to the EU sanctions, the Ministry said.According to the German Foreign Ministry, the German chargée d’affaires in Moscow was told that Russia has issued entry bans against “German government agencies” but no further details were given.The ministry said that the pattern of Russian retaliatory measures is familiar, but it still considers them “unjustified.” It reiterated the German position that the Navalny case is not a bilateral matter, but has a wider international import due to the use of a chemical agent. It renewed calls for Russia to clear up what happened, and said that Moscow so far has shown no readiness to do so.Last week, a joint investigation by the research group Bellingcat and several media outlets alleged that operatives from Russia’s FSB domestic security agency followed Navalny during his trips since 2017. The investigation said the operatives “specialized training in chemical weapons, chemistry and medicine,” and some of them were “in the vicinity” of Navalny in the timeframe “during which he was poisoned.”Navalny, who is currently convalescing in Germany, said the report proved beyond doubt that FSB operatives tried to kill him on Putin’s orders. The video of his phone call to one of the alleged operatives, dismissed by the FSB as a fake, received nearly 13 million views on YouTube 22 hours after it was posted.Russian authorities have repeatedly denied any involvement. Putin charged last week that the investigation relied on data provided by US spy agencies and rejected the allegations.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said that “neither the Kremlin, nor anyone can speak definitively about some kind of poisoning,” because Russia hasn’t received any “information” to that effect from the three countries or the OPCW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-more-eu-officials-with-entry-bans-over-the-union-s-stance-on-alexei-navalny-s-poisoning/story-Jr8JshhPVo6y8Z5kzhJ0BN.html

22-12-2020||World||EU vows ‘final push’ in UK trade talks as rifts over fishing narrow||The European Union is giving a “final push” in a bid to strike a Brexit trade deal with Britain, the bloc’s chief negotiator said on Tuesday.Britain is set to complete its departure from the EU when it leaves the bloc’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31, meaning its current free trade arrangements expire. The two sides have for months been struggling to seal a new framework for their relations, going beyond trade to transport to energy. But the much-postponed final stages now coincide with a cross-Channel crisis as EU and other countries suspend most travel to and from Britain to try to curb a much more contagious variant of the coronavirus.“We are really in a crucial moment. We are giving it a final push,” said the negotiator, Michel Barnier as he arrived to update the bloc’s 27 national envoys on Brexit.Barnier told the closed-door gathering that fisheries remained a stumbling block and that the UK’s latest offer on sharing out the catch from 2021 was “totally unacceptable”, according to an EU diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Barnier is walking a tightrope between London and Paris,” said another EU diplomat, a reference to the small but politically prominent fishing community in northern France that would be affected by any reduction of EU catch.EU officials and diplomats said the EU could be willing to cutting the value of its fish catch in British waters by around 25% from 2021.But the sources said that was only one piece of the puzzle. The length of the transition on fishing rights beyond Dec. 31, as well as how the EU could retaliate if London cut its vessels out of British waters afterwards, were equally important.Earlier in the day, EU diplomats and officials said an agreement was getting closer but also warned it might not come together in time to come into force on Jan. 1.TRADE RETALIATIONThe UK’s offer to gradually curb EU access over three years was also deemed too short for the bloc, which wants a longer-term business perspective for its fishing industry. London has said the bloc’s proposal of six years is too long.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit in a 2016 referendum, arguing that it would restore Britain’s sovereignty, has repeatedly said it must control its waters and who fishes there. London has hence seen the EU’s effort to enshrine trade retaliation in their agreement in the event of losing access to UK waters as excessive, a disagreement that has also played out prominently in another area of trade talks related to ensuring corporate fair play on production standards and state aid.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Johnson spoke on Brexit, as well as the coronavirus, in a phone call on Monday, according to EU sources. More calls would come as needed, they said.Britain, the world’s sixth biggest economy, left the EU, a trade bloc of 450 million consumers, last January. Around $900 million in annual trade is at risk if they fail to craft a new accord by the end of this year. A senior British minister on Tuesday ruled out prolonging Britain’s transition out of the EU beyond Dec. 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-final-push-in-uk-trade-talks-as-rifts-over-fishing-narrow/story-sEvZXAbijSzCxc8IdVjrtI.html

It could be extended depending on the spread of the virus variant in those nations.Iraqi citizens in those countries will be allowed to return, subject to a two-week quarantine on arrival.All land borders with neighbouring nations will also be closed to travellers for two weeks, though the transport of commodities will be permitted, authorities said.The government ordered malls, restaurants, clubs and other social venues to close for two weeks from Dec. 24.Iraq has recorded 586,503 cases of Covid-19, including 12,725 deaths, according to the health ministry.The ministry said it had reached an agreement with Pfizer to import 1.5 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, which would arrive in the country early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-bans-air-travel-with-eight-nations-over-new-variant-of-virus/story-AKz0JX08oWsCyctxqwOn0M.html
22-12-2020||World||Joe Biden names two more Indian-Americans to top positions||US President-elect Joe Biden has named two more Indian-descent Americans to top positions in his administration. Gautam Raghavan, who was born in India, will be the deputy director of the office of presidential personnel, and Vinay Reddy will be director of speechwriting.Raghavan, an Obama White House alumnus and former chief of staff to Representative Pramila Jayapal, will be heading a powerful department that is entrusted with selecting political appointees to federal positions. Every incoming administration has to fill roughly 4,000 such posts.Reddy, who has worked with Biden since he was vice-president and was on his campaign staff, will be head of the team of speechwriters, a very senior position that reflects the president-elect’s close personal equation with him.Biden announced four more appointments on Tuesday. Anne Filipic, another Obama alumnus, will be director of the office of administration and management that runs the executive wing; Ryan Montoya, a veteran of Clinton and Obama administrations, will be director of scheduling and advance; Bruce Reed, a long-time Biden associate, will be deputy chief of staff; and Elizabeth Wilkins will be senior adviser to the chief of staff.“These experienced individuals are joining my administration to carry out policies that will put our nation on a path to building back better than ever before,” Biden said while announcing the new appointments. “They are respected leaders whose values and priorities align with my own and who will dutifully execute their roles to serve the American people.”The president-elect Biden had on Monday named Indian-American Bharat Ramamurti, a long-time congressional aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, as deputy director of the National Economic Council, the key department that advises the American president on domestic and global economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-names-two-more-indian-americans-to-top-positions/story-IUKkGMOwzOKvHOuWUBzEFK.html
22-12-2020||World||‘Assume it’s already in US’: Dr Fauci calls UK travel ban ‘dramatic step’ to contain new Covid variant||Top infectious disease expert of the United States, Dr Anthony Fauci, on Tuesday said that it’s “certainly possible” that the new variant of coronavirus found in Britain has already reached the US as dozens of countries announced travel bans from the United Kingdom.During an interview on ABC’s Good Morning America, Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, called travel ban a “dramatic step”, but indicated that there could be a requirement to test travellers before they arrive in the country.“When you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK, that you really need to assume that it’s here already, and certainly is not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it is already here,” he said.Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that the new variant has not been identified in the United States through sequencing efforts. However, the CDC, in a scientific brief posted on its website, highlighted that viruses have only been sequenced from about 51,000 out of the 18 million Covid-19 cases recorded in the country so far. It further added that the variant could already be in the US without having been detected, given the small fractions of infections that have been sequenced.“Ongoing travel between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the high prevalence of this variant among current UK infections, increase the likelihood of importation,” said the public health institute.Also Read | Over 40 countries ban travel from UK to contain new Covid-19 variant. Here’s the listThe United States has recorded over 18 million Covid-19 cases and more than 319,000 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center. The CDC said that the scientists are working to learn more about this variant to better understand its impact on the transmission rate and vaccine efficacy.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said that the new variant of the coronavirus is 70% more transmissible than existing strains, prompting several countries to ban travel from Britain. India has also suspended all flights from the UK, from December 22 to December 31, to contain the spread of new Covid-19 variant, which is believed to have originated in southeast England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assume-it-s-already-in-us-dr-fauci-calls-uk-travel-ban-dramatic-step-to-contain-new-covid-variant/story-u7UQmv20Ttgpy8hZjAmqqI.html

The announcement was posted by the department on Twitter on Monday.Accordign to Al Rawahi, Oman’s health ministry has formulated a vaccination strategy to cover 60 per cent of the population. He also said that the vaccination programme will be divided into phases, and the first one will start with 20 per cent “due to the limited supply at the current period”.High-risk groups of people, including frontline medical workers, as well as individuals suffering from chronic diseases and elderly persons are set to be inoculated during the first stage.The vaccine will be administered in two doses, with the second one being given after a 21-day period.After the United Kingdom warned that a new variant of the virus seemed to be spreading much faster than previous kinds, India, Pakistan, Russia, Jordan and Hong Kong joined European countries in suspending travel from Britain, and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman closed their borders completely.Oman’s one-week closure of all official ports of entry began on Tuesday “to protect community members from the severity of infection and the speed of spread”.The sultanate’s decision to impose an international travel ban followed an announcement by its neighbour Saudi Arabia late on Sunday that it would shut its borders for a week or until clearer details emerged about the more contagious variant of the virus that has hit the UK.Last week, Saudi Arabia became the first Arab country to start a nationwide vaccination campaign with the Pfizer/BioNtech shot.Oman has struggled to contain a major outbreak that has infected over 1,27,900 people, although cases have declined in recent months.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-to-receive-first-batch-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-wednesday/story-5jjHaBC1iRR2I9bnaDYBrJ.html

22-12-2020||World||Nepal PM Oli seeks control of communist party, rivals ‘sack’ him as party boss||Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday attempted to consolidate his control over the Nepal Communist Party, inducting his loyalists in a key panel of the party even as the rival faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka ‘Prachanda’ announced the decision to replace him as co-chairman of the party with former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal.Nepal plunged into a political crisis after PM Oli, 68, dissolved parliament on Sunday and decided to hold general elections in two phases on April 30 and May 10, a year ahead of schedule. In a televised address to the nation, PM Oli later defended his decision, insisting that he was “forced to seek a fresh mandate through elections as attempts were made against my government, not to allow it to function properly.”“The dissolution of parliament and fresh elections were not my choice,” PM Oli said in his first comments after the decision. The attempt to induct PM Oli’s loyalists in key party panels such as the central committee started soon after.The two factions of the communist party - one headed by PM Oli and the other by rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal - held meetings of their factions. Dahal’s faction has the majority support in most party panels including the 446-member central committee that met on Tuesday.At the end of the central committee meeting, the Dahal faction announced the decision to replace KP Sharma Oli with Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman of the Nepal Communist Party. “A total of 315 Central Committee Members have voted in favour of Madhav Nepal,” the spokesperson said, declaring that PM Oli will also have to face disciplinary action.Just a few hours before this meeting, PM Oli had also presided over a party meet that he had called. This one announced a 1,199 member committee to organise the party’s general convention to strengthen his hold, adding The newly-formed committee by the Oli faction adds 556 members to the existing 446-member Central Committee of the ruling party to give the prime minister majority control.But the Kathmandu Post, however, quoted experts who insisted that PM Oli’s move to induct 556 members may not be successful.The election commission can only recognise the expansion of the central committee if it has been expanded by a majority vote of the existing central committee or on the basis of the statute of the party that authorises Oli, as a chair of the party, to nominate new members in its Central Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-seeks-control-of-communist-party-rivals-sack-him-as-party-boss/story-VlbsPomIyTzJkI7Gu9zhkK.html
22-12-2020||World||Switzerland starts rolling out Covid-19 vaccine, elderly to get initial jabs||Switzerland got its first doses of Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, paving the way for jabs to begin just as the country imposes a month-long clampdown on public life in an attempt to curb stubbornly high infection rates, health officials said.Switzerland’s drugs regulator authorised use of jabs from Pfizer and partner BioNTech on Saturday in what officials called the world’s first such approval under a standard procedure.An initial batch of 107,000 doses will go to individual cantons to start inoculating vulnerable people, including those over 75 at first and those with medical conditions.“In the next seven days the first targeted vaccination programmes can start,” federal health agency official Virginie Masserey told a news conference in Bern.Unlike a high-profile vaccine rollout in Britain, Swiss officials are keeping the media away from homes for the elderly where the first jabs will take place.“Switzerland’s Maggie remains unknown,” the Blick tabloid wrote in reference to Margaret Keenan, the 90-year-old British grandmother who this month became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer vaccine.A nationwide Swiss campaign to vaccinate risk groups starts from Jan. 4. Subsequent deliveries of 250,000 doses a month and expected approval of other vaccines under regulatory review held out hope that all who wanted a free jab could get one by mid-2021, health agency officials have said.Covid-19 cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein have surpassed 400,000 and the death toll has topped 6,000, prompting the government last week to close restaurants for a month and urge people to stay home.Switzerland has a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech to get 3 million doses of the vaccine, enough to give 1.5 million two jabs three weeks apart. It has ordered 15 million vaccine doses in all including deals with Moderna and AstraZeneca .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-starts-rolling-out-covid-19-vaccine-elderly-to-get-initial-jabs/story-bwVjPXaMHF5rfMMJFCYIxO.html
22-12-2020||World||In Greece, wastewater analysis gives clues to Covid-19 viral load||Shortly before a surge in infections prompted Greece to impose a second coronavirus lockdown in early November, chemists at a wastewater treatment plant had already concluded that tougher restrictions would likely be necessary.Their clue? Samples of sewage from the capital Athens. Daily collections of wastewater are analysed at the University of Athens to determine the level of viral load and the expected Covid-19 infections in the community.Greece fared better than most EU countries during the first wave of the pandemic, but has seen a rapid rise in infections since October, forcing it to impose a second nationwide lockdown in early November.To the analytical chemists looking at the wastewater samples before that decision, a second lockdown had started to look very likely.“Before this announcement the total viral load in the wastewater was really, really high,” says analytical chemist Ekaterini Galani, a PhD candidate at the University.“Some weeks after the lockdown we observed a really important decrease of the viral load of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater samples, reflecting that the restrictions were really important for the population.”Chemists doing the analysis say that wastewater-based epidemiology is a non-invasive tool to monitor the pandemic by calculating the real number of infections, both of symptomatic and asymptomatic people.“The epidemiological information obtained from this analysis is used by the respective authorities to adapt measures at the right time and control the ongoing pandemic,” says Galani.The wastewater treatment plant in Athens is designed to serve more than four million people and is one of the largest in Europe.Since its first Covid-19 case was detected in February, Greece has seen a total of 129,584 confirmed infections and 4,044 related deaths.While vaccinations are likely to start in late December and point to light at the end of the tunnel, caution should prevail, said Nikolaos Thomaidis, analytical chemistry professor at the University of Athens.“I think there will be a third wave again in January, but I think that the curve will be less severe and acute and that it will flatten in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-greece-wastewater-analysis-gives-clues-to-covid-19-viral-load/story-HealdT8X86somI5zSZIWZJ.html
22-12-2020||World||Israel set for snap election as budget deadline nears||Israel on Tuesday was on the brink of a fourth national election in two years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main governing partner, Benny Gantz, failed to resolve a dispute over the budget.Parliament voted late on Monday against an attempt by both men to delay a deadline of midnight on Tuesday for approval of the fiscal package.Under the law, failure to pass it by then would mean Israel going to the polls in March, and neither parliament nor the cabinet has passed it yet, a process near impossible to complete in a single day.Barring a last-minute surprise, an election would plunge Netanyahu into a battle for survival as public anger has mounted over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and criminal corruption charges that he faces at court.Though polls show Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party emerging as the largest faction in parliament, surveys also predict a strong showing for parties across the political spectrum seeking to unseat him.Netanyahu and defence minister Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White faction, established a unity government in May after three inconclusive elections held since April 2019.But unlike those campaigns, Netanyahu now faces political challengers from Israel’s right-wing in a ballot that will be held in the shadow of the pandemic which has hit Israel’s economy hard.Likud and Blue and White’s coalition deal involved Gantz taking over from Netanyahu as prime minister in November 2021, and passing a bi-annual budget for 2020 and 2021, a de-facto insurance for the power-sharing deal.But even as that accord was being inked, many analysts argued that Netanyahu would not relinquish his powerful post, and Likud has since demanded to pass the budgets separately while Blue and White insisted Netanyahu stick to their deal.Analysts said Netanyahu had been pushing for an election in May or June next year, after the coronavirus crisis was expected to ease and the economy to begin to recover, hoping to win a parliamentary majority that would grant him immunity and put off his trial. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.But a March vote appears far riskier for Israel’s longest-serving leader.“It’s a whole new ball-game,” said Reuven Hazan, professor at the Hebrew University’s political science department. “Netanyahu is far more vulnerable now,” said Hazan. “The chances of him not being prime minister are higher than they were.”Netanyahu has denied pushing for an early election and has blamed the political turmoil on Gantz’s Blue and White. The deadlock has plunged Israel into more economic uncertainty at the end of a year when a pandemic-induced slump is expected to shrink gross domestic product by 4.5% with the jobless rate standing at 12.1%.In an upcoming election, Netanyahu would likely play up the country’s vaccination drive which began this week, as well as his diplomatic credentials following a string of diplomatic deals with Gulf states, Sudan and Morocco, that were brokered by the United States, Hazan said.Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with President Donald Trump, who made a number of pro-Israel moves during the previous elections. But with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, Netanyahu will lose a major campaign asset, Hazan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-set-for-snap-election-as-budget-deadline-nears/story-4s43MS7AT653sdj55OU5tK.html
22-12-2020||World||Black service members more often investigated, punished: US Air Force report||Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct, according to a new report that looked at racial disparities across the service.The report by the Air Force inspector general, released Monday, said Black members of the Air Force and Space Force are less likely to be promoted to higher enlisted and officer ranks, and one-third of them believe they don’t get the same opportunities as their white peers. And it concluded that “racial disparity exists” for Black service members, but that the data did not explain why it happens.The report comes as the Pentagon struggles with a broader effort to expand diversity within the ranks. The Defense Department last week endorsed a new slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force. And it called for a plan to crack down on participation in hate groups by service members and draft proposed changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Air Force IG report outlined data for racial inequities that have long been suspected. It said that a large number of Black service members reported experiences with bias and racism. And while those reports were difficult to validate within the study, the review concluded that it was “reasonable to conclude that individual acts of racism have occurred in the Department of the Air Force.”One Black squadron commander who was interviewed, for example, said the only mentoring he received throughout his career was from other Black leaders. And he said at times Black service members make one mistake, and it ends their career.“You might get left behind if you don’t have someone that looks like you helping to propel you,” he said. “Black service members need to work twice as hard and you can’t mess up.”Discrimination beliefs cut across the ranks. As many as half of the Black survey respondents said they had been discriminated against because of their race. And 45 percent of Black general officers — they include one-star to four-star generals — said they had experienced discrimination. In contrast, 94% of the white general officers said they didn’t face discrimination based on their race.Senior Air Force and Space Force leaders asked for updates within 60 days on how to address a number of the issues, including the disparity in discipline and the fact that 60% of the Black service members surveyed said they don’t get the same benefit of the doubt as their white peers if they get into trouble.Gen. Charles Brown Jr., chief of staff of the Air Force, said service leaders must rebuild trust with their force.“Racial disparity isn’t an easy topic and something we don’t traditionally talk about much throughout our levels of command,” said Brown, the first Black man to lead the Air Force. “Now we must all move forward with meaningful, lasting, and sustainable change.”Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett added that leaders will take appropriate actions to remove barriers and expand mentorship and other programs to encourage diversity.The IG review examined the military justice process data going back to 2012, looked at promotion rates and other opportunities given to service members, conducted interviews, and received more than 123,000 responses to a survey. Officials said it focused solely on Black service members to get the review done quickly, but subsequent changes would be applied more broadly to other minority groups.Specifically, the review found that enlisted Black service members were 57% more likely than whites to face courts-martial and 72% more likely to get nonjudicial punishment as a result of an investigation. Black troops were twice as likely to be apprehended by security and young Black enlisted members were twice as likely to be involuntarily discharged for misconduct. Black troops also are investigated and found guilty of sexual harassment more often.The report noted, however, that recruits who join the force with a moral waiver — whether they are Black or white — are more likely to face discipline problems. Recruits with previous criminal convictions such as assault, drunk driving or marijuana use require a moral waiver to enlist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-service-members-more-often-investigated-punished-us-air-force-report/story-plH2RHZ9MyTlVi39qvkqqI.html
22-12-2020||World||Pakistan opposition alliance releases schedule for second round of anti-government protests||Pakistan’s Opposition alliance has announced the schedule of its second wave of protests to oust the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, starting with a public meeting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s central city, Mardan, on Wednesday. The steering committee of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) -- an 11-party Opposition alliance -- met on Monday to decide the future course of the ‘struggle’ against the government, The News quoted PDM spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussain in a report on Tuesday. The second phase of the movement will start with a public meeting in Mardan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on December 23. It would be followed by another public meeting in Larkana in Sindh on December 27 on the eve of the death anniversary of Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The PDM steering committee has decided to expand public meetings in smaller cities as well. The protests will be held in Bahawalpur on December 30, Malakand January 3, Bannu January 6, Khazdar January 9, Loralai January 13, Tharparkar January 16, Faisalabad January 18, Sargodha January 23 and Sialkot on January 27. The paper also reported that the PDM is still in a quandary on whether to leave the field of Senate elections open for the ruling the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) does not want to leave the field open for the ruling PTI and its allies to get maximum seats in the Upper House of the Parliament in the upcoming polls. It is expected that the issue of Senate elections will come under discussion in the next meeting of the PDM’s leadership, which is scheduled to be held after December 27 or in early January. Besides discussing the PDM strategy for Senate elections, the PDM, in its meeting, will also decide to take part in the bye-elections which are being held in Sindh on three seats as the PPP is in favour of participating in it as has been already written to the Chief Election Commissioner for holding bye-elections. According to a notification issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the bye-elections in Sindh and Balochistan will be held on February 16, while in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 19. The Opposition alliance had earlier announced that their lawmakers will resign en masse by the end of this month from Parliament to paralyse the government and force Prime Minister Khan to call snap polls. Though the PPP is following the PDM’s decision on resignation, it wants the move to be well calculated instead of one made in haste, the report said. According to PPP insiders, the party will discuss all the options in the meeting of its Central Executive Committee, which is expected to be held within this week. The PPP has also a chance of becoming the second largest party in the Senate, the paper added. The PDM has been formed against the Pakistan Army’s interference in politics and installing “puppet” Prime Minister Khan through a manipulated election.

22-12-2020||World||Madhav Kumar Nepal replaces PM Oli as Nepal Communist Party chairman||Madhav Kumar Nepal has replaced Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli as chairman of the Nepal Communist Party, said party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha on Tuesday, adding that the party will be taking disciplinary action against Oli.Speaking at a press briefing, the ruling party’s spokesperson said, “KP Oli replaced with Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman of the Nepal Communist Party.”He said, “A total of 315 Central Committee Members have voted in favour of Madhav Nepal.”The party will also take disciplinary actions against Oli, the party spokesperson added.This comes just two days after PM Oli had recommended the dissolution of the Parliament. Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari ratified the proposal of Prime Minister Oli for the dissolution of Parliament and announced dates for an election.In a live broadcast on state-owned Nepal Television, Oli asked everyone to be prepared for the elections on April 30 and May 10 next year.The decision to dissolve the Lower House, an unprecedented move, had enraged the public as well as his party insiders. A total of 12 writ petitions have been filed at the Supreme Court against Oli’s move, which has widely been claimed to be unconstitutional.Oli-led Nepal Communist Party weighed heavily in both the lower and upper houses with a huge majority secured during the 2017 general election. Protesting the latest move of Oli, a majority of ministers in his cabinet resigned en-masse on Sunday.Hundreds of people took to the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday afternoon denouncing the latest move of Prime Minister Oli and an early election as a constitutional coup.Protestors chanted slogans against KP Sharma Oli and President Bidhya Devi Bhandari for proposing and ratifying the proposal to dissolve parliament and call a fresh election for next year. They termed the move as “a Constitutional Coup” and demanded both the state and executive head of the nation not to go ahead.Oli, who has been losing support within his own party, has been long criticised for making unilateral decisions while making key appointments and decisions. He has also been widely criticised for mishandling the pandemic and saving ministers accused of corruption.The Himalayan nation nestled between India and China has seen 26 prime ministers in about three decades. The nation was expected to get out of the tumultuous situation after the election of 2017 where Oli’s party secured a majority of nearly two-thirds of votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madhav-kumar-nepal-replaces-pm-oli-as-nepal-communist-party-chairman/story-hDjIgzzGXUHPrqpGcVOhGJ.html
22-12-2020||World||Putin signs law letting ex-presidents become senators for life||President Vladimir Putin signed legislation on Tuesday that allows former presidents to become lawmakers for life in Russia’s upper house of parliament once they leave the Kremlin, a government website showed. The legislation follows sweeping changes to the Russian political system initiated by Putin this year that, among other things, allow him to run for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin if he chooses. He had been due to step down in 2024. The reforms are being closely parsed for clues as to what Putin may do at the end of his current presidential term, his second consecutive and fourth overall. Tuesday’s legislation would allow presidents to name up to 30 senators to the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house, and also to become a senator themselves once they have left office. Other legislation that is yet to be signed into law, but has already been backed by the lower house of parliament, would grant ex-presidents immunity from prosecution for any offences committed in their lifetimes, not merely while in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-signs-law-letting-ex-presidents-become-senators-for-life/story-YO1nnQNBZ4IWPqLyzAAnUI.html
22-12-2020||World||China accuses US of ‘weaponizing visa policy’, imposes new visa limits||China hit back with reciprocal actions Tuesday against unnamed American officials in the latest back-and-forth, following a US announcement of new visa restrictions on Chinese officials.The Foreign Ministry also called on President Donald Trump not to sign into law legislation approved by Congress on Tibet.The visa action came in response to a State Department announcement Monday that said the US will deny visas to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials whose policies or actions are aimed at repressing religious groups, ethnic minorities, dissidents or others.“China has taken reciprocal countermeasures against the US individuals and their family members who are primarily responsible for recent interference in China’s internal affairs,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.He did not say who or how many people were affected.Wang also said China opposed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act, which calls for the establishment of a US consulate in Tibet as well as support for Tibetans to choose the next Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader, on their own.Congress approved the bill Monday as part of a $900 billion coronavirus relief package that also included other unrelated year-end legislation.The US has placed an escalating series of sanctions, visa bans and financial restrictions on Chinese government officials and Communist Party members this year. The US-China relationship has become increasingly fraught as the two countries battle over issues from human rights to the coronavirus and trade.Previous visa restrictions and financial sanctions applied to officials “involved in the horrific abuses taking place in Xinjiang, restrictions on access to Tibet, and the destruction of Hong Kong’s promised autonomy,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Monday’s statement.“Today’s action creates additional restrictions applicable to all (Communist Party) officials engaged in such repressive activities, no matter their location,” he said.Wang criticized the US for having “weaponized“ visa policy.“The issues of Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong concerning Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity are purely internal affairs of China, and no foreign forces should interfere,” he said.Earlier in December, the US announced plans to limits visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families to one month, instead of 10 years. The State Department also said it would deny visas to Chinese citizens linked to overseas influence operations involving violence and other means of intimidation.The US side has also put economic restrictions on Chinese companies. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the US market and the US has lobbied other countries to follow suit, with mixed results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-weaponizing-visa-policy-imposes-new-visa-limits/story-NP1Z2Ne5OdFbtBBqfLpVqN.html
22-12-2020||World||‘There could be some modest hit in vaccine efficacy’: Expert on new Covid-19 strain||The new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is said to have originated in southeast England, has raised concerns over the effectiveness of the vaccines developed to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to a CNN report, Pfizer Inc. has started working on generating data to analyse how well blood samples from people inoculated with its vaccine, BNT162b2, against Covid-19 “may be able to neutralize the new strain from the UK.”What are the chances Covid-19 vaccines won’t work against new virus strain?Earlier on Monday, US President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine czar said the chances that one set of mutations would completely alter the structures against which the vaccines induce an immune response is “extremely low.” During a press briefing, Dr Moncef Slaoui, chief science advisor to Trump’s vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, told reporters that he expects Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid-19 shots will be effective against the new variant of coronavirus found in Britain.Meanwhile, Moderna said the biotech firm expects that the vaccine-induced immunity against Covid-19 would be protective against the variants found in the UK. It further added that the company will be performing additional tests in the coming weeks to “confirm this expectation.” The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised only the two Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna.Some researchers who are analysing the genome of the new variant have suggested that there may be “modest reductions” in vaccine efficacy due to “antigenic drift.” Trevor Bedford, an associate professor in the vaccine and infectious disease division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told CNN that there could be “some modest hit in vaccine efficacy, which wouldn’t be good, but I don’t think it would break the vaccine.”In a series of tweets, Bedford had said that the vaccine developers will likely need a process in the coming years to update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses. He also suggested connecting immunisation records to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections. Going forward, I suggest:1. Emerging variants should be assayed against sera from recovered and vaccinated individuals to test for antigenic effects2. Immunization records should be connected to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections18/18Dr VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, on Tuesday said the new virus strain has no impact, as of now, on the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines developed in India and around the world. India has suspended all flights to and from the UK, starting 11.59pm on December 22 till 11.59 pm on December 31 after several countries announced a ban on inbound travel from the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-could-be-some-modest-hit-in-vaccine-efficacy-expert-on-new-covid-19-strain/story-iJS64sqyt7fd28CIuTOKAM.html
22-12-2020||World||BioNTech to boost vaccine capacity, sees shot beating new strain||Pfizer Inc. partner BioNTech SE is pursuing all its options to make more Covid-19 vaccine doses than the 1.3 billion the companies have promised to produce next year, according to the German firm’s chief executive officer.The companies will probably know by January or February whether and how many additional doses can be produced, Ugur Sahin said late Monday in an interview. “I am confident that we will be able to increase our network capacity, but we don’t have numbers yet.”Sahin also said the vaccine will probably work against the new SARS-CoV-2 strain that has emerged in the UK Lab tests of the vaccine’s performance have already been done against 20 mutant versions; the same tests will now be run against the new UK version, and should take about two weeks, he said.Efficacy results of more than 90% and approvals around the world have set off a race between countries for additional supplies of the precious shots, with the US seeking to exercise an option for a hundred million. Most of the doses anticipated for next year -- enough to immunize 650 million people -- have already been spoken for.More than 2 million people in six countries have already gotten their first shot of the standard two-dose regimen, according to data collected by Bloomberg.BioNTech is seeking more of the raw materials it needs for its mRNA vaccine, more clean rooms and more cooperation partners, Sahin said. The company also needs additional space to formulate the shots, put them into containers and prepare them for shipping, he said. Pfizer is producing vaccine at three sites in the US and one in Europe, while BioNTech has two manufacturing sites in Germany.The vaccine’s EU approval and an inoculation campaign set to start there on Dec. 27 promise to further draw on stocks. By the end of 2020, BioNTech expects to ship 12.5 million doses to the EU and 20 million to the US, the company said in a press conference on Tuesday. The partners have already begun shipping shots to the UK, where Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday tweeted that some 500,000 people had gotten their first dose.New Strain TestsIf the vaccine turns out to be ineffective against the mutant strain circulating in the UK, BioNTech could, in theory, produce a new Covid vaccine to fight the variant within six weeks, Sahin said at the Tuesday briefing. How fast the new inoculation could get to patients would depend on the speed of regulatory review.But so far, Sahin sees no reason to doubt that the existing shot will be effective. Most vaccines target the spike protein, which allows the virus to enter cells.“This virus has multiple mutations, but as far as we know, 99% of the spike protein is not mutated,” he said late Monday. “Let’s do the experiment and get the result. That’s always the best answer, but I would emphasize just to stay calm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-to-boost-vaccine-capacity-sees-shot-beating-new-strain/story-7ejma06o7KsvAbhwQ7jp0M.html
22-12-2020||World||UK turns to cargo jets, freight trains after new coronavirus strain prompts France to bars trucks||UK firms desperate to maintain supply lines after France blocked truck traffic are looking at switching to cargo jets and freight trains to keep goods flowing.J Sainsbury Plc and Tesco Plc are exploring all options to keep supplies flowing, including the use of planes for some fresh-vegetable shipments instead of truck ferries, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG may add dedicated freighter flights to the UK Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel rail link between Britain and France, said talks are underway about running extra freight trains.“There’s been a great deal of discussion with a number of companies contacting us, both existing customers and potential new ones,” Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said. “We’d already seen an increase in demand because of the Brexit deadline but there’s plenty of spare capacity.”Trucks bound for the continent are lined up on the M20 motorway outside Dover, Britain’s busiest ferry port, after a new coronavirus strain prompted France on Sunday to bar drivers from crossing the Channel. The ban, which also applies to Eurotunnel’s truck shuttles, threatens to disrupt just-in-time supply chains and to create shortages of some foods and perishable goods.Sainsbury said it’s exploring alternatives to trucks to keep its stores stocked with lettuce, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruits from the Continent. Air-freight is an option, though the grocer hopes that France and Britain will reach an agreement to reopen links, spokeswoman Victoria Durman said.Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket, has “plenty of food for Christmas,” said Shona Buchanan, a spokeswoman. But if the disruption continues beyond the next two days, “there may be reduced supply on a few items later this week.”Grocers cannot stockpile perishable fresh produce, meaning regular replenishment of supplies is essential. Alternative supply routes being considered alongside air freight include the use of ferries sent directly from Spain and increasing stock from Holland and the UKDedicated FreightersLufthansa will continue to fly passengers to Britain unless there’s a ban on doing so, according to spokesman Helmut Tolksdorf. The aircraft will return to Germany empty, though, after it and others closed their borders to arrivals from the UK Operating a dedicated cargo service would help plug the gap should inbound flights to London, Manchester and Edinburgh also have to cease. Lufthansa Cargo operates planes including Boeing Co. 777Fs capable of carrying 100 metric tons.Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said cargo-only flights between Britain and Europe that use belly-space in Airbus SE A350 passenger jets currently surplus to requirements sold out this morning. The carrier is looking to add as many services as possible for Tuesday, spokeswoman Laura Brander said.Chunnel TrainsEurotunnel currently operates four or five dedicated freight trains a day, carrying bulk products including car parts, steel, aluminum and liquids. That compares with six shuttle trains an hour during normal times carrying trucks through the sub-sea rail route. Before the service was halted, traffic on those trains had increased 11% from a year earlier as companies rushed to stock up ahead of the December 31 no-deal deadline.Spokesman Keefe said freight services have seen a pickup in chilled foods sent to Britain from more distant parts of Europe as a result of earlier concerns about delays at Dover.Running more trains through the tunnel would be a simple matter, he said, though securing pathways across Europe can take a few weeks in normal times. Channel Tunnel cargo services are operated by GB Railfreight and Deutsche Bahn AG’s DB Cargo.Other options for offsetting the loss of truck traffic might including sending more goods in containers, usually the reserve of long-distance shipments from Asia. Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, has been suffering delays and snarlups of its own amid a surge in volumes from restocking before Christmas and the Brexit deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-turns-to-cargo-jets-freight-trains-after-new-coronavirus-strain-prompts-france-to-bars-trucks/story-BtBam69cjWcVZY3D1WelYN.html

We greatly appreciate your commitment to a strong U.S.-India partnership,” the US Ambassador wrote in a tweet.He added, “Similar awards were given to PM (Shinzo) Abe and PM (Scott)Morrison, recognizing our leaders’ shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”United States President Donald Trump has presented Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the prestigious Legion of Merit, a top US honour, for his leadership in elevating India and US strategic partnership, National Security Advisor Robert C. O’ Brien informed.Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu accepted the medal on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Legion of Merit Medal was established by Congress on July 20, 1942.It is awarded to members of the US military and foreign military members and political figures who have displayed exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements. It is one of the highest military medals that can be awarded to foreign officers.The Legion of Merit Medal is a five-rayed white cross, edged with red, resting on a green wreath with a blue centre containing 13 white stars.The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, is a rarely-awarded, prestigious decoration that can only be bestowed by the President, typically to Heads of state or Heads of Government of other countries.The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander is a domed five-pointed American white star plaque of heraldic form bordered in purplish-red enamel 215/16 inches circumscribing diameter with 13 white stars on a blue field emerging from a circle of clouds; backing the star, a laurel wreath with pierced, crossed arrows pointing outward between each arm of the star and the wreath. The reverse is engraved with the words “United States of America.”The citation with the award states “for exceptionally meritorious service as the Prime Minister of the Republic of India from May 2014 to August 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s steadfast leadership and vision have accelerated India’s emergence as a global power and elevated the strategic partnership between the United States and India to address global challenges.”“Prime Minister Modi’s superior effort, personal leadership, and unwavering commitment to advancing strategic cooperation between the United States and India and promoting global peace and prosperity reflect great credit upon himself, the Indian armed forces, and his country,” the citation read.

22-12-2020||World||40,000 lemons missing: UK port chaos upends Brexit planning||In 2019, Nimisha Raja’s Brexit headache was a 24-tonne mountain of beetroot. This year, it’s a hunt for 40,000 lemons.Raja, chief executive of snack producer Nim’s Fruit Crisps, was trying to stockpile to ensure she could fill orders in January without disruption. Instead, like other companies trying to do the same, her plans were completely upended. Delays because of delivery volumes were then compounded after a mutant strain of Covid-19 prompted France to shut down truck travel across the Channel.The problems highlight the difficulties facing businesses as they try to prepare for Brexit with no idea whether a deal will be reached amid a global pandemic that’s strained supply chains. The ban is threatening fresh-food supplies and just-in-time manufacturing, and led to hundreds of trucks stuck on the motorway into Dover, Britain’s busiest ferry port.“It’s been a nightmare, really,” said Raja, who was forced to cancel her delivery. “If it’s stuck at port for two days, do we still have the right to say I don’t want it because I know half of its going to be rotten?”The snack company, based south east of London, has managed to stay open throughout the virus without furloughing any of its workers. But now Covid and Brexit are combining in a nightmare scenario.As industry groups have warned of looming shortages on Monday, some companies have been looking at alternative delivery arrangements. Supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc said it’s studying the use of planes for some fresh-vegetable shipments instead of truck ferries.It’s not the first time a Brexit deadline has caused problems for Raja. Worries about disruption around the U.K.’s original March 2019 departure date caused her to stockpile beetroot, leaving the company scrambling to make them into crisps before they could rot.After that experience, the business decided not to stockpile ahead of other deadlines. But with Brexit going down to the wire, Raja succumbed to warnings from suppliers to get ahead of the import issues anticipated in early January.Suppliers have promised replacement lemons from Egypt but after that Raja needs three tonnes of cucumber if she’s to meet orders. She’s now considering whether she can avoid importing anything from the EU in the coming months.“We can’t go on like this,” she said. “We’ve got so much work to do preparing for Brexit. It’s costing us a lot of money and a lot of time, and that’s the worst thing of all for a small business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-000-lemons-missing-uk-port-chaos-upends-brexit-planning/story-IKnFuiXIAKMf23CfmLYYfK.html
22-12-2020||World||US Congress stings China with new Tibet law on the next Dalai Lama||The US Congress has passed a bill that reaffirms the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The law has been described by Dharamshala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, as a historic move and a clear message to China.The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (TPSA), which was passed by the US Senate, calls for the establishment of a US consulate in Tibet’s main city of Lhasa and underlines the absolute right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama.“The TPSA makes it official United States policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people,” said a statement by the Central Tibetan Administration after the Senate approval. The House of Representatives has already cleared the bill.“Any interference by Chinese government officials will be met with serious sanctions and deemed inadmissible into the United States,” the statement said.Stung by the US move, the Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of meddling in its internal affairs and asked the Donald Trump administration against signing the legislation into law. “We urge the US side to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs and refrain from signing into law these negative clauses and acts, lest it further harms our further cooperation and bilateral relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.Lobsang Sangay, president of the Central Tibetan Administration, described the legislation as a victory for the Tibetan freedom struggle. “We have been pushing for this for the last two years,” he said. He said the move by the US Congress was a tribute to the great legacy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and to the courage and solidarity of six million Tibetans inside Tibet.The Dalai Lama, then 23, had crossed into Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang in April 1959 to escape the Chinese that had invaded Tibet nine years earlier and had brutally suppressed the uprising against Beijing’s rule. The Dalai Lama and the thousands of Tibetans who followed him were settled in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh where he has been living in exile ever since. There are over 80,000 Tibetans living in exile in India; 150,000 more around the world particularly in the US and Europe.China has been attempting to dismantle Tibetan Buddhism since then. It arrested Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in Tibet, just three days after he was proclaimed as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second highest Lama of Tibetan Buddhism, in May 1995. He has never been seen since. Instead, Beijing selected its own six-year old Gyaltsen Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama six months later and enthroned him at Shigatse monastery.The US law is significant because China has already started the process to identify its version of the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama. China has said its leaders have the right to approve the Dalai Lama’s successor, which many see as a coercive attempt to control Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up about 90% of the population, a Reuters report said.This means if the Tibetan people decide to continue with the institution of the Dalai Lama, there could be two Dalai Lamas. Just as there are two Panchen Lamas and two claimants to the title of the 17th Karmapa, the head of wealthy Karma Kagyu school.Sangay said the TPSA sends a loud and clear message to China that Tibet remains a priority for the United States and that it will continue its steadfast support for His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the CTA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-stings-china-with-new-tibet-law-on-the-next-dalai-lama/story-bmWOjVlH6l9VflfTTsm8TI.html

McCain as it sailed through the disputed waters of the SCS.The incident took place as Shandong, China’s second aircraft carrier, was said to be conducting drills in the SCS region after sailing through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday.China claims nearly the entire SCS but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia, besides Vietnam and Taiwan, which China says is a breakaway region.“The Chinese PLA on Tuesday expelled US destroyer USS John S. McCain after it trespassed into China’s territorial waters off Nansha Islands in the South China Sea,” said Senior Colonel Tian Junli, a spokesperson for the PLA southern theatre command.China firmly opposes the US warship’s trespassing, said Tian, warning that the US moves undermine the peace and stability of the region.“Such actions by the US have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security and severely undermined peace and stability in the SCS,” Tian added.The US guided-missile destroyer had last week practised anti-submarine warfare with a French submarine and Japanese carrier in the Philippine Sea.A statement from the US 7th Fleet Public Affairs said the warship was conducting freedom of navigation operations in the SCS.“On December 22, USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the Spratly Islands, consistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Vietnam, and Taiwan,” the statement said.“All interactions with foreign military forces were consistent with international norms and did not impact the operation,” it added.The US statement added that unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the SCS pose a serious threat to the “…freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for SCS littoral nations”.In April, China had scrambled aircraft and deployed ships to track and expel a frontline US warship from near another Beijing-controlled region called Paracel Islands - also known as Xisha Islands in China and Hoang Sa Archipelago in Vietnam - in the SCS.Accusing the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry of carrying out a “provocative act” and violating Chinese sovereignty, the PLA’s southern command had then said the intrusion of the American warship prompted it to “track, monitor, verify, identify and expel” it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expels-us-navy-s-frontline-destroyer-from-south-china-sea/story-ZNC8ikeIcpD4fYjXZAVJlJ.html

After much of Europe and other countries stopped air travel from the United Kingdom, at least five countries have banned flights from South Africa.South Africa’s health minister had earlier said that scientists have found out that the increase in the number of Covid-19 infections in the country is being driven by the new strain of the virus, according to a news report by Bloomberg.Germany, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia have barred flights from South Africa to reduce the spread of the new mutation of the coronavirus, news agency ANI reported. Measures for passengers who are already travelling to these countries from South Africa have also been announced by the respective departments. Also Watch | ‘No evidence that new COVID strain causes severe disease, mortality’: WHOGermanyGermany was among the first few nations to close air travel with South Africa. “Because of the reported coronavirus mutation, the federal government intends to restrict travel options between Germany and Great Britain and South Africa,” Martina Fietz, a government spokesperson, was quoted as saying by ANI.IsraelIsrael’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country is closing its air space for many foreign nationals following the spread of the more infectious coronavirus variant. “We’ve got a new pandemic spreading, with a virus we don’t really know about. This mutation could be a coronavirus two. Therefore, we have implemented the decision to close Israel’s skies,” he said, according to AFP.The PM also mentioned that while there would be some exceptions, the decision otherwise would continue for 10 days and could also be extended further, according to the AFP report.TurkeyTurkish health minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Twitter that “With the instruction of our President and with the coordination of our Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, A temporary suspension has been decided for flights from England, Denmark, the Netherlands and South Africa to our country.” The Turkish Airlines too, announced on Twitter that it is suspending flights following the government order.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has said international flights are being suspended and also the country is closing its land borders to prevent the spread of the virus. It has also suggested measures for international travellers arriving in the country after the ban, according to a report by Reuters.Switzerland Switzerland officials suspect that the new virus strain might already exist in the country and suspended all flights from England and South Africa. Patrick Mathys, assistant head of communicable diseases at the Federal Ministry of Health in Switzerland said that the new mutation of the virus is more infectious, as per a Reuters report. While India is yet to announce any air travel restrictions for flights from South Africa, few other countries including Uzbekistan and the Netherlands have also closed their air spaces for South African flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-strain-in-south-africa-countries-that-announced-flight-suspensions/story-hp6Ce0tkPyr5TrU7PQI0lI.html

Islamabad has so far paid $2 billion to Riyadh after Saudi Arabia insisted on the repayment of the loan earlier this year in the wake of bilateral ties being strained over Pakistan’s efforts to forge an alternative front of Muslim nations through an outreach to Turkey and Malaysia. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan plans to repay the remaining $1 billion by early next year. “This is simply a case of putting off a major economic problem for some more time. The Saudis may have been repaid but the other loan will become due some day,” one of the people cited above said. Also Read: Prominent Baloch activist found dead in mysterious circumstances in CanadaEarlier this month, China bailed out Pakistan by enhancing the size of a 2011 bilateral currency swap agreement by 10 billion yuan or about $1.5 billion, The Express Tribune newspaper had reported, citing sources in the finance ministry and the State Bank of Pakistan. This assistance was used to repay the Saudi loan. China increased the currency swap arrangement instead of extending a commercial loan so that the new $1.5-billion loan wouldn’t reflect on the books of the Pakistan government or be treated as part of country’s external public debt. Pakistan has used the currency swap facility since 2011 to repay foreign debt and keep its foreign currency reserves at comfortable levels, the report said. Saudi Arabia has also been upset by Pakistan’s criticism of the kingdom’s handling of the Kashmir issue, especially after the Indian government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. For instance, the Kashmir issue wasn’t on the official agenda of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held in Niger in November. After hectic lobbying by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the meeting adopted a resolution on Kashmir that experts said was no different from hundreds of similar documents adopted by the OIC over the years that have had no impact. The strain in Pakistan-Saudi Arabia ties is evident from the fact that Riyadh didn’t roll over the period for the $3-billion loan against the backdrop of economic difficulties created by the Covid-19 pandemic. A $3.2-billion oil credit facility extended by Saudi Arabia to Pakistan in 2018 was also suspended after a year. “Saudis, moreover, in the past never insisted on the repayment of loans, but that did not happen this time. The message from Riyadh was clear that it wanted its money back,” the Dawn newspaper reported on Tuesday. “The Saudi attitude, some say, stemmed from its unease over Pakistan’s foreign policy direction, especially its relations with Turkey and Iran,” the report added. The Indian Army chief’s recent visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia has also spurred efforts by Islamabad to repair ties with Riyadh. On Monday, Saudi Arabia’s envoy to Pakistan, Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Maliki, met Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss bilateral cooperation. “The resolve to further strengthen the strong, longstanding Pakistan-Saudi Arabia fraternal ties was reaffirmed,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement. A Saudi Arabian delegation, possibly led by the foreign minister, is expected to visit Pakistan before the end of the year, and this is likely to be followed by a visit to the kingdom by a delegation led by a senior Pakistani minister, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-uses-china-s-financial-assistance-to-repay-saudi-loan/story-NjhagUNJTuqjSpE3sREAkP.html

Milewski has not commented on the matter.“MLI’s report is defamatory, malicious, misleading… feeds into a narrative that is being propagated by the government of India. Contrary to MLI’s allegations, Khalistan Referendum is a gross root initiative led by Sikh sovereigntists,” SFJ’s general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said in a statement.In an interview with Hindustan Times at the time the report was released, Milewski had said his objective behind bringing out the report at this time was because of the Punjab Referendum 2020, which was originally scheduled for November this year but had been postponed to next year. That referendum is being organized by SFJ.Milewski had pointed out that election results in India have clearly shown that Khalistan has little popular support, and even within the community in Canada, the vast majority will not participate in the process. However, that will ensure the results are skewed totally in favour of those that actually support Khalistan. “The problem is, it’s a referendum of the people that support the referendum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-think-tank-mli-slams-sikhs-for-justice-for-filing-defamation-case/story-X6ROlsh19kBXZafHmuVitM.html
22-12-2020||World||Prominent Baloch activist found dead in mysterious circumstances in Canada||Prominent Baloch activist Karima Baloch was found dead in unexplained circumstances in the Canadian city of Toronto on Monday, a day after she was reported missing by the local police. Karima Baloch, a former chairperson of the Baloch Students Organization-Azad (BSO-Azad), is the second prominent Baloch campaigner to be found dead in a foreign country this year. In April, the body of Baloch journalist Sajid Hussain Baloch was found outside Uppsala in Sweden, weeks after he went missing. Toronto police had reported that Karima, 37, had gone missing in the city’s waterfront area on December 20. The police later said she was “located” but didn’t offer more details. Also Read: Baloch activists want support from India without ‘Kashmir lens’Karima’s death was reported by both Balochistan Times and The Balochistan Post, leading news websites aimed at the Baloch community. Balochistan Times reported she was “found dead in Toronto” and that her “family has not provided more details and asked for privacy”. “Her sudden and unexplained disappearance and death has raised serious concerns,” The Balochistan Post reported. Other reports said Karima’s husband Hammal Haidar and her brother identified the body. Amnesty International said in a tweet: “The death of activist #KarimaBaloch in Toronto, Canada is deeply shocking and must be immediately and effectively investigated. The perpetrators must be brought to justice without recourse to the death penalty.” Karima was included in BBC’s list of 100 inspirational and influential women for 2016, in which she was described as a campaigner “for independence for Balochistan from Pakistan”. She fled Pakistan in 2016, saying she feared for her life due to threats from the army and intelligence agencies, and sought refuge in Canada. She was seen as a pioneer of women’s activism in Balochistan and had raised the issue of Balochistan in UN sessions in Switzerland. In 2014, she became the first woman chairperson of BSO-Azad, which has been proscribed by the Pakistan government as a terror group. Karima’s asylum request was suspended by the Canadian province of Ottawa in 2016 because of BSO-Azad’s involvement in “subversion” against the Pakistan government but she was allowed to remain in the country, according to Canadian media reports. In 2016, Karima recorded a video message on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, in which she called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “brother” and asked him to become the voice of the Baloch movement. This was days after Modi raised the Balochistan issue in his Independence Day speech. “We appeal to you that, as our brother, you speak about the genocide and war crimes in Balochistan on international forums and become the voice of the sisters of Baloch...We will fight this on our own, we just want you to become the voice of our struggle,” Karima said in the message. At an event held by Baloch Canadians in Toronto in 2018 to mark what they claimed to be the 70th anniversary of the illegal occupation of Balochistan by Pakistan, Karima said: “We want India to raise the issue as a human rights cause.” She felt this was an “important role” India could play, since atrocities against the Baloch were not on the world’s radar. Karima also said at the time that India had the reach to raise what she described as the “genocide” of the Baloch people. Baloch journalist Sajid Hussain Baloch was reported missing in Sweden in March, and his body was later found in a river. His family and friends alleged he was murdered. Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the journalists’ organisation, said his mysterious disappearance and subsequent death could have been organised by Pakistani intelligence agencies because of his work as a journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-baloch-activist-found-dead-in-mysterious-circumstances-in-canada/story-xHe4sN3Mlp8w5C8k921kJL.html
22-12-2020||World||Isolated UK battles to reopen trade route after day of chaos||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he’s trying to re-open trade routes to France “as fast as possible” after a day of cross-Channel political bartering failed to end the chaos at the UK’s busiest port.France shut down freight traffic from Dover in southeast England at midnight on Sunday because of fear over a faster-spreading mutant strain of Covid-19 that forced the UK government to impose a strict lockdown on London and surrounding areas. Spain and Portugal, meanwhile, joined dozens of countries restricting flights and effectively isolating the UKJohnson said he’d spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron while Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had been in talks with his counterpart. “We both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible,” Johnson told a press conference Monday.The government is drawing up contingency plans to test truck drivers for coronavirus before they leave the UK, the Telegraph newspaper reported late Monday, citing an official it didn’t identify.The search for a solution to keep goods flowing in and out of Britain comes after another taxing weekend for the UK at the end of a torrid year. A spike in coronavirus infections forced Johnson to backtrack on allowing people to spend the festive period together while talks with the European Union on a post-Brexit trade deal missed another deadline.Brexit WarningThe upheaval just 10 days before Britain’s post-Brexit transition period is due to end also gave the country a foretaste of what could ensue. Without an accord, the UK will default to trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms, with the imposition of costly tariffs and quotas, and the threat of more tailbacks at ports as haulers cope with new bureaucracy.The economy is already buckling again, with London, the most critical dynamo for growth, in lockdown. Bloomberg Economics revised its outlook on Monday to predict another recession at the start of 2021. The pound plunged against the dollar, marking its worst day since the coronavirus hit markets in March.Outside Dover, trucks lined up on the M20 highway as an emergency plan was triggered with drivers unable to board ferries. The Department for Transport also prepared to open Manston airport in Kent, which is being overhauled to accommodate as many as 4,000 vehicles as part of Britain’s planning for a no-deal outcome from the EU trade talks.Johnson sought to downplay the crisis, stressing the closure only applies to “a very small percentage” of food entering the UK “The vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal,” he said. “The government has been preparing for a long time for exactly this kind of event.”Vaccine ShipmentsThe UK this month became the first Western country to authorize a coronavirus vaccine. Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, told reporters that the program would be unaffected because the nation already has the majority of this year’s supply from Pfizer Inc.Shapps earlier said the border snarl-up only affects about 20% of incoming trade, and that haulers are accustomed to disruption across the Dover-Calais strait because of the weather and strikes.Nevertheless, the latest challenge is exposing Britain’s trade vulnerabilities just as a 4 1/2-year odyssey to leave the EU moves from political rhetoric to economic reality. Container ports and ferry terminals were already congested because of stockpiling ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline marking a final break from the European single market.Why the UK’s Mutated Coronavirus Is Fanning Worries: QuickTakeBusiness groups facing catastrophic losses urged the government to act soon, with the 18,000-member Logistics UK calling for rapid Covid-19 testing of truckers departing the country as the quickest way of protecting supply chains. Meanwhile, there were long queues at some supermarkets in London, with fresh produce fast disappearing from shelves.French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said European nations are working on “a solid health protocol” to be implemented “in the coming hours.”But a meeting of the EU’s crisis response experts in Brussels on Monday ended without a decision on how to proceed, according to an EU official, who spoke on condition of an anonymity. Some members of the group called for an urgent discussion at political level to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isolated-uk-battles-to-reopen-trade-route-after-day-of-chaos/story-LYjO96C5hCCddLFP4EYZyO.html
22-12-2020||World||US senate passes giant package wrapping relief, funding, tax breaks||The Senate Monday night passed a giant year-end spending bill combining $900 billion in Covid-19 relief aid with $1.4 trillion in regular government funding and a bevy of tax breaks for businesses.The House passed the combined bill earlier, and the legislation now will go to President Donald Trump, who aides said would sign it when it arrives at the White House this week. The House and Senate also cleared a seven-day stopgap funding bill to avert a partial government shutdown while the broader legislation is prepared for the president.The bill, which totals more than $2.3 trillion, contains the second-largest economic relief measure in US history -- after the $1.8 trillion Cares Act passed in March as the pandemic throttled the world’s biggest economy. Economists say the aid should be enough to avert a double-dip recession next year, though risks remain.“This latest fiscal rescue package will add approximately 1.5 percentage points to annualized real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 and close to 2.5 percentage points to calendar-year 2021 growth,” said Mark Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “If lawmakers had not come through, the economy probably would have suffered a double-dip recession in early 2021.”The legislation would provide direct payments of $600 to most Americans and their children. Those with incomes of more than $100,000 would be excluded, as would undocumented immigrants. The payments will go out as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.For the unemployed, a $300-per-week in enhanced unemployment benefits will be put in effect through March. Unemployment insurance programs for gig workers and the long-term unemployed also would be extended. There’s $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program that provides forgivable loans to small businesses. Companies that previously had a PPP loan can qualify for a new one, and their PPP grants would be made tax deductible.The package includes money for transportation -- including for $15 billion for airlines -- vaccine distribution, schools and universities, farmers and food aid.The relief plan is attached to a $1.4 trillion bill that would fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2021. That bill adheres to budget caps set in place during the 2019-debt ceiling fight, including by keeping $12.5 billion in veterans health spending under the cap -- something that cropped up as a last-minute fight. The bill has $1.4 billion for Trump’s border wall and related spending, although the incoming Biden administration could stop construction.The bill also includes an extension of tax breaks -- for the alcohol and renewable-energy industries, among others -- a law to curb surprise medical bills, a water-infrastructure measure and an intelligence-agency policy bill, among its provisions.The haggling over the relief package forced Congress to repeatedly pass temporary funding for government operations. Late Sunday, Trump signed a one-day extension of government funding, giving lawmakers time for votes on Monday.While the bill clears the decks for the incoming Biden administration by wrapping up the fiscal 2021 budget process, it leaves Democrats ready to push for more stimulus after the Jan. 20 inauguration. Many of the aid provisions will expire in the first quarter of next year, so additional relief could be needed by MarchHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that the $900 billion relief bill is just a first step, and vowed to make another package the top priority in the new Congress. That effort is likely to include a push for infrastructure spending, which has bipartisan appeal, but is already facing skepticism from Republicans, with Mnuchin saying Monday that this week’s measure is likely the last aid bill needed to address the pandemic.Critical to the outlook will be whether Democrats manage to win the two Georgia runoff elections for the Senate on Jan. 5 -- giving them control of both chambers of Congress.“I think we are going to have a much easier time than we had with a Republican president and a Republican Senate” said Pelosi.However, even if Democrats defeat the two Republican incumbents in Georgia, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the Senate would be split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast a tie-breaking vote. Meanwhile, because of Democratic losses in the November election, Pelosi will be working with a narrower majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-giant-package-wrapping-relief-funding-tax-breaks/story-RBgt0xuRsiSQc6zFT52J2I.html

She said the reproduction rate of the new variant has increased from 1.1 to 1.5. She also said that the new variant has made no impact on the vaccine or vaccination process. “We do not anticipate any impact on the vaccine and the vaccination,” Kerkhove said.Thank you @CNN @NewDay for having me on to explain more information about what we know this new #SARSCoV2 virus variant reported from 🇬🇧 Quick segment below for more info 👇@WHO https://t.co/fbP4SAMc7zVan Kerkhove also said that WHO and doctors in the UK have set up a surveillance system to study the new variant. “So far we do not see any increase in disease severity or clinical picture. We are also looking at the body’s ability to develop antibodies. The studies are ongoing,” she added. “We have to work a little bit harder as the new Covid-19 variant is spreading. These are in the presence of interventions that are put in place across England. Viruses mutate, they change all the time.”“The interventions that work for preventing the spread of this variant also work for the viruses that are circulating around. So, this is physical distancing, making sure we avoid crowded spaces. We do things indoors as opposed to outdoors,” Van Kerkhove said.The discovery of the new Covid-19 strain B117 has led to a Christmas lockdown in London and southern England. UK prime minister Boris Johnson made the announcement regarding the new lockdown on Sunday and asked people to remain indoors during Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Several nations have also banned flights from the UK over fears of the new coronavirus strain, which experts claim is 70% more transmissible.The global health body has said that the new coronavirus variant discovered in Britain with a higher transmission rate is not yet out of control. “We have had a much higher (contamination rate) at different points in this pandemic and we’ve got it under control. So this situation is not in that sense out of control. But it cannot be left to its own devices,” WHO’s emergencies chief Michael Ryan told a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutant-covid-19-strain-new-coronavirus-variant-can-be-stopped-using-same-preventive-measures-who/story-hf1sjOOj8Nu5I3HHk8H0xO.html

Transportation Minister Ong Ye Kung said a local facility was producing four tonnes of dry ice each day to properly refrigerate the goods. Singapore will further ease social distancing restrictions from December 28 after weeks of barely any local coronavirus infections.Authorities initially kept Covid-19 in check through rigorous contact tracing but the virus later swept through dormitories housing low-paid migrant workers.The city has reported more than 58,000 virus infections but a relatively low 29 deaths.

It also outlined that the flights will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances.“An official source in the Ministry of Interior: The Kingdom decides to suspend all international flights for travelers - except in exceptional cases - temporarily for a week, which may be extended for another week (loosely translated from Arabic),” GACA tweeted on Monday.Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman were among the Gulf nations whose governments announced that they would ban entry and exit via their land and sea borders barring cargo movements and cancel commercial travel. An AFP report said that the ban will not apply to international aircraft currently in the kingdom, which will be allowed to leave. The report also said that cargo from nations where the new strain has not caused an outbreak will be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia.Several nations in Europe and the Middle East have closed their doors to the UK and temporarily halted international commercial travel as a fast-spreading strain of coronavirus put several parts of the United Kingdom in a lockdown. The UK government on Sunday had told the media that the new strain of coronavirus is out of control.India also suspended all flights from the United Kingdom from December 22 to December 31 over fears of the new Covid-19 strain.

22-12-2020||World||Canada’s Ontario to go on province-wide shutdown from Dec 26||Ontario on Monday announced a province-wide shutdown because of a second wave of Covid-19 in Canada’s most populous province. The lockdown will be put in place for southern Ontario from December 26 until January 23, but will lift for northern Ontario on January 9. Health officials criticized the delay, with top one infectious disease doctor saying it was ridiculous to wait until the day after Christmas to shut down. Ontario has had seven straight days of more than 2,000 cases a day. Modeling shows that could more than double in January. Health officials earlier said a four- to six-week hard lockdown could significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. Toronto, Canada’s largest city, had already closed restaurants for indoor dining but schools remained open. All high schools in Ontario will now be closed for in-person learning until January 25. Elementary schools will be closed until January 11. After Covid-19 cases surged in the spring, Canada flattened the epidemic curve with a lockdown. But as in other countries, Covid fatigue set in, restrictions were relaxed and a second wave was unleashed. “We have flattened the curve before and we can do it again,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said. Dr Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, said Ontario is in a very challenging and precarious situation. “There are outbreaks anywhere people congregate,” Yaffe said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the delay until December 26 will allow businesses outside the current lockdown zones to get ready for it. He said it allows restaurants a chance to sell off some of their inventory. “I’m not comprising anything,” Ford said. “I have to be fair to these businesses who have massive inventory.” Dr Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network, said Ford is prioritizing the economy over health by delaying.“Ridiculous. Costing lives. For what?!” Morris said. The Ontario Hospital Association said in a statement that it was “surprised and disappointed” the lockdown won’t happen for another five days. “People across this province need clear public health communication, and the December 26th implementation date sends a confusing message about what they should and shouldn’t do at this crucial moment. We are already hearing from hospital and health system leaders who are shocked that the restrictions will not come into effect until after Christmas,” the association’s president, Anthony Dale, said in the statement. Dr Naveed Mohammad, CEO of the William Osler Health System that operates hospitals in a Toronto suburb, said people need to act as if the lockdown had already started. “Until the people of this province realise what each trip out their home risks for themselves and their loved ones, we won’t get through this,” he said, noting that hospitals in Brampton, Ontario, are grappling with capacity. “Please stay home, starting today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-ontario-to-go-on-province-wide-shutdown-from-dec-26/story-ECcHp0iOo6XlsigGvQWFkK.html
22-12-2020||World||US president-elect Joe Biden receives Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine shot on live television||US President-elect Joe Biden received his first injected dose of the Covid-19 vaccine live on television on Monday in an effort to boost confidence in its safety ahead of its wide distribution next year.Biden has said he would make the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 315,000 Americans and infected more than 17.5 million, his top priority when he takes office on Jan. 20. At age 78, he is in the high-risk group for the highly contagious respiratory disease.A Democrat, Biden will inherit the logistical challenges of distributing the vaccine to hundreds of millions of Americans, as well as the task of persuading people who worry its development was rushed for political reasons to take it.His black long-sleeved shirt rolled up, Biden received the injection from Tabe Mase, nurse practitioner and head of Employee Health Services at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, in front of reporters. Images were carried live on television. After getting the shot, a dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc, Biden praised medical professionals as “heroes”.“I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to worry about,” Biden said. His wife, Jill Biden, who got the injection earlier in the day, stood by.But Biden also noted that the vaccine would take time to roll out and that people should listen to medical experts and not travel for the upcoming holidays if possible.He credited the scientists who worked on the vaccines, adding: “I think that the (Trump) administration deserves some credit, getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed.”Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would likely get the vaccine next week, Biden’s transition team said.Republican President Donald Trump frequently has played down the severity of the pandemic and overseen a response health experts say was disorganized, cavalier and sometimes ignored the science behind disease transmission. New American economyEfforts to limit the economic fallout on Americans from the pandemic were boosted on Sunday when congressional leaders agreed on a $900 billion package to provide the first new aid in months, with votes likely on Monday.Biden on Monday also named additional members to his National Economic Council (NEC), rounding out his economic policymaking team with people his transition office said would help lift Americans out of the economic crisis.David Kamin, an official in former President Barack Obama’s White House, will be NEC deputy director, and Bharat Ramamurti, a former top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, will serve as NEC deputy director for Financial Reform and Consumer Protection, Biden’s team said in a statement.Joelle Gamble will be special assistant to the president for economic policy.“This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all,” Biden said in the statement.Biden had already named Brian Deese, who helped lead Obama’s efforts to bail out the automotive industry and negotiate the Paris climate agreement, to lead the council, which coordinates the country’s economic policymaking.Much of the fate of Biden’s White House agenda will hinge on the outcome of a pair of Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which party controls the upper chamber of the US Congress.Harris traveled on Monday to Columbus, Georgia, to campaign on behalf of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the Democratic candidates locked in tight races with incumbent Republicans.At a drive-in rally for the candidates, Harris, currently a California senator, said she would return to Washington later in the day to vote on the stimulus package.Asked by one journalist whether there were plans to “fumigate” the White House over virus concerns before the Biden administration moved in, Harris said: “I don’t have the current status for that.”Trump was briefly hospitalized in October with Covid-19, and many of his advisers and White House staff have also contracted the virus.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and White House adviser, was also set to campaign in Georgia for Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.The outgoing president, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud, has focused on trying to overturn his election loss even as daily Covid-19 deaths soared. His campaign’s latest long-shot effort was a petition to the US Supreme Court on Sunday that legal experts said would fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-receives-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-shot/story-dBL8empjp8rdT3TdTZH15J.html

22-12-2020||World||Westerners wary of travelling to China amid worries threat of detention||As the research director of an activist investor, Anne Stevenson-Yang made business trips to China from the US almost monthly before the coronavirus hit. But the J Capital Research co-founder has strong reservations about going back, even after the pandemic subsides.Some who do business with China are increasingly worried about the risk of being swept up by security agents and becoming casualties of geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the West.Stevenson-Yang’s concerns, which previously focused on run-ins with local officials, grew after the detention of two Canadians in late 2018. An Australian citizen, Cheng Lei, has been held since August on national security concerns.“You may have a very small chance of being the one they decide to detain, but it’s years of your life,” said Stevenson-Yang, who moved to the northeast US with her Chinese spouse and children around six years ago, after a quarter of a century in China. “I have lots and lots of friends and relatives in China, as well as a business. But I feel like it’s just not worth the risk.”Interviews with a dozen executives, diplomats, consultants and academics show many of them believe there is an increased risk in traveling to China and -- since the passage of a security law in June -- the financial hub of Hong Kong. In China’s opaque justice system, the police, prosecutors and courts answer to a secretive Communist Party committee, and authorities can hold suspects for long periods without trial under increasingly broad national security laws.Haze Fan, a Bloomberg News staffer who is a Chinese citizen, was detained earlier this month in Beijing. While China has confirmed that Fan is being held by the Beijing Municipal National Security Bureau on suspicion of endangering national security, authorities haven’t released further details about her case.Concerns over travel will likely outlast President Donald Trump or any deal to end the US extradition proceedings against Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou, the case Beijing blames for a collapse in ties with Canada, the country that originally detained her. How to ease the risk of arbitrary detention will be among the key challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden.Tensions between the US and China have continued to rise in the final weeks of Trump’s presidency, with his administration including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. -- China’s biggest chipmaker -- on a blacklist along with more than 60 other companies. China’s Ministry of Commerce has threatened to retaliate for the move, which denies companies access to US technology from software to circuitry.“Beijing’s record of detaining individuals in retaliation for the perceived transgression of their home government should be a geopolitical risk on the radar of every C-suite executive,” said Hugo Brennan, the principal Asia analyst at risk consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft.Separating political detentions from legitimate law enforcement can be difficult. China has rejected the label of “hostage diplomacy” as “totally groundless,” saying that no one who follows the country’s laws should fear arrest, and Chinese executives have expressed concern in turn about visiting the US Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying this month said Meng’s case was “100% a political incident.”Still, Chinese diplomats have indicated the fates of the two Canadians detained on Dec. 10, 2018 -- days after Meng’s arrest -- were open to negotiation. Zhao Lijian, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a briefing in June that political intervention to stop proceedings against Meng “could open up space for resolution to the situation” of the Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.“We have received calls from member companies about the possibility of arbitrary detentions,” Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said via email last month. “Our view is that the risk is small, but it’s not zero.”The Australian Strategic Policy Institute compiled data on eight categories of “coercive measures” in a recent report, noting such actions have risen sharply in the past few years: arbitrary detention or execution, popular boycotts, pressure on specific companies, state-issued threats and restrictions on official travel, investment, trade and tourism.One senior American executive said he and others -- especially former government officials working as consultants -- were increasingly wary. “I know a lot of business people who are out of China now and are very afraid of going back,” said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing an issue that could impact business.Although China hasn’t arrested any Americans, the State Department warned US citizens in July they face the risk of arbitrary arrests and exit bans. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, said in October it was “common sense” for the US to worry after pursuing criminal cases against Chinese scholars with military links.Australians have also found themselves under pressure. The Australian government is embroiled in disputes with China over issues including Canberra’s support for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Two prominent Chinese-born Australian citizens -- Cheng and Yang Hengjun -- are in detention on national security charges, and in September the last two journalists working for Australian media outlets in China were flown out of the country after being visited by security agents in the middle of the night.The risks may stretch beyond China’s mainland. In October, Chinese Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu warned that Ottawa’s acceptance of political refugee claims from Hong Kong protesters could threaten the “good health and safety” of more than 300,000 Canadian passport holders there.“It works because, while it is shocking, deeply harmful for the detainee and places enormous political pressure on the foreign government, it is also judged by foreigners as sufficiently rare as to be a manageable risk, something that doesn’t really disrupt profitable business for China,” said David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China.J Capital Research’s Stevenson-Yang said it’s no longer as crucial for her to visit China because her business is less reliant on the country. The company has however compartmentalized information to protect the organization on the ground, “because you never know what can be construed in the wrong way,” she said.“We’ve become very careful about that sort of thing,” Stevenson-Yang said. “And we didn’t used to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/westerners-wary-of-travelling-to-china-amid-worries-threat-of-detention/story-dncvmp7WEE6N5SwXTtVJvL.html
22-12-2020||World||Hacking company NSO faces legal battle from Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Dell||Tech giants including Microsoft and Google on Monday joined Facebook’s legal battle against hacking company NSO, filing an amicus brief in federal court that warned that the Israeli firm’s tools were “powerful, and dangerous.”The brief, filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, opens up a new front in Facebook’s lawsuit against NSO, which it filed last year after it was revealed that the cyber surveillance firm had exploited a bug in Facebook-owned instant messaging program WhatsApp to help surveil more than 1,400 people worldwide.NSO has argued that, because it sells digital break-in tools to police and spy agencies, it should benefit from “sovereign immunity” - a legal doctrine that generally insulates foreign governments from lawsuits. NSO lost that argument in the Northern District of California in July and has since appealed to the Ninth Circuit to have the ruling overturned.Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Cisco, Dell Technologies-owned VMWare and the Washington-based Internet Association joined forces with Facebook to argue against that, saying that awarding soverign immunity to NSO would lead to a proliferation of hacking technology and “more foreign governments with powerful and dangerous cyber surveillance tools.”That in turn “means dramatically more opportunities for those tools to fall into the wrong hands and be used nefariously,” the brief argues.NSO - which did not immediately return a message seeking comment - argues that its products are used to fight crime. But human rights defenders and technologists at places such as Toronto-based Citizen Lab and London-based Amnesty International have documented cases in which NSO technology has been used to target reporters, lawyers and even nutrionists lobbying for soda taxes.Citizen Lab published a report on Sunday alleging that NSO’s phone-hacking technology had been deployed to hack three dozen phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera as well as a device beloning to a reporter at London-based Al Araby TV.NSO’s spyware was also been linked to the slaying of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Khashoggi’s friend, dissident video blogger Omar Abdulaziz, has long argued that it was the Saudi government’s ability to see their WhatsApp messages that led to his death.NSO has denied hacking Khashoggi, but has so far declined to comment on whether its technology was used to spy on others in his circle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hacking-company-nso-faces-legal-battle-from-microsoft-google-cisco-dell/story-nky2pE2eeAtre4LluOBUZN.html

Officials aren’t certain whether it originated in the UK, Vallance added. But by December, he said it was causing over 60% of infections in London.Italy on Sunday said it has detected a new coronavirus strain with mutations in a person who recently returned from the UK. “The patient and their partner returned from the United Kingdom several days ago, landing in Rome’s Fiumicino airport. They are now isolated and have observed, together with family and close contacts, all procedures proscribed by the health authorities,” said an Italian ministry’s statement, according to Sputnik.South Africa has also announced that a new variant of the Covid-19 virus is driving the country’s resurgence of the disease, with higher numbers of confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths. According to officials in the country, the new variant, known as 501.V2, is dominant among new confirmed infections in South Africa’s current wave||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-strain-in-italy-netherlands-denmark-as-far-as-australia/story-A4Mtr05j7MDmLtLcMtmBxK.html

They said it could be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant.There is, however, no evidence yet to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness, or that vaccines will be any less effective against the new variant. The announcement forced countries around the world to soon announce restrictions on flights from the UK. Till Monday, the number of nations that unveiled such restrictions had grown to at least 33.

22-12-2020||World||‘Constitutional coup’: Nepal crisis in top court||Opponents of KP Sharma Oli turned to Nepal’s Supreme Court on Monday to challenge his dissolution of parliament, denouncing it as a “constitutional coup” even as the prime minister defended his move, insisting he was forced to seek a fresh mandate through elections as the rift within the ruling Nepal Communist Party was severely affecting his government’s functioning.Supreme Court spokesman Bhadrakali Pokharel said three petitions against the dissolution were “in the process of being registered”.“Under the constitution, the prime minister has no prerogative to dissolve parliament,” lawyer Dinesh Tripathi, one of the petitioners, told Reuters. “It’s a constitutional coup. I’m seeking a stay order from the court.”Oli on Sunday sprang a surprise on his rivals and got the President to dissolve parliament, a controversial move amid a prolonged tussle for power between him and former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ within the ruling dispensation.In an address to the nation on Monday, Oli said he was forced to dissolve parliament after he learnt about a plan to move a vote of no-confidence against him. Oli, who is also one of the two chairmen of the ruling party, said that the intraparty rift in the ruling Nepal Communist Party severely affected the government’s functioning.“The elected government was pushed to a corner and picketed against and was not allowed to work so I decided to dissolve the house.” Experts say if the court registers the petitions it could take about two weeks for a decision.Oli said his government had done well in terms of safeguarding the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. “I was victimised for enhancing national pride by publishing a map with the inclusion of Kalapani and Lipulekh,” Oli added.In June, Oli claimed efforts were being made to oust him after his government redrew the country’s political map by incorporating three strategically key Indian territories. India had termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/constitutional-coup-nepal-crisis-in-top-court/story-gYemXTEqFDwOh9Zd5OMkkO.html

With their robust experience and qualifications, they will provide the needed voices to guide my administration in overcoming our nation’s unprecedented economic challenges,” Biden said while announcing the appointments.Ramamurti is currently managing director of corporate power programme at Roosevelt Institute, a think tank. He has previously served on a congressional commission overseeing the rollout of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the over $2 trillion stimulus package enacted in March to help struggling Americans and businesses. Ramamurti has also served as an aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren for seven years.Ramamurti’s parents came to the US from Tamil Nadu. His father Ravi Ramamurti did his doctorate at Harvard, and the younger Ramamurti studied at Harvard years later, and so did his twin siblings Gita and Arjun Ramamurti, according to Harvard Magazine.Biden has named a number of Indian-descent Americans to his team, starting with the historic pick of Kamala Harris, who is the first Black, woman and American of Indian, south Asian and Asian descent elected as US vice-president. He has nominated Neera Tanden as cabinet secretary in charge of budget and Vivek Murthy as surgeon general.

22-12-2020||World||UK hit by new coronavirus strain: Here’s a look at other mutations||Just as the world was starting to hope for vaccines to usher in a healthier 2021 UK on Sunday cautioned against a highly contagious and mutated strain of coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed London and surrounding areas under the most stringent lockdown since March, effectively cancelling Christmas. “When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense,” he said at a press conference on Sunday.As Europe and the rest of the world was waking up to a new nightmare and putting travel restrictions in place, the scientific community rushed in to comfort alarmed populations. Scientists emphasised repeatedly that all viruses mutate, it is in their nature, even the flu virus mutates and thus vaccines need to be frequently updated. The coronavirus has mutated before, once at the very start of the pandemic. “This thing’s transmitting, it’s acquiring, it’s adapting all the time,” Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, told the New York Times. “But people don’t want to hear what we say, which is: This virus will mutate.” he added. ALSO WATCH | Covid: Will new virus variant impact vaccine? UK PM Boris clarifies amid alarm How many times has the Sars-CoV-2 virus mutated?So far, scientists have noted two distinct set of mutations in the virus that causes Covid-19, the H69/V70 deletion, and the D614G, both of which affects the spike proteins, which helps the virus to bind to the human cell, and infect it. It is this ability that vaccines seek to target and weaken. The H69-70 deletion affects antibody susceptibility, and has been seen three times so far- in Danish minks, in Britain, and in a patient who was rendered much less responsive to convalescent plasma therapy.The virus was first reported in Wuhan and since then, it is said to have mutated many times, most of which have gone unnoticed. The BBC reported that if the strain that’s infecting people now is compared to the first one that spread in Wuhan a total of 25 mutations will be visible, that’s a little over two mutations a month. As the human body gets more adept at identifying and fighting it, the virus too is expected to fight back, by trying to evade the body’s immune system. The D614G is the first known mutation that is suspected to have occurred in Eastern China in January and later spread through New York City and Europe. Within a few months of the pandemic this particular variant was found all over the world, as it had successfully replaced its predecessor, which had spread from Wuhan. Scientists have opined that the pandemic spread faster as a result of the 614G mutation, stating that some countries which were initially successful in containing the virus faltered later because of the new strain, which spread more rapidly. The H69-70 deletion occurred when the coronavirus spread from humans to minks in Denmark and later Utah. The coronavirus has a tendency to jump from humans to animals and vice versa, minks kept in crowded farms fell prey to the virus and thousands had to be killed to stop the mutated virus from spreading to humans. There is no proof so far of the mutations tampering with vaccine effectiveness. When the 614G spread scientists studied its effect on human lung tissues and hamsters, and found that even though it spread more quickly it did not alter or create new symptoms, nor did it cause a monumental spike in deaths. What is even more important than mutations is change in human behaviour, which scientists say affects how the virus spreads more than mutations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hit-by-new-coronavirus-strain-here-s-a-look-at-other-mutations/story-zYo1syMagWYuIuou7Wr4qO.html

The incident happened at Palvatla village of Vatpally block. The deceased were identified as Jangam Chandramouli (60), Susheela (55) and Srisailam (45). Two other members -- Anasuya (50) and Saritha (40), who also fell sick after eating the jowar rotis, have been undergoing treatment at Osmania Hospital and their condition was serious but stable, the police at Vatpalli said. The locals told the police that Chandramouli’s mother Pedda Shankaramma (80) also died within hours after eating jowar roti about 15 days ago. “Apparently, the family members did not suspect it to be a case of food poisoning then and might have eaten rotis made of the same jowar flour on Monday night, without realising that it was contaminated,” the police said. Within an hour of having their dinner, the family members complained of severe stomach pain and started vomiting. The neighbours immediately rushed them to the government hospital at Jogipet, where Chandramouli and Sushila succumbed. Following the advice of the doctors, the other three others were rushed to Osmania Hospital where Srisailam breathed his last. The other two are still undergoing treatment, the police said. “We have registered a case of suspicious death. We are investigating from where the family had procured jowar flour,” the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-die-after-eating-rotis-made-of-stale-jowar-in-telangana-s-sangareddy/story-vU4AGmEyRUoBGapnEZ65KO.html

While voting began slowly earlier on Tuesday morning, it picked up speed with even places like Bengaluru Urban which are traditionally seen as laggards clocking in nearly 77 % votes.A total of 3019 panchayats having 43,238 seats across 117 taluks voted on Tuesday in more than 23,000 booths sealing the fate of 1.17 lakh candidates.Voting was held between 7 am to 5 pm with one hour later reserved for those affected with Covid-19. The second phase of polls will be held on December 27 with results being declared on December 30. 4377 panchayat wards have already elected their representatives unopposed. The polls are being held on a party-less basis but all parties are looking to have their party workers elected for a majority of GP’s.State EC B Basvaraju said that around 79 to 80 per cent votes had been polled and the figure was similar to the voting percentage in the 2015 GP polls. The final voting percentage is still being tallied and will be known on Wednesday, EC officials added.Except for some minor glitches, the voting, by and large, has been peaceful. However, a candidate Damodar Krishnappa Yaligar who was contesting from Garga village in Gadag district is said to have committed suicide after polling began. Villagers told police that Yaligar feared defeat in the polls and had thus taken the extreme step. The police are investigating the matter.Similarly in Hosahalli village of Shivamogga district officials seized a feast prepared by a candidate allegedly to lure voters. In Malur taluk of Kolar district, villagers of Kambipura protested against lack of proper roads by not participating in the polls. However, in most parts of the state, there was considerable voter enthusiasm, officials added.The prominent leaders, who voted in the Gram Panchayat polls, included KPCC president DK Shivakumar who along with his wife exercised his franchise at his native place Kanakapura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-sees-around-79-voting-in-first-phase-of-gram-panchayat-polls/story-vCHyTbodXW3LQFdZ55P0rL.html
22-12-2020||India||In Odisha, 22 rare idols stolen from 13th century Shiva temple||Nearly 22 antique idols, some of them made of Ashtadhatu alloy, have allegedly been stolen from a 13th century Shiva temple in Khurda district late on Monday night.According to the police, some unidentified miscreants barged into the sanctum sanctorum of the 800-year-old Daksha Prajapati temple in Banpur town of Khurda district by breaking open the locks of three doors and fled with the precious idols worth crores of rupees. Some of the idols were made of ashtadhatu (alloy of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, tin, iron and mercury)Inspector of Banpur police station, Sanjay Patnaik said of the 31 ancient idols in the temple, 22 have been stolen. The stolen idols include Maa Kanaka Durga, Gopinath Dev, Kaliyugeswar Dev and Chandrasekhar Dev.The temple named after Daksha, the father of Lord Shiva’s consort Parvati, is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Known for its architectural composition, the temple has been under the supervision of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). There have been two instances of theft from the same temple twice in the past.INTACH’s state project coordinator and historian Anil Dhir, who earlier this year published a report on the ‘Antiquities of the Prachi Valley’, said more than 300 valuable idols were found missing in different places of the state. “Odisha has become a major hub for idol export. Nearly 48 cases regarding missing idols were filed in different police stations of the Prachi Valley in the last decade and only one recovery was made. There were 20 cases of idol theft in the last decade in Bhadrak, but not a single recovery was made,” said Dhir.State convener of INTACH, Amiya Bhusan Tripathy said the prevailing laws are ineffective to prevent idol thefts and burglary. “A holistic National Heritage Protection Policy and system should be put in place. Though there are 22,000 ancient places of worship in Odisha, there is no database for all the antiques, both stone and metallic idols. Inconsequential and weak legislations like the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 are ineffective to curb these crimes,” said Tripathy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-22-rare-idols-stolen-from-13th-century-shiva-temple/story-5Bd8PSxto08GNG47LZxvVK.html

The court had on Tuesday found a Catholic priest and a nun guilty in the 28-year-old case.The priest - Father Thomas Kotoor - was charged under sections 302, 201 and 449 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), whereas the nun - Sister Sefi - was booked under sections 201 and 302 of the IPC.The priest and the nun, who were on bail, were taken into judicial custody after the mandatory Covid-19 testing. Father Kotoor was shifted to the Poojapura Central jail, and Sister Sefi to the Attakulangara women’s prison in Thiruvananthapuram.Sister Abhaya (19) was found dead in the well of the Pious X Convent in Kottayam in March 1992. It was initially dismissed as a suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was murder. In 2009, the CBI charge-sheeted Kottoor and Sefi in the case. It still took 11 years for the case to reach its logical conclusion due to prolonged legal battles.According to the CBI charge-sheet, on the day of her death, Abhaya got up early to study and went to the kitchen to wash her face. The charge-sheet surmised that she witnessed some sexual activity involving the two priests and nun and was killed because they feared she may disclose what she had witnessed.She was first attacked with an axe and later dumped in the well, the CBI claimed. Although the case created a sensation in Kerala, the church stood by the accused, saying the accused were innocent.Interestingly, the CBI had filed three reports in the case; in first report it said the death of Abhaya was a case of “homicidal suicide.” But this report was rejected by the court, which ordered a fresh investigation. In the second report, the agency said it could not establish beyond doubt whether it was a suicide or murder. In the last report it filed in 2008, the agency said it was a case of murder and arrested the two priests and nun.Another accused, Father Jose Poothrukayil, was discharged by the CBI court last year, on grounds of insufficient evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sister-abhaya-case-cbi-court-to-pronounce-quantum-of-punishment-on-wednesday/story-d1IHEB0jXxJdl12aPcjDLK.html

He used the period as an opportunity and utilised the time to write a fiction book and a play on the same storyline and plot. “Both are in final stages. Earlier too, I wrote a play ‘Madhukar Shah: Bundelkhand Ka Nayak’ which has been published and staged 17 times,” says the actor during his visit to Lucknow. The 66-year-old actor avoided a lot of work for a long time. “Jaan hain to jahan hai! Work can wait for something, but if you get affected with the deadly virus it’s not worthy at my age. So, I took a call and used this time for writing, besides I focused a lot on my health and reduced weight considerably,” says the actor. He has signed four new projects besides three films that were stalled. “I believe it’s now time to start working with safety measures. I will be shooting soon for ‘Bhool Bhuliya-2’ that will resume shoot in Lucknow, then Ashu Trikha’s ‘Koregaon’ and another by director Partho Ghosh. In this entire unlock phase, I only shot for a web series ‘Jaatland’ in Meerut where I play a zamindar. Now, there is lot of work pressure.” In his upcoming release ‘Satya Sai Baba’, he plays the role of a father. Namdev has done lot of projects in Lucknow. “There is another very good series that I will be shooting again here. It’s based on Inspector Avinash Mishra which stars Randeep Hooda and is being directed by Neeraj Pathak. Besides, I have shot here for ‘Jhalki’, ‘Shaadi Main Zaroor Aana’, ‘Kashi In Search of Ganga’, ‘Pyar Main Thoda Twist’ and ‘Bhool Bhuliya-2’.

22-12-2020||India||Gauhati HC orders floor test of BTC executive council before Dec 26||The Gauhati High Court on Tuesday ordered the newly-elected executive council of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in Assam to prove its majority in a floor test on or before December 26. The HC order by Justice Suman Shyam came 10 days after results of the polls to the council were announced following a petition filed by Hagrama Mohilary, the former chief executive member (CEM) of BTC and president of Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) challenging formation of the executive council. “The process of election of a CEM is a democratic process. Therefore, it can’t be denied that the newly appointed CEM would be under a constitutional obligation to prove his majority on the floor of the house,” the HC order read. BPF had emerged as the single largest party winning 17 of the 40 seats to which election was held this month. But United Peoples’ Party Liberal, which won 12, along with Bharatiya Janata Party (9) and Gana Surakha Party (1) came together to cobble up a majority. The lone Congress member joined BJP later. Accepting the coalition’s claim, Governor Jagdish Mukhi asked UPPL, BJP and GSP to form the new executive council. On December 15, president of UPPL, Pramod Boro took oath as the new CEM of BTC. The Governor later nominated 6 other members to the council taking the total strength of BTC to 46. Miffed at not being called to form the executive council despite BPF emerging as the single largest party, Mohilary had approached the HC seeking relief. The petition also sought nomination of the 6 members to be declared as invalid. Admitting the petition, the HC had asked BTC on December 18 to maintain status quo and fixed December 22 as the next date of hearing. “A composite floor test so as to prove the majority of the respondent no. 1 (Pramod Boro) vis-à-vis the petitioner no. 1 (Hagrama Mohilary), in the opinion of this court, would be the best way to resolve the issue. I am therefore of the view that a ‘composite floor test’ should be held on or before 26/12/2020,” Tuesday’s HC order read. The court also ordered that since rules mention about the presence of elected members in a meeting to prove majority, the voting rights of the 6 nominated members shall remain suspended till the floor test is held. Justice Shyam directed newly elected CEM Pramod Boro not to take any major policy decision till the holding of the floor test. The next date of hearing on the petition has been fixed on January 11. Meanwhile, wary of the other side poaching its elected members both BPF and the new ruling coalition of BTC have kept their members under surveillance since declaration of results and not allowed them to move freely or make calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-orders-floor-test-of-btc-executive-council-before-dec-26/story-B98esudfBWt3z6jJwk9udP.html

After giving a point-by-point rebuttal on Tuesday, the chief minister said that as she gave all answers to the union home minister, Shah should give her a treat of Gujarati dishes. “He (Shah) projected Bengal as a land of nightmares as if the state has not registered any development and the state is synonymous with unemployment. If you tell the truth I have no problem but I would challenge all your lies,” she said while speaking to the media at the state secretariat. She said that the state’s gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by 2.7 times since 2011, tax revenue has increased by 2.9 times and capital expenditure has increased by 7.2 times during the same period. Also read: 20 passengers from UK test positive for Covid-19, states begin contact tracing“He (Shah) said Bengal ranks 20th in industrial production. We are saying Bengal ranks fourth. He said Bengal ranks 16th when it comes to state GDP. We are saying that our rank is second in India. He said that FDI in the state has dropped. We are saying it has increased by more than 700 per cent since 2011,” Banerjee said while throwing an open challenge to the union minister.She also said that the state holds the top position on many fronts, including poverty eradication, providing 100-days of work, MSME sector, providing minority scholarship, skill development and building rural roads and rural houses, among others. “I have given all answers. Now Amit Shah owes me a treat. I want to have Gujarati dishes – Dhokla. There is another dish which I love to have but I don’t remember the name,” said Banerjee. The BJP, however, demanded that Banerjee should publish a white paper. The Congress too demanded a white paper on how much investments the state has attracted, job generated and the unemployment situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/your-lies-would-be-challenged-mamata-banerjee-tells-bjp-top-leadership/story-z0NH4Ens7kDaf5L0oLuhWK.html

22-12-2020||India||India, Japan sign deal to boost cooperation between steel industries||India and Japan on Tuesday signed an agreement to enhance cooperation between their steel industries with the aim of ramping up domestic production and greater coordination in the global market, which is dominated by China. The memorandum of cooperation in the field of steel industry, inked by India’s steel ministry and Japan’s economy, trade and industry ministry, will boost mutual cooperation by establishing an “India-Japan steel dialogue” at the joint secretary-level. “Through the dialogue, both sides are expected to deepen mutual understanding on the situations surrounding the steel industry in both countries and in the international market, where excess supply of steel is an issue,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The two sides will also discuss trade and investment related issues and promote sustainable growth in the steel sector, the person added. The move dovetails with efforts by India and Japan to create alternative and reliable supply chains amid the Covid-19 pandemic by working with like-minded partners such as Australia and the US, as well as the Indian government’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) initiative aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing capacities. India and Japan were the second and third largest steel producing countries in 2019, with outputs of 111.2 million tons and 99.3 million tons respectively. However, they were far behind the global leader, China, whose output was 996.3 million tons. China has for long been accused of dumping steel, and its steel exports faced 15 anti-dumping investigations this year in countries such as Australia, Thailand, the UK and the US. India’s demand for steel is growing and the consumption of 88.68 million tons in 2017 was 1.7 times higher than that of 2007. However, India’s per capita consumption of steel was only 75.3 kg in 2017, only one-seventh of the figures for Japan (549.9 kg) or China (544.5kg), signifying a large margin for further growth. The steel ministry plans to expand steel production capacity to 300 million tons by 2030-31. Such expansion can be sustained through domestic demand creation, which is a potential area of cooperation between India and Japan, people familiar with developments said. The agreement signed on Tuesday by Pradip Kumar Tripathi, secretary in the steel ministry, and Shigehiro Tanaka, Japan’s vice-minister for international affairs, will also help improve the quality of steel produced in India. Most of the steel imported from Japan to India is high grade steel. In recent years, Japanese companies have increased their presence in the Indian market and are working with partners to produce better quality steel. In 2019, Nippon Steel and Arcelor Mittal purchased Essar Steel India in one of the largest investments made by a Japanese company in India. Nippon Steel has also established a joint venture with Tata Steel to produces high grade steel for automobiles. A conglomerate led by Mitsubishi Corporation and Larsen & Toubro is working with Steel Authority of India Limited to modernise the Rourkela steel plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-sign-deal-to-boost-cooperation-between-steel-industries/story-nAvh28BzOL70fLgX062rAI.html

Saroj took her to a room to sexually assault her. When the girl resisted and started to scream, Saroj strangulated her to death,” said Bothra.Bothra claimed that after killing the girl, Saroj tried to have sex with the body but failed. “He had discharged semen on the frock. The accused then put the body along with the frock inside a gunny bag and dumped it in a bush near a pond and covered the gunny bag with coconut tree branches. On realizing that he had forgotten to keep the girl’s leggings in the gunny bag, he again went to his house to get it and later threw it in the village pond,” said Bothra. He added that the pond is being dried up to find the leggings.The police official claimed that the teenager was addicted to pornography, especially child pornography, and had watched such porn videos throughout the previous night on his sister’s mobile phone. “The accused had deleted all the search history from the mobile phone except one tab showing ‘how to delete search history’,” he said.The SIT head said there are no eyewitnesses in this incident, but the accused reportedly confessed his crime before two people, one of them has the audio and video recordings of the conversion. “We are looking for other people involved in the crime. The accused has been taken on a three-day remand starting today and we will share further findings after that,” he said.Also read: Nepal PM Oli seeks control of communist party, rivals ‘sack’ him as party bossHours after his claims, mother of the prime accused alleged that her son was tortured by SIT agency to confess to the crime. “My son, who was brought to the house by the cops on Monday, told us that he was being harassed and made to plead guilty. We are concerned as my husband is no more and there is nobody to fight for us,” she said.“The SIT officials took away my daughter’s mobile phone on December 2. Later, on December 10, they again visited our house and told us the mobile had some password. They could have told this when they took away the mobile phone. We suspect the cops had given some password which we don’t know,” Sethi’s mother alleged.The father of the deceased girl also raised doubts about the SIT claim. “The youth was tortured and forced to confess to the crime. He was also offered Rs 5 lakh to take the blame. He has been made a scapegoat. We don’t know whether he was actually involved in the incident or not, but as per our knowledge, he is not like that as has been painted by the probe agency. The SIT is doing drama to suppress our demand for a CBI probe into the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-failing-to-rape-5-year-old-girl-odisha-teen-strangulates-her-to-death/story-n4mxUg2iPYS06Scf44raJM.html
22-12-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi-led delegation to meet President with 20 million signatures against farm laws||A delegation of Congress leaders, led by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday to submit around 20 million signatures collected from across the country in the past three months seeking repeal of the three farm laws. Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal said in a statement that the party had launched a nationwide campaign in September for collecting memoranda of appeals addressed to the President signed by farmers, farm labourers and other stake holders opposing the three new farm legislations. He said around 20 million signatures seeking the President’s intervention for withdrawal of these laws had been collected till now. “The government has chosen to brazenly defame, discredit and eventually tire out the lakhs of protesting farmers. The Modi government and its ministers have chosen to insult them,” he alleged. “The arrogant Modi government having initially duped the farmers by putting on a conciliatory face soon made its intransience apparent. It has become absolutely clear that the Modi government is only committed to the welfare of large corporates instead of innocent farmers and farm labour,” Venugopal said. “The government has also been on an overdrive using public money to create false propaganda and narrative in favour of the draconian farm laws and discrediting the protesting farmers. It is pushing manufactured surveys in media discourse to create support in favour of these anti-farmer laws,” the Congress leader added. The Congress had launched its three-month-long “mass movement” against the government for enacting the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Gandhi also undertook a ‘tractor yatra’ across Punjab and Haryana as part of the campaign. “Lakhs of India’s farmers have been on protest in freezing weather against the three blatantly anti-agriculture laws aimed at bartering their interests in the hands of select crony capitalist friends of the Modi government. They have been blocked from entering Delhi for the last 27 days despite prior notice and peaceful intent,” Venugopal said. “The three laws have caused immense pain and anguish among the farmers and farm labour across India. The farmers have been agitating and requesting the government to annul these legislations. They are sitting on an indefinite strike against these laws and 44 farmers have already lost their lives during the ongoing protests,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-led-delegation-to-meet-president-with-20-million-signatures-against-farm-laws/story-TQoJdpqwydAOq4WCc1M3RN.html
22-12-2020||India||Farmers’ stir: Tomar says hopeful of protesting unions resuming talks with Govt soon||As farmers’ agitation against three farm laws entered its 27th day, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Tuesday he is hopeful that protesting unions would soon complete their internal discussions and resume talks with the government to resolve the crisis. He met two more peasants’ bodies from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh that extended support to the legislations. “Representatives of different farmers’ bodies had come to tell that the laws are good and are in the interest of farmers. They had come to urge the government not make any amendments to the laws,” Tomar said after meeting the two groups. “I am hopeful they (protesting farmers’ unions) will soon complete their internal discussions and come forward for talks. We will be able to find a solution successfully,” the minister said. Agriculture Ministry had written to the protesting groups on Sunday, urging them to specify their concerns on the government’s proposal and finalise a date for the next round of talks to end the protests. At least five rounds of formal talks have failed to break the deadlock as the agitating unions have not agreed to anything less than repeal of the laws. UP-based Kisan Sangarsh Samithi (KSS) and Delhi-based Indian Kisan Union (IKU) are among those farmer groups that have extended support to the laws in the last three weeks. The previous groups were from Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. However, nearly 40 groups are agitating against the laws on various Delhi borders. The protesting groups have maintained that the new laws will eliminate the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP), do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates. The government has been saying that these apprehensions are misplaced. Rajya Sabha MP Surendra Singh Nagar as well as former Uttarakhand Minister and IKU National President Ramkumar Walia were also present in Tuesday’s meeting. “The three laws enacted by the Centre are good and are in the interest of the farming community,” KSS President Ajay Pal Pradhan told PTI after the meeting. While supporting the laws, KSS also urged the minister to ensure that procurement at minimum support price (MSP) continues. Pradhan claimed that thousands of farmers who have come in tractors in support of the laws have been stopped at the border and therefore a select group has come for the meeting. In its representation made to Tomar, KSS also requested the Centre to implement the 2011-12 agreement signed between farmers of Gautam Buddha Nagar with Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Development Authorities. “Even after the High Court order, the development authorities are not implementing the agreement under which the UP government had decided to give 10 per cent of the developed land to farmers whose land was acquired for the development and housing project,” Pradhan said. KSS further demanded that the government should notify only that much land which is required for the development. In the Secunderabad industrial area, industries have developed 45 per cent of the land acquired and the rest is not used yet. “The land was acquired in 1972, but only on paper, the industries are made functional. No infrastructure has been developed. There is no proper road and water facility. Villagers are finding it difficult,” Secunderabad Block Pramuk Pushpendra Bhati said. KSS also demanded steps towards modernisation of mandis, use of mandi tax for development of mandis, a scheme to reduce tubewell charges and farm loan at a lesser interest rate, among others. “We have read the farm laws in detail and are in favour of farmers. We urge farmers not to get misled on this issue,” Walia said. The new agri laws will end middlemen and give options for farmers to sell their produce, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-tomar-says-hopeful-of-protesting-unions-resuming-talks-with-govt-soon/story-xzrcHKQgKeRm5xbp8DCCZI.html

22-12-2020||India||Kerala Governor denies permission for special assembly session against farm laws||The Left Democratic Front government in Kerala suffered a jolt on Tuesday after Governor Arif Mohammad Khan turned down its request to convene a special session of the assembly to pass a resolution against the new farm laws enacted by the Centre.The Kerala government was planning to convene a special session on Wednesday. Earlier the government had approached the Governor with a recommendation to convene the house and he later sought certain clarifications on this. Though the state government replied to the clarifications, the Governor found they were not satisfactory. The Governor also felt that there was no emergency in order to convene a special session in such a short time. The ruling CPI (M) is yet to react but the opposition Congress has criticised the Governor’s decision. “He is acting like an agent of the BJP. His decision is not acceptable. It is the prerogative of the house to decide whether an issue is urgent or not,” said Congress deputy leader in the house K C Joseph. Reeling under many issues like gold smuggling and alleged kickbacks in government projects, the CPI (M) is not likely to engage in an open confrontation with the Governor. Opposition Congress and other parties had also pledged their support to the move to introduce a resolution. In the 140-member house, the BJP has a single legislator. The government was planning a one-hour session to pass a motion to reject these bills after putting it to vote. But its plan fell flat with the Governor’s decision. Earlier the BJP had criticised the move by calling it a politically motivated decision. “It is nothing more than a political gimmick. It is as futile as passing a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),” said minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan. Earlier the state had announced its plan to challenge the three farm laws in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-governor-denies-permission-for-special-assembly-session-against-farm-laws/story-jEaBmn2QTp0MQibWWd0EAI.html

22-12-2020||India||Top BJP leaders make frequent trips to Bengal as assembly polls approach||Apart from the frequent visits of Union home minister Amit Shah and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national president JP Nadda to poll-bound West Bengal, other top BJP leaders and ministers of the Narendra Modi government are simultaneously making rounds of the state to bolster the party’s campaign ahead of the crucial assembly elections slated for 2021. “It is not just Shah or Nadda. We are also expecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to West Bengal even though nothing has been finalized yet. Other central leaders and ministers are meanwhile coming to campaign,” said a senior BJP leader, adding that Shah is expected to come for a week in January. On December 20, when the limelight was on Shah, BJP’s national president of the Mahila Morcha, Vanathi Srinivasan, arrived in West Bengal and has been camping in the state since then. She has been engaged in attending organizational meetings and public outreach programs of the party. While Srinivasan is camping in south Bengal, Union cabinet minister Prahlad Singh Patel made a trip to north Bengal on Tuesday. “Apart from attending a chai chakra - get together over a cup of tea - to reach out to the people and spread the party’s message with an eye on the next assembly polls and attending door-to-door griha sampark campaigns, he is scheduled to address various organizational meetings,” said a senior BJP leader. Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Chandra Maurya was also in the state over the weekend. The party is putting together its biggest election machinery ever in the eastern state and as a part of it, 294 BJP leaders will be arriving in Bengal from Delhi and other states to work with the local unit for polls. They will be part of a 45-member team to be set up for each constituency; existing district committees will assist these teams, a BJP office-bearer said. “Amit Shah and JP Nadda are expected to come to West Bengal every month. The duration of their stay is expected to get longer as elections draw nearer,” said a senior BJP leader. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-member legislative assembly. Poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who has been roped in by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, however, has challenged the BJP saying that the party will not be able to win more than 99 seats of the state’s 294 assembly seats. On Tuesday, PTI quoted Kishor asking whether the BJP leaders will quit, if they fail to get 200 seats, a target set by Amit Shah for the 2021 elections. The Trinamool Congress had won 211 of 294 seats in the West Bengal assembly earlier.“The BJP central leadership has imported functionaries from other states since they do not have faith in the local leadership,” Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, a three-time TMC MP had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-bjp-leaders-make-frequent-trips-to-bengal-as-assembly-polls-approach/story-FdiR7GSiWfzBd4Fum8lEBK.html

They released a letter stating that if farmers want amendments in these laws, they want date and time for discussion,” Sarwan Singh Pandher of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee said on Tuesday at the Singhu border, which has emerged as the epicentre of these protests.“This is not a step forward by the government but a way to trick farmers. A normal person would think that farmers are stubborn but the fact is that we don’t seek amendments in farm laws, we want them to be completely shunned,” Pandher further said. This is not a step forward by the govt but a way to trick farmers.

22-12-2020||India||India and Japan oppose attempts to ‘unilaterally change status quo by coercion’||India and Japan on Tuesday said they strongly oppose all attempts to “unilaterally change the status quo by coercion” and activities that escalate tension, against the backdrop of concerns about China’s assertive actions across the region. The matter figured in a phone conversation between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi, according to a readout from Japan’s defence ministry. Without naming China, the readout said the ministers intend to “continue exchanging views in light of the current events occurring in the region”. The statement was perceived as a strong endorsement for India’s demand for restoration of status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, where tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a faceoff since May. Japan has its own concerns about the activities of Chinese vessels in waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Also Read: US Congress stings China with new Tibet law on the next Dalai LamaThe two defence ministers “concurred in sending a clear message that they strongly oppose any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion or any activities that escalate tension”, the readout said. Singh and Kishi also “shared the view on highlighting the importance of a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law”, it said. They also agreed to “vigorously promote defence cooperation and exchanges to uphold and reinforce the free and open Indo-Pacific” Singh said in a tweet that he and Kishi had expressed satisfaction at ongoing bilateral defence cooperation. “India is committed to further elevate engagements with Japan under the Special Strategic & Global partnership framework,” he added, without giving details. In July, Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki had said that his country opposes any “unilateral attempt to change the status quo” along the LAC after a conversation with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. In recent weeks, there has been closer coordination between the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – in the wake of China’s aggressive actions across the Indo-Pacific. Australia’s navy participated in the trilateral Malabar naval exercise after a gap of several years. During their phone conversation, Singh and Kishi exchanged views on regional situations, including in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and reaffirmed their continued close cooperation, the readout said. The two ministers also discussed recent achievements such as the signing of Japan-India Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) or logistics support agreement in September and the successful completion of the Malabar naval exercise in November. They welcomed the fact that bilateral and multilateral defence cooperation and exchanges were promoted despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Singh and Kishi further discussed cooperation against risks imposed by infectious diseases that could affect peace and security and the promotion of India-Japan efforts such as sharing lessons learned in humanitarian aid and disaster response operations during the pandemic, finding new opportunities for cooperation in third countries to make them more resilient to the pandemic, and exchanging views on reinforcing the rules-based international order, including working together to counter disinformation in the context of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-and-japan-oppose-attempts-to-unilaterally-change-status-quo-by-coercion/story-HUHqNQST0nMTTynHwlUThN.html

He also said that the DDC election was a fight between the BJP and rest of the parties.“This is a win for the BJP. The propaganda has been bust as people have shown their faith in the prime minister and his policies. This is a message that nationalists are prospering in Kashmir,” he told reporters outside the counting centre at SKICC in Srinagar.Senior BJP leader and Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had campaigned for the BJP candidate in the predominantly Shia area of Balahama in the Srinagar district periphery.“They all came together against the BJP as they were afraid of it. But, still the BJP won seats from the valley. Now, they should introspect. People want development and this is a vote for development,” said Hussain.The counting for the DDC polls has been completed in Srinagar with the independent candidates winning half of the seats.Though the BJP had expected to reach at least in the double digits alone in Kashmir, however, coming togeather of six parties, especially two big regional parties the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), created hurdles in the victory of the BJP which has been very active on ground since the party took support back from the PDP in 2018 and the coalition government fell down in J&K.The BJP’s state unit spokesman, Altaf Thakur, lost the DDC election from Dadsara segment in Tral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ddc-election-bjp-s-aijaz-hussain-wins-from-khonmoh-ii-gives-party-first-victory-in-srinagar/story-VvYi8ccF5amoiXMy1gVD0N.html

While Youth Congress leaders called it a cheap publicity stunt and blamed the BJP worker for his election to the post, BJP leaders raised questions against the election process in the party. Harshit Singhai, who is stated to be a supporter of Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, had left Congress party in March to join BJP. After nine months, he was elected as a secretary of Jabalpur north assembly constituency of MP Youth Congress. The elections for MP Youth Congress were held between December 10 and 12. The results were announced on December 18. In the election, Singhai received 12 votes and was elected as the secretary. MP Youth Congress election coordinator Maqsood Mirza said, “It’s a cheap publicity stunt of BJP. Singhai filed his nomination in March. Later, he joined BJP but he didn’t withdraw his nomination purportedly. The election process was held online and nobody paid attention as there were more than 1800 nominations and Singhai was not a popular leader.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-big-slip-in-madhya-pradesh-congress-elects-bjp-leader-to-party-post/story-gWBGS3p995XRW87AGH5VpJ.html
22-12-2020||India||28 years later: Priest, nun convicted in Sister Abhaya murder case; experts hail verdict||A special Central Bureau of Investigation court in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday found the two accused in Sister Abhaya’s murder case guilty and their quantum of punishment will be announced on Wednesday, bringing a dramatic end to the 28-year-old case. Both accused Thomas Kotoor and Sister Sefi were found guilty of murder (Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code), Section 449 (house trespassing to commit a crime) and Section 201 (destroying evidence) and other sections of the IPC. Special judge K Sanil Kumar will hear the convicts on Wednesday before reading out their sentences. Third accused Sister Sefi broke down in court after hearing the verdict but the main accused Kotoor later said he was innocent and he will prove his innocence in the court of God. Second accused in the case Father Jose Poothrukayil was let off by the trial court last year after no evidence was found against him. While most of the witnesses had turned hostile during the trial, the court said a few prosecution witnesses were strong and convincing. The CBI took over the probe after material evidence in the case was either destroyed or tampered with by the local police and crime branch. But its meticulous and scientific probe earned the central agency a lot of praise.Sister Abhaya (19), a plus-two student, was found dead in the well of the Pious X Convent in Kottayam in March 1992. It was initially dismissed as a suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was murder. In 2009, the CBI charge-sheeted Catholic priest Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sefi in the case. Still it took 11 years to reach its logical conclusion due to prolonged legal battles. Abhaya’s brother lauded the verdict. “God is great. Justice has been done to my sister, though it is delayed,” he said. Activist Joman Puthanpurakkal who single-handedly took up the case said his 28 years of work had turned fruitful finally. “It is a slap on the face of church authorities who shamelessly protected the murderers,” he said. He also took the name of a retired Supreme Court judge alleging he tried his best to sabotage the case and implicate him in a false case. Former Deputy SP of the CBI Verghese P Thomas, who first investigated the case and later resigned from the agency alleging that he was pressurized by his senior officers to make it a suicide case, also expressed his happiness. “I paid a heavy price for embracing truth. I resigned when I had eight-nine years service. Most of my batch-mates were later promoted as DIG and IG. Today I feel my sacrifice was worth it,” he said. Leading a retired life, he said his conclusion that it was a clear case of murder had been proved right. Legal experts have also hailed the verdict. “It is a good day for the judiciary. Truth prevailed finally. Credit goes to the CBI team headed by Nandakumar Nair and activists like Jomon Puthanpurakkal,” said senior lawyer B Jayashankar.According to the CBI charge-sheet, on the day of her death, Abhaya got up early to study and went to the kitchen to wash her face. The charge-sheet surmised that she witnessed some sexual activity involving the two priests and nun and was killed because they feared she may disclose what she had witnessed.She was first attacked with an axe and later dumped in the well, the CBI claimed. Although the case created a sensation in Kerala, the church stood by the accused, saying the accused were innocent. Interestingly, the CBI had filed three reports in the case; in first report it said the death of Abhaya was a case of “homicidal suicide.” But this report was rejected by the court, which ordered a fresh investigation. In the second report, the agency said it could not establish beyond doubt whether it was a suicide or murder. In the last report it filed in 2008, the agency said it was a case of murder and arrested the two priests and nun. Jose Poothrukayil was absolved of all the charges before the final trial.Many movies were made based on the theme of the sensational case. The poor parents of Abhaya who valiantly fought for justice died during the long years of legal battle. What makes the case different is that there were a flurry of petitions in different courts and many attempts to scuttle and delay the probe. In 2008 retired ASI of Kerala police V Augustine who investigated the case initially committed suicide. In 2018, the CBI had made former SP K T Michael an accused in the case for destroying key evidence in the case. Later the high court had stayed action against the former SP. During the trail nine witnesses had turned hostile.In 2008 the accused Sefi had filed a complaint against the CBI saying she was forced to undergo a virginity test by the agency without her consent. But the CBI said she did hymenoplasty (a surgical procedure to repair broken hymen) after the case erupted to prove she was a virgin. The CBI later submitted hospital details to cement its claim. Later the court had rejected her plea. Besides the nature of the case in which there was no direct witness, the lengthy legal procedure made the case different. Though the CBI charge-sheeted the three in 2009, the accused moved discharge petitions in different courts. These pleas took nine years to reach any conclusion as the court discharged one of them but rejected the petitions of the other two. Interestingly one of the main witnesses in the case was a small-time robber, Raju. He was on the premises of the convent for stealing areca nuts when the incident took place. He reportedly told CBI officers that he saw two priests and a nun at the convent around the time of Abhaya’s death. He later said he was promised many things to own up to the crime and change his statement but he stuck to his testimony. “I am the happiest man today. I stuck to the truth till the last,” he said after the verdict. The long legal battle put the church in a spot after it supported the accused. It is yet to react to the verdict. A spokesman of the Kanaya Catholic church said it will release a statement later in the day. But reformers in the church want it to change its position and stand with the victim not the accused “It is happiest day in my life. A poor girl got justice after so many years. I hope it will open the eyes of church authorities,” said Sister Lucy Kalapura who was expelled from the congregation last year for supporting a stir against rape accused Bishop Franco Mullakal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-years-later-priest-nun-convicted-in-sister-abhaya-murder-case-experts-hail-verdict/story-dxMSm2TDmQcF96StvpPceK.html

22-12-2020||India||NEP will help India regain its love for Mathematics||Numbers are one of the most innovative ideas of humankind. They make our everyday life convenient and straightforward. Imagine if numbers are not there, how difficult it would have been to measure, count, access, record and quantify different parameters. The branch of knowledge which deals with the study of numbers, i.e., Mathematics is one of the most distinguished disciplines which has a “continuum” of applications from “zero to infinite”. At times it “differentiates” between the “chaos” and the “stability”, sometimes it “integrates” different disciplines of knowledge. It takes us to the “limits” of truth and encompasses the different “dimensions” of expertise. It makes the “complex” things “real” and fascinates us with the notions of “games” and “probability”. The discipline is inherently alluring and takes a beautiful mind to master it. Srinivasa Ramanujan is one such genius that India has produced. Today we celebrate the birthday of Srinivasa Ramanujan as the National Mathematics Day; I bow my head to this genius. On observing his genius and reading about his notebooks and life, it appears that Ramanujan came to this world to serve the discipline of Mathematics only. He solved many complex problems independently and made pioneering contributions to number theory. Bharatvarsh has a rich tradition and several contributions to Mathematics since ancient times.“Like the crest of a peacock, like a gem on the head of a snake, so is mathematics at the head of all knowledge.” This verse from Vedanga Jyotisha (500 BC) is testimony to the pedestal on which we keep Mathematics. Mathematics or Ganit is a dominant discipline in India since ancient times, and the legacy has continued over generations by Guru-Shishya parampara, books and works. Shulba Sutras written in 800-500 BCE contain concepts of geometrical shapes like square, rectangle and right triangle and square roots, etc. The Pythagorean triples are also highlights of Shulba Sutras. Acharya Pingala in 300 BCE illustrated the idea of sunyata or zero for the first time. There is also evidence of zero as a placeholder in the Bakhshali manuscript. In the fifth century AD, Aryabhata gave the basis of the decimal system and calculated the value of Pi till four decimal places. Brahmagupta in the seventh century AD clearly defined and used zero and mentioned negative numbers. His treaties Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta and the Khandakhadyaka have detailed illustrations about series, geometry, arithmetic and algebra, to name a few. Sridharacharya in the ninth century was the pioneer in finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Siddhanta Shiromani has written in four volumes, namely Lilavati, Bijaganita, Grahagaṇita and Goladhyaya by legendary Bhaskaracharya. These four volumes have complex mathematical ideas in the form of verses. Lilavati was reportedly his daughter, and the text is written addressing her. The works of Bhaskaracharya have theorems and concepts of modern-day calculus, arithmetic, trigonometry, algebra and astronomy. In modern times also mathematicians from India have solved problems of crucial importance. Ramanujan is the epitome of mathematical excellence, apart from him, mathematicians like CR Rao, CS Seshadri, to name a few have done immense service to the discipline. Our IITs have also solved some critical mathematical problems by coming up with AKS (Aggarwal-Kayal-Saxsena) primality test and Karmarkar’s algorithm to illustrate some instances. Prof Manjul Bhargava who won the Fields medal, which is equivalent to the Nobel,brought laurels to India through his number theory. Our contributions to the discipline are of great significance since the genesis of the field. The new National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, has significant provision and provides a platform to build, nurture, foster, encourage and multiply mathematical thinking. It has introduced the reforms needed to balance the need for 21st century employment and entrepreneurship, which is marked by critical, lateral and mathematical thinking. The NEP appreciated the necessity of Mathematical thinking and its importance for the country to become a vishwaguru. Big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchains are key technologies of today, and mathematics is the core of all of these technologies. Hence, it is critical to building the computation thinking capabilities of our youngsters. The NEP provides the necessary nourishment by making Mathematics enjoyable and engaging using innovative methods from the foundational step itself. It is also mandated in NEP to introduce a coding curriculum from middle school as it helps in developing the computation capabilities and intuitive reasoning. Because the applications of Mathematics are extensive and diverse, by introducing the multidisciplinary curriculum and credit-based mechanism, NEP provides flexibility to students to apply their knowledge. These reforms will be of particular importance to the student inclining Mathematics. Also, policy provisions for establishing Mathematics clubs in Higher Education Institutions for better collaboration and interdisciplinary research. I am sure that the Indian mathematics and education system is bound to “ramp up” under the shade of NEP. All the ideas in the policy are a keystone for a self-reliant India, a vibrant vishwaguru!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-will-help-india-regain-its-love-for-mathematics/story-Mk50YqCnHcPStVP6o5GkeM.html
22-12-2020||India||Mumbai court closes cheating case against Naresh Goyal, his wife||A day after the Bombay High Court rejected a petition filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) opposing closure of a cheating case against now-defunct Jet Airways and its directors Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita, the metropolitan magistrate court on Tuesday closed the case by accepting the closure report filed by the Mumbai police.The MRA Marg police had filed the closure report on November 9 after probing the complaint filed by Rajendran Neruparambil, chief financial officer (CFO) of Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL), against Jet Airways and the Goyals.Neruparambil had alleged that in 2018-19, Jet Airways owed ATIPL payment of Rs 46.05 crore. He further alleged Goyals’ had engaged ATIPL in business despite being aware of the financial crisis faced by the airline, which shut down operations in April 2019, and had accumulated debt of nearly Rs 8,500 crore.Jet Airways, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita were booked on charges of cheating and a criminal breach of trust in February this year by the MRA Marg police. It was on the basis of the MRA Marg case that ED had initiated the probe into money laundering allegations against the Goyals’.Neither the magistrate court nor the sessions court allowed the ED to intervene in the case to oppose its closure. On Monday, the high court said: “The petitioner, ED, is an independent investigating agency, empowered to investigate offences under the PMLA and FEMA and in the facts cannot be termed as a victim or aggrieved/injured/person interested in the case.”“There is no provision in law which supports the claim of petitioner with respect to its locus to intervene and contest the closure report filed by the respondent No.1- State. Thus, the petitioner cannot be permitted to intervene and contest in the closure report filed by the respondent No.1-State,” the high court said while rejecting the ED’s plea.ATIPL’s lawyer, advocate Dharmesh Joshi, said he would appeal against the order.The ED is conducting a probe against the Goyals and the defunct airline under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Foreign Exchange Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-court-closes-cheating-case-against-naresh-goyal-his-wife/story-AKZRqtk6AnV7vbIrj9kFhO.html

In its advisory to doctors and health officials, the state’s health department has said that mucormycosis infects people with a weak immune system and those with other existing illnesses. The department said the advisory is being issued after some Covid-19 patients in Ahmedabad and Rajkot were found infected with mucormycosis. Last week, doctors at Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital also found multiple cases in recovering coronavirus disease patients, who were diagnosed with the deadly fungal infection. They said nearly half of them lost their eyesight.Also read | Scientists urge concern, not alarm over new virus strainsThis alarming affliction, although rare, is not new. Black Fungus or mucormycosis has been a cause of disease and death of patients in transplants, and ICU and immunodeficient individuals in the past. However, it is the rapid increase in the numbers seen in unsuspected recovering Covid-19 patients that is causing the grave concern, the hospital said in a statement.Here is all about mucormycosis:1. It is a “serious but rare infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes”.2. Mucormycosis most commonly affects the sinuses or lungs after inhaling fungal spores from the air, or the skin after the fungus enters through a cut, burn or other types of skin injury. According to the advisory, it can occur in any part of the body.3. It said though the “overall mortality rate is around 50 per cent”, early identification and treatment can lead to a better outcome.Also read | What we know about the new Covid-19 strain so far4. According to the advisory, people with diabetes or cancer, those who underwent organ transplant, stem cell transplant or people with too much iron in their body are at a greater risk of contracting this infection.5. Mucormycosis “cannot spread between people or between people and animals”. “People get mucormycosis through contact with fungal spores in the environment,” it said.6. The advisory recommended some preventive measures, like wearing N95 masks but said they “have not been proven to prevent mucormycosis”.7. People should also avoid direct contact with a lot of dust, wear shoes, long pants and gloves while handling soil or moss, and clean skin injuries well with soap and water.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-triggering-rare-fatal-fungal-infection-here-s-all-about-mucormycosis/story-ZN9ZD9ewZOwrc4rxIZUACL.html
22-12-2020||India||Tiger conservation body seeks report from Odisha on ecotourism inside reserve||The National Tiger Conservation Authority has asked Odisha chief wildlife warden to submit a status report on the adverse impact of tourism on Satkosia Tiger Reserve by December 18. The move came after wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty alleged that ecotourism activities like camping on sand resorts, river cruise and treetop bridge walks were having an adverse impact on the local wildlife.In his letter to the NTCA, Mohanty had complained that pitching of 20 tents at Badmul on Mahanadi riverbed inside the Satkosia Tiger Reserve would be extremely harmful for local wildlife. “Riverbeds are unique ecological spaces that deserve to be left alone. The Mahanadi river bed within the tiger reserve is used for basking and nesting by turtles and crocodiles. Birds like Indian Skimmers, terns and Pratincoles use it for nesting and feeding. Setting up of tents and allowing tourists to stay on river beds impacts such wildlife and affects their ecological needs, including basking which is vital for metabolism of cold blooded creatures. “Bonfires at night also affect nocturnal wildlife, disorients their vision thereby impacting their ability to feed and move about freely. Similarly, sand sports like basketball, football and volleyball will lead to sand compaction which will make the habitat unsuitable for ground dwelling, burrowing and egg laying fauna,” Mohanty noted in his letter.Chief wildlife warden HS Upadhyay and additional chief secretary of forest and environment department Mona Sharma did not comment on the NTCA letter.In his letter, Mohanty took exceptions to motorized boat cruises inside the Satkosia gorge in the core area of the tiger reserve, alleging that the sound and vibration of OBM engines would disturb aquatic fauna like turtles, fish, crocodiles and avian fauna like migratory waterfowl that are seen in large numbers. Very often crocodiles and turtles that are basking on the river bank have to dive when they see the approaching tourist boat which affects their metabolism dependent upon winter basking, he alleged.Mohanty also said treetop canopy walk, another eco-tourism initiative in Satkosia, would end up disturbing birds who use the tree canopy for nesting and roosting and even for resting. “They would be disturbed if tourists approached them at close distance of 10-15 feet to watch them at the same level much above the ground. Their chicks would be stressed if humans approach them,” he complained in his letter.The NTCA’s letter to the Odisha government also comes in the backdrop of a failed exercise to repopulate the dwindling tiger population of Satkosia, Odisha’s second tiger reserve after Similipal. In June 2018, the NTCA with the Odisha and MP government had relocated a male and a female tiger as part of India’s first inter-state tiger relocation drive. However, the programme was abandoned after the relocated male tiger was poached while two villagers were killed in an attack by the tigress. The tigress, named Sundari, is now housed in a small enclosure waiting to be transported back to Madhya Pradesh.Last month, the state forest department had proposed a 5-year-action plan for Community-managed Ecotourism scheme from the year 2021-22 to 2025-26 amounting to Rs 160.70 crore in which officials suggested corporatising the ecotourism organisation by creating a lean Corporation with chief wildlife warden as its head. The meeting chaired by the chief secretary discussed institutional provision for quick financial approvals, freedom in hiring of employees and engaging domain experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-conservation-body-seeks-report-from-odisha-on-ecotourism-inside-reserve/story-sUBCZGIL0gNRjhYRoWDPWO.html

The state has already launched a fight against poverty, diseases, regional disparity, inequality and natural disasters. Fight against corruption will help us in our fight against all ills of society. May it be inequality, poverty or injustice. Odisha will be the first state to initiate such a step to check corruption,” he said.The CM underscored that Odisha’s on-going fight against corruption has brought laurels for the state from across the country. “Odisha is one of the few states which has done a remarkable job by setting up special courts for the trial of corruption cases or confiscation of property belonging to corrupt persons/officials. Over the last year, action has been taken against 91 corrupt officials in the state,” CM Patnaik said.Reacting to the announcement, BJP leader Lekhashree Samantsinghar said the CM’s proposal on submission of property details to Lokayukta was a publicity stunt. “The BJD does not have the intent to fight corruption,” she alleged.Patnaik’s announcement comes in the wake of arrest of additional principal chief conservator of forests, Abhay Kant Pathak, who amassed disproportionate assets worth Rs 9.35 crore, which was 435 % of his total income.In 2011, CM Patnaik had announced that all the ministers in his cabinet will have to submit their movable and immovable property returns by August every year.

The US had last awarded Legion of Merit to late Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on September 18, 2020 as the senior most Royal in the Middle-East for bridging divides in the restive region.The Legion of Merit (Degree of Chief Commander) awarded to Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi for exceptionally meritorious service as the Prime Minister of the Republic of India from May 2014 to November 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s steadfast leadership and vision have accelerated India’s emergence as a global power and elevated the strategic partnership between the United States and India to address global challenges. His personal engagement expanded United States-India ties across all facets of the relationship, helping to establish a strong foundation for an enduring partnership that is based on shared commitment to freedom, democratic principles, the equal treatment of all citizens, and the rule of law. India is a key partner for the United States in the Indo-Pacific, where the two countries are increasing collaboration to ensure freedom of the seas, open and transparent investment and infrastructure development, secure and reliable digital networks, and good governance. Prime Minister Modi’s personal initiative strengthened the defense partnership between the United States and India, enhancing the United States’ ability to secure joint military cooperation that addressed shared challenges. His efforts to expand India’s economic cooperation with the United States has advanced prosperity, investment and job creation in both countries. Prime Minister Modi’s superior effort, personal leadership, and unwavering commitment to advancing strategic cooperation between the United States and India and promoting global peace and prosperity reflect great credit upon himself, the Indian armed forces, and his country.ALSO WATCH | Trump confers Legion of Merit award to PM Modi for elevating India-US ties While the outgoing US president has awarded the Legion of Merit to Modi, Abe and Morrison for their leadership and vision, it can also be interpreted as President Trump telling the world that it was during his time at the White House that these relationships were taken to a different level.“The Legion of Merit basically mainstreams the QUAD dialogue from an experimental stage and towards institutionalisation of the security architecture. The world has now realised that the real father of QUAD is China, which forced democracies to cement ties due to its aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea, East Ladakh and against Taiwan. It is another matter that India, Australia and Japan’s relationship with the US is bipartisan with a shared vision of democracy and values,” said a senior official.The QUAD dialogue took shape after China aggravated the dispute with Japan over Senkaku Islands, with India after the transgression on the north banks of Pangong Tso in East Ladakh sector, Australia after imposing trade sanctions and testing nuclear missiles during US naval exercises in the South China Sea. While China calls QUAD a product of 20th century mindset, the fact is that Beijing’s Middle Kingdom concept with tributary states is an imperial expansion concept of 18th century with Belt Road Initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-legion-of-merit-award-for-quad-architects-sends-multiple-messages/story-bSHX0b7SNJXkmxTiHVU8hI.html

22-12-2020||India||Priyanka Gandhi writes to Yogi Adityanath over cow deaths in UP shelter home||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Monday raised concerns over the “horrific” conditions of cows in Uttar Pradesh and asked chief minister Yogi Adityanath to take a cue from Chhattisgarh’s ‘Godhan Nyay Yojana’ on their protection. “The UP government may probably take inspiration from the scheme and we all can serve cows. We can save the cows from being forced to live and die in such horrific conditions and can also help our farmers,” said Priyanka in the letter that the state party released to the media on Monday. Drawing attention towards the death of cows in a cow shelter home in Lalitpur, Priyanka Gandhi said the pictures suggest that the cows may have died due to hunger. “You talked about protecting cows while assuming power. Despite your announcements in this regard, efforts of your government have failed. The corrupt officers and those running cow shelters are indulging in corruption and no one knows how many cows are dying for lack of fodder and water,” said Gandhi. The Congress leader detailed how the cow shelters are becoming self-reliant in Chhattisgarh. “Under this Chhattisgarh government scheme, work is being done to protect cows, boost agriculture, conserve the environment, revive canals, take care of stray animals and make organic fertilizer. The Chhattisgarh government has started buying cow dung for Rs 2 per kg. Cow dung for Rs 15 crore per month is being bought as of now. This cow dung, being brought through cow shelter homes, is being used to make vermi-compost which is being sold to government agencies and private consumers at Rs 8 per kg. With this, cow shelter homes are becoming self-reliant,” she said. She further said: “The ‘Godhan Nyay Yojana’ is leading to two main benefits - people are feeding their cows at home and not leaving them, while stray cows are being kept in shelter homes. Those being benefited from the scheme include more than half of women and a large number of unemployed persons of backward classes…. I hope you also want the welfare of cows. So I am writing this letter to you to put a stop to atrocities against the cows. I understand this is my responsibility to make you aware of these issues.” CM Adityanath, who is often seen feeding cows and pictured on many occasions with them, said in November that 524,000 cows are kept in government-run shelters, while more than eight lakh of them have been housed in ‘Kanha Upvan’, the cow shelters being run by local bodies in the state.After the cow shelters started overflowing, the Yogi Adityanath government launched the Chief Minister Destitute Cows Participation Scheme in August last year offering willing farmers to take strays against an affidavit that they would look after them properly at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-writes-to-yogi-adityanath-over-cow-deaths-in-up-shelter-home/story-NVVcPCLdkNSUrYYQMlMHNJ.html
22-12-2020||India||The man who knew infinity: All you need to know about Srinivasa Ramanujan||National Mathematics Day or Math Day is observed every year on December 22, honouring the legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar on his birthday. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh had inaugurated on this date in 2012, after which it is observed as Math Day every year.Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Tamil Nadu’s Erode. He had developed a talent for mathematics from a very young age, mastering trigonometry at the age of 12 and was eligible for a scholarship at the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam. He had enrolled in Madras’ Pachaiyappa College at the age of 14.Ramanujan worked at the Madras Port Trust in 1912 where his mathematical prowess was recognised by some of his co-workers, one of whom referred him to professor GH Hardy of Trinity College, Cambridge University. He met Hardy in 1913, a year after which he went to Trinity College where he honed his craft under the Englishman’s tutelage.He received his degree from Cambridge in 1916 and went on to publish several brilliant papers on his subject with Hardy’s help, and the two even collaborated on several joint projects and publications. Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society in 1917 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his excellent work on Elliptic Functions and the theory of numbers. He was also the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of the Trinity College.Despite not having any formal training in pure mathematics, Ramanujan made priceless contributions to several mathematical concepts like infinite series, continued fractions, number theory and mathematical analysis. He also made notable contributions like the hypergeometric series, the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, the theory of divergent series, and the functional equations of the zeta function.Ramanujan died at the young age of 32 owing to deteriorating health on April 26, 1920. Robert Kanigel wrote a book about him called ‘The Man Who Knew Infinity’ in 2015. His life was also portrayed in a movie with the same name where he was played by British-Indian actor Dev Patel. The film shed light on Ramanujan’s childhood in India, his time in Britain during World War I, and his journey to becoming one of India’s most renowned mathematicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-man-who-knew-infinity-all-you-need-to-know-about-srinivasa-ramanujan/story-19Q6Lt2rIY87V75VLGHhzI.html

Rajkhowa, an expert in rocket propelled grenades (RPG), was the second most important man in ULFA-I after commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah. Rajkhowa had surrendered before security forces in Meghalaya last month. A large number of arms and ammunition, including assault rifles, pistols, grenades, etc, were handed over by the rebels from ULFA-I, United Peoples’ Revolutionary Front (UPRF), Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) and Peoples’ Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (PDCK). “It’s nice that several children of Assam who were engaged in anti-national activities have decided to return to mainstream and join in nation building. I welcome them all back,” said Sonowal at a function held at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra in Guwahati. “Our effort would be to ensure proper rehabilitation of those who have given up violence. I urge those who have laid down arms today to avail the various schemes launched by our government to help them,” he added. This was the third major laying down of arms ceremony by rebels in Assam this year. In January, three days after signing of the third Bodo peace pact, 1615 cadres of three factions of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) had given up arms. The same month, 644 rebels of 8 militant outfits - ULFA-I, NDFB (S), Kamtapur Liberation Organisation, National Liberation Front of Bengalis, Rabha National Liberation Front, Communist Party of India-Maoist, National Santhal Liberation Army and Adivasi Dragon Fighter had laid down arms. With Monday’s ceremony, the total number of rebels laying down arms in such big numbers and joining the mainstream increased to 2,323 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/63-insurgents-give-up-arms-in-assam-cm-sonowal-welcomes-them/story-rcDhbR8ODrzRBjCTK7acKM.html

22-12-2020||India||‘Did not let the pandemic delay or derail our government’s initiatives’: Jai Ram Thakur||Three years since he was unexpectedly catapulted to the top job in Himachal Pradesh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, 55, is firmly in the saddle politically. But he faces the uphill task of keeping a bevy of poll promises, made tougher by an unrelenting Covid-19 rampage that has battered the state’s economy, already weighed down by a surging debt burden of ₹55,000 crore. With his understated, hands-on style of governance, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Mandi, who enters his fourth year at the helm on December 27, has been quick to reset his priorities to blunt the opposition’s charge of below-par performance. In an exclusive interview with Ramesh Vinayak in Shimla on Sunday, Thakur exuded an air of quiet confidence in his ability to deal with the challenges ahead. Edited excerpts: How do you look at three years of your government? Overall, it has been a satisfactory performance. The last one year, since March, has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic which adversely impacted the state financially and also certain big projects. But we didn’t let the health emergency delay or derail initiatives that we had taken at the outset of our term... There is not a single major issue that people hold against my government. Which are those initiatives? Since its inception, Himachal Pradesh has seen two parties’ rule by rotation. Every five years, the new government used to begin its term with a spirit of revenge against the last regime... I put an end to the politics of vendetta... We also launched the Jan Manch scheme in which all ministers, along with officials, hear public grievances at a pre-decided venue on the first Thursday of every month... On the social welfare front, our government reduced the limit for old-age pension from 80 to 70 years and expanded the ambit of the Narendra Modi government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme that benefited 22 lakh of the state’s 70 lakh population. For those left out, we introduced the Him Care scheme for free treatment. Similarly, as a state version of the Centre’s Ujjwala scheme that covered 1.5 lakh families, was implemented Grahini Suvidha, covering another 2.86 lakh beneficiaries. Today, Himachal Pradesh is the only the state where each household has a cooking gas facility. How is it that Covid-19 continues to surge in Himachal, while it is on the decline in other states? The spike in two months has coincided with the onset of winter and the wedding season... There was casualness in adhering to the government- imposed caps on the number of attendees. So, we had to reimpose restrictions and tighten enforcement. The limit for social gatherings has been restricted to 50. Night curfew is in place in the four worst-hit districts of Shimla, Kullu, Kangra and Mandi. As a result, the number of daily cases has dropped from 800 to 300. With 9,000 tests daily, our testing is much higher than others... the caseload has shown a sharp decline from 1,000 to 300 in the past week. We will review the night curfew on December 23. What has been the impact of the Covid crisis on the state’s economy? We have suffered an economic loss of at least ₹30,000 crore. The hardest hit is tourism that has been a big generator of employment and revenue. Industrial, agriculture and horticulture sectors were less impacted. Drug manufacturing at Baddi, one of Asia’s major pharma hubs, went on even during the lockdown. What is your wish list for the Centre? We are pressing for external-aided projects. A ₹1,892-crore tourism infrastructure project funded by the Asian Development Bank is at an advanced stage, but it has been on hold. There has also been a pause on the centrally-funded national highway projects. We are expecting the Finance Commission’s nod on state-specific projects. Your government faced flak over a health department scam in the purchase of Covid supplies that led to the resignation of the state BJP chief. Has that not hurt the government’s image? More than the government, it was an individual case. Soon after the scam surfaced, the government acted swiftly and arrested the health director, that too amid the pandemic. State party president Dr Rajeev Bindal resigned on moral grounds. Had he not done that...That would have hurt us more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-let-the-pandemic-delay-or-derail-our-government-s-initiatives-jai-ram-thakur/story-CPDHDfknIc5fF2CFpoHwGJ.html

The issue before the bench, headed by justice Sanjib Banerjee, pertained to a petition by the father of a 19-year-old Hindu woman, who got married to a Muslim man and also converted to Islam. While the father alleged pressure on his daughter, the woman recorded her statement before a magistrate, stating that she married a person of her choice and would not want to go back to her parents. As she was about to meet a district judge to record her statement finally, the father submitted in the HC that he feared his daughter might not feel free to testify. He pleaded that before she meets the judge, his apprehensions regarding pressure on his daughter should be allayed. The bench accepted the father’s plea and directed for a meeting between the woman and the additional public prosecutor of the HC on December 23 before she finally records her statement. But at the same time, the bench, in its order, said: “If an adult marries as per her choice and decides to convert and not return to her paternal house, there can be no interference in the matter.” The case comes amid controversy over a stringent anti-conversion law in UP which bans conversion by fraud, coercion, enticement or marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-cannot-interfere-when-woman-marries-as-per-wishes-converts-hc/story-etBuBfSmfCyey4e1jG1bnJ.html

Kishore tweeted: “For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in #WestBengal. PS: Please save this tweet and if BJP does any better I must quit this space!” BJP leaders scoffed at the claim, saying it was ambiguous because Kishor hadn’t spelt out what he meant by “space.” A top executive at I-Pac, Kishor’s company, said he meant leaving his job as an election strategist. “What he meant is quite obvious. He will leave his work if the BJP wins more than 99 seats in Bengal. Those in the BJP, who counter this, should be asked whether they will quit politics if he is proved right,” the executive said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-struggle-to-cross-double-digits-in-bengal-says-kishor-triggers-row/story-UWwGvRKIoC0o5rqhP2oERN.html
22-12-2020||India||Govt open to more tweaks if farm talks resume: Official||The Union government hasn’t ruled out more concessions or amendments to the three farm laws and a set of recent proposals it sent out to farm unions should not be considered final, provided farmers restart negotiations and spell out their objections, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The government has worked the back channels to bring farmer groups back to the negotiating table, the person cited above added, asking not to be named. In its back channel talks, the government has urged farm unions not to insist on the repeal of the three contentious farm laws as a precondition for the dialogue. The government is open to working out additional concessions but a repeal of the laws is not an option, the person said. “The government believes that extensive safeguards for each and every apprehension can be included in the laws to put an end to all vulnerabilities of farmers through discussions. The proposals sent so far to the farmers are not final. This is the government’s position.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana are protesting a set of reforms they say will hurt their livelihoods. These changes include lifting restrictions on agribusiness engaged in farm trade, deregulating agricultural markets, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities and a new contract farming regime. The person quoted above said a fresh invite for talks may be sent to farmers. On Sunday, a top agricultural ministry bureaucrat wrote to Darshan Pal, a farm leader, asking him to clarify what objections farm unions had to the government’s last proposal on December 9. In the written proposal, the government had offered amendments to some provisions of the laws for greater oversight on deregulated markets, sparing farmers penalties for stubble burning, which cases pollution and promising to keep providing farmers subsidised power instead of direct cash transfer, but farm union said they won’t call off their agitation until the laws were fully repealed. “The Modi government is fundamentally wrong in treating agriculture as a base for growth of corporates. We will launch a counter campaign against lies propagated by the PM, agriculture minister and the BJP,” said Avik Saha of Samyukt Kisan Morcha. Farm unions haven’t shown any signs that they are interested in resuming dialogue with the government since calling off talks on December 8, citing a stalemate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-open-to-more-tweaks-if-farm-talks-resume-official/story-QcMyBOOommgwq7uwYagSzN.html
22-12-2020||India||Delhiwale: Mansion of a dozen labourers||It looks like a museum. Nothing like this old-fashioned balcony exists anywhere else in the immediate vicinity.What is it like to actually live in this building?It turns out that this elegant Walled City mansion is a rent-free home to a dozen labourers. They work for a construction material supplier who sits in the shop below, here in Mohalla Qabristan neighbourhood. The building belongs to him.“It’s at least 100 years old, but our family moved to a bigger house, nearby, a long time ago,” he says.The entry is dramatic. The steep unlit staircase abruptly opens into a tiny, cluttered courtyard. It doesn’t feel like the same building—that from the outside looks so grand.This morning, the courtyard smells of amla (gooseberry) hair oil and Lifebuoy soap. One corner is piled up with ladders and ballis (wooden poles), probably the work equipments of the dwellers. The only room on this floor has its door partially open. Three men are asleep, loudly snoring.The landing above is accessed by a makeshift metallic staircase. Two tin-roofed sheds comprise the living quarters of another set of labourers. In one, Zafar is making meat curry for lunch, while Annu is having his breakfast—aloo subzi and roti. There’s no window, and street sounds have grown fainter, as if coming from very far. The room looks bare, yet it has all the basic household essentials, including a gas cylinder. A broom is plonked beside a tall earthen pot. A metal trunk is plopped up on what appears to be the remains of a dressing mirror—“we picked it from a kabadi walla (waste picker),” says Zafar. Clothes are hung from a metal chord. A hand-held mirror on the wall is reflecting the aforementioned trunk, making it look like a painter’s framed ‘still life’.By this time some of the residents have already left for work, Zafar says. On clambering down back to the street, the house no longer looks like a museum, but very contemporary, pulsating with the presence of the people living in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-mansion-of-a-dozen-labourers/story-wEmNDmSKm6ctbQjpnxn6mJ.html
22-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The big news of Monday was the big news of Sunday, which was the big news of Saturday – the new strain of the coronavirus in the UK. Following the lead of many other countries, India too stopped flights from the UK till the end of the year, but it may be too late. According to a report in virological.org by researchers from several UK universities – the report was authored for the Covid-19 Genomics Consortium, UK, a public-private partnership that seeks to “collect, sequence and analyse the whole genomes of virus samples in the UK” – the first samples of the strain (now called B.1.1.7) was collected on September 20. That’s three months back, which probably means that most countries barring the entry of travellers from the UK, or stopping flights to and from that country are probably too late. There is a very high probability that the strain has already entered their countries.Between the time I wrote Dispatch 229 on Sunday and the time I am writing this, scientists have figured out even more about this strain, and the bad news would appear to be that, at least in a laboratory setting, it is more infective than the older strain. It also emerges that the strain is now the dominant one, at least in the UK, but that should not come as a surprise to anyone – that’s how mutations often work. According to the report in virological.org, three of the new strain’s multiple mutations (17, according to most reports), are interesting. One, which I wrote about in yesterday’s dispatch, Mutation N501Y, effects a change in the spike protein of the virus, possibly making it bind better with human cells; another, also in the spike protein, could, researchers suspect, help the virus evade the host’s immune system; and the third, whose effects are not known, is close to the cleavage site of the spike protein. This is the site which reacts with the human enzyme furin, resulting in the spike protein breaking into two parts, with one part (S1), attaching itself to the ACE receptor found in human cells, facilitating the entry of the viral matter. It’s easy to see how all this could make the new strain more infective, but as I pointed out yesterday, we will not know for sure till more studies of infectivity happen, and more genomes of the virus are analysed – and both need to happen across the globe.India may be seeing a lull in new cases, but this is no guarantee that the new strain isn’t here already. The country has had a so-called travel bubble with the UK since May, with 70 flights a week between the countries. This can be established through a large-scale genomic analysis. India has been analysing viral genomes from around the country, and while this does not seem to have been on the same scale as the UK’s, if there were a new strain of the virus rapidly emerging as the predominant one, it is likely to have been picked up.The UK scare is likely to push India (and many other countries) to sequence more genomes of the virus. According to an article in Science (sciencemag.org), the UK’s efforts at identifying the new strain were helped by the fact that one of the commonly used RT-PCR tests in that country, TaqPath, showed pieces of only two genes in the result if the virus was the new strain (as compared to pieces of three genes for the older strain; one of the genes is hidden by one of the mutations). This kit is approved for use in India too (according to the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research), but this columnist doesn’t know how many labs, if any at all, use it. That would be a good starting point for India’s investigations into the new strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-GjInMRHZdpunOOSc3joXFI.html
22-12-2020||India||‘Don’t lie’: Mamata hits back in election slugfest||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday dismissed Union home minister Amit Shah’s contention about lack of development in the state as “garbage of lies”, announced additional funds for social welfare schemes and accused the central government of dividing the country, pulling out all the stops against an aggressive Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that is ready to challenge her in the assembly elections early next year.First, Banerjee held a press conference at the state secretariat in the afternoon and countered Shah’s claim that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government, which stormed to power in 2011 after ending a three-decade Left rule, failed to deliver and lagged behind other states on various parameters, except corruption and extortion.“I want to tell Amitji that you are the home minister and it does not suit you to shell out lies provided by your party workers without cross-checking,” Banerjee said, rebutting Shah, who visited the state over the weekend to bolster the BJP’s election campaign and launched a scathing criticism of the TMC administration. “I will only speak on two things today: he said we are a zero in industry, [but] we are number one in MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises). He also said that we have not constructed village roads, [but] we are number one on that count too and this information has been shared by the government of India,” Banerjee said.“Why are you speaking garbage of lies to people. Tell the truth,” she added, while also highlighting the success of her government’s schemes for distributing cash among girls of economically backward families and bicycles among students. “Some people coming from Delhi are jealous and they keep spreading falsehoods.” On Sunday, Shah visited Visva Bharati, Bengal’s only central university set up by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in Birbhum, and led a massive BJP rally in the heart of Bolpur town. Banerjee on Monday also said she had written a letter to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, reiterating the state’s request to route the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme funds through her government for disbursal among the farmers. Under PM-Kisan, the Centre provides an income support of ₹6,000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment. The amount is paid in three equal cash transfers of ₹2,000 — one every four months. The Bengal government has yet to implement it, as well as the Ayushman Bharat health scheme. “We never said we will not give the money to the farmers, but we wanted that the funds be routed through the state government,” Banerjee said.She announced the increase of expenditure on social welfare and development schemes by an additional ₹8,700 crore. This amount, she said, will be disbursed over the next month and allotted to different departments, ranging from panchayat to health. “The government spent ₹20,212 crore in 2020-21 on development expenditure...But after witnessing the demand for such schemes at the camps being held for the “Duware Sarkar” (government at the doorsterp) programme, we have decided to release an additional ₹8700 crore over the next one month,” Banerjee said, referring to a flagship outreach programme launched by her government earlier this month. The BJP was quick to hit back. “The CM’s announcement made it clear that she treats people only as vote bank. The TMC government works only for political benefits,” said Samik Bhattacharya, the chief spokesperson of the BJP’s state unit.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, too, called a press conference and questioned the state‘s refusal to implement central schemes. “She wrote [to the Centre] that this money (for PM Kisan) should be given to the state government. Why should that be done when beneficiaries are getting the money directly in their accounts across the country?” he asked. Speaking to reporters, Banerjee also announced that she will visit Birbhum district on December 28 for an official meeting, and also lead a roadshow the next day. Later in the evening, she inaugurated the Christmas festival at Allen Park in the city’s posh Park Street area, where she said the BJP-led government at the Centre was bent on “dividing the country”.“The BJP government has cancelled the public holiday on Christmas after coming to power. Why did they do so? Don’t they have any regard for the sentiments of the Christian community?” Banerjee said. “Is there secularism in India? I am sorry to say that a typical politics of hatred is going on.”Banerjee’s remarks appeared to refer to the BJP government’s decision in 2014 — it came to power that year — to celebrate December 25 as “Good Governance Day”, a move that triggered widespread controversy amidst apprehensions that the holiday will be scrapped. To be sure, Christmas remains a public holiday as per the Centre’s list. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said it was Banerjee who violated secular values by declaring monthly stipend for Imams of the state’s mosques. “A person who makes political statements from administrative meetings every day has no right to talk about the Constitution,” he said. Meanwhile, the election heat in Bengal appeared to have reached Mumbai, where ruling coalition member Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) hit out at the BJP. Speaking to reporters, Maharashtra minister and NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik said Banerjee called up NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday. The BJP’s “use” of central machinery to “destabilise” the Bengal government could be discussed by other non-BJP parties in Delhi, Malik said, in an indication that the fiercely fought Bengal election could be catapulted to the national stage. Banerjee’s government has been at odds with the Centre over a host of issues; the latest being the Centre directing three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to join central duty for their alleged dereliction of duty during an attack on the convoy of BJP president JP Nadda in the state on December 10. “The IPS officers have been withdrawn without the consent of the West Bengal government, which is very dangerous. West Bengal chief minister has discussed the issue with Pawar saheb,” Malik said. He added that the BJP’s “programme to destabilise” elected governments in states “is not right and not in line with democracy”.

22-12-2020||India||India suspends UK flights||India joined a growing list of countries on Monday to seal off access to people who have been to the UK, suspending all flights to and from the country between December 23 and December 31 in order to stop the arrival of a new strain of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 feared to spread faster. All passengers who arrive from the UK on December 21 and 22 will be asked to take an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 at the airport, with only those who test negative be allowed to go home, where they will need to isolate for seven days. Anyone who tests positive will be taken to institutional quarantine or to a medical facility if their health requires, the government announced. The move came hours after an emergency meeting of the Union health ministry’s joint monitoring group (JMG), which reviewed information from the UK where authorities on Saturday released details of B.1.1.7, a new strain of the coronavirus with an unusually high number of changes. After receiving the expert group’s opinion, the civil aviation ministry announced suspension of flights to and from UK.“Considering the prevailing situation in UK. Government of India has decided that all flights originating from UK to India shall be temporarily suspended till 31st December 2020 (23.59 hours). This suspension to start w.e.f. 23.59 hours, 22nd December 2020,” the ministry said in a statement, which was reiterated separately by minister Hardeep Singh Puri.“As a measure of abundant precaution, passengers arriving from UK in all transit flights (flights that have taken off or flights which are reaching India before 22nd Dec at 23.59 hrs) should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned,” it added.“It is just a precautionary measure. This strain has not been found in India,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.A second top official, too, said genomic sequencing has not found such a variant in India.“We have not found anything related to the UK strain so far in any of our samples. Be it in our laboratory in National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune or any other laboratories across the country doing genome sequencing, there is no evidence of this mutation in our samples,” said Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“We have imposed a 10-day suspension on flights to and from UK after a thorough review by the government. We will reassess the suspension period as per the situation prevailing in the country,” an aviation ministry official said, asking not to be named. Passengers will not be allowed to leave the airport until the test results are out, and states will make arrangements for waiting passengers. Those whose test results are positive will be isolated, and those with negative results will have to mandatorily remain in home isolation for a week.Some states, such as Maharashtra and Kerala, separately announced tougher restrictions. The aviation ministry official quoted above said that the Centre too could announce similar restrictions as a whole for arrivals from other European nations. Genomic sequencing repository Nextstrain showed the variant found in UK was also circulating in Denmark, and similar mutations – although in a different strain – were seen in some samples from South Africa. India has been operating international flights through bilateral transport bubbles with 23 countries including UK since calling off scheduled overseas flight operations when it announced the lockdown in March. India’s bubble agreement with UK covered at least 70 flights per week, according to the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The airlines flying these routes were Air India, British Airways, Vistara and Virgin Atlantic. The new coronavirus variant has prompted the UK government to impose a Tier 4 lockdown across the country and tighten restrictions for all of England especially during the festive period. Viruses mutate often as the biological process of replication within hosts they infect is not always a perfect process. The Sars-Cov-2 has also been mutating, but none of these changes have been seen as worrying as yet. Experts from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium on Saturday said the new variant is significant because it now “accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England”, “has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein”, and the mutations “have potential biological effects”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-suspends-uk-flights/story-QMUMArhX9wRilV7HFyl48L.html
22-12-2020||India||PM Modi to release cash, speak to farmers in Dec 25 outreach||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will release the next tranche of PM-Kisan, the direct cash-transfer scheme for farmers, making payments worth ₹18,000 crore to 80 million farmers and also chat with some of them virtually on Christmas Day, the agriculture ministry has said. Modi released the first tranche in 2019 and will do so again at a time when thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab, are protesting three agricultural laws they say will hurt their livelihoods. The government says the reforms will give farmers more market access and boost investment in the farm sector. “It will be a freewheeling conversation. The Prime Minister is likely to talk about the new farm laws and how they will benefit farmers,” an official said, requesting anonymity. Under PM-Kisan, the government provides income support of ₹6,000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of ₹2,000 — one every four months. It was launched on February 24, 2019, when the first instalment was paid. The Prime Minister will most likely ask farmers impromptu questions on how they have benefited from the scheme and “take a briefing from them on what they are growing and what else they want to see done for them ahead of the budget”, the official said. Farmers from all four corners of the country will be connected online through panchayat for the interaction, according to the official. The Prime Minister also intends to use the session to receive feedback on the ground realities of farming, he said. The Modi government has ramped up its outreach of farmers in the face of a massive, ongoing agitation by thousands of farmers who have encircled Delhi and are calling for the scrapping of a set of farm-reform laws. The protest entered its 26th day on Monday.PM Modi has been frequently explaining the benefits of farm reforms and often assured farmers that the existing government support mechanism, including minimum support price and agriculture mandis, will continue. “Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed his feelings by writing a letter to the farmer brothers and sisters, attempting to have a polite dialogue. I request all the farmers to read it,” PM Modi had tweeted on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-release-cash-speak-to-farmers-in-dec-25-outreach/story-AS9N8LgkcwgRI8TYYjdR3L.html
22-12-2020||India||New manual on graft investigations: CBI looks to finish probes within 9 months||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has decided to complete majority of its investigations under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act within a maximum nine months, according to the latest Crime Manual of the agency, which was updated after 15 years. The existing one-year deadline in corruption cases will apply only in those cases wherein a high ranking government official such as a joint secretary or secretary is accused, and the probe is being supervised by an officer of additional director rank or above in the CBI, people familiar with the development said. For cases against lower-rung government officers, like clerks or section officers etc, CBI’s investigating officers (IOs) will have to complete probes within six months. CBI’s latest Crime Manual — which has been prepared by a task force led by additional director Praveen Sinha after consulting legal experts, retired officers of the agency and other experts — has for the first time given a provision to form “investigation teams” in complex cases rather than depending on one Investigating Officer (IO). The manual, which is referred to by the CBI officers while initiating a preliminary enquiry (PE) or First Information Report (FIR) and conducting investigations, had become outdated as courts had struck down several criminal laws and there have been amendment in various laws as well. The Prevention of Corruption Act and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) have also been since amended, and Supreme Court has passed several judgments, which have been taken into account while updating the manual for the benefit of IOs, said the officer. The manual also gives special thrust on investigations abroad. Officials cited above said a special chapter has been dedicated in the manual explaining how to conduct investigations abroad as well as procedures and the functioning of Interpol. “We have comprehensively revised our SOPs (standard operating procedures) so as to enhance the speed and quality of investigation and in consonance with global best practices,” said an officer who did not want to be named. The new manual will explain to the IOs the procedure to collect the digital evidence as large number of cases related to child pornography, phishing, and bitcoins etc. having international ramifications are being reported. It also has information about preventive vigilance functioning of CBI so that field units can use the same, officers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-manual-on-graft-investigations-cbi-looks-to-finish-probes-within-9-months/story-jMrsVFs3bCnCnjJNonCjSL.html
22-12-2020||India||60% rise in leopard numbers in 4 years; Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra top states||The union environment ministry has said there has been over 60% increase in population of leopards in India since 2014. There were at least 12,852 leopards in the country in 2018 compared to 7,910 leopards estimated in 2014 according to the ministry’s ‘Status of Leopards in India 2018’ report released on Monday.Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of leopards—3,421 followed by Karnataka—1783 and Maharashtra—1690. Leopard population had increased in all states of central India when compared to previous estimates of 2014. When it comes to different landscapes of India, central India and Eastern Ghats were found to have 8071 leopards stretching across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and Northern Telangana. The Shivalik Hills and Gangetic Plains landscape extending from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh to parts of Bihar 1253 leopards were recorded. In the Western Ghats which includes protected areas in Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu 3387 leopards were recorded while only 141 were estimated for northeastern hills and Brahmaputra plains.The estimation exercise hasn’t considered other leopard occupied areas such as non-forested habitats (coffee and tea plantations), higher elevations in the Himalayas, arid landscapes and majority of the northeastern landscape. “The population estimation should be considered as the minimum number of leopards in each of the landscapes,” the report cautions.Genetic analysis of leopards during the study has indicated that leopard populations across the country are not strictly genetically structured as opposed to tiger populations which show structuring. Parts of northeast for example have genetically distinct tiger populations. But the leopard population in India is largely continuous, the estimation of their population by the National Tiger Conservation Authority(NTCA) has revealed.The findings of NTCA however contradict a study published in the journal PeerJ in February. The study by Wildlife Institute of India and Bengaluru based Centre for Wildlife Studies which used faecal samples to study genetic markers found four distinct sub-populations of leopards in India with high genetic variation—leopards of the Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau-Semi Arid region, Shivalik and the Terai region in North India. The assessment of genetic data had also revealed a possibly human-induced 75-90% population decline among leopards in India in the past 120-200 years.NTCA in its leopard population estimation has acknowledged that leopard populations are increasingly becoming fragmented due to low wild prey densities. “This has resulted in leopards venturing out into human dominated landscapes and ending up in conflicts. Intense conflicts are mostly reported from hills of Shivalik-Terai landscape and parts of Central India. The forests of Central Indian landscape harbours the largest population of leopards in its fragmented forest patches. While genetic data and population data suggest that leopard populations across is continuous, there is an increasing need for corridor connectivity, and improvement of habitat, to reduce interface with humans and thereby reducing the chance of conflict,” the report has concluded. “Based on an ever-increasing number of reported leopard deaths over the past decade due to a combination of factors such as roadkills, poisoning, electrocution and persecution by humans, the leopard population should at best remain stable if not decrease since 2014. Such a drastic increase in the population of a large carnivore (apex predator) within such a narrow time period, and that too in a constantly deteriorating habitat, is ecologically impossible. Since the report does not mention anything about the difference in sampled area between 2014 and 2018, one can safely attribute the increase to a gross underestimation in 2014 coupled with an increase in the total area sampled in 2018,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT).“The current estimate is based on sampling that was carried out in tiger-bearing areas. While leopards coexist well with tigers, they have a much wider distribution than tigers. This means that a significant portion of leopard habitat such as the entire state of Gujarat and innumerable leopard-bearing habitats such as the Sanjay Gandhi Nation Park, Jhalana are not sampled in this exercise. This means that in the future, if these are included in the estimation process, the population will go up further. To summarise, while the 2018 figure seems far more realistic compared to that of 2014, it is far from representing the real leopard situation on the ground. Having said this, India is the first country that has even attempted to estimate its leopard population. For more accurate results the government will have to carry out an exercise that is designed specifically for leopards, and one that covers their entire range,” he added.“Leopard numbers can increase substantially but that doesn’t show whether leopard occupancy has increased. If leopard area also increases then that is a sign that they are safe. Leopard area may be out in the full report which will be published later. Leopard numbers fluctuate a lot due to presence of tigers. In protected areas where tiger numbers are low, leopard numbers increase. They can also increase due to better habitat management. In Tadoba we saw leopard numbers jump from 80 to 120 in 3 to 4 years,” said Bilal Habib, Head, Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-rise-in-leopard-numbers-in-4-yrs/story-qnL8cprKCnPopwclbkHkAJ.html
22-12-2020||India||New Covid strain not yet found in India: Experts||India has not yet detected the new strain of coronavirus that has spread to some parts of the United Kingdom, top government officials said on Monday, describing the curbs on flight services as a “measure of caution”.The new strain is feared to be more infective and could 70% more transmissible, experts in UK said over the weekend, prompting over 40 nations – including India – to suspend flight operations. “It is just a precautionary measure. This strain has not been found in India,” confirmed Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), also said, “We have not found anything related to the UK strain so far in any of our samples. Be it in our laboratory in National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune or any other laboratories across the country doing genome sequencing, there is no evidence of this mutation in our samples.”As part of epidemiological surveillance, India has been performing virus genome sequencing to follow mutations.“It is an ongoing process that started some eight months ago. The process is that if there is any new mutation found in the virus then it is compared with past mutations to figure out the change. So far, there have only been minor mutations seen in the virus which is not of much consequence, and nobody has identified anything of this particular UK strain,” Dr Panda said.“We are constantly vigilant, and it is not like the strain has mutated in the UK and suddenly we will start looking for this mutation. If there is a mutation it will show up in the surveillance but so far there is nothing of consequence,” he added. Virology experts who have been performing genome sequencing also say they haven’t come across this particular strain as yet.“We have been sequencing but so far nothing of this sort has been identified. There are two things, antigenic drift and antigenic shift wherein drift is a minor change and shift suggests a major mutation in the virus structure. Many a times even if there has been a mutation we have to see what impact it has clinically. There have been mutations detected in Sars-Cov-2 virus in the past but those haven’t meant much clinically,” said a senior virologist at a prominent government laboratory approved to perform Covid-19 testing, while asking not to be named. The mutation should not be a cause for concern, the virologists said, as it has shown to be more transmissible, which means it will spread faster, and not more virulent.“There are three causes of worry when we talk of virus mutation: transmissibility, pathogenicity (the strength to cause disease), immunogenicity (to provoke body’s immune response). In both the cases, in the UK and South Africa, the strains have been found to be more transmissible. The virulent part has not been established yet,” said Dr Jacob John, former virology department head, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “It partly explains the second wave that the world is seeing; however it will be difficult to predict the epidemic pattern in India as we don’t have a systemic approach to pandemic research in India. We don’t have the relevant data. We treat outbreaks more like a law and order problem in India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-strain-not-yet-found-in-india-experts/story-n8S2ODv01FvDUmnc0sQCzH.html
22-12-2020||India||Road to safety: On the vaccine trail||The wall is new — so new, in fact, that it is yet to be plastered over. It has been built in the large room of a public health clinic in Bihar’s Dharbanga to create another room. It is secured with a collapsible gate, but as with most walls, it is what lies behind (or will soon lie behind) that’s interesting — an air-conditioned vault that will house 2021’s most precious commodity, Covid-19 vaccines. In Hathua, in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district, roughly 60km away as the crow flies from the clinic with the room with the brick wall , the women and children’s ward of the district hospital is empty. That isn’t surprising because it is no longer a women’s and children’s ward. In the ward, a cement platform has been readied. It will support a walk-in cooler that is being installed, a mega-refrigerator that can store vaccines at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It’s not just Bihar — across India, large cities, nondescript towns, districts big and small, are all scrambling to add critical infrastructure to meet the challenge of vaccinating 300 million people by July 2021, and, if all goes well, hundreds of millions more by the end of the year. India has recorded in excess of 10 million cases of the viral disease, and suffered 146,163 deaths, and while the per-million statistics are better than most countries (including those in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations), and the case fatality rate is among the lowest in the world in such a large country, it is clear that life and work — both have been disrupted radically in 2020 — will return to normal only when enough people have been vaccinated.This is easier said than done. It requires the government to mobilise millions of workers, significantly augment health infrastructure in a country that spends less than 2% of its GDP on the sector, create a seamless network between states, ministries, agencies and local administrations and, also, a huge outreach effort that, at once, spreads awareness about the benefits of vaccination and quickly quashes malicious rumours of the sort that often circulate over messaging platforms. To be sure, India is no stranger to mass immunization measures. It launched a vaccination programme for newborns way back in 1978. Seven years later, it expanded the programme to make it universal and cover all districts. Every year, it gives 11 types of vaccines to close to 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women. It even boasts two national training centres for cold chains in Pune and Delhi that provide technical training in maintenance of facilities that constitute the backbone of the immunization outreach. As an aside, it emerges that one of the vaccines that is part of the universal immunization programme, the BCG one, may provide people with some form of protection against severe versions of Covid-19, one reason being offered by researchers for India’s better-than-expected Covid-19 metrics.Magnitude of the task The addition of vaccines over time to the universal programme, particularly the introduction of the pulse polio vaccine in 1995, has led to a wider and more robust network of better logistics and solid infrastructure, but that is not enough. The sheer scale and urgency of administering Covid-19 vaccines poses a stiff challenge even to the old hands in India’s success story in vaccination. For India never had to immunize 300 million people in six months. And states such as Bihar, home to 99 million people (if it were a country, it would be the 15th most populous in the world), are key to meeting this challenge. The infectiveness of Covid-19 has resulted in its own network effect — no one is safe till everyone is — which means poor and backward states such as Bihar will have to vaccinate people with the same efficiency that richer and more developed states do. At the heart of Bihar’s effort is a five-storeyed building in Patna’s Nalanda Medical College and Hospital campus. This is one of India’s largest state vaccine stores—the Centre that stores and supplies vaccines across the state. Each floor of this building has massive halls packed with containers of different shapes and sizes. There are countless cardboard boxes full of syringes, used cold boxes, Thermocol covers, piles of small plastic ice packs, yellowing from years of use. This is the Centre that fuels the immunization programme in this part of the Hindi heartland. The ground floor has several rows of mega-sized refrigerators. Then there are three walk-in-freezers (WIF). These super-cool white boxes have a temperature range of minus  15 to -25 degrees Celsius. Barring some research facilities or top hospitals such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, or the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore,, where refrigerators with far lower temperature capacities are available, these WIFs offer the lowest temperature vaults in India’s vast health sector network. The poorer version of the WIF are the walk-in-coolers (WIC) that can maintain 2 to 8 degrees Celsius temperatures. Both look like mini containers. “These WIFs are 20 cubic metres. But they are enough to store 1.5 to 2 lakh vials. Our total capacity in all WIFs and WICs is 2 million vials,” explained Dr. NK Sinha, the state immunization officer.“We are encouraging the private sector to contribute in capacity augmentation. We have given the cold chain specifications to the corporate affairs ministry and the heavy industry ministry so that industries can know what they need to build,” said union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. Cold storages, Bhushan points out, are being set up maintaining geographical equity. “Once you plot the 29000 available cold storages on map, you realize where all we need to have more cold storage facilities. We also don’t require cold storages as long as we can easily transport vaccines to the last point by road,” he adds. Dry as a cold desert Nearly all districts in India possess these super stores. But their existing capacities will fall short when the vaccines start arriving. “We can’t pack these fridges with vaccines; 25% space has to be kept vacant for circulation of the cold air. Also, we need to keep our regular vaccines,” added Dr. Sinha.Indeed, public health systems around India will have to keep the universal vaccination programme going; this is, after all, the lifeline for millions of children and pregnant mothers. But this also means that the Centre and the states can tap only 150,000 out of 239,000 vaccinators. “If everyone joins the Covid vaccine administration measure, how can we run the regular pulse polio or BCG camps?” a senior official involved in the vaccination drive asked. Unlike domestic refrigerators, both WIF and WIC have shelves all along their inside walls to store the vaccines. They are as dry as a cold desert, powered by two powerful compressors, and people can walk inside to take out vaccines or add fresh stock. Stepping inside a WIF is akin to taking a walk outside in Antarctica, albeit in summer and on a good day. There’s a basketful of fat, thermal jackets, trousers and gloves kept beside these vaccine vaults. Such walk-in refrigerators are easy to install or dismantle but not available at all nodes of the vaccine network. The smaller centres have deep-freezers and ice-lined refrigerators, the mini versions of the WIF and WIC. They offer same range of temperatures as their big brothers, but are easier to install. And they are easy to identify too — all freezers have blue bodies and all refrigerators, white ones. The larger vaccination centres, where people will be vaccinated, will have these mini-freezers and refrigerators. In other sites, especially mobile or pop-up ones, small cold boxes lined with ice packs, will come in handy. These cold boxes are the ones pulse polio vaccinators carry in their door-to-door campaigns. But states aren’t just counting what they have — they are adding more. At the seminar room in Patna’s new secretariat, the state’s principal secretary of health Pratyaya Amrit waves a list of additional cold chain infrastructure required for the state. “We require 8 WICs, 2 WIFs, 432 ice-lined refrigerators and 549 deep freezers. The centre has assured us of all help.” And once he gets them, Amrit also has a plan to deal with a quintessential developing-world problem, power cuts. The temperature tracker app In the US, United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx Corp. have devised systems to track and measure in real-time, for each individual vaccine pallet, metrics such as temperature, light exposure and motion. India, too, will have a somewhat similar protocol to track real-time the location of delivery vans carrying vaccines, stock positions and the people being vaccinated. The Central government will closely monitor all vital data. But while FedEx and UPS don’t have to face power cuts in Europe or the US, uninterrupted power is not available in every part of India. “We have individual generators attached to each and every WIF and WIC,” said Amrit, “to ensure a steady flow of electricity”. There’s also a small black box with a digital panel perched on the wall above the deep freezers and ice-lined refrigerators in the room at the Muzaffarpur hospital. The labels suggest these were given by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the national health mission. These black boxes or temperature alert machines, flash the temperature of the refrigerator it is attached to. But its utility doesn’t end here. Ram Ratan, the AIIMS-educated state programme officer for immunization, summons a hospital employee who takes out his mobile phone, opens an app and shows the details of the real-time temperatures of each one of the vaccine storages. “There will be an alert if the temperature rises. We will know immediately and take appropriate steps,” said the employee. Ratan added that he can “monitor all vaccine vaults across Bihar with the help of this, sitting in Patna.” But to store the vaccines, states have to get them first. The supply chain At the crowded Basant Vihar restaurant (a favourite of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar), Dr. NK Sinha, the state immunization officer, recalls how the premier Rajdhani Express had to be requisitioned to deliver polio vaccines to the state in 1995. India already has a detailed plan on the supply chain for Covid-19 vaccines even though no vaccines have got approval from the Indian drug regulators so far. To be sure, transporting vaccines will be easier than storing them. All possible vaccine candidates for India, from Serum Institute of India’s Covishield to Pfizer Inc.’s mRNA vaccine will require 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius temperature for transportation. Covishield, developed by the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca Plc., can be stored, transported and handled at 2 degrees to 8 degrees, BioNTech SE and Pfizer’s vaccines need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, but can be kept for up to five days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. The same temperature can keep Moderna’s product stable for 30 days but if it needs to be stored for longer, the vaccine requires a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius. The Gamaleya vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. Much of the long-distance movement of the vaccines in India will be by air. The last mile transport is likely to be over the road. Today’s India boasts of 137 airports covering all 28 states and eight Union territories and as of March 2017 the road network runs over 5.8 million kilometres, a significant expansion of the country’s transport capacity from the early years of economic liberalization. Indian Railways, too, has nine refrigerated parcel vans but they are unlikely to be used, according to officials. From airports, refrigerated vans and insulated vaccine cars will take the quickest possible route and maintain strict temperature controls to deliver the vials at designated points. The vaccines will be treated like VIPs and will receive police protection during transportation. The centre’s guideline to this effect to the states says: “Vaccine safety need to be ensured during storage, transportation and delivery of vaccine with sufficient police arrangements so that there are no leakages in the delivery system.” Every state has made elaborate preparations already. Bihar, according to a power point presentation by the principal secretary of health Amrit, has one that details every part of the plan — from picking up the vials at the airport, sending them to storage, then moving them across the state. “The vaccine pallets will come to the state vaccine store in refrigerated vaccine vans. The same vehicle will be used to send them to regional vaccine stores (Bihar has 10 such stores),” said Amrit. “The regional centres will send the consignment to all the district vaccine stores in insulated vaccine vans (smaller vans that carry the vials in cold boxes).” These vans will take the vaccines to designated cold chain points, the final storage destination before the vaccine pallets are sent to vaccination sites. At every level, right from the production lines to the jabs, the Union government will keep a close eye. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan described the transportation model as the hub and spoke method and said, “the entire programme will be monitored by the central government. The discussions and debate For Bhushan and other officials involved in Covid-19 management at the Centre, weekend breaks have become a rare luxury. According to an official, “for the past five months, there are at least five-six meetings daily related to Covid management over different echelons of the central government.” Reviews with states, inter-ministerial or intra-ministerial discussions, meetings with cabinet secretary or the Prime Minister’s Office dominate the long days of the Covid-19 managers of the Narendra Modi government. India is yet to sanction emergency authorization to any vaccine at the time of writing this article, but way back in July, when Covid-19 vaccine trials entered a defining stage worldwide, Indian authorities started preliminary discussions on a wide range of issues, from logistics to ethics, to set the stage for a smooth supply and effective use of a vaccine when it is ready. A month later, On August 8, the cabinet secretariat formed an expert committee comprising representatives of a host of ministries and institutions to oversee all aspects of its Covid-19 vaccine plan, from identification of the vaccine to buying to financing the purchase to distribution and administration. “The expert group or Negvac led by member Niti Ayog Dr. VK Paul doesn’t have any fixed schedule for meeting. It summons a meeting as and when required. It doesn’t even have a WhatsApp group for members to keep in touch daily. For them, landlines and webinars are the most effective medium of interactions,” a member of the panel said on condition of anonymity. Negvac is short for the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration Prime Minister Modi held a series of meetings with the state chief ministers and two all-party meetings over the last six months. He is also regularly briefed on the Covid-19 situation and all aspects of the vaccine plan. On November 28, Modi visited the facilities of Bharat Biotech International Limited, Serum Institute of India and Zydus Cadila Limited to see first hand how these companies were getting along with their vaccine development and manufacturing. But all plans eventually arrive at the same point — administration of the vaccine. The final challenge Sitting next to his supervisor at a small office in Patna’s state vaccine store, a middle-aged official says that neither he nor any of his family members will take the vaccine. His supervisor, who holds a key position in the immunisation programme in the state, looked visibly embarrassed. But there are many who are worried about two unknown enemies that can seriously hamper the prospects of the vaccine plan: misconceptions and rumours. “In rural Bihar, people think Covid is an urban illness. They refuse to believe that it has spread across rural India too,” said Onkar Chand, the social mobilization coordinator in Darbhanga. “And as a result, a large part of the rural population might flatly refuse to take vaccines. Any refusal to take vaccines not only dampens the campaign but also make others sceptical about the vaccine programme” added Dr. NK Sinha. The local administration is aware of this. Muzaffarpur district collector Chandrasekhar Singh accepts that false rumours resulting in a boycott of vaccines is a risk factor that he has thought about a lot. “We plan to do a door-to-door campaign. We will involve influential political leaders as well as religious heads to campaign for us. The information and communication plan is one of the critical areas of the overall Covid programme,” Singh adds. In his last few meetings, apart from reiterating the importance of mask and social distancing to combat Covid-19, the Prime Minister himself has spoken of the need to collectively counter the menace of rumours. Similar rumours in 2018, usually speared through WhatsApp, caused concerns about child-lifting in many parts of the country and resulted in many innocent people being lynched. “There is always a possibility that a recipient might die due to natural causes after taking jabs. But even that can be fuel for the gossip mills,” said a Union government official who asked not to be named. As Prataya Amrit returns for a quick lunch at home, a family member shows a forwarded message in WhatsApp that says, “vaccination will start from tomorrow.” “Just imagine. No vaccine has been decided yet but such rumours have already started spreading.”The Centre’s guideline for the states too, acknowledges the challenge of “ensuring over 1.3 billion people in India receive factual and timely information and updates on vaccine rollout progress and benefits.” . It adds that outreach efforts need to address “public’s anxiety and queries regarding government’s decision for prioritization of vaccine administration, apprehension about the vaccines introduced after a short trial, and fear of adverse events, misconception about vaccine efficacy, rumours and negative narrative in the media / social media space.” But far away from the world of rumours, on a bright December morning, a group of auxiliary nurses at a vaccination centre in Muzaffarpur say they are not worried about false rumours. “We are ready to push Covid vaccines (likely to be intramuscular one, one adds helpfully) when the time comes.” Another demonstrates how the vaccines will be delivered with single-use syringes that automatically disable themselves once used. A third explains how ice boxes must sweat for a few minutes before the vaccines can be kept in them for use at the inoculation centre. India’s Covid-19 managers have many things to worry about, but if these nurses in Bihar are any indication, the administration of the shots isn’t one of them. “When a newborn arrives for BCG or pulse polio, we feel as if its our own child. When people come for Covid vaccines to use, they will be treated like our family members,” smiles Sunita Kumari, one of the nurses, as she prepares a vaccine for a pregnant woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-to-safety-on-the-vaccine-trail/story-FJ2iOS1qbryyzkoOedG9lK.html
22-12-2020||India||Kisan Ekta page taken down due to spam alert after ‘increased activity’, says Facebook||Facebook on Monday said that Kisan Ekta Morcha’s Facebook page was taken down as increased activity on the page had initiated an automated response against spam content. “As per our review, our automated systems found an increased activity on the Facebook page www.facebook.com/kisanektamorcha and flagged it as spam, which violates our Community Standards. We restored the page in less than three hours when we became aware of the context. The review showed that only the Facebook page was affected by the automated systems while the Instagram account remained unaffected,” a company spokesperson said.The social networking faced a massive backlash from civil society after the page, which is run by a farmers’ collective, went down late Sunday evening. It sparked widespread criticism, with farmers saying the move was an attempt to muzzle their voices.It wasn’t immediately clear why the company took down the website purely based on an automated system alert. Hindustan Times on Sunday reported that Kisan Ekta Morcha’s Facebook page, less than five days old, had notched up 75,000 followers. The group collects and collates information from different farmers’ unions and posts them across social media. “Now this is #TooMuchDemocracy. A peaceful protest by #Kissan & @Facebook deletes @Kisanektamorcha Facebook page,” the farmers group tweeted after its Facebook page was taken down. The group also received a restriction on its Instagram account, after which it was not allowed to post videos or photographs. According to Baljeet Singh, the head of the group’s information technology cell, the page was taken down for being in violation of the social media website’s community standards.“We had posted clips countering Narendra Modi’s speech from day before yesterday,” Singh said on Sunday. “Each of his lies was countered with facts and examples. Subsequently, we started a live broadcast with (Swaraj India’s) Yogendra Yadav and in the middle of the broadcast, the page was taken down.” After massive outrage, Facebook later restored the page. “The vast majority of our work fighting spam is done automatically using recognizable patterns of problematic behaviour,” the Facebook spokesperson added. “For example, if an account is posting over and over in quick succession that’s a strong sign something is wrong. However, we also rely on our human review team to work on cases where human expertise is needed to understand the context of a particular situation. In Q3, 2020 out of the 1.9 billion pieces of content removed globally for violating our policies on spam, we restored 74.9 mn pieces of content, when we identified issues ourselves.”A Digital rights activist, however, disagreed with the social networking website’s assessment.Internet Freedom Foundation trustee and lawyer Apar Gupta said the takedown demonstrated faulty processes that ignore user rights, “As per the statement issued by Facebook it is evident that human review is not being conducted prior to its algorithms taking down pages. This clearly indicates that the system itself is faulty and requires oversight as well as clear notice and appeal processes prior to page and account takedowns,” he said.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific Policy Director at Access Now — Facebook’s conduct here shows the tremendous drawbacks of the company’s over-reliance on supposedly automated systems to handle issues relating to content governance. The use of automated tools to regulate content should only be for exceptional cases; not a norm. The actions of platforms have real world consequences on those seeking to exercise their fundamental rights. Despite its repeated statements about the importance of India to it, it does not appear that Facebook is engaged in open, transparent discussion with civil society in India on its practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-ekta-page-taken-down-due-to-spam-alert-after-increased-activity-says-fb/story-pNiE5otiEq5LhxqZ8duWRI.html
22-12-2020||India||Motilal Vora (1927-2020)‘He was an ideal example of a political worker and leader ’||Motilal Vora was an ideal example of what a political worker and a leader should be. He was always committed to his work and to performing the duties assigned to him from time to time. My relations with him goes back to 1966, when he was not even in the Congress party. Even yesterday, I had sent a bouquet of flowers for him. He was happy to see that and had told his family members that he wanted to talk to me. That was our friendship. Voraji patiently listened to the grievances of Congress workers and would extend a helping hand to everyone in whatever way he could. He was perhaps among the few politicians who held a post – either in a government or the party – throughout his career. He was perhaps also the only person in India who was elevated from a minister of state to a chief minister. Voraji was known for striking a perfect balance between different leaders. Despite late leader Arjun Singh proposing his name as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, he maintained a fine relationship with Shyama Charan Shukla and Madhavrao Scindia as well. There was a time when the people of Madhya Pradesh would describe the state government as “Moti-Madhav Express.”Digvijaya Singh would often narrate how he, as the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, would send party delegations to Voraji (then chief minister) daily with demands and grievances and how he would send them back happy. Along with assurances, Voraji would offer them tea also. He would never say no to anything. It was these qualities that endeared him to all. There are many political events in which he played an important part, but I don’t want to get into those details. Everybody remembers how he {as the state governor then} administered the oath to Mayawati as Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 1995. He had friends and admirers across political parties. In a way, Voraji was a symbol in himself, and this is what the younger generation should learn from him. It is a great loss but I will add that he lived life to the full and passed away without much suffering. It is a personal loss to me. I have lost a good friend today.

22-12-2020||India||MP govt cautious over EC order in probe against officers, ministers||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Madhya Pradesh is proceeding cautiously on a communique from the Election Commission of India (ECI)suggesting a probe of at least three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, a state administrative service official and several politicians for alleged use of unaccounted money in the 2019 general elections. The politicians include three ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government and two ex-ministers whose names surfaced during income tax raids conducted on two aides of the then chief minister Kamal Nath and certain others associated with them in connections with allegations that they had made “extensive use of unaccounted cash” during the elections, according to officials who requested anonymity and an official communique by the ECI, which asked the government to register a case after a probe by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW). The communique has been posted on its website.What has worried the state government are the names of several politicians of the ruling party, including the ministers, in a report by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) submitted to the state government last week; some are said to be eyeing vacant cabinet berths,the officials said. The CBDT report may delay a planned expansion of the cabinet, BJP functionaries said. Names of these officers and politicians came to light during the raids against the political advisor to the then chief minister Kamal Nath, RK Miglani, the then officer on special duty to Nath, Praveen Kakkad, and certain others associated with the two, in Bhopal and Delhi in April 2019, as per the I-T department. The ECI’s official communiqué said: “After deliberations, Commission directed to forward copy of the report of CBDT dated 28.10.2020 to the chief electoral officer, Madhya Pradesh, to lodge a criminal action before designated authority, e.g. Economic Offence Wing, State of Madhya Pradesh against concerned for violation as per extant Electoral and other relevant laws. Commission has also directed union home secretary to initiate appropriate departmental action against All India Service officers and also to chief secretary, Madhya Pradesh for similar action against state officer.” When asked by journalists about the findings of the report, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said: “The law will take its own course and nobody will be spared.” Home minister Narottam Mishra spoke in a similar vein. He said: “ECI and CBDT sent the report to the chief electoral officer and chief secretary in the state after an investigation. As directed by the ECI, the matter is being forwarded to EOW for further action.

UGC had specified in its guidelines for the academic calendar of 2020-21 that because of the pandemic, first-year undergraduate and postgraduate students and their parents were facing financial hardship and they should be charged no money for cancelling admission up to December 31.In a letter dated December 17 to vice chancellors of all universities, UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said the regulator had received scores of complaints and submissions claiming non-refund or partial refund by colleges of money they had already paid for admission.“To be crystal clear, the entire lees including all charges be refunded in totality (zero cancellation charges) on account of cancellation/ migration up to 31.12.2020. Thereafter, on cancellation/ withdrawal of admissions up to 31.12,2020, the entire fee collected from a student be refunded in full after deduction of not more than Rs. 1,000 as processing fee,” said the letter by Jain.Jain said the Commission had been receiving several references in the form of Right to Information applications, complaints, public grievances or court cases on non-refund of fees by universities/ institutions in violation of the UGC guidelines. T“The Commission has taken a very serious view of such complaints. Most of these complaints have come from the students who have taken admission in private or self-financing universities and deemed to be universities and later opted out for one or the other reasons,” Jain said.The UGC asked universities to ensure compliance with its directive, warning that they could face punitive action if they didn’t. Such action could include a recommendation for withdrawal of affiliation, withholding of grants, declaring a college or varsity ineligible for grants or publishing a notice informing the public about violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/refund-full-fee-if-admission-is-cancelled-ugc-tells-varsities/story-PME8uMKbxlNDe40zgt8SXI.html
22-12-2020||India||India should not worry about our ties with Pakistan, says Russia||Russia on Monday said it was committed to developing its relationship with Pakistan although India should have no concern about such moves as they are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and aimed at ensuring regional stability. Moscow’s efforts to develop relations with Islamabad fit in with the basic values of the strategic partnership between India and Russia, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev told a news briefing. His deputy, Roman Babushkin, said Russia’s ties with Pakistan were “independent in nature” and the two sides have a trade and economic agenda. “If you take a look at the substance of our ties with Pakistan and the priorities we are committed to, you could easily see they would correspond to the basic values of Russia and India, especially the privileged and strategic partnership – issues like regional stability, transparency, fighting terror, drugs and crime first and foremost,” Kudashev said in response to a question on a perceived uptick in ties between Moscow and Islamabad. Economic cooperation between Russia and Pakistan, Kudashev said, was a key to progress and predictability. “Our ties with Pakistan are naturally no exception to the values of our ties with India,” he added. Babushkin said India should not be worried about Russia’s commitment to respecting the sensitivities of any other country. “Russia is very cautious when it comes to respect of sensitivities but at the same time we regard our relations with Pakistan are independent in nature and we also have a bilateral trade and economic agenda. We are quite committed to developing this relationship further, including from the point of view of Pakistan being a partner country in the framework of the SCO,” he said. SCO comprises eight member-states -- India, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan;“The basic principle of Russian foreign policy is to have bilateral relations not aimed against any other country. This is the very important principle we are following when it comes to cooperation with every country in the world, including Pakistan,” he added. Babushkin said a recent exercise between the Russian and Pakistani armies focused on counter-terrorism. “Such kind of collaboration, including experience sharing and capacity building, is quite natural for all SCO member states. We have reached an advanced level of exercises with India including the three services. All of that is important from the point of view of how we proceed to ensure regional stability. Promoting dialogue and a unified agenda are also instrumental for the same reasons,” he said. India has in the past expressed concerns about possible arms deals between Russia, the supplier of a majority of weapon systems used by Indian armed forces, and Pakistan. In response to an another question, Babushkin said Russia and India closely consult each other on the situation in Afghanistan. The current negotiations between the Taliban and the US are being conducted on the basis of agreements between the two sides. Russia wants these negotiations to be successful and lead to a “forward-looking solution in Afghanistan” so that the war-torn country can have a “maximum possible representative government” that takes care of the interests of all national and ethnic groups, Babushkin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-should-not-worry-about-our-ties-with-pak-says-russia/story-T0ZBWTQzgjRARrnwT6jHbM.html
22-12-2020||India||Despite US sanctions threat, S-400 deal ‘advancing well’||Russia’s ongoing deals with India for military hardware, including for S-400 air defence systems, are “advancing well” despite the threat of potential US sanctions, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev said on Monday. There can be “good progress” if decisions related to the procurement of Ka-226 helicopters and production of AK-203 assault rifles are expedited, and Russia is prepared to share the most advanced technologies with India in line with the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” {Self-Reliant India} initiatives, Kudashev told a news briefing. His remarks came against the backdrop of the US imposing sanctions last week on Turkey over its $2.5-billion deal with Russia for the S-400 air defence system under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). US officials have warned that India’s acquisition of high-tech Russian systems could attract similar sanctions. “As far as current deals [are] concerned, we are advancing well, including with S-400 supplies. If relevant decisions to start work related to Ka-226 helicopters and AK-203 rifles production are expedited, soon we will see good progress, which is especially important due to deep interests expressed by the Indian armed forces,” Kudashev said. India and Russia signed a $5.4-billion deal for five S-400 systems in October 2018, and the first batch is expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. All deliveries will be completed in a five-year period. Asked specifically about the threat of US secondary sanctions against India under CAATSA, Kudashev said Russia, like India, doesn’t recognise sanctions other than those imposed by the UN Security Council. Roman Babushkin, chargé d’affaires at the Russian embassy, described US secondary sanctions on arms purchases from Russia as “illegal tools of unfair competition and pressure”. Kudashev said both Russia and India were disciplined members of the international arms control regimes and their bilateral military-technical cooperation will not introduce “any threat to the regional balance”. “As far as sanctions are concerned, it’s hard to predict and let the Biden administration first announce publicly its plans and foreign policy vision. We do not recognise or welcome unilateral sanctions as a tool...of inter-state or international relations, sanctions other than those applied by the UN Security Council, this is also the case of Turkey,” he said. “As far as India is concerned, we share the same platform. India’s position is crystal clear – no sanctions are acknowledged other than those applied by the UN Security Council. Whatever the future is, we believe that our ties will stand the coming challenges,” he added. Kudashev said the “unparalleled defence cooperation” between India and Russia was based on “real exchange of technologies and joint ventures, helps India to advance local production and expand its military export potential”. The two sides are working on co-development and co-production of equipment, components and spare parts, improving the after sales service system and deepening localisation programmes. Russia is also looking forward to participating in Aero-India 2021, where it will showcase the Su-57, Su-35 and MiG-35 combat jets, Ka-52, Ka-226, Mi-17B-5 and Mi-26 helicopters, and the S-400 and Buk missile systems. “We are ready to share almost everything we have, doubly so since the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives and the emergence of the military-technical economic corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh create especially favourable conditions. There are no obstacles to our cooperation,” Kudashev said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-us-sanctions-threat-s-400-deal-advancing-well/story-LsDbYrG8l1htstXJXH6YmK.html
22-12-2020||India||Maharashtra orders night curfew for 15 days, quarantine for travellers from abroad||The Uddhav Thackeray government has decided to impose a seven-hour night curfew in cities across Maharashtra from Tuesday for the next 15 days and order travellers from abroad to quarantine themselves. The curfew will be effective in all municipal corporation areas across the state between 11 pm and 6 am till January 5.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, however, asserted that the night curfew did not imply that people couldn’t step out at all. “There is a difference between a night curfew and a lockdown. While in a lockdown, individuals cannot step out of their homes. In a curfew, more than 5 people cannot assemble outside during the specified hours. So, offices that function overnight or something like dairy transportation can still operate. Taxis, cars and auto rickshaws will also run just like before,” he said.ALSO WATCH | Covid update: Oxford vaccine shows 70% efficacy; Maharashtra’s travel curb Chahal added that the curfew was being imposed due to violations of social distancing norms. “Even on Sunday night, our teams visited some nightclubs and found violations. This is why the decision of night curfew had to be taken. This is not a normal new year which is why we cannot have normal celebrations. The curfew is being imposed to ensure that such violations are not repeated,” he said.The Maharashtra government has also decided to keep all travellers from European and Middle-Eastern countries in institutional quarantine for 14 days. People landing at the state’s airports from other countries will be asked to home quarantine themselves, the state government said.Travelers coming from European and Middle-East countries should be kept at institutional quarantine facilities. Their RT-PCR tests should be conducted on the 5th or 7th day and they will be allowed to go home after completion of the quarantine period.“Municipal commissioners have been directed to develop institutional quarantine facilities at hotels or by developing temporary facilities close to airports,” the chief minister said.The decision was taken in a high level meeting called by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, a precautionary measure considering the new variant of the Sar-CoV-2 found in Britain that is believed to spread faster than the previous strains. Thackeray said the government and people had to be vigilant for the next 15 days.“A total of five flights are arriving from the United Kingdom by tomorrow night when the Centre’s order to suspend UK flights will come into force. Nearly 1,000 passengers arriving in these flights will be quarantined in hotels. We have arranged 2,000 rooms (1,000 rooms in luxury hotels and 1,000 rooms in budgeted hotels) in hotels across the city. BEST buses will be used to transport them to the hotels,” Chahal said.“If any of the passengers are found to be symptomatic, they will be directly shifted from the airport to GT hospital where beds have already been reserved,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-orders-night-curfew-for-15-days-quarantine-for-travellers-from-abroad/story-azpo1rM37Ma9PHoD516SYM.html

22-12-2020||Editorials||The PM’s message of inclusion||On Sunday morning, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi paid a surprise visit to Delhi’s Gurudwara Rakab Ganj Sahib to pay tributes to Guru Tegh Bahadur. He tweeted that it was an honour that the 400th birth anniversary of the Guru would be marked in his government’s tenure — and pledged to celebrate it in a historic manner. The PM’s symbolic appearance at a gurudwara comes at a time when farmers from Punjab, largely but not exclusively Sikh, have expressed their firm opposition to the Centre’s agrarian reforms. The protests have acquired an element of identity-based grievance too, and while policy differences are legitimate in a democracy, it is crucial that they don’t assume a divide which runs on community lines. And that is why the PM’s gesture was significant, for it indicated that the reforms were not targeted at a community, which is an integral part of what constitutes the Indian nation, and the government respected Sikh religion and heritage. On Tuesday, PM Modi addressed the centenary celebrations of the iconic Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) — an institution that has contributed enormously in bringing modern education to Indians, largely but not exclusively Muslims, over this period. AMU is often the target of the foot soldiers of extreme Hindutva groups for its so-called Muslim character, and the institution has been unsure of its future. That is why the PM’s unequivocal tribute to AMU and its role in nation-building and deepening India’s relations with the world; his emphasis on the non-discriminatory approach of his government’s policies, including welfare schemes; and reiteration that the constitutional rights of every citizen are secure is significant. At a time when Muslims feel a degree of insecurity about their place in Indian democracy, the PM’s words matter. Sikhs and Muslims — along with other minorities — help make up the cultural mosaic that is India. As they fulfil their duties as Indian citizens and exercise their rights — including the right to protest, organise, assemble peacefully — they must always have a sense that India is as much theirs as that of members of a religion that may constitute the majority, irrespective of differences on policies and legislations. The PM clearly recognised this and has reached out and reassured the country’s minorities at a time of ferment. It is now important that this message is internalised down the chain, both in government and in the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-pm-s-message-of-inclusion/story-l3DfnMilJGEhSYdghWkE9M.html
22-12-2020||Editorials||The rise in extreme climate events||More than 75% of India’s districts are hotspots of extreme climate events and are bearing the lethal effects of a rapidly-changing microclimate with loss of property, livelihoods and lives, according to a study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). The report notes that while India witnessed 250 extreme climate events between 1970 and 2005, the country recorded 310 extreme weather events after 2005. That India has been at the receiving end of the climate crisis is known. According to the Climate Risk Index, 2018, the country jumped nine places in climate vulnerability rankings, and was ranked the fifth-most climate-vulnerable country in the world. Storms are escalating into cyclones, droughts are affecting more than half the country, and floods of an unprecedented scale are causing catastrophic damage. The Centre has done well in treating climate as a priority issue — but the scale of the destruction of lives, livelihoods and critical infrastructure warrants more action.It is not just the Centre; states have a key role too. The State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) need upscaling and capacity enhancement. Many pilot projects on resilience are taking place; the effective ones need to be replicated quickly. There has to be a sharper focus on building institutional and human capacity and district-level localisation of SAPCCs so that the authorities can respond to changing climate challenges quickly and effectively. The report provides yet another warning that business-as-usual isn’t sustainable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-rise-in-extreme-climate-events/story-3c5rHgQZq31YG6XCNq6vUK.html
