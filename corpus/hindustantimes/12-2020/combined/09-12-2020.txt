Part of this is because there is divergence in information from official sources, academics and “unofficial” sources, and a difference in opinion on the timeliness and completeness.Press releases tell us that vaccines are performing well. On December 2, the United Kingdom (UK)’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency became the first regulator to grant temporary authorisation based on a phase III trial, to Pfizer and BioNTech’s mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine. On December 7, the UK began the process of administering vaccines. Results from the Astra-Zeneca/University of Oxford vaccine, based on a chimpanzee adenoviral vector, well exceed the 50% efficacy requested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and regulators, leading to the reasonable assumption that most vaccines that are based on the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 will be successful.In India, Pfizer has applied to the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation for emergency approval, under the provisions of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rule, 2019, which allow the national regulatory authority to waive clinical trials. Even if Pfizer is granted approval, it is unlikely that this will be a vaccine that can be widely deployed because it requires storage at -70 degrees Celsius. Given the limited capacity of even cold storage at -20 degrees Celsius as required by the Moderna vaccine, it is likely that India’s national immunisation system, and those of other low- and middle-income countries, will opt for vaccines that can be stored at the more widely available facilities that hold vaccines at 2-8 degrees Celsius. If vaccines that will not be used for national immunisation programmes are given limited or full approval, the ability to purchase vaccines will differentiate sections of society between those with purchased access and those who must wait for the government to provide vaccines. This situation already exists for many vaccines, such as influenza or chickenpox where vaccines are available in the private sector. Open and transparent discussions about the role of the private sector and access to vaccines are essential for a clearer picture of what lies ahead.In terms of production capacity, figures vary, but a survey of 113 manufacturers by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and partners between March and June 2020 estimated that global capacity was two to four billion doses by the end of 2021. Vaccine production landscapes tend to be slow to change, but much more optimistic figures are now being projected, with the Duke Global Health Innovation Center stating that purchase of more than nine billion doses is in discussion and India alone already has an advance market commitment of 1.6 billion doses. This figure does not align with the government’s announcement of financial commitments to vaccines or plans for immunisation, and company announcements of their production capacity and commitment not just to India, but to global supply through the COVAX facility.Even if the figures are correct, and India will have access to 1.6 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, there are significant challenges to getting these doses to where they are needed. The WHO has six rights of supply-chain management for immunisation, which are right product, right quantity, right condition, right place, right time and right cost. Making sure that all of these logistics are in place requires permutations of product packed volume, temperature for transport and storage, location of supply and delivery, cycle for vaccination and restocking. Availability of refrigerated transport, security of transport, opportunities for pilferage and replacement with fake products are all very real concerns for which preparation is necessary. To accompany the complexity of storage and supply, which in India will be managed by the National Cold Chain Vaccine Management Resource Centre and the electronic Vaccine Information Network, redeveloped as COVIN, we will need to train vaccinators, have additional supplies needed for immunisations, prepare for immunisation sessions and establish systems for waste disposal. And all that, as we develop and use methods to identify and track individuals who need the vaccine.India does not have an adult immunisation programme beyond the tetanus/diphtheria vaccination for pregnant women. Hence, in the prioritisation lists that have been announced, identifying and reaching all priority groups will be a challenge. States have been asked to list public and private health care workers, and this is feasible and being done. However, moving beyond health care workers and other essential workers, however defined, to the elderly and those with co-morbidities as indicated in official announcements will be difficult and there is a need to prepare for falsified documents and fraud. As important as the issue of delivering vaccines to those prioritised, and not those who try to beat the system is the global concern for migrants and refugees who might be excluded from vaccination based on lack of residency documentation. Ensuring that both doses of a two-dose schedule are delivered is also a challenge since drop-outs are already known to be an issue, particularly for the most vulnerable populations, for infant immunisation. This is likely to much greater with adult immunisation.Not all problems can be anticipated, but we have experience with strengthening immunisation and with the conduct of campaigns, particularly in the last decade. While the government is using that experience to plan for a range of product, supply and logistic scenarios, sharing plans and developing the right partnerships is important, because in this enterprise, all of us are stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/navigating-the-vaccine-challenge/story-qVaZbfDC7mLDYdRkoBhkDI.html
09-12-2020||News||How the agriculture reforms finally liberate farmers | Opinion||In early April 2019, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) released a Farmers Manifesto for Freedom. It was a progressive document, and said, “Seven decades after India won independence from British colonial rule, the largest section of our population, the farmers, have remained bound by the chain of laws and regulations”.The manifesto sought “freedom to trade” and bemoaned that existing laws were restricting farmers from “where, how and at what price they can sell their produce”, and underlined that Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) have only helped in creating “legal monopolies” of a few “licensed traders”, who now have a “stranglehold on farmers”. It called for removal of restriction on land use including “contract farming”, and abolition of “such laws as the APMC and the Essential Commodities Act”. It even sought facilitation of “future trading” in all agricultural commodities.APMCs were started in central India during British rule to force cotton farmers to sell their produce only to State-run markets so that cotton mills in England could have cheap raw material from India. After Independence, the powerful rural lobby ensured that this legacy continued. It helped farmers in the initial years when Indian agriculture was in dire straits until the Green Revolution. But today, as the BKU manifesto highlights, APMCs have become dens of ”middlemen” from whom the farmers have to be ”saved”.This is what the three recent agriculture reform acts intend to do. Strangely, the same BKU is on the streets leading the so-called farmers agitation against the reforms. They argued earlier that the farmers were “bound by the chains” of British-era laws. Now, they argue that the same chains should be restored because the farmers may, in future, be bound by the chains of private agri-entrepreneurs.Incidentally, through a tweet on April 4, 2019, the BKU leadership had expressed happiness about the Congress and Rahul Gandhi adopting ”some parts” and said, ”Let us see what the BJP and Narendra Modi adopt”. The Congress is now supporting BKU leadership’s duplicity, while the Modi government is working for the implementation of its manifesto. The acts are the most historic and boldest reforms in agriculture since Independence. The farmer is the only private producer in India who didn’t have freedom to sell until now. “Farmers of India! You are henceforth the masters of the harvest”, said Ram Manohar Lohia in 1963 articulating his vision for agricultural reforms. Modi has transformed that vision into a reality.The APMC regime was an anomaly, with farmers forced to sell their produce only to APMCs. For political reasons, government after government, in states as well as at the Centre, went on extending the Minimum Support Price regime leading not only to a distorted pricing regime but also the production pattern. The new laws end that anomaly. They essentially extend three benefits to farmers. They are now free to sell their produce wherever they get better prices — in mandis or to private procurers anywhere. They can now price their produce as per the demand. They can now enter into agreements with corporate and private agribusinesses and engage even in future trading.Opposition to such historic reforms is suicidal for the farming community. Yet, some sections of the farmers are on the streets blockading Delhi arteries. There could be some genuine apprehensions, such as the need for an MSP protection in case private businesses try to exploit farmers. The government has been open to discussion on such concerns. But the propaganda that the new acts make the farmers slaves to private businesses is far-fetched. The acts protect the land of the farmer from any kind of exploitation even if the farmer defaults.The agitation is led by a section of the farmers, misled by false propaganda. On the other hand, the majority of the tilling class, Dalits and the poor, are conspicuous by their absence. The government must engage with the farmers directly and explain the benefits. A couple of amendments could be considered, but anything beyond that would be detrimental to the future of agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-agriculture-reforms-finally-liberate-farmers/story-mB1fDyTdiaFA6LYxwBWW1K.html
09-12-2020||News||Decoding India’s latest diplomatic push in the West Asian theatre | Opinion||Over the past month, New Delhi has orchestrated a significant push to strengthen relations with the Gulf. India’s Army chief General MM Naravane’s visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited Bahrain and UAE earlier, and further visits by top officials to Qatar, Oman and Kuwait are to be undertaken.Long gone are the days when Indian diplomats scoffed at postings in the region, which were looked down upon for being work largely based around Indian migrant workers, sans the frills and thrills of the cinematic view of international diplomacy. Today, India is central to the economic and geopolitical thinking of Asia and global economics and politics. This has reflected throughout the Covid-19 crisis, with New Delhi’s dispatch of rapid medical response teams to Kuwait and emergency nurses to UAE, and talks at the highest levels, first digitally and now in person, on issues such as health diplomacy.The recent flurry of diplomacy between the regions, while being a continuation of trends of the past few years, is also centred on two major fronts. The first, of course, is the fact that as positive news of vaccines now rolling out across the world means that preparations to normalise global economics, commerce, migration have begun. The larger Gulf region is home to nearly seven million Indian workers, and one of India’s major tasks is to try and manage what is essentially a mini country-like population outside its own borders. According to estimates from May, over 300,000 Indian workers had registered to return from the Gulf as the pandemic ravaged global economics and trade, with unprecedented job losses.Though India prepared to rehabilitate the returning workers and put their skill sets to use domestically to an extent, a planned return and normalisation of migrant workers to and from the Gulf is critical not only for hundreds of thousands of people to return to employment in the region, but also because this employment generates a significant chunk of the nearly $80 billion in remittances that the Indian economy enjoys every year. This cash flow is critical, and its health depends on the normalisation of employment opportunities in the Gulf which relies on both skilled and semi-skilled labour from countries such as India.Second, it is even more pertinent today to push India’s case in countries such as UAE, which recently orchestrated a ban on 13 countries for reissuance of visas. This list includes Pakistan. The reasons for the ban were not aired overtly by Abu Dhabi; however, analysts believe that security reasons were the driving force behind this measure. In private, officials in the Gulf have often stated that workers from countries such as India are increasingly preferred due to their high level of qualifications and the low threat of extremism and ideological indoctrination both from their native society and how they integrate into the Gulf in general. Meanwhile, the ongoing problems between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also offer New Delhi more diplomatic room.Beyond this, India’s diplomacy push in West Asia also comes at a time when arrangements such as the Abraham Accords signed between UAE, Bahrain and Israel are potentially bringing in a new era of geo-political normalisation. Further stability in the Gulf and minimised chances of conflict create a more durable environment for both India’s economic and diaspora interests.While successfully balancing relations between Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia power blocks, New Delhi’s affinity for this Gulf outreach is rooted in geopolitical and geo-economic realities. Despite certain roadblocks such as an often aloof view of India’s concerns regarding migrant workers by the Gulf, and the concerns of certain Gulf nations regarding minority rights issues in India (which some capitals have raised privately), long-term interests for both sides have trumped short-term issues of contention, paving the way for robust development of relations across the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/decoding-india-s-latest-diplomatic-push-in-the-west-asian-theatre-opinion/story-RoTBWrjp3P7jdMvDfAxtIN.html
09-12-2020||News||The Indian economy is bouncing back | Opinion||“You can’t discover light by analysing the dark.” The quote by Wayne Dyer resonates with the four-month episode of the great economic fall that followed the pandemic, with predictions of a gory climax. Critics claimed that it would take more than one or two years for India to reverse the Q1 23.9% GDP contraction. The last four months, however, have witnessed a desirable twist; a flush of optimism for businesses, governments and the financial markets, brought in by a 7.5% contraction in Q2 — better than most street estimates. This figure beats the global average, where according to an analysis by State Bank of India, 49 economies declined at an average of 12.4%.Going by the latest trends and government forecasts, India’s economy is likely to return to pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the current fiscal year, which is much earlier than expected. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has predicted a positive growth in the second half of FY21. Take a look at the recently published Q2 data — manufacturing PMI is above 50 for the fourth straight month; the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached 89.2 last month, only 11 percentage points lower than pre-Covid-19 levels; growth in other trends such as foreign policy investment, foreign direct investment (FDI) and corporate bond market inflows point to strong investor faith in India’s economic resilience. Besides, upwards revisions by rating agencies in India’s GDP forecast are all telling the same story — that we have kicked off the rebound phase.This recovery sentiment has been buoyed largely by the bold leadership of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, and frequent policy interventions by the central government. Over the last eight months, the government has not just expanded the ambit of its Covid-19 response strategy by pooling in massive resources for virus control and acquiring vaccination, but has simultaneously employed the Keynesian prescription for recession, ie spending (worth ₹20 lakh crore) to boost aggregate demand. This reflected in the recently-announced stimulus package, which focused on resetting demand by introducing new employment schemes for the formal sector workforce. It is worth noting that unemployment levels are currently on a decline; the 6.7% unemployment rate for September was lower than the pre-Covid-19 level of 7.6% in February. Besides, fiscal stimulus and tax rebates for growth-critical sectors, such as housing, would have spillover effects, thus indirectly boosting demand-led growth.Looking at all three stimulus packages, it is clear that the government’s fiscal response has been calibrated, where it has made judicious choices in spending, especially with regard to continuation or expansion of certain schemes. The one that stands out is the extension of the 100% credit guarantee scheme to 26 stressed sectors. Similarly, incentives to firms through the expansion of production linked incentive (PLI) schemes worth ₹1.46 lakh crore for 10 new sectors will give a boost to the manufacturing sector, and result in long-term benefits for the economy. A calculated restraint in spending the money of taxpayers is critical in the face of limited fiscal space. What is equally laudable is that the government has stayed on the ball in taking small steps to forge the big picture of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat. While fixing the broken, it also unleashed structural reforms across various sectors that promise far-reaching benefits for the economy. For instance, the liberalisation of the notoriously rigid formal labour market would expedite India’s upward movement in the ease of doing business rankings, and attract further investments. Since 2014, India has moved up 79 positions in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings. Reforms and timely fiscal interventions in other critical sectors are already showing positive results: The Gross Value Added for three sectors (agriculture, manufacturing and utilities) has been positive in Q2, as compared to just one (agriculture) in Q1 this year.This positive sentiment is not just evident in growth indicators, but can be seen among the people as well. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the by-elections in seven states, besides improving its performance to return to power in Bihar. The leitmotif of the government’s economic and policy efforts is to open up more windows for India to gain from the current vacuum in the global supply chain. At the same time, there will be a sustained focus on reforms to enable a conducive environment for start-ups, micro, small and medium enterprises, and other businesses, and propel a global market for local products.For now, the government’s prognosis for the near future is as follows. The first priority is to keep the pandemic spread under control, and thus, eliminate the possibility of facing a second wave of the virus. The second is to sustain the momentum of recovery, so that it enters the positive territory by the end of the third quarter. The Covid-19 battle is proving to be a long-drawn-out one, where all the countries have seen severe output losses this fiscal year. However, with India’s impressive pace of recovery, the declining graph of active Covid-19 cases, and with the vaccination distribution blueprint in place, perhaps, the light at the end of the tunnel is not as far as it seems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-indian-economy-is-bouncing-back-opinion/story-Na5Dw9tTvIRxUu3FmCnAaI.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 pandemic, slowdown hits IIT placements||The economic slowdown due to the pandemic seems to have hit the total number of jobs offered as well as salary packages offered to students at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) this year. It has been a week since the placements at IITs commenced. While the overall pay packages for domestic job roles have witnessed a rise this year, several companies known to offer international job profiles to students every year, have offered either domestic roles or missed out on offering jobs altogether in some IITs compared to 2019-20 placement season.As per the placement report for the first couple of days shared by IIT-Bombay (IIT-B), several companies offered jobs across sectors and the highest annual package of ₹46.41 lakh was offered by Qualcomm. Last year, the highest domestic package received by a student of the institute was ₹32.59 lakhs, by the same company. The highest international package this year was offered by proprietary trading firm Optiver of 1.57 lakh euros per annum (roughly, ₹1.39 crore), slightly lower than the ₹1.54 crore package offered by Microsoft to a student last year.Surprisingly Microsoft, which was known to offer the highest packages and international job offers for three consecutive years, offered only domestic roles to candidates this year.At IIT-Roorkee, 671 students have been offered jobs, both domestic and international, in the first week of placements. The number, however, stood at 747 in the same week last year. As per information shared by the institute, the highest number of jobs were offered by Microsoft India Pvt Ltd, Societe General Global Solution Centre, EXL Service, Goldman Sachs and Oracle India Pvt Ltd. “Higher jobs have been offered in the finance as well as for analytics field this year,” said a spokesperson for IIT-Roorkee.According to a statement shared by IIT-Hyderabad, students of the institute received 222 job offers, including 30 international offers in the first phase of placements which ended on December 6 this year. Last year, the institute had received 36 international job offers in the first phase and 295 jobs overall in the 2019-20 academic year. This year, 116 companies had registered for placements at the institute compared to around 150 in phase one last year. Not a single US-based company registered to offer international posts to students of the institute this time.“We had anticipated a slowdown due to the pandemic and accordingly strengthened our student teams to adapt to the changing scenario. We are glad that the first phase of placements started on this positive note,” said Pradeep Yemula, faculty in-charge (placements) at IIT-Hyderabad.The overall domestic pay packages were on the higher side this year across IITs, especially on the first couple of days. At IIT-Roorkee, the annual package for a domestic role witnessed a rise with a student of the institute being offered Rs 80 lakh per annum, almost 29% higher compared to ₹62.2 lakh offered to a student last year. The number of international job offers, however, witnessed a dip with only three job offers made in the first half of the day compared to 10 and seven that were made last year and the year before last respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-pandemic-slowdown-hits-iit-placements/story-UH2iI0vewfxdSM6392TdGN.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||MCZMA nod to reclaim 21 hectare more for Mumbai coastal road project||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has given its nod to civic body’s proposal for reclaiming additional 21 hectare (ha) area for the coastal road project, allowing the increase in the total length of the road from 9.98km to 10.58km.The proposal was recommended to the Union environment ministry for final clearance after the coastal authority laid down 16 conditions that need compliance by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) while commencing reclamation, as per the minutes of the meeting published on MCZMA’s website on Tuesday. The proposal was presented before MCZMA during a meeting held on October 27 and 28 as directed by the Supreme Court (SC) in October that no additional reclamation could be carried out by BMC until environmental clearance was granted by MCZMA and the environment ministry.“There was a lot of back and forth since the meetings on October 27-28. The final decision to recommend the project was taken on December 2,” said a senior official from the state environment department, requesting anonymity, adding that members took into consideration every aspect (environmental, socio-economic, SC and Bombay high court orders etc.) over a month. “We understood that of the 21 ha proposed reclamation, 14.49 ha is meant for protection measures to build a seawall to curb erosion and reduce intense wave impact while remaining 6.51 ha involves necessary additional reclamation connecting the project along its right of way. Our objective is to ensure the protection of the coastline, and for that it is imperative we have a defence mechanism in the form of this wall. BMC has also been directed to explore how the marine ecosystem can be allowed to propagate in the intertidal area protected by this natural rubble mound wall.”Environmentalist Debi Goenka said, “It is shocking that MCZMA, on the one hand, has quite rightly pointed out that they have no powers to grant post facto clearance in the case of the jetty at Guhagar. Yet, in the case of the coastal road, they have recommended that post facto clearance be granted for the coastal road project.”Among specific recommendations, BMC was directed to prepare an environmental management plan adhering to recommendations by expert bodies in the environmental impact assessment for the project including the protection of corals and safe translocation of the marine organism. BMC had completed coral translocation earlier this month but has sought to translocate any more protected species for further reclamation since they have permission validity from the forest department till December 31, 2020. Other recommendations included protection of the local fishing community’s livelihood from Worli and Haji Ali based on recommendations by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). BMC was also directed to set up an in-house environment management cell with a plan to monitor real-time changes of Mumbai shoreline for the next 15 years to assess erosion and sea-level rise, and also explore the development of an artificial coral reef to conserve marine biodiversity, the minutes read.The coastal road is to be an eight-lane highway connecting Princess Street Flyover in south Mumbai to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and seeks to reduce travel time between south Mumbai and western suburbs by 70%. The total cost of the project as per the proposal read ₹8,429.44 crore.BMC had received coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance in July 2016 for reclaiming 90 ha of the south Mumbai coastline for the project. Now, BMC intends on reclaiming a total of 111 ha for the project and applied for fresh clearances for the 21 ha before MCZMA. As per the 2016 CRZ clearance, 90 ha included 20 ha for constructing the coastal road and 70 ha to be developed as green spaces used as parks, cycle tracks, promenade, butterfly park, bus depots etc. “We will follow all recommendations and ensure the project is completed by July 2023 without any further delay,” said Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of the project.At Priyadarshini Park, the MCZMA has accepted a submission made by senior advocate BA Desai that a water body (lagoon) should not be reclaimed and that the promenade should be constructed in such a way to allow the water to flow beneath it and carry out anti-sea erosion measures as the location was already facing erosion.‘SUBMISSIONS BY ORIGINAL PETITIONERS NOT CONSIDERED’On October 8, SC had directed the BMC not to undertake any reclamation beyond the 90-ha area for the project as mandated by the 2016 CRZ clearance. The SC bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was hearing multiple applications by environment groups challenging the ongoing reclamation alleging that BMC had reclaimed far beyond what was required for the road. The SC allowed BMC to seek CRZ clearance from MCZMA and also directed original writ petitioners (before the Bombay High Court) to raise their concerns. While MCZMA’s minutes had a paragraph each from counsels and environmentalists, petitioners said their written submissions were not dealt with at all. “The MCZMA has not dealt with any of the written representations and the written submissions submitted by the petitioners. They have only dealt with the oral submissions made by us. The written submissions made by us after the meeting were in response to the PowerPoint presentation made by BMC, and even these were not considered,” said Goenka. Representations from petitioners such as Goenka, Nitesh Patil, Shweta Wagh, Stalin D, counsel Zaman Ali, Rishita Tanish, and many others pointed out the reasons why the fresh CRZ clearance should not be issued, that the coastal zone was high risk (a cyclone-prone area), the livelihood of fishers, inadequate traffic studies, and marine biodiversity conservation etc. “BMC has successfully managed to divert the main focus of destruction to this issue of extra 21 ha, which was deliberately introduced to confuse and mislead the judiciary proceedings before the SC,” said Stalin D. Concerning the Priyadarshini Park decision, Goenka said, “This is the same point that we had made about the coastal road itself – there is no need to reclaim the land between the coastal road and the existing roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mczma-nod-to-reclaim-21-hectare-more-for-mumbai-coastal-road-project/story-ic5erYBzqNKBYrybVRVYtM.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government names rural development scheme after NCP chief Sharad Pawar||To commemorate the 80th birthday of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, the state government has decided to name a rural development scheme after him. ‘Sharad Pawar Gram Samruddhi Yojana’ will be implemented under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNRES). The proposal to name the scheme after Pawar was cleared by the state cabinet on Wednesday. Pawar is considered a guiding force of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress. Forming a three-party government was also his brainchild.The works to be undertaken under this scheme will include constructing pakka sheds for cattle, goats and poultry farming. The benefit of the scheme can also be used for nadep composting, a method of organic composting used as alternative farmyard manure, said an official from employment guarantee scheme (EGS) department. The central funds under MGNRES will be utilised through the scheme.“The idea is to create job opportunities for those who are unemployed in rural areas and develop permanent assets for gram panchayats and allied villages. The assets to be developed can be of personal and public use. The scheme will also help in stopping migration from villages due to unemployment,” said another official from the EGS department.“The state government also wants to double the income of farmers by 2022, and the initiative is a step forward to achieve that target,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-names-rural-development-scheme-after-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar/story-WLJ59Dk3jZ99rpv4M99jPI.html
09-12-2020||City||2 property dealers shot dead in north Delhi’s Kamal Vihar||New Delhi: Two men were shot dead by a group of bike-borne men in Kamal Vihar area of north Delhi on Wednesday evening. Police said they had detained one suspect late by Wednesday night. The victims were property dealers and the police suspect the murder was the fallout of enmity over a property dispute.The deceased were identified as Anuj (26) and Anand (27), both residents of Mukundpur. Police said the duo worked as property dealers and also dealt in disputed properties.According to the police, the incident took place around 8pm when both Anand and Anuj were standing close to their house. Witnesses told the police that around 4-5 men arrived there on motorcycles and opened fire on the two men. “As the duo tried to escape, they ran in different directions but were chased and shot dead. Both the men received multiple bullet injuries. As they collapsed, bleeding profusely, the attackers fled the spot on two-wheelers,” said a senior police officer, who wished not to be named.Locals then called the police and reported the matter. Both the men were rushed to a hospital. While Anuj died at the spot, Anand succumbed to his fatal wounds on his way to the hospital.Initial probe revealed that the two men who were attacked worked as property dealers and police suspect that the murder took place following enmity over a property deal. A crime and forensics team was called on the spot for inspection.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said by late evening his teams had detained one of the murder suspects. “A case of murder has been registered at Burari police station. Three separate teams have been formed to track and arrest the suspects. CCTV footages are being checked and the mater id being probed from all the possible angles,” he said.Police are also looking into the recent property deals that the two men were involved in. Their family and friends are also being questioned to find out more about any property dispute the two men were involved in, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-property-dealers-shot-dead-in-north-delhi-s-kamal-vihar/story-IctX086GdvQApY6vFBaxBN.html
09-12-2020||City||In farm stir that has unified, Udasi songs emerge as anthem||Sangrur Never has a protest movement been as inclusive as the ongoing farmers’ stir in which contrasting beliefs as well as differences of caste and religion were shed to unite in the struggle against the new agricultural laws. Singing and raising slogans they have moved on, and the most sung poet of this resistance is the dalit-revolutionary poet Sant Ram Udasi (1939-1986).Even as many young singers and activists compose songs glorifying Punjab’s history and the unity of its peasantry, Udasi, a school teacher, who emerged as the people’s poet from Malwa village of Raisar, is the most popular with protesting farmers. His songs are being sung with zeal at the Singhu and Tikri borders of Delhi. Jasbir Jassi sang this song a decade back and his song is being used in protests by speakers. The song goes as such, Maa dharteye, teri godh nu chann hor bathere Tu magdha rahin ve surja kammian de vehre. (Mother Earth, for your lap, there are million moons; Dear Sun, you should shine on labourers’ abodes.)Singer Ravinder raised the spirits of protesters by singing Udasi’s songs. The lyrics are, Desh hai pyara sanu zindgi pyari nalon, par desh ton pyare ehde log hania, Asi tod deni lahu peeni jok hania (The nation is dearer than life to me, but more than the nation, its people. We will do away with this blood-sucking leech); Jagjit Nikki said, Dilliey dyala dekh, deg ch ubbalda ni, Aje tera dil na thare. (Delhi. Look at Diyala boiling in the cauldron, yet your heart isn’t placated.)“The songs of Udasi are relevant even now. Both old and young respond to them,” says Nikki.Dalit singer Bant Singh, who sang fervent songs of Udasi at the start of farmers’ march at Joga near Mansa, says: “In this movement, there is no Sikh or Hindu, no Jat or Dalit. All Punjabis are in it together and we will fight for our rights.” Commenting on the all-inclusive nature of the protest, Jalandhar-based dalit writer Des Raj Kali adds, “The farmers’ struggle has seen the revolutionary dreams of Udasi’s poetry come alive.

The project was completed in 2007 at a cost of around ₹15 crore.The complex was initially put on auction for ₹197 crore in 2009 and 2013, but in the last two auctions, the reserve price was reduced to ₹157 crore. But despite that, it failed to attract any bidders.The local bodies department has directed the LIT to involve deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma in deciding the new reserve price so that it is not reduced to less than the market value of the property. An LIT official requesting anonymity said the idea to auction the complex as one unit has turned out to be a bad decision. There are two basements for parking, restaurant, coffee shop, bank spaces, 10 showrooms, 38 offices among other facilities in the complex and these should have been auctioned separately, the official added.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said, “The complex has turned out to be a white elephant due to misgovernance and maladministration of the SAD-BJP government. The local bodies department and LIT is making efforts to sell off the property and now a decision has been taken to form a price fixation committee under the chairmanship of the DC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-takers-for-ludhiana-improvement-trust-complex-committee-formed-to-reduce-reserve-price-further/story-P9G1joAMTWwj7gMMWYl7mL.html

They added that the council must send a new question paper for practice, as conducting the mock test with the leaked question paper will not benefit students.A principal, requesting anonymity, said, “I was shocked to find out that the leaked question paper was given to students for practice. Subject teachers have been conducting online coaching classes and holding tests regularly so that maximum students can clear the NTSE. But, this mock test will not benefit students, as they were already aware of the questions. We have prepared the results and many students who scored 70% earlier got more than 85% marks in the test held today. ”NTSE nodal officer Balwinder Kaur, said, “We sent the question papers to school principals and received no such complaint.

09-12-2020||City||Patients reporting back with depression, anxiety post Covid recovery, finds DMCH study||Recovering from the virus seems to be first of the many battles that Covid-19 patients have to fight. A study conducted by the department of psychiatry of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) has revealed that at least 30% of the patients who recovered from the virus reported back with depression while 40% developed symptoms of anxiety. While fighting the virus is a task in itself, many patients had to put up with societal stigma that ended in job losses and alienation, even after they recovered. Prof (Dr) Rupesh Chaudhary of the department of psychiatry said, “Every day, we come across at least two cases of depression that are directly caused due to job loss. Patients report that they were thrown out by their employers on suspicion that they may still end up infecting others.” He added that brain fog, which causes forgetfulness, confusion, impaired attention and memory, is also a common after-effect of Covid-19. “Due to this people are unable to resume their work and hence face a financial crisis which becomes another risk factor for impending psychiatric disorders,” said Dr Chaudhary. Fake news, social media adding to woes While stressing on the judicious use of social media, Dr Chaudhary said that fake news and excess use of social media are also adding to stress and anxiety levels among patients. “If not Covid, fake news about Covid is doing more harm to patients. A lot of patients suffering from sleep disorders due to excessive worry. We have come across cases where people take baths repeatedly, change their clothes four times a day and clean locks and door handles frequently due to fear of catching the infection again. A lot of this stress is caused by the long time they spent in isolation,” said Chaudhary. “These psychological symptoms can trigger the onset of psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, phobias, anger problems, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse, and behavioural changes such as avoiding crowded places and frequent hand washing,” he said. “This in turn can lead to a substantial increase in loneliness, domestic violence, child abuse among other problems,” Dr Chaudhary added. Dr Pankaj Kumar, assistant professor, department of psychiatry, DMCH says, “We are experiencing an upsurge in the cases of anxiety, depression and PTSD among Covid survivors. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has become markedly noticeable as people become obsessed with fear of contamination, excessive worries and apprehensions of being re-infected or becoming a source of spread of infection among their loved ones.” “Stigma against healthcare workers and survivors of the Covid-19 infection has resulted in harassment, discrimination and social isolation. Stigmatised individuals may experience emotional disturbance, anxiety and depression,” he added. Mediation, yoga proving remedial pills Dr Chaudhary said, “Covid-19 pandemic has significantly changed our lifestyles and outlook towards life. We have a tough challenge to prove our survival both in terms of physical and mental wellbeing in this crisis situation, and even after the pandemic is curtailed.” “Some of the essentials for good mental health includes keeping calm, doing yoga and meditation, following the precautions diligently, maintaining social distancing, developing a positive attitude, avoiding excessive screen time and Covid news watching, having a balanced diet and a good sleep, doing some physical activity, not drinking or smoking, maintaining digital connections with friends, trying to get back to routine life and keeping yourself busy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-reporting-back-with-depression-anxiety-post-covid-recovery-finds-dmch-study/story-0JvGaYdthsu4S9oOEigYWO.html
09-12-2020||Noida||Delhi-Noida side at Chilla border opened||People protesting the Centre’s new farm laws on Wednesday evening opened Delhi-Noida road at Chilla border. The farmers said this was done after police assured them that the farmers will not be stopped from coming to Noida from western UP.The Chilla border protest began on December 1 when the protesters blocked Noida-to-Delhi road. On December 5, the protesters blocked Delhi-to-Noida route as well when they came to know that some farmers were stopped at Jewar toll plaza. The Noida-Delhi route remains closed from December 1 till today. For Delhi bound commuters, Noida Police advised them to take the DND Flyway route or Kalindi Kunj route to commute between the two national capital region (NCR) cities. The number of protesters at the Chilla border and the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida has decreased significantly. Only about 20 protesters were seen at the Dalit Prerna Sthal and 40 at the Chilla border. Dr SK Giri, general secretary and spokesperson for BKU (Lok Shakti), said, “We have been protesting for 10 days against the farm laws. We had dispatched most of the protesters to their respective home districts for the nationwide protest on December 8.” At the protest site, the farmers addressed the gathering and vowed to continue their struggle till the demands are met. The farmers also organised a game of tug-of-war with one end supposed to be the government and the other, the protesters. The protesters “won” that game.A group of Samajwadi Party workers on Wednesday marched from GT Road in Dadri and they were arrested and brought to Surajpur police line. Veer Singh Yadav, president Samajwadi Party Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the government had adopted an oppressive means to quell the farmers’ protest. “We have the right to peaceful protest but the government and police are not allowing us. On Wednesday, a group of SP workers organised a peaceful march but the police team arrived and bundled us in three buses and brought to Surajpur police line,” he said. Vishal Pandey, addl DCP Greater Noida, said that prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code was in force in the district, which banned a gathering of more than four persons. “Protest or any such gathering is not allowed. The police first advised the Samajwadi Party workers not to protest. But when they refused, police arrested 80 workers and booked them under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC. They were later released on personal bond,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-noida-side-at-chilla-border-opened/story-OTHbiYk0hSnYEcwKrH7gEM.html
09-12-2020||City||Assembly panel asks civic bodies to submit plan on reducing height of Ghazipur, Bhalswa landfills||New Delhi: Senior AAP leader and chairperson of Delhi Assembly’s environment committee Atishi on Wednesday asked the North and East Delhi municipal corporations to submit detailed plans and timelines to reduce the height of the Ghazipur and Bhalswa landfills.“The height of the two landfills has not been reduced over the years. Besides, frequent fires have been contributing to high air pollution levels in Delhi. The corporations must list out what steps they have taken to reduce the height of the landfills and control the fires raging there,” said Atishi in a statement.The environment committee had summoned the municipal commissioners of the two corporations after a fire broke out at the Ghazipur landfill on November 25. Three days later, another fire was reported from the Bhalswa landfill site.While the two commissioners are infected with Covid-19, they were represented by Brijesh Singh, additional commissioner, EDMC; Pradeep Khandelwal, chief engineer, EDMC and Nourang Singh, chief engineer, North corporation during the meeting. “At the rate the work is going on at present, it will take 25 years to tackle the Ghazipur landfill alone,” said Atishi.The committee has asked the civic officials to submit plans with timelines to bring landfills to ground level by Monday. “You said the garbage dumps are self-combustible. Give timelines and plans to confirm when you can reduce the height of the existing landfill sites to zero,” she said.Also, the committee has asked them to submit a report on the action taken against the engineers on duty, when the fires occurred, over the last five years. Besides, the civic bodies have also been asked to give a report on the expenses in the last five years on waste management, the bidding process, and the name of these agencies involved.The two landfills, rising beyond the permissible limit of 20 metres, have exhausted their lifespan years ago.A senior East Corporation official, who did not wish to be named, said, “We will be submitting our plans by next week.” Despite repeated attempts, officials in the North corporation could not be reached for a comment. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that BJP is not opposed to formation and abeyance to time line for solving issues but the way Delhi Assembly’s Environment Committee head Atishi has started handling MCDs landfill sites cases smacks of political vendetta.“Atishi and her party comrades are unable to digest how East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir and EDMC’s efforts to reduce height of Ghazipur landfill site are showing positive results. The sudden activism by Atishi is politically intended just to divert EDMC attention from ground level performance to replying to her queries and BJP strongly condemns this,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assembly-panel-asks-civic-bodies-to-submit-plan-on-reducing-height-of-ghazipur-bhalswa-landfills/story-qXI8Fi6PUL7BJtGKgQsdsM.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||School uniform stores in Ludhiana struggling to stay afloat||Even though private schools reopened 50 days ago for students of Classes 9 to 12, the sale of school uniforms is yet to pick up pace. Some uniform sellers said that 90% of their business comes from students of nursery to Class 8. But, as schools are closed for these classes, they have been unable to clear even the old stock from last winter.Amid the Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdown, uniform dealers faced a cash crunch in 2020, and said that this was the worst year for them financially. Many of them said that if this continues, it will become difficult for them to pay for fixed costs, including rent and salaries for employees. Vipin Aggarwal, owner of Evershine School Uniform, Mall road, said, “Reopening of schools has not helped uniform dealers revive their business. Before the lockdown, I had 14 employees in my shop, and now there are only three.”The shops are stocked with winter uniforms, and shelves laden with sweaters, shirts, trousers, coats, ties and belts of different schools, but customers are not turning up. “Our sales are down by 90%. This year, we have placed no new orders, as unsold stock has piled up. I had 600 employees before lockdown, and during the peak season, it reaches 1,000. But, due to the pandemic, we just have 20 people now,” said Nilesh Aggarwal of Dressco School Uniform, Mali Ganj, the oldest uniform manufacturer in the district. Aggarwal’s family has been in the business since 1973.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-uniform-stores-in-ludhiana-struggling-to-stay-afloat/story-gcLbFkG9IdVqtJJalGSQnI.html
09-12-2020||Noida||With little help from health department, ailing farmers relying on volunteers||With a pandemic raging and the winter in full swing, protesters against the central government’s farm laws at UP Gate have only volunteers to rely on for their medical requirements. While the Ghaziabad health department says it does not have enough doctors to handle the situation, the district administration said it has done its bit: it has sent two ambulances, an officials who is not a doctor and it has supplied the agitation leaders with emergency phone numbers.On the ground, protesters say the government’s efforts to take care of their health was a poor joke.“For the last five days, we received about 50 patients every day who come with various complications like gastric issues, body pain along with cold and cough,” said Gursimran Singh who brought in private ambulance to the site with antibiotics, cough syrups and antipyretics, among others.Tthe central government had requested that senior citizens, women and children protesters return home. The protesters, however, rejected it.“The Ghaziabad health department has not sent any doctors or medicines or Covid-19. People are having to sleep in open, which affects their health,” said Sukhpal Singh who came along with Gursimran Singh. UP Gate is some distance away from any residential or commercial areas and is an open area adjacent to Ghazipur landfill site. Ghaziabad authorities had arranged for drinking water and mobile toilets at the site and say that they also sanitize the area regularly. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other neighbouring states had been protesting at the site since November 28. “We get up early morning and bathe in open with cold water from the tankers despite the water not suiting us. Some also bathe with bottled water that we get as donations. There are plenty of mosquitoes and mobile toilets are completely choked. Over the 11 days of protest here, the conditions have become unhygienic,” said Gurlal Singh, a protesting farmer from Shamli in UP. “There is lot of air pollution here which is also affecting people who are in the open. In Bijnor, we don’t have any pollution,” said Dinesh Singh, another farmer. Charanjeet Singh, a farmer from Bilaspur, said that he had been suffering a burning sensation in his chest for the last few days. “I had come here four or five days ago. think that the change of water has affected me,” he said. Dr. Soban Chaudhary is running a free medical camp under the aegis of Delhi gurdwara. “Our camp has been functioning here since November 29 and we are checking about 100-120 patients a day. Most of them suffer loose motions, cough and cold and even body ache. Almost all farmers here sleep in open amid winter chill that hit them,” he said.The district health department officials said that they had stationed two ambulances at the site and an official to deal with emergency situation. “Most of our doctors are engaged in Covid-19 duty. Besides, we have only one physician in the government setup. But we do send our doctors to the protest site,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said that he will look into the issues of sanitation and cleanliness. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “Anyone needing medical help can also contact police and sub-divisional magistrates deployed on duty. We have given our health department contact numbers to farmers’ leaders and they can get medical help whenever needed.”Volunteers, however, are not enough to deal with possible health crisis, say doctors.“In case the health department is short of resources, the administration can always seek help of private hospitals. From there, junior doctors or MBBS-level doctors can go to the site and help people,” said Dr. Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association - Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-little-help-from-health-department-ailing-farmers-relying-on-volunteers/story-AlsLO7GAxAGxt5SlTByFTL.html

The three-wheeler driver also suffered injuries in the mishap. Onlookers rushed them to the civil hospital, where the infant, identified as Aarav, was declared dead on arrival. His father, Manoj Burman, 38, and mother, Neelu Burman, 35, have been referred to a private hospital in Model Town. The three-wheeler driver, Sandeep Kumar, who is recuperating at the civil hospital, said that due to low visibility, he was driving slowly but the car driver was speeding, which led to the collision. Division Number 8 station house officer, inspector Jarnail Singh said Manoj Burman, who works as a graphic designer in the city, was returning from his hometown in Madhya Pradesh with his family. Their train had reached the city around 3am following which they had boarded an auto to take them to their rented accommodation on Pakhowal road. The cop said that impact of the collision was so strong that all occupants of the auto fell down on road and sustained injuries. The car driver, meanwhile, fled the spot, leaving the car behind. Police have seized the vehicle and registered a case against the unidentified driver, the cop said. ‘Child born after seven years of marriage… fate played a cruel joke on us’Sitting on his hospital bed, Manoj Burman cannot stop sobbing. “Fate has played a cruel joke on us. Aarav was born seven years after our marriage. We had consulted several doctors and prayed at many temples before we were finally blessed with a child. And now, he been snatched away from our lives so brutally,” said the grief-stricken father. “My wife is still unconscious. I don’t know how I will give her the news, when she gains consciousness and asks about Aarav,” he adds.Burman wife and son had been living in Jabalpur until now. On December 2, he had gone back to his native place to bring them to Ludhiana. “I had been staying away from them due to work. I was hoping that once they start living here, I will get to spend more time with my child,” he sobbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-month-old-boy-dies-after-car-rams-into-auto/story-svCn7Y1Oeak4KcsIMt3SeO.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||Antibiotic resistance: WHO awards research project to Ludhiana vet varsity||The World Health Organisation (WHO) has awarded a research project on antibiotic resistance to the school of public health and zoonoses, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.It was awarded by WHO’s regional office for the south-east Asian region. The project will be headed by Randhir Singh, professor, school of public health and zoonoses, and his team.The school has been working actively in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for many years and has several national and international collaborations in the area.Randhir Singh said AMR is one of the major global health problems and their indiscriminate use in human and animal health sectors is mainly to blame for this. He added that if this problem is not addressed immediately, then as per some projections, 10 million people annually are going to lose their life globally by 2050, and the losses will be higher in low or middle income countries.JPS Gill, director research of the university, said that scientists of the university will carry out the situation analysis of the antibiotic use in animal production and agriculture sector and its impact on food safety and AMR for south-east Asia Region.Dr Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor, GADVASU, lauded the efforts of the scientists. He said that the issue of antibiotic resistance is a big economic burden. He added that it is important to continuously monitor this problem, especially in the animal production and agricultural sector.Dr RS Aulakh, director, school of public health and zoonoses, said that food animals and foods of animal origin are one of the important contributors of antibiotic resistant organisms. Growing population and increased food demand is further going to escalate the problem, he added.What is antimicrobial resistance?AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time, and no longer respond to medicines. This makes infections harder to treat and increases risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/antibiotic-resistance-who-awards-research-project-to-ludhiana-vet-varsity/story-ODbPR6UjrFHNoOuYCQETCP.html
09-12-2020||Noida||Facing odds, elderly and women not ready to leave farmers’ protest midway||Despite the central government’s requests to the protesters to request the elderly and children among them to go back home, many at UP Gate have not heeded that call.Sixty-year-old Suresh Chand is on “maun vrat (oath of silence)” and has fastened a mask around his mouth that read “Gandhi Ji ke pad chinnh, bhook hartaal par (On foot-steps of Gandhiji, on hunger strike”). He showed a handwritten note with a list of demands that included the complete repeal of the new farm laws.People around him said Chand had been fasting since December 6. Satnam Singh, 63, from Meerut, is also on protest -- sitting on the highway during the day and sleeping on the roadside at night. He is dressed in white kurta-pyjama and traditional Punjabi Jutti as shoes, with a staff in hand. “There is no question of going back from here till government accepts our demands. We elected the government and they should pay heed to our demands. In fact, if these demands are met, the Prime Minister will be lauded by all and will get a lot of appreciation,” he said. “We sleep on road with blankets that are drenched due to the mist. Still, we stay strong.”Pilibhit resident Vikramjeet Singh, 19, was supposed to go to Australia to attend university. “Since the pandemic hit, I decided stay here and when the protests hit, I decided to join them,” he said. “I will not go back till the farmers’ demands are met. I am sleeping on tractor-trolleys with other farmers. Jashandeep Singh, a class 12 student has also come from Pilibhit. “We have small farmland back home and my father has opened a small pesticide shop. So, in away, our fortunes are tied to the farmers. We sleep on roads with a blanket ever since I came here. I will not be leaving the protest midway,” he said. Below the UP Gate flyover is a group of women from Amroha. “We left our children and cattle back home and came for this important protest and just not to leave it midway. There is no one to look after our farms there anyway. So, we will be here till demands get accepted by the government,” said Poonam Kumari. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he has also made appeals to protesters to go back. “We have made number of appeals to them to leave for home but they are not ready. We also asked them to at least send home children, women and elderly and have also made similar appeals to their leaders as the weather conditions are harsh and not favourable. It seems they are not ready,” he said. The protests at the UP Gate are likely to continue and extend further. The farmers have occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of National Highway-9 which is now blocked for any traffic. The farmer unions on Wednesday also rejected a proposal sent by the Centre to end the impasse over farm laws. The farmers protesting near national capital Delhi said that they will block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway by December 12 and hold protest demonstrations in many parts of the country on December 14. They are protesting and demanding that the government rollback the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/facing-odds-elderly-and-women-not-ready-to-leave-farmers-protest-midway/story-Sz0io18o8mrwW5FTjd9LKJ.html

Officials of NIAL said that Zurich International AG, the Swiss company selected for developing the Jewar airport, would be asked to start work on the project only after AAI approves the master plan.“The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is a competent authority to make sure that all norms related with the project are complied with. AAI will give its approvals in the next 15-20 days and then we will ask Zurich to start work at the ground,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of NIAL and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), the two agencies appointed by the UP government to monitor the airport project.AAI is a statutory body working under the ministry of civil aviation, and is responsible for creating, upgrading, maintaining and managing civil aviation infrastructure in India.“It was necessary because NIAL does not have the expertise to examine the technical aspects of the project. Once the master plan is approved, the work will begin at the site,” said Singh.According to the officials, the master plan contains the details about terminal building, commercial space, hotels, offices, training centre, cargo facility and parking, among others, on the premises of the airport. The proposed airport will also have the facility of maintenance, repair and overhauling services of aircraft.Once the master plan gets approval from AAI, it will be approved in the board meeting of NIAL, the officials said.The UP government has already acquired 1,334 hectares of land for the first phase of the airport. The project has four phases and the first phase has to become operational by 2023-24. In total, the state government has to acquire 5,000 hectares of land for the ambitious project.Recently, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari, head of project monitoring and implementation committee (PMIC), the apex committee monitoring the Jewar international airport, approved five runways for the project at Jewar. The PMIC also said that the land acquisition can start at the site for second phase whenever the required funds are available.Yeida has already sought permission from the state government that the land acquisition for the second phase of the airport should be started.Zurich International will invest Rs 30,000 crore in the project and it gets 40 years to fully develop this project. Under PPP model, Zurich will design, build, finance, operate and transfer the project to government after 40 years. The airport will start with two runways by 2023-24 under phase-I and it will have five runways on completion to full capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nial-submits-master-plan-of-jewar-airport-project-to-airports-authority-of-india-for-technical-examination/story-oUD84HTh41cOEXQGk0IW8I.html

Experts attributed the relatively better air quality to lesser haze.“The air quality in Gurugram is relatively better in comparison to other cities due to lesser haze. The haze disappeared around 11am whereas, in Delhi, the haze build-up lasted for a longer time,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. Panwar said that the air quality would deteriorate in the morning hours on Thursday due to fog but might recover during the latter part of the day.The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 304.8 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally and remain in the very poor category on Thursday. The air quality is likely to improve from Friday evening and reach the lower-end of the very poor category. The air quality is expected to improve significantly during the weekend on account of light rain, due to a new western disturbance.Gurugram’s minimum temperature settled at 12.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory, which, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Wednesday. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 25.4 degrees Celsius.As per the weekly IMD forecast, moderate fog is expected on Thursday while the temperature is expected to stay in a similar range. Scattered rain is likely during the weekend. Mahesh Palawat, director at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, said that a dip in temperature could be expected around December 15. He said that temperatures were higher due to an increased frequency of western disturbances and the current wind direction being easterly. “Until November, there was a gap of 8-10 days between western disturbances. However, the frequency and intensity of western disturbance have increased in December. They are approaching one after another and when a series of western disturbances approach, the flow of northerly winds gets obstructed due to formation of an induced cyclonic circulation over northern plains and the temperature increases. The easterly winds are also warmer in nature,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-in-poor-zone-as-haze-clears-up/story-swz77GFRGedhtiyf7gsUeJ.html

The employees had been allegedly duping US citizens by posing as security support service executives of an e-commerce giant and charged money through e-gift cards, said police. According to the police, the call centre was duping people of hundreds of dollars. The police said that at least 2,000 US citizens are suspected to have been targeted by the call centre. The executives used to tell their victims that their membership to the website has been cancelled or that the payments made by them are not reflecting in their accounts, or claimed product delivery updates.The suspects were identified as Praveen Kumar (32), of Bawal in Rewari and Manish Kumar (32), of Buxar in Bihar. The call centre was operated from the basement of their shared residence, the police said.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that the suspects had registered as a company — Squad Company — but had no legal permission to operate a call centre. “We received information that an illegal call centre was operational from a residential area in Sector 45. We formed teams, including cyber crime officials, and raided the house. Telecallers were found making calls and two of the owners were present there. We released the telecallers after questioning them,” he said. Goel said they have recovered 13 computers and two mobile phones from their possession. The police said the confiscated hardware will be sent to a laboratory in Madhuban in Karnal for forensic examination. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have started cracking down on illegal call centres operating across the city. “We received specific inputs that a fake call centre had cheated several US nationals on the pretext of being security support service provider in Sector 45 area. The people employed at the call centre operated without a registered licence issued by the department of telecommunications (DoT),” he said.A case was registered on Wednesday at the Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act, after which two of the owners of the call centre were arrested from the spot. The police said the exact number of victims and the total amount of money siphoned may be higher than their estimates. “We are also getting a forensic audit of the seized property to know the exact details of the victims who have been duped. The illegal call centres are using same modus operandi to dupe people and, have already arrested 66 people this year and busted nearly 44 call centres,” Rao said, adding that the suspects had duped around 2,000 victims.The suspects used to provide pick and drop facilities to all the employees and were paying Rs 25,000 monthly salary, and nearly Rs 30,000 in incentives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fake-call-centre-busted-used-to-dupe-us-citizens-by-impersonating-e-commerce-platform/story-m5JNgmo7LXGJwgGr5T57RK.html
09-12-2020||Gurugram||State extends provisional affiliation with pvt schools for another year||In a relief to unrecognised private schools, the state government has extended their provisional affiliation with the Board of School Education, Haryana, for one year, giving them more time to fulfil the norms for recognition. These are schools whose cases of recognition have not been finalised by the department so far and hold temporary recognition, which is renewed every year. Keeping in view the representations received from private school associations for the extension of provisional/temporary affiliation and in the interest of students studying in such schools, the state government had set up a committee for reviewing the affiliation norms. The committee suggested simplified norms for affiliation and the amendment in rules was in consideration at the government level. Because of these circumstances, the department has granted provisional recognition to these private schools for another year. “The state government has decided to grant provisional affiliation to schools, whose cases of recognition have not been finalised by the department, for another academic session — 2020-21 with the condition that schools are able to produce the proof of temporary recognition/affiliation by the department during the last session—2019-20,” said the director of secondary education in a written statement on Tuesday. An official from the education department, requesting anonymity, said, “These schools hold temporary affiliation from the Haryana board. Last year, the government had said that it would no longer renew the affiliation of these schools and they would need to fulfil the norms for recognition. However, the government has now given them relaxation for another year. Without the renewal of temporary affiliation, children in these schools cannot sit for the board exam.”Yashpal Yadav, state president of the Haryana Shikshan Sansthan Sangathan — a union of private schools in the state —said that there are 1,334 private schools in the state with temporary affiliation. “Recognition norms were modified by the state government in 2003. Schools that held temporary affiliation back then benefited from the extension of provisional affiliation,” said Yadav. He said there are around 3,200 private unrecognised schools in the state and the union had been advocating for permanent recognition of all these schools. Despite attempts, district education official Indu Boken couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-extends-provisional-affiliation-with-pvt-schools-for-another-year/story-csb0ItsQOA4kTC8SpVdrwN.html
09-12-2020||Gurugram||Mayor tells officials to fast-track development work or face action||During a review meeting with officials and councillors working under zones 1 and 3 of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), mayor Madhu Azad told them that any negligence or deliberate delay in executing development works would be reported to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and would invite action — stated a release issued by the civic body on Wednesday.Azad further said that Khattar had issued these directions to her and all MCG councillors during their last meeting with him. “If any official is negligent or keeps development work pending without any reason, then their name will be forwarded to the CM for action. The CM had himself said the same during the last meeting with councillors. Officials have been further directed to not keep files of minor works pending with them and clear them at the earliest so that development projects can be fast-tracked,” said Azad.During the meeting, MCG officials and councillors also agreed in principle that the civic body should not club tenders of various wards for cleaning sewers and rather issue the same on a ward-to-ward basis.“There have been several cases where the MCG has given a contractor the task of cleaning three wards together. In some cases, the work executed by the contractor may be satisfactory for two wards while for another, it may be either incomplete or unsatisfactory. Despite this, a contractor gets the total payment for all three wards from the MCG, after receiving “work satisfactory” certificate from just one councillor,” said an MCG official, who attended the meeting.In 2019, the MCG had introduced a policy that civic officials can transfer funds to contractors only after the local ward councillor of the area issues a “work satisfactory” certificate. Even if a single councillor issues this certificate, a contractor can get paid for executing the work that may have been carried out under the ambit of various councillors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mayor-tells-councillors-to-fast-track-development-work-or-face-action/story-kUFY6OxaiuzhAla1u00wpK.html
09-12-2020||Gurugram||Schools told to get symptomatic cases tested when classes resume||The district health department on Wednesday directed all its primary and community health centres to test symptomatic teachers or students of government schools for Covid-19 whenever schools reopen. Although there have been no clear directions regarding the resumption of schools, which are shut till December 10, the director general of health services on Tuesday advised the education department to adopt preventive measures if schools resume soon. In Haryana, schools were shut in November, after over 300 students tested positive for Covid-19 across the state. Schools were earlier shut till November 30 and this was further extended to December 10 by home minister Anil Vij, after considering the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state. Vij said that schools will be provided with necessary Covid-19 guidelines before reopening.On Tuesday, the director general of health services shared the measures, to be taken for the safety of students and teachers attending school, with the director of school education. As per their suggestion, similar to the Union ministry of home affairs’ guidelines, classes are to be held in a staggered manner to ensure adequate social distancing. All students and teachers coming to schools have to be screened for Covid-19 and only those who are asymptomatic will be allowed to attend the class. Also, the education department will have to coordinate with health facilities for Covid-19 testing of the symptomatic cases. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Primary and community health centres have been told to test teachers and students, if symptomatic. Health centres will coordinate with nearby schools once there is clarity on the reopening of schools.” District education officer Indu Boken did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on the resumption of schools. School principals said that they are yet to receive a new directive in this regard. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said, “So far, we have not been told if schools will open from December 11 or if the closure is getting extended further. The department has not shared any written directive so far. We are continuing with online classes till there is clarity on the reopening of schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/schools-told-to-get-symptomatic-cases-tested-when-classes-resume/story-qZGUAWIn1dW9AUOxdQ49UK.html
09-12-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 tests to cost Rs 700 in Gurugram||The Haryana health department on Wednesday revised the price of Covid-19 tests for the fifth time since March, capping the rate for RT-PCR tests at private labs, hospitals and designated collection centre at Rs 700.Sample collection from residences would continue to cost Rs 900, which has been in effect since October 29, according to the order issued by Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, on the revised testing rates on Wednesday.On Wednesday, at least 5,005 tests were administered, of which 4,342 were RT-PCR and 663 were rapid antigen tests. As many as 436 new Covid-19 infections and three Covid-related deaths were recorded on the day. The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard test for detecting Covid-19. The costs of other tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body, such as antigen test (Rs 500) antibody test (Rs 250), TrueNat (Rs 1250) and CBNAAT (Rs 2,400) continue to remain the same.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The proposal for the separate testing charges for home collection and samples taken at labs and hospitals was discussed with private labs a long time ago. In hospitals, Covid-19 tests for inpatient department (IPD) and outpatient department (OPD) will cost Rs 700.”According to him, the state is continuing with Rs 900 for home collection as it will cover the cost of kits, consumables and manpower, among other charges.Over time, private labs have raised the issue that reduced testing price fails to cover the overall cost incurred in administering the Covid-19 test. However, officials of the health department reiterated that testing charges are reduced based on the rates of the RT-PCR kits, which has been consistently declining.Dr Rishabh Rajput, director – Covid-19, Modern Diagnostics, said, “Every day, the number of home collection of samples is limited, while the footfall of people at the lab remains high. The revised charges will not affect the current operations of the lab.”The state health department for the first time slashed the RT-PCR testing charge on June 16. From Rs 4,500, which was the upper limit of the RT-PCR charges fixed by the Indian Council of Medical Research in March, the testing cost was brought down to Rs 2,400 in June. It was reduced to Rs 1,600 on August 29, then to Rs 1,200 on October 2 and further to Rs 900 on October 29.“Currently, the state has the lowest Covid-19 testing cost in Delhi-NCR. It will motivate people to come forward for testing due to affordability,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-tests-to-cost-rs-700-in-gurugram/story-SjjZU18td5ae3OoN0ofLQM.html

In one such instance, an inmate said that he had bought a phone, having a market value of ₹26,000, for ₹85,000. Jail officials also said that the gang was providing call facilities to other inmates and used to charge ₹10 per one minute from them. At least eight such complaints have been received and cases registered since August this year, officials familiar with the matter said. The matter came to light in August when Dharambir Chautala, the former deputy superintendent of the jail, was arrested for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards and mobile phones to inmates. Gururgam police in the last two years have registered more than 200 cases, where mobiles have been recovered from jail inmates, said the police. Harinder Singh, jail superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said they have started conducting surprise checks in the barracks, and on Monday evening, around 4.30pm, they recovered one mobile phone from an inmate named Rahul Khan, who was lodged in Block -3. “During questioning, he revealed that he had bought the phone from one Sahun, another inmate, for ₹85,000 one-and-a-half months ago. He said the mobile was used by five inmates and they used to charge other inmates to make calls,” he said. The payment was made by Khan’s family to Sahun’s relative in Nuh, Singh said.The mobile phone was used by the five inmates who allowed others to make calls in lieu of money. They told officials that they wanted to earn quick money through the mobile and had, therefore, invested in the phone, said the police. Singh said strict warnings have been issued to all the officials to ensure that no illegal activity is allowed inside the premises. “We are also investigating as to how the mobile phone was smuggled inside the jail premises,” Singh added. Khan is lodged in Bhondsi jail since September 2019 and is involved in 44 cases of theft, snatching and attempt to murder. He belongs to Nuh and was operating along with his close aides, who are also lodged in the same barrack. During questioning, it was also revealed that mobile phones were smuggled a few months ago and were hidden in the barracks. Since the arrest of Chautala, the inmates have become cautious. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they are investigating the case and will take the call detail records of the mobile number to get the exact details of the calls made from inside the jail. “We will scan the call details and since when the phone was operational following which action will be taken against the inmates under Prisoners Act,” he said. Jail authorities said earlier an inmate identified as Ravi used to help Chautala to crack deals with inmates who wanted to buy mobile phones and drugs. He became the middleman and started taking orders from inmates and later delivered mobile phones and drugs to them with the consent of Chautala. However, after his arrest, the supply of drugs and mobile phones had stopped. “We are keeping a close watch on all the staff inside the jail premises and have given warnings to all. Strict action will be taken against any person found indulging in any illegal activity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhondsi-jail-inmates-found-selling-phones-inside-premises/story-6z5B08l2VQNSfE1ZC8nTjM.html
09-12-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad Police bust gang involved in insurance fraud; two held||The Faridabad Police busted a gang of four, who had allegedly duped people of more than ₹5 crore on the pretext of reviving their lapsed insurance policies. The 23-year-old alleged kingpin of the gang and his aide were arrested from Moti Nagar in Delhi on Tuesday. Investigators said the probe revealed that they had allegedly been running a call centre and had hired 10 female executives to make calls and get details of policy holders. The police said the gang members had allegedly recruited people who had lost jobs during lockdown. The police said they arrested two of the suspects from Delhi on Tuesday. One of them was identified as Mohammad Iqbal of Muzzafarpur in Bihar, who lived in a rented accommodation in Rani Bagh, and the other one was identified as Vinod Kumar of Badshahpur in Bihar, who lived in Uttam Nagar in Delhi. Kumar was the alleged mastermind behind the gang. They were produced before the court and were taken on four days of police remand, said the police. The remaining two suspects are at large and teams are conducting raids to arrest them. Arpit Jain, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said that they had received a complaint from one Yashpal Singh, a Faridabad resident, who was duped of ₹22.63 lakh on the pretext of having his expired insurance policy revived. “Singh shared all the details of his policies and the amount was transferred to six different bank accounts. Victim kept calling them for updates but the suspects misled him and gave excuses that during lockdown the process was taking time. Later, they stopped taking his calls. When he contacted the insurance company, he realised he was duped and took the help of the police,” he said. Jain said the suspects were using same set of mobile numbers and used to target people across the county. “We started investigating and, based on technical surveillance, we reached the suspects and arrested two of them,” he said. The police said that during questioning, the suspects revealed that they used to buy the data through insurance agents and executives, and used the data to make calls to victims. OP Singh, commissioner of the Faridabad police, said at least 30 victims have been identified by analysing their bank transactions, which also showed the gang’s bank accounts have allegedly received ₹5 crore. “We have recovered ₹14 lakh and 21 mobile phone from their possession, which were used in the crime,” he said. Singh said the gang operated in an organised manner and had different members performing different tasks such as making calls, creating bank accounts with a forged documentation and withdrawing cash. The police said the crime team had been on the trail of this gang ever since they received a complaint from Singh. Singh said the investigators began by analysing the bank accounts in which the victim had deposited the money and the phone numbers from which he received calls from suspects posing as different government officials, including income tax officers. On Tuesday night, the police finally nabbed two suspects while they were allegedly making calls to victims from their call centre. Singh said during questioning, they allegedly revealed that four friends had formed the gang two years ago and started a call centre in Delhi’s Moti Nagar after hiring nearly 10 call centre executives to make calls. “The gang used to hire women executives to gain trust of victims and had worked for insurance process in various BPOs. They had the data of lapsed insurance policies,” he said. So far, the police have unearthed 10 fake bank accounts in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar that were allegedly used to receive money from the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-police-bust-gang-involved-in-insurance-fraud-two-held/story-6TnUQxhP18bpQLf5hmxyYJ.html

The boy’s family based in Jewar had recently received ₹10 crore for their land that the Uttar Pradesh government had acquired for a project in connection with the upcoming Noida international airport. Police said the suspects decided to kidnap the boy when they came to know about this.The boy was reported missing to the police on December 6. His father complained that his son had gone to their farm the previous day but did not return.“We launched a search when he did not return home at night. Next day, we filed a missing person complaint at the Jewar police station,” said the father. On December 7, Giridhar, a person who worked on the family’s farm, received the ransom call. The caller was using the victim’s phone.“Giridhar told us about the call and we immediately informed police,” said the father. Vishal Pandey, Greater Noida additional DCP, said they put the victim’s number on surveillance. “While tracking the mobile phone number, we realised that the kidnappers were moving a lot, even going as far as Faridabad in Haryana,” he said. But on Wednesday morning, they detected that the phone was in Greater Noida.“We put up barricades at strategic locations and checked vehicles. At Jhuppa Banda cut police checked a Wagon-R car and found the three suspects and the victim with his hands and legs tied in the back seat,” he said, adding that the suspects were arrested with little resistance.Police seized the vehicle, a countrymade gun, two live cartridges, two knives and victim’s mobile phone from their possession. The mastermind of the crime was allegedly 38-year-old Joginder Singh, Giridhar’s cousin and a resident of Jewar. His accomplices were identified by police as 32-year-old Balbeer Singh, a resident of Sohna in Haryana, and 28-year-old Sudhir Jaat, a resident of Faridabad. “Joginder got to know that the boy’s family had received huge compensation recently in lieu of their land,” said Pandey. Narrating his ordeal, the boy said he had come home in March after the Covid-19 induced lockdown was imposed. He was a student at a private boarding school in Kosi Kalan in Mathura.”Joginder and I knew each other and I suspect he knew about the ₹10 crore compensation too,” he said. “I was at my family’s farm on December 5 around 5pm when a Wagon-R arrived and blocked the exit from the farm. I went up to them when suddenly the three overpowered me and pushed me inside the car, held a knife to me and drove away.”The family said they found his motorcycle at the farm when they searched for him. The victim said the men blindfolded him, tied his limbs and drove into a forested area that people didn’t frequent. “They kept me there the whole night, snatched my phone and threatened to kill me if I didn’t co-operate. Next day, they took me to Faridabad and locked me in a small room,” the boy said. Police said they suspects may have believed that the best way to keep police off their trail would be to keep moving and on Wednesday morning, they came to Greater Noida. At around 1am, they were caught.Addl DCP Pandey said that the suspects had planned to kill the victim and dump the body in the Yamuna after they got the ransom. A case under Section 364-A (kidnapping for ransom) of IPC was registered against the suspects and a court and sent them to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-held-for-abducting-17-year-old-for-1-cr-ransom/story-KXoaInU414PpaodTOLD21N.html
09-12-2020||Noida||Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara have highest Covid-19 caseload in December||Ghaziabad: Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara have emerged as the top three localities having a high Covid-19 caseload in the recent mapping conducted by the Ghaziabad health department from December 1 to 8. Officials said that they are concerned with rising number of cases, but focussed testing and surveillance is continuing to break the chain of infection.According to the latest mapping in December, Indirapuram has topped the list with 232 Covid-19 cases, while Vaishali and Vasundhara are on second and third spot with 126 cases each. Out of a total 1,258 Covid-19 cases that the district witnessed from December 1 to 8, share of the three localities is about 38.47%. During the period from March to November, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara had 2,819, 1,355 and 1,318 cases, respectively, according to the health department data. Their contribution to overall 23,060 Covid-19 cases during the period was about 23.81% in the district. The Indirapuram locality is the worst affected as it topped the list of most cases during the period March to November and also running on the top of the monthly case list in September, October and November, the data showed. “We are taking extra efforts to bring down the number of cases and trying to break the chain of infection. We have deputed additional teams to these areas and taking up focussed testing along with surveillance. Due to this, the cases are seemingly on rise but we expected them to decline once the chain of infection gets broken and positive persons are isolated,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The three localities are located adjacent to each other and house an estimated population of about 6-7 lakh, the officials said. The localities also comprise major working-class population which travels to Delhi and other NCR cities like Noida and Gurugram on daily basis, they said. “These areas have been high on number of cases for past several months and it is time that focussed testing is increased and carried out in each of the residential pockets in these areas. If there is shortage of staff, then more resources can be hired with the help of contingency funds sent by the government,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Increased testing is the only option to find out cases of infection and to isolate them at the earliest,” he added. In November, the district health department had been conducting an average of about 4,058 tests per day but the testing has fallen to an average of about 3,750 tests per day in first eight days of December so far. “There are number of our healthcare staff members who have contracted infection of late. These include our staff from the integrated disease surveillance program laboratory. So, several activities have got hampered as a result. In areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara, we have deployed more teams for testing,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named. According to official figures, 44 healthcare staff members of the district health department contracted Covid-19 infection in November while the figure was 19, 16 and 13 in the months of October, September and August, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/indirapuram-vaishali-and-vasundhara-have-highest-covid-19-caseload-in-december/story-afoURjBdVr0xRLRXIWKRTJ.html
09-12-2020||Noida||‘Very poor’ is the best air quality Noida sees in past six days||Noida: The air quality of Noida improved to ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday, making it the cleanest air that the city has seen in the past six days. Noida had been suffering ‘severe’ air quality since December 4, while the city’s air has not improved beyond ‘very poor’ levels this month so far. However, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida continued being under ‘severe’ air on Wednesday, with Ghaziabad for the six days in row and Greater Noida for the third day. According to weather analysts, low wind speed, high humidity, and low temperatures are some of the major reasons that the local emissions could not be ventilated enough to make a significant positive effect on the air quality of the three cities. The pollution monitoring agencies stated that the intrusion of stubble burning smoke from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana is still negligible. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the weather conditions, such as humidity and temperatures, were almost same as a day earlier, a slight increase in the wind speed let some improvement in the air quality. However, with weather conditions largely in favour of the pollution levels, the winds are not strong enough to ventilate the pollutants, IMD said. “The wind speed on Wednesday was recorded at 8kmph. However, it was negligible during early morning and night hours. So whatever ventilation happened, it did so during the afternoon time. On Tuesday, the maximum wind speed was 5kmph. There are possibilities of rain between December 11 and 12 which may improve the air quality by washing the pollutants. However, prior to that the weather conditions will remain almost the same and not very strong to make a significant reduction of the pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 394 against 407 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s air quality on Wednesday was 404 against 405 on Tuesday, while Ghaziabad also saw slight improvement with an AQI of 418 against 424 a day earlier, showed the CPCB data. AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Though the fine particles or PM2.5 levels dropped, they still remained at least four times the safe standards. The average PM2.5 level for past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 259.5 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³), against 270.52 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 278.07 µg/m³ against 269.46 on Tuesday. The average PM2.5 level also lowered in Ghaziabad that was recorded at 291.12 µg/m³ on Wednesday against 314.33 µg/m³ on Tuesday. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to deteriorate due to calm winds on Thursday. “Calm surface winds are forecasted for tomorrow and AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate towards the high end of the very poor category. Thereafter, under the influence of fresh Western Disturbance, isolated to scattered rainfall is expected on 11th and 12th December, and AQI is likely to improve to the lower end of the very poor category by December 11,” said the SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/very-poor-is-the-best-air-quality-noida-sees-in-past-six-days/story-MAf1JehJHABigHGQ7Ni0oN.html

In the past couple of days, there has been almost zero visibility on the expressway causing some accidents,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.Yeida has also decided to arrange tea for the commuters at toll plazas so that the drivers stay alert and do not fall asleep in the early morning hours.“As per the past records, accidents do take place during wee hours because the drivers fall asleep. If they halt at toll plazas and have tea, then it will help reducing accidents,” said Singh.Yeida’s move to reduce the speed limit comes after some accidents took place in the past week amid foggy weather. Four persons were killed and one injured in a road accident when a car rammed into a state transport bus from behind on the Yamuna Expressway last Saturday, the police had said. The collision that took place at 6.45 am was of such intensity that it left the front portion of the car completely flattened.The data provided by Yeida shows that 45% of accidents are a result of drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Also, speeding and violation of traffic rules account for 19% and 11% accidents, respectively, on the expressway, the data shows. The stationary vehicles on the expressway have also been found as a major cause of accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yeida-reduces-max-speed-limit-for-vehicles-plying-on-yamuna-expressway-due-to-low-visibility/story-qLuASZi0LSimfJMz2rSs1L.html

While the next two days could see shallow to moderate fog, the visibility would be further hit with very dense fog by the weekend, IMD said. The region currently has several parameters supporting moderate fog in the morning hours. The areas that could be affected include highways, roads along agriculture land, waterbodies and expressways. “There will be shallow fog on Thursday and Friday morning that will bring down the visibility to around 200 metres or less. The current humidity levels are high especially during the morning hours and the wind speed would also be less, leading to the fog between 5 am and 8.30 am,” said an official at IMD. The moderate fog brings down the visibility to 200 metres, he added. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 11.8 degrees Celsius, while the average minimum for the NCR was 9.6 degrees Celsius. The humidity oscillated between 97 and 61%, while the winds during the morning hours were calm that led to humidity in the morning. “There are chances of rains on the night of December 11 and 12 that could lead to dense fog in the morning hours. However, till Saturday the region will see shallow fog. The region is already seeing high humidity, low winds and low temperatures that leads to fog. However, the humidity will rise further and temperatures will drop by December 12, leading to very dense fog,” said Mahesh Palawat, head of Skymet, a private weather foresting agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/visibility-may-drop-to-200-metres-in-morning-hours-says-imd/story-8xJAjvZVdPeEoDlNzf902I.html

The administration has been uploading the names of beneficiaries and encroachers of state land under the scam. At serial number 229 is the name of Pathania’s late father Bhupinder Singh and grandfather Jagdev Singh, who were shown as beneficiaries of state land measuring nine Kanals and 14 Marlas at a cost of ₹970 under the “unconstitutional” Roshni Act. The land is located at Kehal village in Majalta area of Ramnagar in Udhampur district. However, Pathania said that no member of his family was beneficiary of the state land under the Act. “My political opponents and some disgruntled revenue officials have projected me as beneficiary of Roshni Act. My mother, my brother, my sister and I do not have even an inch of land mutated under Roshni Act in our names,” he said. Pathania said an attempt is being made to stoke a controversy and make an issue amid the DDC elections. “I am going to file a ₹50 lakh defamation case against them including revenue officials. I request people to beware of fake news,” he added. Pathania, who had won Ramnagar assembly seat for the BJP in 2014 elections, claimed that during his tenure as MLA, he did not purchase even an inch of land. “An attempt is being made to malign my image,” he added. Panthers Party president and former MLA Balwant Singh Mankotia said, “Politicians and influential people took maximum benefit of Roshni Act. Since his name (RS Pathania) has also figured in the list put out by the government, I want to know what action will the BJP initiate against him.” Mankotia said as soon as names of politicians from their party cropped up, the BJP filed a review petition before the high court. He said though many politicians and influential people benefitted from the Roshni Act, Panthers Party will not allow poor and landless farmers to suffer. “We will not allow government to snatch small land holdings of poor people. We may start a mass agitation,” he added. In a U-turn, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has sought a review of October 9 high court judgment that had declared the 2001 J&K State Land (Vesting of Ownership to Occupants) Act (Roshni Act) null and void. In its October 9 order, the high court had also ordered a CBI probe and directed the government to cancel all mutations of state lands under the Act, and work out modalities to evict encroachers from such land and retrieve it within six months. Following the order, the administration has been uploading the names of “encroachers” on government website. These names included those of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, party vice-president Omar Abdullah, Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti, PDP leader and former finance minister Haseeb Drabu, and Congress leaders. On December 4, the administration, through special secretary (revenue) Nazir Ahmad Thakur, filed a review petition before the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roshni-land-scam-ex-mla-pathania-s-late-father-grandfather-on-list-of-beneficiaries/story-cWQyv7PWCBiA4YQOWSB16I.html

The ski resort is ready and many more events will be organised in coming days,” director, tourism, Kashmir, Nisar Ahmad Wani said.He said this season, a number of ski courses for youth are slated to be organised for which large number of applications have already been received. “Initially, four groups from J&K and two groups from outside the UT will undergo ski courses in coming weeks. Two groups are exclusively for girls. Youth services and sports department is also organising ski courses.”The Gulmarg bowl is presently covered with two feet of snow and a large number of young enthusiasts can be seen engaged in Alpine skiing, snow cycling, sledging and All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) race.“Though the footfall hasn’t increased but the arrivals has gone up. Even locals are visiting this place daily,” said Khursheed Ahmad, a local tourist guide. People affiliated with tourism say that despite Covid-19, the number of enquires have gone up this year. Gulmarg Gondola, one of Asia’s largest and highest cable cars, was opened for tourists in September after it remained closed for six months due to the pandemic.Officials said tourists have started trickling in small numbers amid proper Covid-19 protocols. Every person has to under go a rapid Covid test before being allowed into Gulmarg. The tourism department has also started campaigns to woo tourists.

The results of their work have been published in the journal Engineering Reports. The research paper has been co-authored by researcher scholars Raj Kiran, Sourav Sharma along with Anuruddh Kumar, IIT Mandi alumnus currently working at Hanyang University, North Korea, under the supervision of Rajeev Kumar and Rahul Vaish, associate professors, School of Engineering, IITMandi.Rajeev Kumar said piezoelectric materials can generate electrical energy when a force is applied on them and are thus extremely useful. “Such materials can, for example, be used in floor tiles to generate electrical energy from walking or on roads where the weight from the vehicles can power road lights and signals. However, currently, the electrical energy produced by these materials is very low, which limits their applications in real life situations,” he said.Meanwhile, Rahul Vaish said, “We have developed a technique known as graded poling to enhance the power output of piezoelectric materials by more than 100 times.” The researchers have used numerical techniques to utilise multiple mechanical stresses – bending, compressive and tensile stresses at the top and bottom of thepiezoelectric cantilever beams and shear stresses in the mid-section – in order to significantly improve the electrical output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iit-mandi-researchers-propose-technique-to-generate-electricity-from-floor-tiles/story-ajBtC1fSpO5yWFsy3H6GyL.html

By March 2021, all these 58,000 gram panchayats will have community toilets. A woman each drawn from the panchayat’s women self-help groups will be employed to take care of the toilets. We have already employed 6,000 in as many gram panchayats where the toilets have been built. The government will pay Rs 6,000 per month each to the women who will be community toilets caretakers,” said additional chief secretary, rural development and panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh.As part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the state government is constructing 58,000 toilets in the gram panchayats. A sum of Rs 3 lakh is being given for the construction of a community toilet under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural-2.Women working in these toilets will be given sanitation kits, gloves, and toilet cleaners twice a year.“While 6,000 women toilet caretakers have been appointed, more would be appointed gradually as and when community toilets will be built in the remaining 52,000 gram panchayats. We are also doing a third party verification of toilets which have been completed and quality of construction,” said Manoj Kumar Singh.The women caretakers will do the cleaning at least twice a day. Apart from the salary of Rs 6,000 each, the department will pay Rs 500 per month for the repair of electricity fitment, plumbing, taps and for cleaning equipment like brooms, brushes, wipers, sponges, clothes, mop, bucket, mug etc. Rs 1,000 per month will be given to cover utility charges — water supply, electricity, solid waste management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/58k-women-to-manage-rural-community-toilets-in-up/story-gC5aSZjm9QKfE1pOLflybO.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||94 animals, birds rescued during a raid in Mumbai||The Thane wing of the Maharashtra forest department carried out a raid based on a tip-off that led to the interception of a truck carrying 94 caged animals and birds, which were rescued and the truck driver was arrested on early Wednesday morning.The forest department said they were assisted by animal welfare group Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA) during the raid.According to forest officials, 62 Indian rose-ringed parakeets, 12 plum headed parakeets, seven Indian palm squirrels, and 13 albino rabbits, were being delivered to south Mumbai as the truck was on route to Crawford Market. The truck was intercepted for inspection at Anand Nagar toll naka, Thane along the Eastern Express Highway. Some of the animals are protected under various Schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.“We had received a tip-off about this truck on Tuesday itself, and from 4.30 am onwards our team of forest officers and WWA were at a Dhaba keeping an eye on the truck. We spotted the vehicle around 6am. On further inquiry we found the animals and birds kept hidden at the back of the truck and arrested the driver,” said Narendra Muthe, range forest officer (Thane).The accused was identified as Shakil Ahmed Ansari, who was taken into forest custody. “A case was filed against Ansari. He was produced before a local district court but was granted bail later on Wednesday. However, further investigations into the source of these animals and birds is underway,” said Muthe.The animals and birds are in the custody of the department and their health is being monitored. They would be soon released based on the court’s order, added Muthe. This is the second instance of such a large raid this year after 88 wild animals rescued on October 30 with two persons arrested from a go-down cum apartment in Lalbaug by the same investigation teams.The Bombay high court in June 2017 had directed the Maharashtra government to shut down all illegal pet shops at Crawford market terming it a “black market” for wildlife trade but according to forest officials and wildlife activists, traders were quiet for a few years but a spike in trade was observed in 2020.WWA said the idea was to break the chain of supply of this illegal wildlife trade. “We are trying to intercept the origin of this trade. Crawford and Kurla markets continue to operate in full swing despite repeated raids this year across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region,” said Aditya Patil, president, WWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/94-animals-birds-rescued-during-a-raid-in-mumbai/story-0v0xr83DTfOE8OV6zNWWzJ.html

Work on listing the volunteers has begun from Monday,” he said.The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) earlier had shortlisted Prakhar Hospital as one of two centres for human trials.According to the health department, Zydus had done trials on 20 people in Kanpur last month and the details were not shared.But the process has been kept transparent for the third phase. Dr Tripathi, the chief guide for the trial, said the drug controller had given the approval and the vaccine stock would reach Kanpur soon.Fifty-seven more people were given Covaxin in the third trial in Kanpur. The volunteers included the doctors and engineers who were examined by an ICMR team, which is staying in Kanpur during this phase.Dr JS Kushwaha, the head of Prakhar Hospital, said none of the volunteers given this vaccine had complained of any side- effects so far.Only 13 volunteers went for doses at the Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College, where the trial of Sputnik vaccine was going on. Seven others refused. They developed cold feet after learning that a Haryana minister tested positive for Covid-19 even after he was given one dose of a vaccine.Prof Richa Giri, vice principal of the medical college, said people should come forward to participate.“There is no reason for them to be apprehensive. I think their fear stems from the social media posts on this issue. They need to realise vaccine is the only way we can defeat corona and they should be mentally prepared,” Prof Giri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kanpur-emerges-as-key-centre-for-vaccine-trials/story-EldkEcT3xqLuiuyMhOcmGK.html

The court said that this was a publicity” interest litigation and the petitioner had not done any homework before filing the plea.The court was hearing a plea by the Anti-Corruption Council of India Trust, through advocate Ashok Kumar Singh, claiming that according to news reports, several schools are allegedly collecting fee under various heads, other than tuition fee, and are denying access to online classes to those students who are unable to pay the fee.It contended that such actions are in violation of the Delhi government’s directions to schools to not charge anything more than tuition fee during the pandemic when all schools are shut .A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said the petitioner has not given any information regarding a particular school or how much fee was being charged in excess as alleged. It said that the whole plea was a “bogus matter” wherein vague terms have been used by the petitioner and no details have been given about the schools denying online classes to students. “The petition claims that ‘proper’ online classes are not being held…What is the meaning of proper?... It is such a vague term. Anything can be termed as not being proper,” the bench said.“Without doing any homework, this petition has been filed. No details have been given. It appears that this is a publicity interest litigation and not a public interest litigation (PIL),” it added.The bench said the litigation cost f ₹20,000 must be deposited within four weeks and would be used for access to justice programmes.It had claimed that according to the Delhi Parents Association there are 76 private schools which are in violation of the Delhi government direction.During the hearing, advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told the court that the government has issued two circulars --- on April 18 and August 28 -- where the directions were given to schools on the collection of fees while asking them only to charge tuition fee. He said that the orders are still in force till the end of the pandemic.“Schools are finding it impossible to manage their expenses with the meagre tuition fee being paid by a few, and on top of that, there are those having nothing to do with education, wanting some publicity. This culture of making schools the soft target and expecting everything for free will very soon spell doom for education in the city,” said advocate Kamal Gupta, counsel for the Action Committee for 400 Private schools. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-rejects-plea-against-pvt-schools-call-petition-a-publicity-litigation/story-MgWBNZNGsNDNdYm6FxkwSI.html

The bison weighed 700kg to 800kg, was 5.5 feet in height and was around three-four-years old. According to forest officials, the gaur is listed as Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is tagged as ‘vulnerable’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List.Despite the forest department succeeding in rescuing the animal from the urban area of Kothrud, the bison died later in captivity.“The bison was rescued on the second attempt, as the first attempt in Mahatma Society failed when despite residents being informed to stay indoors, they crowded to see the bison. We used nets and a tranquiliser gun, but the bison jumped and ran. He kept on running from humans and the fast approaching vehicles, for 12km, until the forest officials finally managed to capture him, with crowds on all sides,” said Anil Khaire, head of the rehabilitation and rescue centre, Katraj.“While treating him, the bison breathed his last. It was suffering from high pressure and myopathy , which is often a fatal, exertion- or stress-induced muscle degenerative condition affecting captured wild animals. The myopathy referred to relates to the muscle damage and weakness observed after a strenuous event,” said Rahul Patil, divisional forest official.The officials feel the biggest hurdle in capturing and rescuing the bison was the crowd of people, and trying to get a closer look of the bison.Retired forest official Sanjay Marne said, “When it comes to rescue or capture of wild animals, we have often maintained a good team of rescue workers and are equipped with enough tranquiliser guns and protection nets to cordon off the animal from running away. Here too, the officials had all their equipment, but the public is a major nuisance and causes lots of hurdles to a quiet rescue. It is a wild animal has not seen so many humans, hence, it tends to jump and run scared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crowding-onlookers-made-bison-rescue-all-but-impossible-to-be-safe/story-I6bmMFS9kMKtQXMzrLFcSM.html

There are 60 farmers from a single village who may have to lose their land, with the local MLA Suresh Jagtap also demanding shifting of the airport site, an issue that was discussed during Tuesday’s meeting between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, in Delhi. During the meeting, Rajnath Singh asked government officials to submit the proposal for the same on an urgent basis, said Jagtap, a Congress MLA who was present during the meeting. “Met defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Defense secretary and civil aviation secretary in New Delhi to discuss the proposed international airport at Purandar. The Maharashtra government has proposed to set up a new international airport in order to reduce the heavy air traffic load at Pune International airport. I insisted on the need to expedite work of the airport,” Pawar tweeted after the meeting Besides Jagtap, former Air chief marshal (retd) Bhushan Gokhale was also present at the meeting on Tuesday.The existing site was chosen in 2015 by the then Devendra Fadnavis government, as the previously selected area in Khed tehsil of Pune district received opposition from locals. After shifting the site to Purandar, the Fadnavis government expedited the process for all necessary approvals with the state government. However, with the new site being considered, state government will have to seek permissions from Air force, civil aviation and environment ministry, which may consume further time. As per the existing plan, the 2,832 hectares of land had been reserved for the Purandar Airport which would be named the Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje Pune International Airport. A total of seven villages were affected due to existing site and farmers from these villages - Pargaon, Rajewadi, Munjewadi, Vanpuri, Kumbalvalan, Ekhatpur and Udachi Wadi - were the use of land.According to Jagtap, he suggested shifting of site around 15 kms away from existing site. “At the new site, maximum land is owned by the government and only one village is getting affected,” said Jagtap, who gave a presentation for the new site in the presence of Pawar. “As the existing site will require more land acquisition to be done, the defense minister gave clear instructions to consider the suggestion for new site. Defence minister also instructed both civil aviation and defense secretary to make comparative proposals for the existing site and the proposed site urgently,” said Jagtap. Despite repeated attempts Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao did not respond to calls and messages. Rao had recently hinted that authorities are thinking about two to three sites in the same tehsil.The proposed airport had been planned on 2,000 hectares. Central and state governments had given all the necessary permissions but the actual land acquisition did not start. Total land acquisition cost is expected to be Rs4,000 crore for the existing site. If the new site gets approved, land acquisition cost will come down, said administrative sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/purandar-airport-likely-to-get-delayed-as-admin-identifies-fresh-strip-of-land-to-be-taken-over/story-iFSwXfxT8Qlti5zJsVUHkL.html

College of Arts and Craft second year BFA student Shivalika Yadav, along with five other students joined hands with Dastak Manch and Oxfam India to encourage women to speak up (Bol) against forced marriage (Marzi bina shaadi nahi).“We made graffiti on the flyover pillars near the New High Court building as many people commute along that stretch of the road. There is a traffic signal and people stop there. We felt our creativity will get eyeballs and will be helpful in sensitising the public,” said Yadav.She was joined by Bareeza Nazim, Hamna Fatima, Pragya Pal, Priyanshi Srivastav and Anshay Upmanyu. Together they have done four paintings, all themed on women’s empowerment. The students accomplished the task in four hours. More such graffiti is to be done in the days to come, she said.These students said they know about the consequences of early marriage and how it badly impacts married life. The event was part of the ongoing 16-day campaign ‘Stree - Paksh’ launched by Dastak Manch and Oxfam on November 25 with the lighting of 16 diyas - a symbolic representation of the endeavour to highlight gender-based issues through various informational and communicational programmes throughout the 16 days.Social activist Deepak Kabir said because of financial constraints and rising unemployment incidents of domestic violence /violence against women, rape cases and molestations have risen. Amidst such circumstances it was imperative to highlight these issues. Representatives from Oxfam and Sheroes Hangout are also supporting the cause. Veena, Sangita and Sanhita from Dastak Manch stood by Arts College students in this pursuit.‘Bol’ is a series of photo - poetry - poster exhibitions, portraying women’s voices through, poetry, photos, illustrations and posters and features prominent names such as Ranu Uniyal, Arshi Alvi, Sangita Jaiswal, Anupriya and Malvika Hariom. Nand Kishor of Oxfam stressed on the need to increase the awareness and impact of ‘Bano Nai Soch’ and ‘Marzi bina shaadi nahi’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-human-rights-day-graffiti-effort-to-sensitise-adolescent-girls-about-early-marriage/story-06Yo96G6yBxtiXJio6wkKN.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab minister Ashu set to head state badminton body||Punjab cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is all set to become the president of the Punjab Badminton Association (PBA). Confirming the development, the Punjab’s food and supply minister said, “I am contesting for the post of the PBA president.” Most likely, it will be unanimous elections, as the incumbent president Ashok Gupta, a retired Punjab bureaucrat, has decided not to contest the polls and it has been learnt that some of the members of the group in power have met the Punjab minister in Ludhiana and offered their unconditional support to him. “I can only comment about myself that I am not contesting in the elections,” said Gupta. On the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the state sports department is holding the elections of the state badminton unit on December 13. The filing of the nomination is on Wednesday (December 9), while the withdrawal is December 10. The sports department has formed a three-member committee, comprising deputy commissioners of Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar, to conduct the elections. Acting on a petition filed in 2018 by Rajesh Tandon in the high court against PBA for non-adoption of the national sports code on the lines of the parent body, Badminton Association of India (BAI), the court issued directions to the state sports ministry to sort out the matter. As per the BAI’s constitution and national sports code, each of the 19 affiliated district units have two votes each, making the electoral college of 38 votes. “Sixteen district units have openly announced their support in favor of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, so most likely it will be a unanimous election,” says former national-level badminton player Ritin Khanna, who is part of Jalandhar district’s executive body. Hurdles ahead Rajinder Kalsi, who is currently the honorary general secretary of PBA, claims that he has not been kept in the loop, while announcing the elections. “The current elections are not held as per the PBA constitution, which was revised in August 2019 and approved by the general house. As per the current PBA constitution, the electoral college is of 51 votes, which includes two votes each of the 19 district units and 13 votes of executive members,” says Kalsi. “As per my knowledge, the BAI is not sending an observer, which is mandatory for holding the state unit elections.” After the elections on December 13, the main challenge for the newly elected body of PBA will be to get the national body’s approval. “Nobody is challenging the current elections, as the state machinery is involved. But getting affiliation from BAI will be a challenge. And someone might approach the BAI or the court challenging the elections,” said an official in the PBA’s incumbent body, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-minister-ashu-set-to-head-state-badminton-body/story-VOeJhPp8pQCZm4UIPrtV0H.html
09-12-2020||City||Andhra ‘mystery’ illness: Latest tests disclose presence of pesticide residues in drinking water||As Andhra Pradesh health department looks into the source of heavy metals like lead and nickel in the blood samples of people in Eluru town who suffered from a mysterious disease in the past three days, latest tests revealed the presence of high residues of pesticides in drinking water samples. The disease left one dead and over 500 people with symptoms ranging from giddiness and convulsions to epilepsy.Reports of water samples tested by a Vijayawada-based private laboratory at the instance of Eluru Municipal Corporation (which were seen by Hindustan Times) indicated that the drinking water supplied to areas like Gandhi Colony, Ramachandra Rao Peta, Pension Line Area and JP Colony contained high quantities of various pesticide residues, thousands of times more than the permissible limits. Drinking water sample obtained from Gandhi Colony contained 14.21 milligrams per litre (mg/lit) of a pesticide OP-DDD (Ortho-Para Dichloro-Diphenyl Dichloroethane) and 15.23 mg/lit of another pesticide PP-DDD. Another sample collected from Ramachandra Rao Pet contained 10.89 mg/lit of pesticide Alachlor and 13.37 mg/lit of OP-DDE. Water samples collected from other areas also contained high quantity of Alachlor, DDE, DDD and DDT pesticides. The samples were sent to the laboratory for testing on Sunday and the reports were submitted to the state health department on Tuesday night. “Test results of another 15 samples have come on Wednesday,” a senior official in the food safety division of Eluru municipal corporation told HT on condition of anonymity. According to the official, parts of Eluru town get water supply from Godavari river and Krishna river through canals. Water samples from these canals were also tested and they were found to have residues of Alachlor and Methoxychlor to the extent of 10.88 mg/litre to as high as 17.64 mg/litre. “The maximum permissible limit of these pesticide residues in all these water samples is <0.001 mg/litre,” the official quoted above said. More water samples of various other localities were also sent to another private laboratory and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) in Hyderabad for corroboration. Interestingly, the laboratory tests of these drinking water samples have shown only minute traces of heavy metals like lead and nickel which were within permissible limits, but strangely, the blood samples of the affected patients tested by All India Institute of Medical Sciences showed high incidence of these metals. “It is a strange phenomenon. But we suspect that the high presence of heavy metals in the blood samples of patients could be due to a process called biomagnification – accumulation in blood over a period of time and it will lead to symptoms of neuro-toxicity,” the official said. Eluru government hospital superintendent AVR Mohan, who explained the latest developments to chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in a video conference, said apart from heavy metals like lead, presence of pesticides also was also responsible for the mysterious disease. “But there is nothing to worry. The incidence of the disease is getting reduced,” he said. Ever since the mysterious disease surfaced in Eluru town on Saturday night, the municipal corporation authorities have been making efforts to find out the source of contamination of water. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the trouble could have started after the heavy rains and floods in October and November. “There were flash floods to Tammileru river near Eluru, resulting in the breach of bund and flooding of crops and aquaculture ponds. While there is a heavy usage of pesticides in these crops and bromine in aquaculture, the run-off water could have entered the municipal water storage tank at Denduluru on the outskirts of Eluru town,” the municipal corporation official quoted above said. Incidentally, the places which were affected in the town are those which are close to that municipal water tank. They receive water first, so they must have been affected first, he said. In the past 48 hours, the authorities have been supplying mineral water to the people in the affected areas, instead of municipal water. “Now, the cases of mysterious disease are coming down,” the official said. As of now, only 76 people are undergoing treatment and they would also be discharged shortly, the hospital authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/andhra-mystery-illness-latest-tests-disclose-presence-of-pesticide-residues-in-drinking-water/story-0ijMz4H1sUZ1hVCEKiQEdL.html

09-12-2020||City||Goa restaurateur, accused of allegedly molesting dyslexic minor girl, granted bail||The Bombay high court at Goa has granted bail to Varun Nayyar, a prominent restaurateur who was accused of allegedly raping a minor mentally challenged girl in a hotel room back in August. Although the complaint was filed against unknown persons, Nayyar, 30, was arrested after eyewitnesses told the police that he was seen in the hotel along with the 13-year-old girl. The girl’s mother filed a police complaint after her daughter narrated her ordeal, stating that an unknown person came in a car, picked her up from the road, took her to a hotel, and molested her in the room. When she raised an alarm, he let go of her and then dropped her back from where he had picked her.Nayyar, through his lawyers, argued that it was a case of mistaken identity and pointed out that neither the victim nor the so-called star witnesses, who are said to have seen the her in his company, could identify him in the test identification parade. The prosecution however, opposed his bail alleging that the case involves a minor girl, who suffers from dyslexia. Therefore, the applicant cannot take advantage of the fact that she could not recognise him. However, the court decided in favour of the accused, pointing to the prima facie flimsy evidence against him. “Three alleged eye witnesses, who are said to have seen the victim in the (accused’s) company have failed to identify [him] in the test identification parade. Even the victim’s testimony and the medical evidence--I stress,only prima facie--have not been conclusive for us to draw any inference that there has been any rape or molestation,” the high court bench of justice Dama Seshadri Naidu, said. “When the victim girl resisted the applicant’s alleged attempt, he is said to have allowed her to get dressed and dropped her at the place from where he had picked her up. In this case, the investigation has been completed and a charge sheet filed. The perpetrator’s identity remains unascertainable. A pre-trial bail cannot be treated as exoneration of the applicant from the crime.In the meanwhile, it is inequitable to let the applicant suffer pre-trial incarceration only based on the gravity of the offence, without anything more on the record to link him with the crime,” the high court said. Nayyar has been asked to cooperate with the investigation, not influence or intimidate witnesses, to keep the police informed of his whereabouts, and make himself available as and when called for.Nayyar, who owns the popular Delhi Darbar chain of restaurants in Goa, has been incarcerated since his arrest in mid-August and his previous bail applications by the sessions court were rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-restaurateur-accused-of-allegedly-molesting-dyslexic-minor-girl-granted-bail/story-6jGmTkr8oOv1Pu3b31TYjO.html

By noon, the gaur had been tranquillised by forest officials, who took him for medical examination. During the tranquillization, the guar sustained injuries as the animal tried to escape. However, the gaur died while being taken to the forest. The officials said that after running non-stop for five hours, the animal died due to exhaustion. Rahul Patil, divisional forest officer, Maharashtra Forest Department (Pune Circle), said, “Primary cause of the gaur’s death is high stress due to exertion and increase in the body temperature.” Some locals spotted the bison, listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red list since 1986, at Mahatma society, which is surrounded by hills. The animal was frightened and probably hurt by stray dogs in the early morning hours, according to resident witnesses.A team of forest personnel rushed to the spot at 8am and police personnel were also deployed in the area to control the crowd which came out to see the animal. Prima facie, the animal is suspected to have ventured into the residential society from the Mulshi forest area located nearby, said Rahul Patil.“The forest department sent a team of forest officials who tranquillised him after five hours,” said Patil. Patil said, “It is surprising for us too to see a gaur so far away from the forest.” Following the spotting of the animal, large number of locals rushed to the spot. Disturbed by the crowd, the animal damaged a few vehicles, including two cars along with entrance gate of a housing society. Prashant Deshpande, a resident of Mahatma Society and the first one to call the rescue and rehabilitation centre, Katraj, said, “I was woken up by a sound of something crashing in the adjoining open plot at 6.30 am. From my terrace, I saw this tall, large bull, jumping off a wooden plank off the Mahatma Society compound wall and then moving around until he settled under a tree. I immediately called the rescue team and was waiting for them to arrive. Meanwhile, morning walkers had already begun to speculate about the bull and realized that it was an Indian bison.”Anil Khaire, head of the rescue and rehabilitation centre, Katraj was first on the spot, said, “The bison was hurt and was scared of seeing so many people. When we first approached it with a tranquillizer gun and a protection net to cordon off his run, he jumped over the net and ran into the street. There he ran for almost 12km non-stop and then we captured him by casting a protective net formation and the forest officials took him to Bavdhan transit centre for treatment before transporting him to the jungle near the city.” However, all this running caused the bison to die due to exhaustion. According to Patil, “We were readying the bison to be taken to Tamhini jungle, when he died due to high pressure, and temperature. People did not cooperate and crowded a lot to see the large bovine, which is one of the vulnerable species. It is an unfortunate incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/indian-bison-strays-into-residential-area-in-pune-dies-due-to-cardiac-arrest-during-rescue-ops/story-swJIEkce4E781KIkQXfxDP.html

Although the city has a state storage in its jurisdiction, the civic body will rely on the state health department’s walk-in storage facility and its own deep freezers to store the Covid-19 vaccine.Dr Ashish Bharti, civic health chief said, “The PMC does not have its own walk-in cold storage facility, but we have 55 ice-laced refrigerators and 35 deep freezers. They can maintain a temperature of about 2-8 degrees Celsius and can store about 3-5 lakh doses at a time. Given that we currently have only 44,000 healthcare workers who have registered with us, we won’t need a lot of storage capacity. Most private hospitals have not registered their staff with us and so they won’t be eligible for the same.”Currently, the state storage unit is located at the state’s family planning and welfare department located near Naidu hospital, which will also work as storage for Pune city’s vaccine needs.A senior civic staffer assigned with the vaccination drive, but speaking on condition of anonymity said, “We are yet to get guidelines for the vaccination drive, but during a morning video conference call on Tuesday we were told that we have to set up vaccination booths like election booths; which will have three rooms; waiting room, vaccination room and observation room. We will send an e-certificate once a person completes the two-dose course which happens in a 28-day timeframe. We will get a detailed guidelines on the same soon and the staff will also undergo training on the same.” While the civic body is preparing for storage and registration of the vaccine beneficiaries, there are still no guidelines on whether antibody tests would be necessary before a person is vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-covid-vaccine-storage-plan-55-ice-laced-refrigerators-35-deep-freezers/story-40uPmWxbIynz0hZLaSIChJ.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||SHO suspended after illegal liquor factory unearthed in Punjab’s Rajpura||Patiala A day after an illegal liquor factory was unearthed in Patiala district’s Rajpura town, the station house officer was on Wednesday placed under suspension and show-cause notices were issued to the superintendent of police, detective, the deputy superintendent of police, detective, and the crime investigation agency (CIA) in-charge. Taking a serious note of the police laxity, Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vikram Jeet Duggal said there was a zero-tolerance policy towards spurious liquor and no police officer would be spared in Patiala district for showing leniency in dealing with crime control in the district. FACTORY WAS RUNNING FOR OVER A WEEK The role of the town’s police is under question as the DSP said that the factory was running for a week, while financial commissioner, taxation, A Venu Parsad confirmed that the unit was in place for a month-and-a-half. Despite the police intelligence wing’s alert of large-scale liquor smuggling in the area, the police failed to make any arrest. Excise officials, however, unearthed another liquor factory.Venu, who visited the spot with excise commissioner Rajat Aggarwal, said “Our investigation shows that the factory was running for the past one-and-a-half months. The ENA was pilfered with help of drivers. As we have installed GPRS in trucks carrying Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA) movement, the basic raw material, the accused chose a site near the highway. The printed material was procured from Delhi, while ENA was blended with water to make liquor.” He said that police will investigate further. KEY ACCUSED WAS KINGPIN OF SHAMBU RACKET The SSP said that based on the information provided by excise officials, a case was registered under Sections 420, 465, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code and under the Excise Act against Dipesh Grover of Rajpura and Karaj Singh of Shamaspur village of Rajpura. Grover was the kingpin of an illegal liquor factory busted at Shambu in Patiala district. “We are concerned as Dipesh has again indulged in illegal sale of liquor, after coming out of bail in similar case. I have asked officials to nab his links, who were supplying ENA. We are also investigating as to who was selling the packed liquor,” the SSP said, adding action had taken against erring officials. AAP PROTESTS Seeking action against local Congress MLAs for the illegal trade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held a massive protest in Rajpura Town and burnt the effigy of Captain Amarinder Singh and local MLA Hardial Kamboj. “Patiala has not seen any major project over the past four years, but it has became a hub of illicit liquor. All this is mushrooming under the patronage of Congress leaders. Dipesh is a close aide of two Congress MLAs and the case should be shifted to any other agency to bring out role of politicians,” said Harchand Barsat and Neena Mittal, senior AAP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sho-suspended-after-illegal-liquor-factory-unearthed-in-punjab-s-rajpura-town/story-smTkavNHI62mBzOqbfzXqM.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC convicts HIV positive man of rape, acquits him of attempt to murder||Sexual activity by a person infected by HIV will not attract the offence of attempt to murder, observed the Delhi High Court which upheld the conviction of an HIV positive man for raping his minor step daughter but acquitted him of the offence of attempting to murder the victim.The trial court had said that the act of the accused amounted to attempt to murder as he had the knowledge that being HIV positive his crime could have resulted in transmitting the potentially lethal disease causing death. However, the high court which noted that there was no intention to kill the victim, said there was no material furnished along with the charge sheet to establish that the victim was infected with AIDS or was HIV positive and even her tests for HIV had yielded a negative result.The high court did not agree with the trial court’s reasoning that since the man was aware that his acts could result in transmitting the potentially lethal disease, he had knowingly committed an act, which if resulted in transmitting of HIV and the victim’s death from it would amount to murder. Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the high court does not concur with the trial court’s view that the appellant man was guilty of the offence of attempt to murder.“The import of holding so would also mean that any sexual activity by a person infected by HIV is punishable under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC, notwithstanding that his or her partner has consented to such sexual activity. “This is because the culpable act under Section 307 of the IPC does not cease to be one if the victim of such an act has also consented to the same,” the high court said.It further said “if the reasoning adopted by the trial court is extended further, it would also mean that a healthy person, who willingly engages in unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV positive partner and as a result acquires the disease that eventually proves fatal, would have committed suicide.“And the HIV positive partner would be guilty of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC if not guilty of committing murder,” it said.The high court was deciding the appeal filed by the man who was held guilty by the trial court of the offence of raping his step daughter, who was around 15-year-old at the time of offence in 2015, and since he was infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), he was also convicted for the offence of attempt to murder.Besides rape and attempt to murder, the trial court in 2012, had also convicted the man for the offence of causing miscarriage without woman’s consent and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.Though the man has been acquitted of the offence of causing miscarriage of the woman by the high court, he would have to spend 10 years in jail for the offence of rape.The high court noted that the man had not raped the victim with an intention of causing her death.According to the prosecution, the man was lonely after the death of his wife, who was also HIV positive, and he had sexually preyed on his step daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-convicts-hiv-positive-man-of-rape-acquits-him-of-attempt-to-murder/story-4EZ5sAA5NeLoiZStYMLlMN.html

The incident took place at Lath Market, situated in Bada Bazar area, barely 800 metres from the Town police station. Police said six robbers entered the shop at around 10.30 am, posing as customers, while others took positions outside the shop. There were no other customers and only employees were present at the shop.“Posing as customers, robbers entered our shop and asked us to show diamond necklaces. We did not notice anything wrong in their behaviour. All of them were in their mid-30s and were speaking in both Hindi and Bhojpuri,” said an employee of the shop. One of the eyewitnesses, Santosh Kumar Lath, said the armed bandits fired two rounds inside the shop and asked the staff to hand over all gold ornaments and not attempt to raise an alarm. When the shop owners resisted their attempt, they hit them with pistol butts.“They further threatened to kill the staff and owners if they did not cooperate,” said Lath. “We were scared and could not dare to raise an alarm as the goons were holding their guns at us. We had to allow them to take away whatever we had and handed them the safe keys. They stuffed all the ornaments inside their bags,” said another employee.

09-12-2020||Lucknow||UP may soon allow private institutes to use 14 airstrips for training pilots, technicians||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has approved, in principle, the proposed policy for utilising fourteen civil aviation airstrips in the state for training by private flying institutions.The proposed policy envisages facilitation of running courses for training pilots, aviation engineers, technicians, flight dispatchers, and cabin crew personnel. “While giving the approval, the chief minister asked the officers concerned to study similar policies of other states,” said a state government press statement after a presentation made before Yogi on the proposed policy.Chief minister’s additional chief secretary, SP Goel, and special secretary, civil aviation department, Surendra Singh made the presentation at a meeting at the chief minister’s residence.“The state has an immense potential for civil aviation and the state has made significant stride in the direction. Development work on Kushinagar airport is over and the licencing process is on. There has been an approval for five airstrips for Noida airport,” he said at the meeting. Yogi also said that several airstrips in the state were being scaled up into airports. Infrastructure development in the sphere of civil aviation would consolidate connectivity, he said. During the presentation, the CM was told that the state has seven functional airports, one more is ready, and twelve airports are in the development stage. Apart from this, UP also has eight airstrips. And for creating skilled manpower for the civil aviation area, the state had made a policy in 2007. In these 13 years, there have been many changes in civil aviation sector and hence, a new policy is being made.After the CM’s approval, the draft policy would go to the Cabinet for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-may-soon-allow-private-institutes-to-use-14-airstrips-for-training-pilots-technicians/story-SfM7AZDhbBWNEdMfuMfquO.html

Now give your best shot to make it to the hip societies of your college. And needless to say, this is happening online, too!Arvada, president of Adhrita: The Indian Dance Society of Hindu College, says, “We are conducting online auditions in two rounds. Round one will have students, who are interested, send a two-minute video of them performing any dance form, and for round two, we will be conducting an online workshop with a choreographer, who will judge the ability of these students to learn within a stipulated time.” And Stephanians aren’t behind when it comes to hand picking the best talent for their ECA societies! “Of course every society wants the best talent to join in so that competitions and fests can be real fun,” says Hamza Matto, vice president of Bazm-e-Adab, Urdu Literary Society at St Stephen’s College. He adds, “The USP of our society is qawwali night and Eid lunch, but those can’t happen digitally... We recently organised an online orientation for the students, where everyone recited poetry live, and the old society members were introduced to the freshers. It was a very different feeling to e-meet, but we all enjoyed ourselves.” Most society presidents say they would prefer conducting offline auditions, but freshers have been responding so enthusiastically to even online activities that they don’t mind changing their mindset for the time duration of the pandemic. “All this is difficult for us, however we have to do this for the time being. We started with orientation, and introduced our society digitally to the freshers,” says Fatima Naz Jamali, president of Moksh, The Dramatics Society of Sri Aurobindo College, sharing that since semester began later this year, exams are round the corner, and they need time to prepare. “Auditions we’ll host digitally in the next few months; we are all hoping the campus might reopen then. For now we are forming WhatsApp groups, and updating videos of our society’s performances from previous years, so that the freshers can join and understand how #DramSoc works in our college. The freshers are really excited; we have been receiving endless calls from aspiring freshers about what happens in the dramatics society. In auditions, we might ask the students to act impromptu. Later, we’ll have online sessions where scriptwriting, storytelling and dramatic society’s games will be taught,” adds Jamali. Speaking about the good response from freshers, Arvada adds, “Students have been enthusiastic and excited uptill now. They are reaching out to us to get an idea of what kind of videos they have to shoot. They are also trying to get an idea about how extra curricular activities add another aspect to their college life. We are used to teaching new dance forms physically, so it’s really difficult for us to teach any new folk dance form digitally. But we are planning to host online workout sessions every week, and teach choreographies through small workshops.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/du-societies-what-s-the-buzz-in-eca/story-blczxmpKgWQwAziqExwGRI.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Rape a heinous crime, there can be no leniency in conviction: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court on Tuesday enhanced punishment of a rape convict from three to seven years imprisonment, observing that rape is a heinous crime which cannot be viewed with any leniency.“A rape victim is left with a feeling of degradation, humiliation and guilt for the rest of her life,” said the division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NJ Jamadar. “Once the court finds the evidence of victim to be trustworthy, conviction would follow, and the conviction should be followed by a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence,” the bench insisted.The court said that the Supreme Court, in a catena of judgements, has held that the society cannot look upon a woman with derision, depravity, contempt and as an object of desire. “Rape amounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of a woman. She is forced to live with indignation throughout her life,” said HC, while disapproving the lenient approach of the Mumbai sessions court in sentencing a hotelier’s son convicted for raping and impregnating a minor who worked at his house as a maid.The court was irked to note that though the trial court convicted the man, it handed him only three-year imprisonment -- less than the minimum sentence provided for the offence -- without assigning any special reasons.In August 1992, the survivor approached Gamdevi police station, complaining that during the period, man ravished her a number of times and his mother later took her to a hospital for abortion.After the doctor refused to medically terminate the pregnancy, the minor was allegedly taken to a rescue home, with a stern warning from the mother of the accused to surrender the child there.The survivor then delivered a child at the state-run JJ Hospital. The child was, however, allegedly taken away after she was discharged from the hospital and thereafter, she was kept confined in the house. The minor managed to escape and reached JJ Hospital, where a nurse helped her.In August 1992, the survivor lodged complaint with Gamdevi police station. Both, the man and his mother were prosecuted for various offences, but on June 15, 2006, an additional sessions judge acquitted the mother while convicting the man for rape and sentenced him to three years’ rigorous imprisonment. The convict then moved the high court, challenging his conviction, whereas the state government too filed an appeal for enhancement of sentence handed down to him.The court on Tuesday dismissed the appeal, upheld his conviction, and observed that the survivor’s testimony was duly corroborated by the other evidence on record.The court also enhanced the sentence to seven years’ imprisonment, directing the convict, who was out on bail during pendency of the appeal, to surrender on January 4, 2021, for serving the remainder term.“It needs to be painfully observed that despite there being material evidence against the accused No. 2 (mother), the learned Sessions Court has recorded acquittal,” said the bench. “It was incumbent upon the State to file an appeal against acquittal, in view of the fact that the victim was subjected to harassment, she was brutally assaulted, she was forced to abandon her child, which in fact is an offence punishable under section 317 of the Indian Penal Code.”HC also expressed anguish over the fact that the survivor had given birth to a child who lived with her hardly for six days and thereafter, the child was brutally snatched away by the mother of the accused, who abandoned the child, which eventually died. “It is unfortunate that she was not even informed about the demise of her child.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rape-a-heinous-crime-there-can-be-no-leniency-in-conviction-bombay-hc/story-E6tdJ7G5r8ot2i199m3XrI.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||BKU (Ugrahan) alleges cold shoulder by farmer unions, says not invited for talks||The Left-backed Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), which has a significant following in south Punjab, on Wednesday alleged that it had not been called for talks by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, comprising 30 other farm organisations, at Singhu border to decide on the stand to be taken after the Centre shares its draft proposal. Though the sixth round of talks between agitating farmers and the Centre scheduled on Wednesday has been cancelled, a meeting of farmer union leaders will be held to decide on the course of action on the draft proposal. BKU Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the Morcha had agreed for talks with Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday night without taking his faction on board. Also read: Will consider govt’s ‘written’ proposal only on repeal of farm laws, not amendment: Farmers’ leaderFourteen leaders from various farmer unions met Shah but the government did not invite the Ugrahan faction. “The Morcha did not contact us either for today’s meeting at Singhu on the Haryana-Delhi border to decide on the future course,” he said. GOVT TRYING TO DIVIDE FARM UNIONS: UGRAHAN The government is trying to divide the unions and the Morcha leaders should be aware of the Centre’s design to derail the mass movement against the three farm laws, he said. “We will take a decision on the future course after consulting other unions but the Morcha should have insisted that the Centre hold talks in the presence of representatives of all farmer unions participating in the agitation,” he said. “It is good to know that the delegation did not agree to an offer of amendments as the farming community demands the rollback of the three laws and two ordinances back,” Ugrahan added. THIRD INCIDENT OF DIFFERENCE WITH OTHERS In the past two weeks, Ugrahan has differed thrice with 30 other farm unions of Punjab on the course of the agitation. On November 26, all farmer unions, barring the BKU (Ugrahan), undertook the Dilli Chalo protest, forcibly entering Haryana from Punjab after breaking barricades. The next day, the Ugrahan faction blamed the joint forum for breaching the understanding reached by national farmer unions that activists will undertake indefinite dharnas, wherever the authorities stop them. On November 25, Ugrahan had criticised the two-month-long rail blockade by farmer organisations, saying it was wrong as it had hit the industrial and agricultural interests of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bku-ugrahan-alleges-cold-shoulder-by-farmer-unions-says-not-invited-for-talks/story-W9mxmmQvSTFFU5mlZrC9JJ.html

Around 6pm on Tuesday evening, when BJP candidate Rubina Khan, who had won from Panchayat Samiti Fatehpur Ward No 19 and was taking out a winning procession, some persons from the crowd caught a young person and started assaulting him,” said a police official from Sikar district. He added that soon after the supporters of the Congress candidate also came out, resulting in a fight between the two groups. “People clashed with each other with sticks in their hands. Some started stone pelting houses of the locals. On receiving the information, police reached the spot and controlled the situation. However, in the meantime, 35-year-old Kanhaiyalal and his 57-year-old father Pyarelal got seriously injured in the attack.Also Read: BJP leads Congress in Rajasthan panchayat polls, dubs it verdict on Gehlot govt10 more people were injured, who were immediately rushed to a local hospital, the official said.

Based on specific inputs, a team of NCB officials led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede arrested Rigel Mahakala from Andheri (West) and seized hashish, ecstasy pills and Rs16 lakh in cash. “Rigel supplied drugs to Anuj Keshwani who was earlier arrested by NCB,” said Wankhede. In September, following Kaizan Ibrahim’s interrogation, NCB had raided Keshwani’s Khar residence and seized 590 grams of hashish, 0.64 grams of LSD sheets, 304 grams of marijuana, including imported marijuana joints and capsules, Rs185,200 in cash and 5,000 in Indonesian currency. Ibrahim was among the peddlers who allegedly supplied marijuana to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, said NCB officials. Wankhede added, “The operation is currently on and we have also arrested a big supplier of drugs. He supplied drugs to Rigel and to other peddlers who move around in the Bollywood industry. We will share his details once the legal process of arrest is completed.” NCB, which has been investigating the drug angle in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, has till now arrested over 20 persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bollywood-drug-case-ncb-arrests-2-key-suppliers-seizes-drugs-worth-rs2-5-crore/story-MWTSrSMNQMEjbyAp1hT21N.html
09-12-2020||City||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s active case tally continues to drop||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dropped to be lowest in the past five months on Tuesday. On the day, there were 73,374 active cases, which is a gradual fall from 301,752 cases on September 17, the highest that the state has reported. The daily caseload has stabilised over the past few weeks with around 5,000 daily cases. The number of recovered patients over the past eight days is at the daily average of 6,495 which is more than fresh infections, according to the state health department statement. This has helped the authorities in reducing the number of patients admitted to the Covid-19 facilities. Maharashtra reported its highest daily caseload of 24,619 on September 17 with highest active cases on the same day. Since then, the number of daily infections and active cases has seen a gradual drop. The state had reported 73,298 active cases -- almost the same as the current level -- on June 29, after which the number kept rising. On November 7, the number dropped below 100,000 cases. Also read | 32,080 new cases push India’s Covid-19 tally over 9.73 mn; recoveries above 9.21 mnHigh population density districts like Mumbai, Pune, and Thane account for the highest number of active patients. Currently, Pune has 15,344 active cases followed by 14,039 in Thane and 12,231 in Mumbai. The drop in the number of active cases has been reported when the state authorities are still expecting the potential second wave in January after a drop in the winter temperature. “We have been augmenting our health infrastructure to be prepared to take up additional burden of the cases in case of a spike. The current dip in the active cases has helped us ease the burden on the health machinery,” said an official from the health department. Meanwhile, 10% of the active cases in the state are reported to be critical. As on December 2, as many as 9,937 cases were critical with the number of active cases being 90,557 on the day. “It is a good sign that the daily caseload has dropped below 5,000 from around 24,000 cases mid-September. But the state authorities need to go for aggressive tracing of the suspected contacts...that’s where the machinery is lagging, according to our observations. These contacts keep spreading the virus to others rapidly. Tracing and testing should not be compromised even though the number of cases has been witnessing a fall,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, state president, Indian Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-maharashtra-s-active-case-tally-continues-to-drop/story-qzIJv8XPqxtPw2JZ9AgJ1I.html

09-12-2020||Patna||Cold winds enter Bihar region, likely to bring dense fog, dip in mercury||Several places in Bihar including central and southern parts of the state along with capital Patna are likely to experience dense fog and fall in mercury from Wednesday, said officials of Patna meteorological centre.As per the 5-day forecast, minimum temperature in the state is predicted to hover around 13 to 14 degrees Celsius while maximum temperature is likely to be around 24 degrees Celsius.On Tuesday, Patna recorded a minimum temperature of 15.4 degrees Celsius, which was four notches below the normal while maximum temperature stood at 26.8 degrees Celsius. Gaya remained the coldest in the state with the lowest minimum temperature of 11 degrees Celsius.Officials at Patna meteorological centre said that moderate fog is likely to prevail in the eastern parts and shallow fog at other parts for the next two days.“Significant change in weather conditions can be felt from today. Cold north-westerly winds entered the Bihar region on Tuesday which is expected to bring day and night temperature down from Wednesday onwards. Even during daytime, sunlight has low heat. The winter condition is likely to become colder due to the fall in day and night temperature, if the speed of wind intensifies in coming days,” said Sudhanshu, a meteorologist.“Dense fog is likely over places situated near water bodies while moderate fog is likely at other places for the next two days. Fog is favourable for Rabi crops but it obstructs flight services due to poor visibility”, he added.Also Read: Intense western disturbance to bring rain to plains, heavy snowfall to Western HimalayasExplaining the fog formation, meteorologist SK Patel said, “A cyclonic circulation extending up to 1.5 km above mean sea level is lying over Rajasthan and neighbourhood. Due to formation of cyclonic circulation, humid condition prevails at lower-level of atmosphere. Pollutant particles rise in the atmosphere in the presence of humidity and wind which leads to formation of fog.” According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, Patna’s 24-hour AQI based on six air monitoring stations was 315 with PM2.5 and PM10 prominent pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/cold-winds-enter-bihar-region-likely-to-bring-dense-fog-dip-in-mercury/story-em9PgESLY4DHtzrjVtdHhM.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Moderate fog today as well; Delhi’s AQI in poor category||The fog spell that has been enveloping the city for the past two days is likely to continue on Wednesday, with lesser intensity, according to the India Meteorological Department. Scientists said that even though moderate fog is expected on Wednesday, the air quality remained in the very poor zone. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that at 6am, the average air quality index of Delhi was 355.The average air quality index (AQI) was 383 in the very poor zone on Tuesday. It was 400, almost touching the severe mark on Monday. On a scale of 0-500, an AQI value between 301-400 is considered very poor while 401-500 is severe. At least 10 of the 35 monitoring stations, including hot spots, however, continued to be in the severe category.“The high moisture content, which was an impact of the easterly winds, started to reduce on Tuesday and hence the intensity of fog cover was less. We expect moderate fog in Delhi over the next three to four days. Though moisture has reduced, the wind speed did not pick up much, therefore, no significant improvement was seen in the air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He added that no major variation is expected in the air quality over the coming week. The average wind speed on Tuesday was 5-6 kmph, not favourable for dispersion of pollutants. “The wind speed is likely to remain around 10 kmph over the next three days. Also, Delhi may see very light rain or drizzle on December 11 on account of a Western Disturbance that will affect the whole of northwest India, including Delhi. Till at least December 12, there will be no significant change in the morning and night temperatures,” said Srivastava.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 9.5 degrees C, a notch above normal. The maximum settled at 28.3 degrees C, four notches above normal.As per System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM 2.5 levels was negligible. “The major factors influencing Delhi’s air quality at present include reduced ventilation index and fog formation. Air quality is likely to remain in very poor category over the next two days,” the SAFAR bulletin stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/moderate-fog-today-as-well-delhi-s-aqi-in-poor-category/story-4U13SAd13kVAlPakTR2uUN.html
09-12-2020||City||TMC MP Mahua Moitra draws flak, media boycott for ‘2 paisa’||Days after referring to the media as a “two paisa” entity, Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra was boycotted by two prominent Bengali news channels on Tuesday evening and strongly criticised by journalists across the state. On Sunday, while attending a party meeting at Gayeshpur in Nadia district from where she is elected, Moitra lost her temper on seeing some local reporters. What she said thereafter was recorded by someone who shared it on social media. “Who has invited this two-paisa press here? A meeting is on and everybody is eager to see their faces in papers and television….,” Moitra can be heard saying in the short video clip that has gone viral. HT has seen the video. The Kolkata Press Club, the first institution of its kind set up in the country in 1945, condemned her remark and demanded an apology. Journalists across Bengal used the image of an old two paisa coin as their avatars on social media pages. Many of them wrote sharp posts against the TMC. On Monday, Moitra, who did not take calls from journalists, tweeted a meme featuring the image of a two paisa coin and a message that said “I apologize for the mean hurtful accurate things I said.” “My meme-editing skills are improving!” she wrote in the tweet. While this drew more flak, the TMC leadership on Tuesday distanced itself from the young MP. “What she said is her statement, not the party’s opinion. Mamata Banerjee believes in the media and shares information with the press. We maintain a cordial relationship with the media even if you write against us,” panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee said at a press conference at the TMC headquarters on Tuesday afternoon. Also Read: ‘Armed men in rally killed BJP worker’Education minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee also described the incident as an unfortunate one and said his party respects the media. An online magazine on Monday also reported that Moitra told it that standards of Kolkata Press Club members have fallen abysmally. Moitra even shared this report on Twitter. Also Read: Court in Bengal orders second autopsy of BJP workers killed in SiliguriReacting to this, Snehasis Sur, a veteran journalist and president of the Kolkata Press Club, said, “We don’t need to hear from Moitra how this institution has contributed to journalism during Independence, the Bangladesh war or the Emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-mp-mahua-moita-draws-flak-media-boycott-for-2-paisa/story-6o964yu5wy3gGFX7fu9QkI.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC pulls up jail officials for denying eyeglasses to Gautam Navlakha||The Bombay high court on Tuesday criticised authorities at Mumbai’s Taloja jail for refusing to give activist Gautam Navlakha, who is currently in jail in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case, a pair of spectacles and called for workshops for jail officials.The court’s comments came a day after Navlakha’s partner Sahba Hussain alleged that the 70-year-old activist, who is facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, found that his spectacles had been stolen inside jail, and that prison authorities didn’t permit a replacement.“We gather from news reports that Navlakha has lost his spectacles in jail and when his family took him a new pair, the jail authorities refused to accept them,” said the bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik. “Can this (spectacles) be denied,” the bench asked. “These are human considerations. Humanity is most important, everything else will follow subsequently,” the judges added.The court was hearing separate petitions filed by Ramesh Gaichor and Sagar Gorkhe -- two other activists also arrested in the same case -- questioning their arrest.Navlakha has been in Taloja jail since his arrest on October 1, 2018.On Monday, Hussain said, “He [Navlakha] is allowed to speak to me only once a week. On November 30, he told me that his spectacles were stolen and that he was under stress. My question is how can spectacles be stolen inside the jail? Particularly, because he removes them only when he goes to sleep.”She added that Navlakha’s spectacles were stolen on November 27 and that “It was an emergency, for he is close to being blind without his glasses. Yet, he was not permitted to call home for a replacement until three days later, but even that call proved futile.”A senior jail official, requesting anonymity, said, “When Navlakha informed us about his spectacles being stolen, we told him that he has to look after his belongings. But we told him to give us his prescription...and we also asked him to inform his family to deliver it. We did not receive any response from him after that. Later, we received a courier which we do not accept because of security reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-pulls-up-jail-officials-for-denying-eyeglasses-to-gautam-navlakha/story-pkcVDCqcw7k7QHyPpt3clL.html
09-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Armed men in rally killed BJP worker’||West Bengal police said on Tuesday that a 50-year-old man who died during a pitched battle between the police and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in Silguri had succumbed to injuries caused by shotguns that local law enforcement agencies do not use.”Police do not use shotguns. It’s obvious that during yesterday’s protest in Siliguri, armed persons were brought and they fired from firearms,” the police said in a tweet at around 10.30 am, terming the incident “unprecedented”. An autopsy was performed on Monday night on the man, Ulen Roy, who died in the clash between BJP activists and the police in north Bengal’s Siliguri earlier in the day. The BJP had alleged that he had been beaten to death by the police. The police used tear gas and water cannon to stop two BJP processions from moving towards Uttar Kanya, the secretariat building in north Bengal. “The deceased received pellet injuries from a shotgun fired from close range by a person standing near the deceased in the protest program. This is unprecedented. Bringing armed persons in protest programs and inciting them to fire is unheard of,” said the state police. “There was a malafide intention to create violence by the use of firearms. CID {Criminal Investigation Department} West Bengal has been asked to investigate. Truth will come out and strong action will be taken against all those who planned and executed the heinous crime,” the police said in a third tweet. The BJP refused to accept the statement of the police and demanded a probe by the Criminal Bureau of investigation (CBI). The party also demanded a second autopsy and moved the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Jalpaiguri, which allowed it and said the autopsy has to be done by November 11. “The first autopsy report confirmed our allegation that the police used firearms and Roy was shot by them. The allegation being made against us is ridiculous because Rai was shot in the chest while approaching the police barricades. Had someone in the procession shot him, the injuries would have been found on his back,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu, who is stationed in Siliguri. “We will not stop till the truth is revealed. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government has come down to killing our workers because the ruling party knows that its days are numbered,” said Basu, referring to assembly polls due in about five months. The BJP won seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the north Bengal region in 2019. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee defended the state police while addressing an administrative meeting at Ranigunj in West Burdwan district on Tuesday afternoon. “BJP is killing its own people with pellets and blaming the police. Police do not use these (shotguns). The media should not encourage this,” she said. State panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee alleged that BJP workers were carrying several shotguns. “One of these killed the man. He was carrying a shotgun too. The police never lost patience. They only chased away the troublemakers. The CID will find out the truth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/armed-men-in-rally-killed-bjp-worker/story-Hk7sn9AAvtt6BGM1HjMKiJ.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: 3,188 cases, positivity rate stays below 5% for sixth day||With a high number of tests being conducted and fewer new cases reported, the average positivity rate—the proportion of samples that test positive for Covid-19—remained below 5% for the sixth day in a row on Tuesday. On December 2, Delhi had recorded a positivity rate of 5%. Of the 75,409 tests conducted, 31,098 (41%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging. With 22,310 active cases in the city as on Tuesday, there were 6,357 containment zones in the capital, according to the government bulletin. On Tuesday, Delhi reported 3,188 new cases, taking the total tally of infections in the city to 597,000 so far. There were 57 deaths recorded on the day, with the total death toll of Covid-19 reaching 9,763. The cumulative case fatality ratio (CFR) — the proportion of people who died of the disease compared to those who were tested positive for it — stood at 1.64%. The cumulative CFR has consistently reduced since recording a high 4.11% on June 16 to 1.56% in mid-November, when it started increasing during the third wave of cases in Delhi. The highest number of deaths recorded in a day during the third wave was 131 deaths on November 18. “Number of deaths in Delhi are on a decline. Lowest deaths since 5th Nov. Our frontline warriors like doctors and nurses are working round the clock to save each and every life. I Request you all to observe all precautions for this trend to decline further,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. The number of new cases reported had peaked at 8,593 on November 10 and the positivity rate (during Delhi’s third wave of infections) at 15.33% on November 15, according to the government data. Experts say that the number of deaths usually peaks a little after the number of cases do because patients are admitted to hospitals for some time before succumbing to the infection. Jain had earlier said that a majority of deaths in Delhi hospitals took place 10 days after a patient’s admission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-in-delhi-3-188-cases-positivity-rate-stays-below-5-for-sixth-day/story-YezVtRFaCCSsGAgR9ICl8O.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The winged companion||She likes guavas, which is pretty conventional for somebody like her. She is a parrot.“Her name is Katto, call her by her name,” says fruit-seller Zakir a bit sternly. His tone instantly softens as he starts talking to the parro... oops, as he starts talking to Katto.“How are you, my Katto? I love you so much. Do you know that?”But Katto’s claws are perched on a stack of oranges, and her gaze is constantly shifting towards the adjacent stack of tempting guavas. The young Zakir’s fruit cart is parked on a pavement in Old Delhi’s Matia Mahal bazaar. His home is nearby. He acquired Katto just last week. “I got her for ₹300 from Meena Bazaar,” he explains, referring to a nearby market where you can shop for all sorts of miscellaneous stuff from artificial jewellery, mobile phone battery chargers, wedding lehengas, wall clocks, fruit juice mixers to caged birds.But Katto isn’t in a cage.“She can’t leave me,” Zakir says. Katto’s wings are tied to her feet on either sides by a rubber band.Katto has already acquired some sort of stardom in the area. Passers-by are stopping by, and calling out to her affectionately. Everyone seems to know her name. Not all non-human creatures are so well-known in the locality. The lane is teeming with dogs and cats, but nobody is stopping to pat these anonymous strays, though they do look well-fed, thanks to the scraps of meat that the kind butchers throw at them—many small meat shops here. The local sky over the neighbourhood remains crowded throughout the day with bands of pigeons, though those pigeons are just blurs in the air when seen from the street, with no individuality. Unlike Katto. But then, Katto cannot fly.Now a man arrives. Katto seems to know him. She eagerly jumps on his finger tip. The man kisses Katto on her beak. He then carefully places her on the top of a guava. Katto starts tapping on the fruit with her beak, as if knocking at a friend’s door. Meanwhile Zakir gets restless, asking the onlookers to disperse if they aren’t planning to buy his fruits. He and Katto are left alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-winged-companion/story-G53gqh5GWKT7qEM33QCqgI.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||AAP says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal put under house arrest; BJP, police refute claim||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that Delhi Police kept chief minister Arvind Kejriwal “virtually” under house arrest since he returned after meeting protesting farmers camped at the Singhu border on Monday afternoon. Police denied the contention, saying there was only “general deployment” outside the CM’s residence, and his movement was not barred in any way.AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said on Tuesday morning that no one, not even domestic help, had been allowed to leave or enter the CM’s official residence since Monday, and Kejriwal had to cancel all scheduled meetings on Tuesday. This, he alleged, was being done on directions from the Union home ministry to stop the chief minister from standing with the farmers in their call for a Bharat Bandh to oppose three contentious farm laws that they want repealed.“On a day when the entire country is supporting the farmers in the Bharat Bandh, the central government’s home ministry has asked the Delhi Police to not allow Kejriwal to leave his residence. Yesterday, when Kejriwal along with all his Cabinet colleagues, went to Singhu border to meet the protesting farmers as a sewadar (volunteer), the central government got scared. It’s like how they got upset when Kejriwal did not allow the Delhi Police to convert nine stadiums into temporary jails for the farmers,” he said.Also Read: ‘This is not LoC,’ AAP tweets after Delhi Police clarify Kejriwal not under ‘house arrest’He also said that a protest by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) municipal corporation mayors and other leaders in front of the CM’s residence on Tuesday morning was a ploy to keep Kejriwal confined.Soon after Bhardwaj’s media briefing, special commissioner of police (law and order) Satish Golcha termed AAP’s claims “totally baseless and unfounded”. “There’s absolutely no restriction. The CM has been making usual engagements and he has been moving out of his residence for any engagement whatsoever,” Golcha said.The issue snowballed at around the time deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and AAP Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann were on a sit-in outside the CM’s residence after dramatically trying to get through the barricades and enter Kejriwal’s house along with several party workers. The police stopped them, saying only Sisodia and elected representatives would be allowed on the grounds that entry to the CM’s residence is based on prior appointment, except for public hearing hours, which last for about an hour every day. The AAP leaders, however, demanded entry for all. As the sit-in protest in front of the CM’s residence continued, police allowed all party workers to enter the premises at around 5.30pm. Kejriwal addressed the gathering shortly afterwards, saying he was barred from joining the protesting farmers. “I congratulate the farmers and the people of the country who made this Bharat Bandh successful. Just like I went to Singhu border yesterday, I had planned to go to the border as a sewadar today as well, to peacefully sit with the farmers. But I guess they (the Central government) understood my planning, and consequently did not allow me to go,” he said.Kejriwal added that Union home minister Amit Shah was meeting farmers later on Tuesday, with another meeting scheduled on Wednesday. “I hope the Central government finally accepts the valid demands of the farmers,” he said.When contacted, police said they cordoned off a small portion in front of the CM’s residence for security reasons as mayors and councillors of the three BJP-ruled corporations continued to be on a sit-in protest for the second consecutive day over alleged unpaid dues to the MCDs. On Tuesday, they were joined by more BJP leaders, including MPs Meenakshi Lekhi and Parvesh Verma.

We were in continuous touch with the CM’s office, and when they were asked to come in, Sisodia and other AAP members were allowed,” he said.The police also released a CCTV video apparently showing Kejriwal visiting a hotel on Monday night, and contended that the CM had attended a wedding there, to back their claim that there was no bar on his movement. The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to a query about the footage released by the police.“The proclamation of Kejriwal’s Bharat Bandh failed. So he pretended to be in house arrest while the entry to his house remained open throughout the day. On Monday night, he went to Singhu border and attended weddings. After doing everything, he is now not going out of the house today because he will have to face the leaders of the municipal corporations. CM Kejriwal is not in house arrest, he is resting in the house,” BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-says-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-put-under-house-arrest-bjp-police-refute-claim/story-hkf0lsf4qicF6PVioviuvN.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Panel summons MCD commissioners||The commissioners of the East and North Delhi Municipal Corporations have been summoned before the Delhi assembly’s environment committee regarding frequent fire incidents at the Ghazipur and Bhalaswa landfill sites in the city. As per the notice issued to the two commissioners on December 7, they have been asked to appear before the committee on December 9. Garbage and waste burning is one of the major contributors to air pollution in the capital. The AAP had earlier accused of the BJP, which is in power in the three civic bodies, of mismanagement of the Ghazipur landfill and demanded a probe by L-G Anil Baijal into the incident. The BJP had termed the accusations “frivolous” Senior AAP leader and committee chairperson Atishi on Tuesday said the two landfill sites have been major contributors to air pollution in Delhi. “The two commissioners have been summoned to ensure that such fire incidents do not occur in the future,” Atishi said in a statement. She added that the meeting has been called to know the reason behind poor waste management of the municipal corporations, which is leading to frequent incidents of garbage burning and a considerable increase in the height of the landfill sites in Delhi. On November 25, a fire at the Ghazipur landfill that raged for over 12 hours had led to a spike in the pollution levels in Delhi with the air quality reaching the severe zone. Three days later, another fire was reported from the Bhalaswa landfill site. “These fire incidents are making all the efforts of the Delhi government redundant and strict action must be taken against the authorities responsible for the fires,” said Atishi. Both EDMC commissioner Dilraj Kaur and Gyanesh Bharti, who is SDMC commissioner, and is handling North MCD as additional charge have been been infected by Covid and could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/panel-summons-mcd-commissioners/story-77eDY1YNXkFJ07PfWXOUtM.html

Chautala said this while presiding over a review meeting with all district deputy excise and taxation commissioners through videoconferencing regarding licence. The minister also directed the officers to conduct raids to prevent illegal sale of liquor and impose penalty in cases of delay in recovery. In cases where recovery is outstanding and property is attached, take appropriate actions to get recovery done through that property, he added. He said the excise officials should ensure that liquor is not served in hotels, restaurants and banquet halls which have not paid the licence fee. He also directed to examine the licence given for one day and to take action against those who serve liquor without licence. Chautala said that there has been a significant increase in revenue due to prevention of illegal sale of liquor. He said that in the first six months of the current year, the excise department collected Rs 660 crore additional revenue than the previous year. It is believed that the excise department will not only meet the target of raising revenue of Rs 7,500 crore mentioned in the new policy 2020-21, but this time about 20% more revenue can be generated, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-sale-of-liquor-dushyant-asks-for-e-receipts-at-all-vends/story-BwFWuLZtUFFcBSoO4duHKI.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Rahul Nanda’s aide held in Topsgrup case||Topsgrup chairman Rahul Nanda’s aide and the security service firm’s senior employee M Shashidharan was arrested by Enforcement Directorate officers on Monday night in the money laundering case. The accused was produced in the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court and was remanded in ED’s custody till Friday. Nanda had denied all allegations against him previously.According to ED sources, Shashidharan is suspected of helping Nanda to carry out several fund transfers. While staying abroad, Nanda got money transfers done through his company executives, including Shashidharan.The arrested accused is suspected of participating in a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) deal involving money laundering, with Nanda. Shashidharan was allegedly working on the instructions of Nanda to carry out the money transactions, ED sources said.Shashidharan, behalf of Nanda, had earlier filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police against Topsgrup’s former vice-president Ramesh Iyer (the complainant in ED’s case) and others for financial irregularities through cheating and forgery. The Mumbai economic offences wing (EOW) is now investigating the case.This is the second arrest by ED in the Topsgrup case. Amit Chandole, a business associate of Shiv Sena member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik was arrested last month. On Monday the Bombay high court (HC) permitted ED to extend its custody of Chandole after the same had earlier been denied by a lower court.Sources said that ED officers may confront Chandole and Shashidharan and interrogate them together in connection with suspicious funds transfers linking to MMRDA security service contracts, as well as the roles played by Nanda and Sarnaik.Topsgrup had obtained a contract to provide security guards for MMRDA projects in alleged collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means by a “well-thought-out strategy”, ED had claimed.The agency claimed that these illegal manoeuvres aimed to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the number of contracted security guards deployed at the cost of MMRDA, and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. The legislator had denied the allegations. Against this “active role and criminal conspiracy”, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract and sometimes, the money used to be transferred to the account of a third person, said ED. Chandole accepted the receipt of cash from Topsgrup for the MMRDA projects, ED claimed. Therefore, part of the amount received by Topsgrup from MMRDA appears to be proceeds of crime, said ED. Iyer’s complaint with ED says that it was Nanda and the arrested accused Shashidharan who instructed Niraj Bijlani, ex-CEO of Topsgrup, to pay the alleged illegal gratification related to MMRDA contracts to Chandole. The duo allegedly asked Bijlani to deliver the said amount every month at a café at Mallet Bunder. From May 2017 to June 2020, ₹90 lakh was given through Bijlani, Iyer alleged in his original complaint to Mumbai Police.ED’s money laundering probe is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by Mumbai’s Yellow Gate police on October 28 on the direction of 16th metropolitan magistrate court against Nanda and his family members. The criminal case was recently transferred to the Mumbai EOW for further investigation. The complainant filed by Iyer alleged that Nanda and others diverted huge funds from the firm’s accounts to various accounts in India and overseas. He further alleged that these funds were utilised by Nanda and others for their personal purposes such as purchasing property. The security firm was thus defrauded of ₹175 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rahul-nanda-s-aide-held-in-topsgrup-case/story-JrUt4QXB034nGq8BmQDT2H.html

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the all-time highest December maximum temperature for Mumbai was recorded on December 4, 1987, at 39.8 degrees Celsius.The weather bureau said a couple of major factors were responsible for the rise in maximum temperature. “Owing to the formation of a weather system over central India, warm and dry easterly winds, termed easterly waves, are moving over the city. While this is already letting temperatures to rise, the sea breeze set in very late on Tuesday allowing the maximum temperature to rise further,” said Bishwambhar Singh, director, regional meteorological centre, IMD Mumbai. “Although the temperatures were high, there was drop in humidity on Tuesday and the heat index (air temperature and relative humidity) was low, indicating the perceived heat to be lower than previous days.”The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 35.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees Celsius above normal.

The minimum temperature in the suburbs, meanwhile, was 18.2 degrees Celsius and 22.2 degrees Celsius in the suburbs and south Mumbai, both close to the normal mark. “While the minimum and maximum temperature is expected to be in the range of 18 and 34-35 degrees Celsius over the next five days in Mumbai, parts of central Maharashtra and Marathwada could expect a drop in maximum temperatures owing to the western disturbance over northern parts of the country,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD.The hot weather kept air pollution in the moderate category as the city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 173, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research.

Addressing election rallies in Chatha area, Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta said, “The Congress and other parties through their fallacious propaganda are misleading the farming community by stoking fear among them.” . Gupta said the Opposition had swayed the farming fraternity by making them believe the government was working against their interests and the hoax will soon be exposed. “It is hypocritical of Congress to protest farm laws as they passed the Contract Farming Act while they were in power. The party has even mentioned introduction of these laws in its manifesto”, he said. Meanwhile, led by former minister Raman Bhalla, Congress activists held protest rallies against the farm laws. Bhalla appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to put aside his other engagements and personally address the ‘genuine’ issues of agitating farmers. “The PM should resolve the issues of agitating ‘annadatas’ on top priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bharat-bandh-fruit-mandis-in-kashmir-observe-complete-shutdown/story-Z8xcKPejXfIveDyxJh1uAO.html

09-12-2020||Chandigarh||Roshni land scam:File action taken report before December 11: J&K HC to CBI||A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court on Tuesday rapped the UT administration for taking lopsided action in the much-publicised Roshni land scam. The bench, comprising chief justice Gita Mittal and justice Rajesh Bindal, also sought to know the UT’s urgency in seeking hearing of the review petition that was scheduled to be taken up on December 16. “Today the division bench heard a fresh miscellaneous application filed by the UT administration seeking to prepone the date of hearing of the review petition, which had been fixed for December 16, along with the main PIL,” said advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmad, counsel of the petitioner professor SK Bhalla. “When this preponement application came up for hearing, the division headed by chief justice Gita Mittal put a specific query to additional advocate general (AAG) Aseem Sawhney about its urgency, upon which Sawhney submitted that the CBI had started a probe and had restricted it to those FIRs that were earlier being probed by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB), which was creating problems for the officers of the UT administration and if a CBI probe in those cases was allowed to continue it will unsettle things that had already been settled,” said Shakeel. He said the AAG further submitted that the UT administration should be allowed to formulate a policy for segregating the poor people and farmers from the purview of the HC judgment of October 9 and other connected matters. At this, advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed submitted that since the passing of the judgment, a false narrative contrary to facts and records, was being run by people with vested interests to defeat the very intent and purpose of the court directions. Ahmed submitted, “A particular community was targeted and accused of grabbing ponds, rivers, state land and forest land when there were no such observations or directions in the judgment”,. He further submitted that the judgment was misinterpreted to foster a false narrative to mislead the common masses and to create a wedge between the peace loving people of J&K. Ahmed argued that the divisional administration of Jammu was selectively leaking names of Roshni beneficiaries in the media to target a particular community and to give a wrong impression under the garb of the directions of the division bench. The bench while expressing concern and displeasure in the open court orally observed, “We do not want discrimination of any kind on the basis of culture, region, religion or status.” The bench impressed upon the CBI to investigate the matter fairly and further clarified that its October 9 judgment was never meant to target people unnecessarily and that it was not against any culture, region, religion and status. Ahmed said the bench further remarked, “We do not want lopsided investigation and investigation has to be fair.” It directed the CBI counsel advocate Monika Kohli to file first action taken report (ATR) in a sealed cover before the next date of hearing. Kohli resisted submissions of AAG Aseem Sawhney and submitted that the CBI was investigating the scam squarely as per the directions of the bench and she further divulged that CBI was almost ready with its ATR and the same shall be filed shortly. After hearing the arguments, the bench allowed preponement of the application moved by UT administration and listed the main PIL along with review petition for December 11. The Jammu and Kashmir administration has sought a review of October 9 HC judgment that had declared the 2001 J&K State Land (Vesting of Ownership to Occupants) Act (Roshni Act) null and void.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roshni-land-scam-file-action-taken-report-before-december-11-j-k-hc-to-cbi/story-JWMPrw0RsEoMO7dMqNmMBN.html

The civic body has suggested to cut seven trees and transplant 169 more in Mulund for the construction of the Wadala-Thane corridor.Bharatiya Janata Party corporator Abhijit Samant, who is a member of the tree authority, said, “We are not against tree-cutting for development, but we must ensure that the trees survive and are maintained after transplantation. This is very important, considering we are developing at the cost of trees.”Earlier this month, the tree authority cleared a proposal to cut and transplant 1,234 trees for various infrastructure projects.Earlier this month, the tree authority cleared a proposal to cut and transplant 1,234 trees for various infrastructure projects, including the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL), the upcoming bridge at Mahalaxmi station and for the construction of Hancock Bridge at Sandhurst Road station.Bharatiya Janata Party corporator Abhijit Samant, who is a member of the tree authority, said, “We are not against tree-cutting for development, but we must ensure that the trees survive and are maintained after their transplantation.

09-12-2020||City||Bharat Bandh: APMCs in Navi Mumbai and Thane remain closed||The call for Bharat Bandh witnessed a mixed response in Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai. At Thane, the station area was put under heavy police bandobast to ensure there was no law-and-order problem. However, there was a tepid response to the bandh in the city. Members of the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi party participated in the protest. They raised slogans and held posters in hand near the station premises. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) workers gathered outside the Thane district collector’s office and raised slogans in support of farmers on Tuesday morning. Some youth had also gathered at the Majiwada circle in the evening around 3pm with posters to create awareness about the farm laws and why the farmers are protesting. “They are the reason we have food on our plate. So we cannot let them be treated indifferently. We want to create awareness among the younger generation and also show solidarity with the farmers,” said one of the protestors Deep Meher Singh, 24, who is a student. Mumbra, however, wore a deserted look. Shopkeepers and autorickshaw drivers in Mumbra had joined the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday to show solidarity with the farmers protesting in Delhi against the three farm laws passed by the Centre. “All autos were off the roads and shops remained closed till 5pm to express support with the farmers. We also had a protest outside the party office in Mumbra at noon,” said Shamim Khan from NCP. Around 30 protestors from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were detained by the Mumbra police on Tuesday afternoon. “As the crowd was growing, we had to ensure that peace is maintained. Hence we detained them, but they were released soon after,” said senior inspector Madhukar Kad from Mumbra police station. The neighbouring areas of Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath and Badlapur did not witness any major impact owing to Bharat Bandh in the morning. Although the autorickshaw unions, Konkan Vibhag Rickshaw Taxi Mahasangh in Kalyan and Lal Bauta Rickshaw Union in Dombivli decided to support the bandh, several autos were seen plying on the roads, ferrying commuters. The shops also remained open. However, by afternoon, Shiv Sena and left party workers thronged the streets of Kalyan and Vitthalwadi and asked shopkeepers to shut the shops. The agricultural produce market committee (APMC) in Kalyan was closed completely. At Kolsewadi, many of Congress’s Kalyan unit members were detained by the police, as they had decided to carry out a bike rally in the city. “We wanted to reach out to more people and had planned to do a rally with 150 bikes. However, the police did not allow us and detained around 40-50 of our party workers. We did not have any intention to commit violence,” said Sachin Pote, president, of the unit. At Navi Mumbai, too, the protest call witnessed a mixed response throughout the day. Panvel and Ulwe came to a complete standstill and the five wholesale APMC markets were closed for the entire day, as mathadis and traders supported the farmers’ agitation. Several rallies and protests were organised by social organisations and political parties. However, there was no violence reported. “The farm bills will sound a death knell for the farmers as well as for the mathadis and the APMC traders. We stand strongly with the farmers of the country and hence, all the APMC markets in the state are closed today,” said legislative Council member and mathadi leader Shashikant Shinde. The Congress and the NCP staged protests at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi, holding placards and raising slogans against the Narendra Modi government. “The farm laws have been brought by the Modi government to only benefit some top industrialists. This is going to prove very costly for them as the entire country has united against it,” said Navi Mumbai Congress president Anil Kaushik. Navi Mumbai Gurudwaras and various transport associations undertook a car and bike rally from Panvel Gurudwara Sahib to Mumbai. They had to stop at Mankhurd, after vehicles were halted several times. In the evening, a human chain was formed from Vashi toll Naka to Panvel to register the protest. Panvel witnessed a near complete shutdown, with the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) along with Congress and other political parties coming out in support of the bandh. Political workers staged a protest at Shivaji Chowk in Panvel. “The way the farmers are being treated by the Modi government reminds us of the British rule. This is dictatorship and Modi and [Union home minister Amit] Shah are agents of industrialists. The bandh today has been very successful in sending them a strong message,” said Congress leader Mahendra Gharat. PWP leader Pritam Mhatre said that the party had organised a march last week too against the laws. “Today the unity among the MVA (Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) and the traders and business communities shows what the people believe. The farm laws have to be withdrawn by the government,” said Mhatre. Workers’ activist Ulka Mahajan said, “Those who do not follow the constitution or care for the farmers will be thrown out of power by the people.” According to Shiv Sena leader Baban Patil, the party had not organised a rally in the city. “People have spontaneously supported the bandh. The central government should stop being adamant,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bharat-bandh-apmcs-in-navi-mumbai-and-thane-remain-closed/story-lycVRizponveWmVwuVeDCJ.html

They only allowed the vehicles of those in emergency services and the farmers going to Delhi border for protest.Due to this, the Ambala police created several diversions along the highway to facilitate the movement of daily commuters.“The black laws must be taken back.

09-12-2020||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar breaks silence, says BJP raked up his 2010 letter seeking reforms to divert attention||Two days after a controversy erupted over a letter written by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in the past seeking amendment to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act to allow private parties in the sector, the veteran leader has broken his silence on the issue. Pawar claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who raked up the issue may have not read the letter properly. He said when he had written it in 2010 as the Union agriculture minister, he had suggested reforms to the APMC Act. However, the three laws brought by the BJP-led Centre do not even mention APMC, he said. Pawar also alleged the BJP is “purposely” raking up the letter to divert attention from the laws, and there is no need to give importance to their claims.“There is no doubt that I had written the letter. But I had sought reforms to the APMC Act. They [BJP] would have understood it if they had read the letter properly. Their legislations don’t even mention APMC. It is a conspiracy to divert attention by taking our name. Thus, there is no need to give [the issue] importance,” Pawar told reporters in Delhi on Tuesday after his meeting with Union defence minister Rajnath Singh. The veteran leader said he had not met Singh to discuss the farm laws, but to get a speedy approval for the proposed airport at Purandar near Pune.As the agriculture minister during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime, Pawar had written to chief ministers to amend the APMC Act in their states to facilitate the private sector to play an important role in the sector. The BJP recently made the letter viral, claiming that Pawar, too, had proposed the same set of changes in the APMC Act.The veteran leader has backed the farmers’ protest against the laws, along with other Opposition parties. However, he refused to comment on the reforms brought into the sector now or in the past, when he had held the agriculture portfolio in Dr Manmohan Singh’s government. Pawar said he wants the collective stand of the opposition parties to reflect on the issue, for which a meeting will be held on Wednesday. Opposition leaders will also meet President Ram Nath Kovind to express their concerns over the three laws enacted by the Centre in September and seek their repeal. “Tomorrow five-six leaders from different parties are going to discuss and take a collective stand on the matter. So I don’t want to express any opinion as an individual today. We have also sought an appointment with the President tomorrow [Wednesday] to present our collective thoughts before him,” he said.“I don’t want to give any signs from NCP or from myself. I want a collective thinking to reflect on our stand as Opposition,” he said when pressed for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-breaks-silence-says-bjp-raked-up-his-2010-letter-seeking-reforms-to-divert-attention/story-fvO4WGoN4dvI37wQVuGEWN.html
09-12-2020||City||Bandh: Farmers find support from all quarters in Ludhiana||With people from all walks of life, including shopkeepers, industrialists, politicians and bank officials, coming out in support of the farmers’ call for Bharat Bandh, Ludhiana witnessed a complete shutdown on Tuesday.Around 11am, over 50 tractors that were lined up near the Old Session Chowk, started heading towards Ghumar Mandi. Youths bearing flags and posters, raised slogans against the Centre and demanded the roll back of the new farm laws. At several points, social distancing and mask norms were seen being openly flouted. The busy Jagraon Bridge became a melting pot of various protesting unions even as the rest of the city wore a deserted look with markets, banks and even government offices, such as the deputy commissioner’s office and municipal corporation, remaining closed. Vikas Kumar Juneja, a leader of the DC office employee union, said, “In support of the farmers, all staff members have gone on a mass casual leave. We will resume work from tomorrow.” Though liquor vends were open, essential services such as fuel stations, chemist shops, hotels and eateries remained shut. The wholesale vegetable market was also closed, though a few retail vendors had opened for business. Darshan Lal Baweja, chairman of the Ludhiana market committee, said the new laws will hit both farmers and arhtiyas. “By snatching our meal, the BJP-led central government wants to feed their capitalist friends. We will not let this happen,” said Baweja.Many hotels and restaurants had put up hoardings, pledging the support to the farmers. Amarvir Singh, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, said, “Amid the pandemic, what was the urgency to introduce farm laws. So we have decided to stand with our farmers.”Pawan Kumar Batra, president of the Ghumar Mandi shopkeepers association, echoed in, “If the one who feeds humanity will sleep on an empty stomach, how will the rest of us survive? This is the reason why we are all supporting the farmers,” said Batra.The federation of association of rural medical officers of Punjab, a body representing 700 doctors serving in rural dispensaries of the state, also extended their support to the farmers.Dr JP Singh Narula and Dr Jagjit Singh Bajwa, both officers of the federation, said once the new laws are implemented, the rural infrastructure will be collapse and leave a detrimental impact on the healthcare in these areas.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office in Chaura Bazar and RSS office near mini-secretariat remained heavily fortified through the day, the opposition parties including Congress, which is the ruling party in the state, and BJP’s former ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) targeted the saffron party.Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) took out motorcycle rallies with the farmer unions while Congress leaders including Rakesh Panday, Sanjay Talwar, Suinder Dawar and mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, joined the protest outside the DC office.Congress MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid said, “These laws will ruin the agriculture sector of the state. We will fight tooth and nail with the Centre for the roll back of these laws.” SAD MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali led the protest at Dana Mandi in Dakha while district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon, senior leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal and YAD president Gudeep Singh Gosha sat dharna at the Samral Bypass Chowk.Addressing the gathering, former cabinet minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “We have already snapped ties with the BJP. Our leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Cabinet to register her protest. We will continue to oppose the BJP government till these black laws are not withdrawn.”Hub of hosiery and cycle manufacturing units, 90% of the industry in Ludhiana remained closed on Tuesday as various associations extended their support to the agitating farmers. It was only after 3 pm that the units opened.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president FICO (Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organization), said, “We stand with our ann daata in their protest . Today all trade and industrial units shut their operations and supported the farmers. We also request the Government of India to resolve the issue at the earliest,” he said.Onkar Singh Pahwa, president of All India Cycle Manufacturers Association, said almost all units manufacturing cycle and cycle parts remained closed. Vinod Thapar, president, Knitwear Club, stated that they had given a call for shut down of all the hosiery units and 90% units did not operate today.Police remained on their toes throughout the day though no untoward incident was reported during the Bandh. Around 2, 500 police personnel were pressed into the service to maintain the law and order situation. Police had special security arrangements outside Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s district office, near Clock Tower, and barricaded the approach roads.Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchazhian said that cops were present at all major markets and crossroads and several personnel were also conducting foot patrolling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bandh-farmers-find-support-from-all-quarters-in-ludhiana/story-nnLUW8dir16KYn46Jg7IhN.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Delhi couple reunited with 4-year-old son after 17 months as Mumbai court approves adoption||Seventeen months after Abhinav and Rekha Aggarwal lost custody of their son following allegations of illegal child trafficking, the family was reunited when a city civil court declared the Aggarwals legally adoptive parents of four-year-old Yatarth. On December 7, Yatarth was reunited with his parents after spending more than a year in a state-run orphanage. Even as they celebrate, the Aggarwals are keenly aware that Yatarth has borne the brunt of this case. “I accept I had committed a crime, and so did those who offered the baby to me. But the child was not at fault. He [Yatarth] became the victim in this case,” said Delhi-based businessman, Abhinav Aggarwal.On July 5, 2019, the Aggarwals’ lives were turned upside down when Mumbai Police’s crime branch took their three-year-old adopted son Yatarth away and booked Aggarwal, 42, and his wife Rekha, 40, for illegal child trafficking. The shocked Aggarwals were among seven couples charged by Mumbai Police as part of its investigation into a child trafficking racket.In November 2016, Aggarwal happened to see a photo of a nine-day old baby boy. “A relative of mine had planned to adopt the boy. But later they decided to have a baby by in vitro fertilisation (IVF),” said Aggarwal. He and Rekha have a daughter, who was 15 years old at the time, and they decided to adopt the baby boy in the photo. Their relatives introduced them to a social worker named Pawan Sharma. “The social worker told us he would take care of the paperwork and would also give us the baby’s birth certificate, stating the boy was legally ours. We were not aware of the actual procedure and within a few days, we had the child,” said Aggarwal, who has denied buying Yatarth as an infant. “I agreed to give donations to the social worker whenever the need arose. Over three years, I paid Rs 1.5 lakh in donations,” he said.In July 2019, Mumbai Police charged the Aggarwals and six other couples under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Sharma was later arrested and booked under the same charges. He is currently out on bail. While the trafficking charges against the couples are yet to be decided in court, on August 16, Bombay high court (HC) allowed visitation rights to all the adoptive parents.The charges led the Aggarwals to discover that Sharma’s paperwork was not legally binding — as a result of which Yatarth was sent to an orphanage in Chembur and the Aggarwals were in judicial custody in July 2019. The Aggarwals got bail 10 days later, but the Child Welfare Committee refused to grant them Yatarth’s custody. “We realised we were not his parents legally and that we had committed a crime under the Juvenile Justice Act,” said Aggarwal. The couple would not be able to see Yatarth for months. “It was around Diwali in 2019 that the court permitted me to see my child,” said Aggarwal, who remained in Mumbai, living in a hotel until March this year, when hotels were forced to shut during the lockdown. Since then, the couple have been in touch with Yatarth over video calls.The Aggarwals have been doggedly pursuing the legal route to reuniting their family. In September 2019, Aggarwal moved HC, seeking the trafficking case be quashed and the Aggarwals be granted Yatarth’s custody. Meanwhile, in November 2019, the Aggarwals’ were directed by the civil court to initiate proceedings to legally adopt Yatarth. On November 27, 2019, the city civil court asked CWC to submit a social investigation report within 45 days, but there were a series of delays and CWC ultimately submitted the report this year, in early October. Finally, on October 8, the civil court allowed the Aggarwals’ adoption petition and directed CWC to hand Yatarth over to the Aggarwals. This decision is unrelated to the ongoing criminal case in HC, which according to the Aggarwals’ legal counsel Raja Thakare, will take its own course. Aggarwal’s mission now is to work towards simplifying the process of adoption in India. “I will fight for all my life for this issue,” he said, adding, “No parent should get trapped in this vicious cycle.” Priti Patkar, co-founder of Prerna, a non-governmental organisation that works with survivors of child trafficking, agreed that the adoption process is cumbersome. However, Patkar stressed that rather than simplification, what is needed is for all parties to know their legal rights, responsibilities and requirements. Patkar also recommended a robust hand-holding system for adoptive parents, so that they get guidance along the way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delhi-couple-reunited-with-4-year-old-son-after-17-months-as-mumbai-court-approves-adoption/story-XjsPdMs4PNxiKPtHPZNUdI.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Parents threaten to protest if school fee grievances not redressed by Maharashtra education department||ankita.bhatkhande@htlive.com Parents from schools across Maharashtra have said that they would protest outside the office of the education director in Pune if the department does not take note of their grievances on the issue of fees of private schools. On Monday, the India Wide Parents Association had said that the state education department had not responded to several complaints made by parents over schools charging indiscriminate fees during the pandemic. “Schools have been hiking fees and overcharging parents even during times like these when parents are struggling to pay them owing to salary cuts and job losses. Despite several complaints, the education department has not acted against schools and the issues raised by parents remain unaddressed. We are thus asking the authorities to look into our concerns or else will begin an indefinite protest,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the India Wide Parents Association. Officials from the department have said that they are working on addressing the grievances raised by parents. In a circular issued by the office of the deputy director on September 16, the department had formed two committees of officials to look into the complaints of parents from different schools. Thereafter, officials from the two committees had also visited schools for audits. However, parents have said that there was no substantial outcome from the steps. “In many schools where parents have complained, the audit is yet to take place. Meanwhile, the lack of action from the department has led to several schools terminating the admissions of students who have not been able to pay fees. The department needs to act against the complaints or else parents will definitely protest,” said Salil Dhani, a parent from Kandivli. A government resolution (GR) released on May 8 had stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners.

The funds will be released only for pre-approved works.” Priority list To ensure that funds are utilised only for selected projects, the MC has asked the councillors to submit a list of works that have to be carried out in their wards. “The councillors will be providing the MC with a priority list,” said Yadav.The civic body is facing an acute fund shortage due to a fall in revenue generation during the pandemic. There has also been a cut in the grant-in-aid it receives from the Chandigarh administration because of the expenditure restrictions imposed by the central government.Struggling to pay for its stipulated revenue expenditure like salaries, the MC had decided to cease all capital expenditure including all approved development works.Yadav insisted that the MC would be able to earmark around ₹8 crore for the development works in councillors’ wards.So far, the MC has received the priority lists from less than four councilors. “After receiving the list from all, we will compile a composite list and thereafter, work will start in all the wards,” said an MC official.The works listed by the councillors so far include laying of paver blocks, improvements in parks, new stormwater system, and works in EWS colonies falling in their wards. Meanwhile, there are several projects that are still awaiting the approval of the UT administration.As per a list prepared by the MC, the incomplete works range from construction of community centres, booth markets and underground escalators to road works, underground parking, transfer of properties, bus stops, cleaning of seasonal rivulets, sewage system, green belt, creation of primary health centres, etc. Many of these works are pending for several years now, in some cases for the entire elapsed period of the current MC House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-to-earmark-8-crore-for-development-in-wards/story-ZgEaupViRRtk5gq0tUsJOK.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University: Fresh concerns arise over syndicate’s future as term nears end||With the senate polls not having been held so far at Panjab University (PU), fresh concerns are being raised over the future of the syndicate, whose one-year term will end on December 31.After the term of the syndicate, which is the highest executive body of PU, will end, the varsity will be left without a governing body. The members of the syndicate are elected from among the members of the PU senate every year.The term of the senate ended on October 31, but the polls were postponed by the vice-chancellor for the second time on October 15 citing the pandemic.Syndicate member Navdeep Goyal said, “In the absence of the governing bodies of the university, many important decisions will be left pending. Any vacuum in the governance will affect the varsity’s smooth functioning. There are already a lot of issues pending which need to be taken up by the governing bodies of the University.”According to the PU Calendar, the executive government of the university will be vested in the syndicate, which has powers to consider and make recommendations to the senate as it deems fit in the matters that include appointment of officers of Class A, affiliation and disaffiliation of colleges, recommendations of the board of finance relating to annual budget, supplementary grants, and others.The Calendar also grants power to the syndicate to pass orders on various university matters, including those related to colleges, academic council, faculties, and sanction proposals of new expenditure up to a particular limit.‘Unprecedented situation’Calling it an unprecedented situation, syndicate member Rabindra Nath Sharma said, “It is a tragedy for the democratic structure of the Panjab University.”“Again we urge the vice chancellor to do his duties and call the meeting of the syndicate immediately so that the pending issues could be discussed and resolved democratically,” he said.No meeting held after JulyAfter the senate polls were deferred in August, the varsity’s syndicate has not met for the fourth month in a row. The last meeting of the executive body was held in July. As a PU tradition, its executive body meets once in a month.“It is very unfortunate that no senate meeting has been held after December last year and the syndicate has not met since July,” said syndicate member DPS Randhawa.Regarding the senate election he said, “My question is why the chancellor and the vice-chancellor and all other concerned authorities are afraid of having an autonomous body in the institution. Reforms to some extent are fine but this unique system of governance should not be abolished.”PU registrar Vikram Nayyar said, “The university will take necessary action as per the provisions of the PU Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-fresh-concerns-arise-over-syndicate-s-future-as-term-nears-end/story-Vw7rv7horVlcZKd4Uy85GI.html
09-12-2020||City||Mayoral candidate will be from BJP, reiterates Ambala MLA||A day after Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta announced that the mayoral candidate for the municipal corporation (MC) polls will be from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and not from the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), his ally in Ambala, Aseem Goel, on Tuesday reiterated the statement.Goel said that BJP will contest on the mayoral seat for the upcoming MC polls while JJP in-charge for the polls Ashok Sherwal said that the party had demanded 11 wards along with the mayor seat.Speaking to the Hindustan Times, Goel said, “I say this with full responsibility that the mayoral candidate will be from the BJP itself. As of now, the JJP leaders have not put forward any demand for the mayor seat, but I have received a list of 11 wards where they’re ready to contest.”Goel said that the official announcement on seat-sharing will be done on the day the names of the candidates are declared.JJP meeting conductedSherwal, along with Shahabad MLA Ram Karan Kala, chaired his second meeting with the party workers at Tau Devi Lal Bhawan on Tuesday. He said, “The motive behind contesting together is to win the MC and the party is focused on quality, not quantity.”“We’ve selected a few names at the meeting and will forward it to the high-command. We’ve claimed 11 wards where our candidates are strong and also the mayor seat, in our previous meetings with the BJP leaders. On Wednesday, there will be a final meeting, after which it will be clear which party will have the mayor candidate,” Sherwal, state president of the party’s SC cell, told the HT.Sources in the BJP said that Goel had been leading closed-door meetings for seat-sharing with the JJP at local levels for the last two-three days. The party will declare its candidates from Thursday in three slots, a source had earlier said. A top-placed source in the JJP’s Ambala unit, however, said, “We have been told by our senior leaders that the major candidates from all the three MCs (Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat) will be from the BJP.”This comes at a time when the saffron party is at a backfoot amid farmers’ stir on Delhi borders with many leaders and legislatures from the JJP joining them. The JJP has also demanded cancellation of the cases lodged against the farmers in the state.AAP to support HDFThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will support former state minister Nirmal Singh’s Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) in the MC polls.The decision was taken after a meeting between AAP’s Haryana in-charge and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Gupta and HDF’s general secretary Chitra Sarwara in Delhi.Chitra, while addressing a press conference along with AAP’s district vice-president Gagandeep Kapoor, said, “We’ve mutually discussed the local governance and decentralisation model of the Delhi government. AAP has already decided that they’ll not contest on the party symbol, but their workers can contest on the HDF symbol. We expect some other like-minded parties to support us in the coming days.”The nomination process for the elections will begin on November 11, while voting is scheduled for the 27th and declaration of results on the 30th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayoral-candidate-will-be-from-bjp-reiterates-ambala-mla/story-BEG5jBVhxNRrNpZrCq08UM.html

Till Tuesday, almost 190 volunteers had taken the first dose of the vaccine.The government-run JJ Hospital started the trial on November 30, and so far, 180 people have participated in it. After receiving the vaccine from the Central government on Sunday, Sion hospital started its clinical trial on Monday. Till Tuesday, the hospital has administered the vaccine to around 10 volunteers.“Initially, we are giving the vaccine to five to six people daily, but we will soon increase the number to speed up the process,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital.Covaxin has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The vaccine received Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval, and the trials commenced across India from July.Recently, the pharmaceutical firm applied to the central drug regulator seeking emergency-use authorisation. It is the third firm after Serum Institute of India and American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, to apply for emergency-use approval.In the last week of October, ICMR selected JJ and Sion hospitals for the pan-India trial of Covaxin. As many as 2,000 volunteers between the age group of 18 and 60 years will be included in the trial. Of this group, 20% of volunteers with co-morbidities will be selected, and another 5% will comprise medical health workers. The hospitals will follow up with the volunteers for 12 months as per ICMR rules.“The third phase will have two stages. After 28 days of the first vaccination, volunteers will be given the second vial,” said Dr Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-jj-and-sion-hospitals-begin-clinical-trials-for-first-indigenous-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin/story-Fv5QXXbekEuWQi1SALKUMN.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 rules for entry from other states land fliers and Mumbai airport staff in trouble||Ten days on, passengers as well airport officials are still struggling to implement the state government’s new rule that made carrying a recent negative Covid-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test report mandatory for travellers from Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa. While passengers find it difficult to get the reports on time, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) staff has a tough time stopping those who don’t have the papers. Another complaint is the absence of a price cap on the tests conducted at the airport, similar to that on private laboratories in the state. While the RT-PCR test at the airport costs ₹1,400 per person, the state has capped it at ₹980 for anyone who walks into a laboratory. Citizens are charged ₹1,400 for samples collected from Covid care centres, hospitals or dispensaries, and ₹1,800 if swab is collected from home.Prasad Pandit’s tweet read: ‘Me and my brother had to undergo a mandatory Covid Test at Mumbai Airport as per guidelines of @CMOMaharashtra Tests were conducted by #SuburbanDiagnostics. The testing centre was a chaos with no respect to social distancing. @AAI_Official security was nowhere to be seen. The reports were expected in 24hours and its been more than 36hours. In calling their helpline for an update - they informed my test was never conducted and has been unresponsive since. @OfficeofUT @rajeshtope11 why make tests mandatory if we can’t expect a result.The guideline is from the state government and #SuburbanDiagnostics is appointed by them to conduct these tests. There has to be an accountability. Moreover the passengers are paying full amount for those tests.’ (sic). Another passenger who landed Mumbai on December 2 in his tweet said, “I have done my test on 2nd Dec. at airport by suburban diagnostic, still waiting for reports as on 8th Dec....after login, its showing report not ready for download.” (sic) A query sent to Suburban Diagnostics chief executive officer (CEO) Sushant Kinra did not yield a response till the time of going to print. Despite several attempts, health minister Rajesh Tope was not available for a comment and health secretary Pradeep Vyas did not respond to HT’s text messages on the price slab.An airport official working closely to implement this norm said, “There is additional staff at the airport to guide people. If people find the government-approved rate of ₹1,400 unaffordable, they have the option to carry a negative report along with them. Why don’t they do that?” A CSMIA official said, “We are following all norms and protocols laid down by the state government and are ensuring they are implemented and followed.” HT had earlier reported that passengers had complained of violation of social distancing norms and long queues during the testing. Kinra had then said that they had started to display QR codes more prominently and asked their staffers to allow passengers to fill forms using tablets, apart from the physical forms. Starting Friday, Suburban Diagnostic increased their counters from five to eight. Thirty-two people have been working in three shifts to ensure that sufficient staffers man the counters and help passengers. “Instead of daily passes, we also give weekly airport entry passes now. This will help staffers be at their workstation on time,” Kinra had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-s-covid-19-rules-for-entry-from-other-states-land-fliers-and-mumbai-airport-staff-in-trouble/story-DTNbW64ACAkMGVAu5fwxhO.html
09-12-2020||Mumbai||Farmers’ call for Bharat Bandh over Centre’s new laws: Mixed response to stir in Maharashtra||Tuesday’s Bharat Bandh, called by farmers in protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, got a mixed response across the state, with the normal life remaining largely unaffected. Shops in some parts of Mumbai downed their shutters, amid tight police security on the streets, after political parties peacefully rallying through the city asked them to support the country-wide bandh. In Maharashtra, the bandh was symbolically supported by 48 trade unions, labour organisations and social organisations under a joint action task force, Jan Andolanachi Sangharsha Samiti. Besides, all three ruling parties – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – supported it. This is the first time the three parties that allied to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state joined hands to stage protest over an issue. In Mumbai, NCP and Congress workers were seen rallying together in some places. Many parts of south-central Mumbai, including the busy area of Dadar Terminus, retail and wholesale markets of Dadar East and West, Wadala and Matunga wore a deserted look. The BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) in the evening stated they had run buses to their full capacity. Black-and-yellow taxis, autorickshaws, local and outstation trains also continued to run. While the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) markets at Navi Mumbai remained closed, supply of essential items such as milk and vegetables was not hit. All nationalised and private banks were open, even though bank employees’ unions supported the bandh. Sanjay Pansare, chairperson of fruits and vegetables traders’ association, said, “APMC showed 100% support to the bandh call.” Viren Shah of Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, said, “Shops in a majority of areas in Mumbai remained open and conducted business smoothly. However, sales were down by 30% to 40% and buyers did not venture out.” Ajit Navale, Maharashtra general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, said, “The bandh received good response in Maharashtra. Road blocks were organised by farmers in various parts of Maharashtra, including Kalvan, Nashik, and closer to Mumbai at Thane, and Palghar. Major fruit and vegetable markets at Ahmednagar, Ale Phata on Pune-Nashik highway and APMC in Navi Mumbai also remained closed.” The Congress staged a statewide agitation, led by Maharashtra revenue minister and Congress state president Balasaheb Thorat. Other Congress leaders, including public works minister Ashok Chavan, energy minister Nitin Raut, animal husbandry and dairy development minister Sunil Kedar, minister of state for agriculture Vishwajeet Kadam, state Congress working president Muzaffar Hussain, Mumbai Congress president Eknath Gaikwad, were also present. Sanjay Raut, chief spokesperson of Shiv Sena, said, “It is not a political bandh. It is to show solidarity with farmers who have been protesting for the past 12 days. Participating in the bandh is voluntary, and no one is being forced to support it.” Suyog Yadav, taluka president of NCP Youth Congress, said, “We have been peacefully rallying in south-central Mumbai on Tuesday morning, and requesting shops to be shut. We have done rounds of Wadala, Sewri and Dadar.” Around 50 protesters from the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, a farmers’ union based in Kolhapur, organised a rail roko agitation at Malkapur railway station in Buldhana district at 6.50am. The protesters blocked the railway tracks, but were removed by the railway protection force, government railway police and local police. The joint action task force also plans indefinite sit-in protests at three places in Maharashtra, along the lines of Shaheen Baug protests over the citizenship law in New Delhi. These are to be called Kisan Mazdur Baug, and are being organised at Pune, Nashik and Sangli, until farmers’ demands are met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farmers-call-for-bharat-bandh-over-centre-s-new-laws-mixed-response-to-stir-in-maharashtra/story-9OslX0cs6T30zhDhMbOzFI.html

The accused allegedly provided logistical support to a racket member Javed Ghulamnabi Sheikh, who was caught at the Mumbai airport along with Pakistan-origin high-quality counterfeit currencies worth ₹23.8 lakh in January. Hussain, 47, a resident of Pavlipada, Trombay, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Sheikh, a Kalwa (West) resident, was arrested by Mumbai crime branch officers at Mumbai airport in January on arriving from Dubai. An examination of his bag had resulted in the recovery of 1,193 high-quality counterfeit notes of ₹2,000 denomination worth ₹23.86 lakh. NIA’s preliminary investigation has revealed that the seized fake currency notes were sent to Dubai from Pakistan and were being brought to Mumbai for Hussain. Sheikh received the notes from a man named Sardar in Dubai who is suspected to be linked to Dawood Ibrahim’s gang, sources added.Hussain has nearly 30 criminal cases registered against him. According to Trombay police, he posed as a social worker and a builder but has previously charged with smuggling, extortion, attempt to murder and murder. “He was nabbed on November 28 from his residence by NIA officers with the assistance of Trombay police in a fake currency case,” said an officer from Trombay police, requesting anonymity. On December 5, he was remanded in judicial custody.“My client has been arrested by NIA based on a previous fake currency note case, claiming he provided logistic support to other accused. But the main accused is Sardar, who is wanted. Hussain has been sent to judicial custody by the court. We will move an application for bail once NIA files a charge sheet in the case,” said Hussain’s lawyer Sharif Shaikh.Hussain had previously contested the assembly elections from Trombay but lost. His wife Khairunissa Hussain is a former civic corporator from the same area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nia-arrests-trombay-man-in-international-counterfeit-currency-racket-linked-to-dawood-gang/story-pBT7cYGU0t7JNcEGc17BPM.html
09-12-2020||Noida||Noida’s air quality ‘severe’ for fifth day||The air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad continued to be in the ‘severe’ category for the fifth day in row on Tuesday. Though the humidity levels dropped slightly from 100% to 97% on Tuesday, the wind speeds were not enough to pull the air quality out of severe levels, weather analysts said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 407 on Tuesday against 422 on Monday, showing a marginal improvement. Similarly, Greater Noida recorded an AQI value of 405 against 422 a day earlier. Ghaziabad also saw a slight improvement with an AQI of 424 on Tuesday against 438 on Monday, the CPCB data showed. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The pollution monitoring agencies stated that while the intrusion of stubble burning smoke from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana is still negligible, it’s the high humid conditions here that trap the locally generated pollutants thereby slowing down the ventilation process. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed and humidity levels both dropped on Tuesday. The air quality of Noida and Greater Noida may be pulled out of ‘severe’ category if the winds pick up on Wednesday, IMD said. “The wind speed on Tuesday dropped to 5kmph against 10kmph on Monday. Wednesday may see almost similar weather conditions. However, the wind speed may increase to 8kmph and the temperatures may also see slight rise by a degree or two. These conditions may not be enough to make significant improvement to the air quality but may slightly improve it,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. Though the fine particles or pollutant PM2.5 levels showed slight improvement, they still remained four times the safe limits. PM2.5 for the past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 270.52 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 293.76 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 269.46 µg/m³ on Tuesday against 298.70 µg/m³ a day earlier. However, the PM2.5 level soared for Ghaziabad, which was recorded at 314.33 µg/m³ on Tuesday against 289.68 µg/m³ a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 µg/m³. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to recover slightly on Wednesday. “Surface winds are likely to be picking up slightly and AQI is forecasted to be in the very poor category for the next two days. AQI is likely to improve and stay in the middle-end of the very poor category on 11th December,” said the SAFAR statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-severe-for-fifth-day/story-pA2fZGPNB0lF1M2WqPWapI.html

09-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest two drug smugglers, bust international cartel||The Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed to have busted an international drug cartel with the arrest of two men, a BBA graduate and a BCom graduate, who would smuggle in narcotic substances from the US through international courier services and supply them in Delhi-NCR and other parts of the country. Police confiscated at least 600 grams of narcotic substances, including marijuana and Tetrahydrocannabinol, from them, senior police officials said.Police identified the two arrested men as Avinash Jain, a BBA graduate, and his friend Shashank Gupta, a BCom graduate, both residents of Delhi. Police said they frisked the men after arresting them and confiscated 450 grams of imported marijuana, 100 grams of a toffee containing Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis that can be consumed by smoking, and 50 grams of hash. The police also confiscated four mobile phones and a Honda City car the men used for procurement and transportation of drugs.Additional commissioner of police, crime, Shibesh Singh said they arrested the men following information that some persons involved in the illegal import of drugs from USA using the dark web, would come to Vasant Kunj to supply drugs to one of their contacts. The police laid a trap and arrested both the men, Singh said.During interrogation, the two men told police that they had imported the confiscated narcotic substances from the USA through the dark web. “They said that as the new year is approaching, the demand for imported contraband is high in Delhi and NCR. They said they paid in advance through cryptocurrency, mainly Bitcoins, through a blockchain wallet. Once the payment is made to the supplier, they dispatch the parcel through an international courier service. A courier agency delivered the parcel to the place of destination after customs clearance,” the additional commissioner said.Singh said that further probe revealed that the accused persons were supplying the drugs to only verified customers. “They fixed all the deals through applications like WhatsApp, Imo, Instagram, Wickr, FaceTime, etc. They sold weed in Delhi for ₹3,000 to ₹5,000 per gram and the toffee containing Tetrahydrocannabinol ₹100-500. They said they sold 50 grams of hash for ₹50,000,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-two-drug-smugglers-bust-international-cartel/story-9BwM0co1F2V6X5FpC4e6iK.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||No new taxes in North MCD budget, focus on loans to fill revenue gaps||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation did not propose any new measure to boost its revenue in the budget proposals for the financial year 2021-22 on Tuesday despite its liabilities going up by over Rs 1,345 crore. The civic body instead pinned its hopes on soft loans and old remunerative projects to fill the huge gap between actual income and deficit. In its 2021-22 budget proposals presented on Tuesday, the north civic body did not propose any new tax or hike in existing property tax slabs. The north corporation presented a total budget for Rs 9,205.96 crore, including Rs 3,445 crore loan.The corporation, however, proposed to increase transfer duty by 1% for change in the title of properties worth more than Rs 25 lakh. This proposal was already passed by the civic body and is awaiting Delhi government’s approval.According to budget estimates, the liabilities have increased to Rs 7,523.97 from Rs 6,176.32 crore from last year.“Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, the overall recovery in tax collection has been reduced. Our own remunerative projects to make the corporation self-reliant have also been slowed down due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown situations. So, a special alternate arrangement for special grant or interest free long term loan from state or union government be thought of,” additional commissioner Swati Sharma said while presenting the budget. North DMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti has been infected with Covid-19.Civic officials said that the property tax collection of the civic body has gone down due to the coronavirus pandemic. As per the budget estimates, there had been collection of Rs 388.55 crore as property tax till November 25 this year,which is Rs 25.53 crore less than last year during the same period. It stated that Rs 162.88 crore has been collected as transfer duty this year so far.Officials said that due to the pandemic the civic body decided not to levy any new tax on the public and also made no proposal to increase property tax.The municipality has not been able to pay salaries to its employees due to fund crunch. Ministerial staff, teachers and engineers in north corporation have not been paid for last three to four month. Similarly, salaries of doctors, nursing staff and paramedic employees are pending for two-three months.The civic body said it will focus on its old remunerative projects to generate revenue. The remunerative projects which will be expedited to make the north corporation self-reliant include redevelopment of Azadpur and Model Town staff quarters, which is expected to bring revenue of Rs 6,939 crore and Rs 8453 crore by leasing those to government agencies. Another project include Minto Road staff quarters, which the Income Tax department has desired take on lease after redevelopment. The reserve price of this is Rs 3,900 crore (approx).Officials said that the municipality has also decided to expedite the plan to provide parking for 12,915 cars by developing multi-level parkings at 17 locations.To control air pollution, North civic body also proposed to set-up e-charging and battery swap stations for e-vehicles on roads in its jurisdiction at every three kilometres from a charging point. Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said, “In this budget, an effort has been made not to put any additional burden of tax hike or new tax on the common man, who is already troubled due to the coronavirus pandemic. We will bridge the revenue gap by expediting our remunerative projects and through soft loan from the state or union government.”Vikas Goel, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor and leader of opposition in the municipality, termed the budget “disappointing”.“There is nothing new in this budget as no new projects are announced. They have not even produced any progress report of the ongoing projects. There is noting for the public in the budget. They have also not suggested any new measure to enhance revenue and improve financial condition of the civic body,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-new-taxes-in-north-mcd-budget-focus-on-loans-to-fill-revenue-gaps/story-NZCDvdZLUE91mNFvo6vXaO.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Mayors to continue their protest outside Delhi CM’s residence||Mayors and office-bearers of the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations camped outside Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal’s residence at Flagstaff Road for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.Amid high drama outside the CM’s residence — Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders sat on dharna outside the CM’s residence demanding to meet him while alleging that he has been put under house arrest by the Delhi Police — the mayors said that they will not leave until the CM meets them and agrees to release the pending dues.The mayors are demanding that the Delhi government immediately clear dues totalling ₹13,000 crore. The pressure is mounting on the BJP, as sanitation workers and other staff are threatening to go on strike due to non-payment of salaries.Municipal corporation officials alleged that the Delhi government didn’t implement the report of the fourth Delhi Finance Commission. “Approximately ₹13,000 crore is owed to the corporations based on the recommendations of the fourth finance commission,” said an official with the East municipal corporation.Also Read: No new taxes in North MCD budget, focus on loans to fill revenue gapsNorth corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “We had called off the protest in October after assurance from the Delhi’s urban development minister that the funds will be released. But the government has not released funds. We have written several letters to them. Our employees are threatening to go on strike. We have no option but to sit here and demand funds. Who will be responsible if they go on strike?”On Tuesday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, MPs Parvesh Verma and Meenakshi Lekhi and other senior leaders joined the mayors and other office-bearers in their protest outside the CM’s residence. Jai Prakash, South corporation mayor Amanika Singh, East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain and others have been sitting outside the CM’s residence since Monday. They have brought their own quilts and bedsheets to sit outside the CM’s house.Gupta said, “It is unfortunate that the CM doesn’t have the time to even meet the mayors. His party is levelling baseless allegations that he has been put under house arrest. The CM attended three events yesterday and today [Tuesday] was free to go wherever he wanted to. We will continue our protest till we get the funds.”According to an East corporation official who requested anonymity, salaries have been paid to all the employees till September and pensions have been paid till August this year. The North corporation has been the worst-affected, as salaries of staff have been pending for three or four months. In October this year, the three mayors had staged a day-long sit-in protest outside the CM’s residence demanding funds.According to a senior North corporation official who did not wish to be named, the Delhi government is yet to release a total of ₹6,283 crore pending as per recommendations of the third and fifth Delhi Finance Commission. “Besides, in the current financial year, a total of ₹1,200 crore is due. This includes BTA (basic tax assignment) and funds allocated under planned and non-planned heads. So far this year the corporation has received around ₹700 crore including ₹200 crore under the BTA and remaining under different budget heads such as health, education and sanitation among others,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.Also Read: AAP says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal put under house arrest; BJP, police refute claimOfficials in the South corporation said that ₹4,130 crore is pending as per the third and fifth finance commissions while ₹1,600 crore is due in the current financial year. “Under the budget for this financial year, no funds have been released by the government so far,” said a senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The East corporation is yet to get a total of ₹2,985 crore, as approved by the state finance commission. “Of the ₹1,100 crore due in the current financial year, the corporation has so far received around ₹400 crore,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.South corporation’s leader of the house Narendra Chawla said, “The salaries are delayed by at least 20-25 days every month. We have also not been able to pay pensions to the retired employees.”The safai karamcharis engaged with the North corporation, who had earlier planned to go on strike from November-end and decided against it after meeting senior corporation leaders, may go on strike if they are not paid by the year-end. “The sanitation workers had met the mayor and senior officials last month threatening to go on strike. However, they were assured their salaries will be disbursed by December. If the civic body fails to pay even now, they may be forced to go on strike,” said Sanjay Gahlot, head, Delhi Safai Karamchari Union.In a statement, AAP said,“Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCDs know that their protest is only an excuse by their high command to keep CM Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest and prevent him from supporting farmers in today [Tuesday]’s Bharat Bandh. The mayors are well aware that Delhi government has been given all the due funds and it is because of their corruption and inefficiency that the MCDs are facing financial ruin. Since they have decided to only protest rather than govern, it is best that they resign and let AAP run the MCDs. We will run the MCDs efficiently and within the same budget.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-to-continue-their-protest-outside-delhi-cm-s-residence/story-FTPcyO5t9XmiE0Qe94cbhN.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Bharat Bandh largely peaceful in borders, crowd swells at protest sites||The national capital remained largely peaceful during the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday though the crowd of protesting farmers swelled at various protest spots across the city. The police tightened the security measures at the border points, while several shops near protest points chose to down shutters on Tuesday. Some of them said they closed their business in “solidarity” with farmers. One of the few roads blocked by protesters on Tuesday was the NH-44. A group of young men, mostly from Delhi and a few from Punjab, blocked the highway a few kilometers before the Singhu border. Rajesh Kalshan, a resident of Swaroop Nagar in Delhi, who was among the protesters there, said, “We had carried out a march in our neighbourhood and then thought of blocking the NH-44 as we wanted the government to take notice of the farmers’ problems.”But senior police officers soon reached the spot and urged the men to make way. In any case, the brief blockade did little to disrupt traffic as motorists were diverted to an adjacent service lane. Also Read: No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollbackAt Singhu border, a few shops remained closed on Tuesday. Ram Niwas, a grocery shop owner, said nobody forced him to close. “We chose to remain closed to show support to farmers. Several of use are from farmer families and want the government to right the injustice done to the farming community,” he said.There was also an increase in the number of protesters. Farmers said about 200 more trucks carrying farmers have reached the Singhu between Monday night and Tuesday to support the Bharat Bandh. “We hadn’t anticipated any trouble and there hardly was any disruption,” said a senior police officer, who didn’t want to be identified. At the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border, nearly 300 farmers blocked the Delhi-Meerut Expressway part and service lane of NH-24 but facilitated the movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles. “Our protest is not aimed at creating problems for the public. It is primarily to wake up the government,” said Surjeet Singh, a farmer from Saharanpur.Also Read| Bharat Bandh: Farmers block NH-44, raise anti-govt slogans in AmbalaThe number of farmers protesting at Chilla border was much fewer that what it had been in the last one week. Dharmendra Singh, youth national secretary of BKU (Bhanu unit) said, “Our leaders had asked us to return to our respective cities and villages and participate in the Bharat Bandh at local levels. On Wednesday, we will return to Chilla border to continue our protest.”At the Tikri Border, which has been witnessing protests since November 27, the situation remained as before. Nishan Singh, a farmer from Arnivala village in Fazilka district, said that all markets around the border were shut. “The border has been bandh since so many days. So, we didn’t need to do anything more than raise our voice against the farm bills,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-largely-peaceful-in-borders-crowd-swells-at-protest-sites/story-74q1X9Qzj8TlCnPpcMyycI.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Bharat Bandh: Protesting farmers block Delhi-Meerut Expressway for five hours||Protesting farmers on Tuesday completely blocked the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border connecting Delhi and Ghaziabad for five hours after calling for a nationwide bandh. While the farmers allowed traffic to resume on one carriageway (from Delhi to Ghaziabad) of the highway after five hours, the highway passing through Chilla border, connecting east Delhi and Noida, remained completely blocked for the fourth consecutive day.The blockade caused heavy traffic jams on alternate routes through which the police had to divert commuters. As many as 4,000 traffic policemen were deployed on Delhi’s roads throughout the day to ensure smooth vehicular movement.Apart from the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, seven other borders that remained completely closed on Tuesday due to the farmers’ protest are Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Jharoda, Piao Maniyari, and Mangesh (in the outer and south-western parts of the city) and the Chilla border.Also Read: Bharat Bandh largely peaceful in borders, crowd swells at protest sitesUntil Monday night, only one carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border was blocked; the service road of NH-24 at the UP Gate border has been closed for 10 days now. But around 10.50am on Tuesday, farmers at the Ghazipur border blocked the other carriageway as well.This prompted the Delhi Police to divert traffic towards Ghaziabad from Delhi via the Anand Vihar railway station. The traffic on the other carriageway (that is shut since Wednesday last), is being diverted through Apsara border, Bhopra and Anand Vihar.Himanshu Kumar, a resident of Gurugram who was travelling to Ghaziabad with his wife, was stuck on the Delhi-Meerut carriageway as the protesting farmers stopped his motorcycle and forced him to return.“The police on the Delhi side did not stop us as the strike was to start at 11am. The roads were already blocked before 10.54am. I requested the protestors to let us pass, but they paid us no heed. We have no choice but to return and take the alternate route, which must be congested because of the diversion,” said Kumar.Another commuter, Sunil Kumar, who was travelling to Meerut (UP) with his family, said that he had to take detours several times due to the barricading. “It took us an hour or so to reach Ghazipur border from Lakshmi Nagar due to barricades, only to be disappointed as the border was closed. We will now search for another road to enter UP,” he said.The Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway was, however, reopened by the farmers around 2.45pm, restoring vehicular movement to normal. Framers had also kept a passage open for emergency vehicles throughout. A video of the farmers making way for a hearse van and vehicles accompanying the van at Ghazipur border also surfaced on social media.Also Read: No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollbackOne of the few roads blocked by the protesters was NH-44—outside a gurdwara and a few kilometres before the Singhu Border—by a group of young men who included mostly Delhi residents and a few from Punjab. The blockade, however, did little to disrupt traffic as the motorists were diverted to an adjacent service lane by the police.Delhi Police also issued traffic advisories on social media to make the commuters aware of the affected routes and the diversions available. In one of its tweets, Delhi traffic police said, “Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders — Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders.”In another tweet, the police said, “Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari & Mangesh borders are closed. NH-44 is closed. Please take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad, Saboli & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road, NH-44.”While arterial roads at Delhi’s borders were affected due to the bandh, senior traffic officials said that traffic was lighter than usual on Tuesday within the city too.Officials said that the number of cabs and private vehicles, especially on arterial stretches, was lower than usual on regular weekdays. “On traffic-heavy stretches such as Dhaula Kuan, South Extension, Lajpat Nagar and Moti Bagh, there were fewer vehicles. The peak hour traffic rush was also under control. This was mainly because there were fewer cabs. Worried about being caught in jams, people also preferred to use their private vehicles only if necessary,” said a traffic police officer requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-protesting-farmers-block-delhi-meerut-expressway-for-five-hours/story-zI0tn1nsjPtVw8EkezdLfN.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Okhla Mandi functions as usual, but other markets affected by bandh||Trade of fruits, vegetables and grains in Delhi markets was affected on Tuesday as a section of traders shut shop in support of the Barath Bandh. While it was business as usual at the Okhla fruit and vegetable market, trade was hit at the Azadpur and Ghazipur markets. The Narela and Najafgarh foodgrain markets remained completely shut in support of the strike on Tuesday. “Azadpur Mandi was almost closed. Many wholesale trader associations had joined the Bharat Bandh. A few trucks loaded with vegetables and fruits arrived at the market, but no major work was done,” said Adil Khan, chairman, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) of Azadpur Mandi. Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader and member of the Azadpur APMC said otherwise. The market was not “almost shut”, but daily transactions did reduce on Tuesday. The trade of vegetables was down by around 30%, and that of fruits was down by 50%,” he said. Also Read| Bharat Bandh: Protesting farmers block Delhi-Meerut Expressway for five hoursTraders from the Okhla Mandi said their business continued as usual. “All trucks arrived as usual. The number of visitors may have been slightly lower on Tuesday, but traders were open for business,” said Nitin Lal, an onion trader in Okhla Mandi. Supplies to Ghazipur Mandi were severely affected as it shares a border with Uttar Padesh’s Ghaziabad which was completely shut to traffic movement for several days now. “Ghazipur saw the maximum impact of the strike. The turnout of traders was very low and visitors fewer,” said an APMC member of Ghaziabad Mandi who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/okhla-mandi-functions-as-usual-but-other-markets-affected-by-bandh/story-ZNTYV6tEmOVL7ICxtO6ZdI.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Transport services, Metro largely unaffected by nationwide strike||Transport services in Delhi, including auto-rickshaws and cabs, remained largely unaffected by the one-day Bharat Bandh called by agitating farmers on Tuesday. The Delhi Transport Corporation buses, cluster buses and the Delhi Metro also operated as usual. Despite several unions of autos, taxis and other public service vehicles announcing their support to the strike, the impact was minimal on the city roads.On the Delhi Metro, entry and exit was shut only at one station -- Pandit Shree Ram Sharma station on the Green Line.Ashita Singh, who used an Uber cab to reach her office in Nehru Place from Mayur Vihar Phase 1, said, “I did not face any surge pricing for my ride. The waiting time was also not more than usual.” Lakhbir Kumar, an IT Professional, said he had opted to work from home owing to strike call, “Our office had asked everyone to work from home owing to the farmers protest and the nationwide strike call. In fact, many of my friends in other companies were also asked not to come to office. Many like me, apprehending disruptions, avoided travelling in general,” he said.Also Read: Bharat Bandh largely peaceful in borders, crowd swells at protest sitesA senior Delhi transport official said buses were seen running below capacity as passengers were visibly fewer than usual.The ridership figures for Tuesday was yet to be compiled till this report was filed. Auto and taxi unions which joined the one-day strike claimed that “thousands” of cabs, autos, Gramin Sewas, RTVs, and phat phat Sewa owners kept their vehicles off the roads on Tuesday between 11am and 3pm. Kamaljeet Gill, president of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi, which represents drivers working with cab aggregators, claimed most of its members were on strike. A few members of the striking auto, taxi unions held an ‘Akhand Paath’ at Bangla Sahib Gurdwara praying for the well-being of farmers and drivers, he said.Rajender Soni, general secretary of the Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union said all their autos and taxis operated normally and the strike had no impact at all. “The auto and taxi services were normal even at the airport, bus stations and railway stations,” he said.Due to closure of borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the city’s interstate bus terminals (ISBT) saw fewer buses. The Kashmere Gate ISBTs received only 68 buses from other states as against the usual of over 500 buses. The ISBT did not see a single bus from Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.The Anand Vihar ISBT received 448 buses on Tuesday, but they were all from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, senior government officials said.All markets were also open in the capital, but traders said the footfall on Tuesday was quite low. Also Read: Okhla Mandi functions as usual, but other markets affected by bandhAshwani Marwah, general secretary of the traders association of Lajpat Nagar, said, “We all kept our shops open today. But the crowd was less than half of what it was on Monday. With protests happening at the borders and in various parts of the city, people are not keen to step out.”Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar mandal, said, “The year started with ant-CAA protest, followed by riots and then Covid. It has been an extremely difficult year for businesses in the city. It was only in September that business had finally picked up, even in the face of several restrictions. But for the past week, the situation is back to square one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/transport-services-metro-largely-unaffected-by-nationwide-strike/story-LGJTLdmVO7sEvXVS9rxr2H.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||FIR against Delhi Cong chief, others for violating social distancing during strike||The Delhi Police on Tuesday registered a case against Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Anil Chaudhary and other party workers for allegedly violating social distancing norms while participating in the nationwide strike (Bharat Bandh) on Tuesday, the police said. The first information report (FIR) was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) and the Epidemic Disease Act against Chaudhary and others at the IP Estate police station, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia.Around noon, as nearly 40 Congress workers led by DPCC president Chaudhary were protesting below the ITO flyover, they were found violating social distancing norms. They were taken to the police station, from where they were later released, DCP Bhatia said.While the DCP said that nobody was arrested in the case, the DPCC president said that he was arrested illegally for protesting in support of the Bharat Bandh, demanding roll back of the three “anti-farmer laws”.Chaudhary said, “Such arm-twisting, and undemocratic actions by the Delhi Police, cannot curb their resolve to support the farmers’ agitation. The farmers have been protesting at the borders of Delhi, braving the chilling cold and limited living conditions, demanding the rollback of the black Acts (farm laws), else they are prepared for a long haul of protests at the borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fir-against-delhi-congress-chief-others-for-violating-social-distancing-during-bharat-bandh/story-D4ugXJ2omXrZmDtJDIviuL.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi University sets the ball rolling for appointment of new vice-chancellor||The Delhi University’s (DU) Executive Council (EC) — the highest decision-making body — on Tuesday suggested seven names for the search committee to be constituted for the recruitment of the new vice-chancellor (V-C). The university administration will now select two names out of seven and send them to the University Grants Commission (UGC). The selection committee for the recruitment of V-C consists of three people — two of them will be suggested by the DU administration and one will be recommended by the Union education ministry.JL Gupta, an EC member, confirmed the development and said, “An EC meeting was held on Tuesday and the council has suggested the names of seven people including KK Aggarwal, former V-C of Indraprastha University; Yogesh Narayan, chancellor of HNB Garhwal University; Professor Raj Kumar, V-C of Panjab University and VK Gupta, former chief justice of Uttarakhand high court for the search committee,” he said.DU dean of colleges Balram Pani has been authorised by the EC to pick two names to be sent to the UGC. “The decision will be taken by Wednesday. We will then send the two names to the UGC and it will form a three-member committee by adding one name suggested by the ministry (education),” Pani said.The selection of a new DU V-C is crucial in the backdrop of the suspension of the current V-C Yogesh Tyagi by the union ministry of education in October. The Centre had pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university under Tyagi’s tenure. The suspension was followed by a high voltage drama when a faction led by Tyagi -- who was on medical leave since July and is due to retire in March -- overrode the recommendations of the EC to first appoint a new Registrar and then a new pro-V-C. The President of India had nullified all orders and appointments made by Tyagi.Several teachers and administrators said that the tussle was mainly over influencing the selection of the next vice-chancellor. The university has already published an advertisement seeking applications for the post of V-C. “Now, the three-member committee will select candidates from the applications and proceed with the process of the recruitment of the new V-C,” said Gupta. The President, who is the visitor to DU, will choose the V-C based on the recommendations of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-sets-the-ball-rolling-for-appointment-of-new-vice-chancellor/story-TevnIE3hH0YFZRZIlGhHvJ.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Bed attached to truck, desi geyser that runs on wood fire: farmers find ways to cope at protest sites||From sofa-cum-beds attached to the exterior of trucks, to portable ‘desi geysers’ that run on wood and cow dung cakes, some creature comforts are at hand for the Punjabi farmers camping at the Singhu border to protest the Centre’s new farm laws. The most visible of these comforts at the Singhu Border were the sofa-cum-beds jutting out of trucks, padded with mattresses. Up to four farmers sat on each on them, some reading newspapers, others holding discussions. Known in Punjab as ‘manja’, this is a foldable iron structure which farmers --mostly in sugarcane producing belts of Punjab -- get installed after purchasing trucks. When not used, they are folded back into the truck wall. “In Punjab, when we take sugarcane to mills, we have to sometimes spend up to two days and nights in our trucks, while waiting in queues. The seats inside are uncomfortable to sleep on, so the bed comes handy,” said Komaldeep Singh Cheema, who brought one such truck from Cheema Kalan village in Jalandhar. About 3.5 feet wide and six feet long, these beds can comfortably allow two adults to sleep in and seat four to five people. They also have arrangements to fix mosquito nets. “In our villages, when a small group of farmers wish to have a meeting, we place three or four trucks in a circle and roll out the manjas. Here, the manjas are providing a break from the monotony of sitting inside the trucks or standing on the road. It actually feels like a luxury during these protests,” said Cheema.“Locally we also refer it to as daftar (office). The more mattresses you add you it, the more comfortable it gets,” said Harenderjeet Singh Sodhi, another farmer from Pindal Majra village of Fatehgarh Sahib district. A three to four foot tall water heating equipment which the farmers call a “desi geyser” is also turning out to be a boon in the Delhi cold. At several points, particularly near langars and bathing spaces, the geyser made of iron or tin is being used to heat water for bathing or washing utensils. “In villages, we prefer the desi geyser to the electric ones. It heats water in five to ten minutes from the wood fire or cow dung cake fire. The advantage is that unlike a stove, it needs little fuel,” said Harmandeep Singh who belongs to Dhindsa village in Ferozpur. The compact cylindrical apparatus pumps out hot water from a pipe when more water is poured from the top. “We asked our families to send it when we realised that we were going to camp here ( Singhu) for long and the weather is it going to get colder,” said Jasveer Singh, a farmer from Sodhi Nagar in Ferozpur.Farmers have brought several trucks filled with cow dung cakes and wood. The actual intent was to use them for cooking once the gas cylinders ran empty, but the fuel is now being used for the geysers. Among the other things associated with farming that are coming in handy are hundreds of plastic fertilizer sacks.“Earlier we would stitch together several such sacks to make floor mats. Now we use them as roofs on our trucks. They get heated during the day and retain the heat to keep our trucks cosy at night,” said Jasvinder Singh, a farmer from Bhalri village in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district of Punjab.HT had earlier reported how sofas made of hay are being used to seat farmers at the protest site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bed-attached-to-truck-desi-geyser-that-run-on-wood-fire-farmers-find-ways-to-cope-at-protest-sites/story-x700N7qFi6OCY4VGLYZuCL.html
09-12-2020||Delhi||Farmers set up gurdwara at protest site to derive ‘strength’||Under a canopy of orange and white drapes, a few farmers on Tuesday sat quietly in an enclosure similar to several others put up across the five-kilometre-long protest site at Delhi’s Singhu border. This enclosure, however, is different from others as protesting farmers have converted it into a makeshift gurdwara open to all—making it the only religious place on the protest site.Set up on November 27 to “give strength” to the farmers, the gurdwara on Monday started a 48-hour “akhand path” or continuous recitation of the religious texts—a day before the Bharat Bandh. From taking off shoes to covering their heads to not turning their back towards the religious texts, people at the marquee follow all the rules put in place for any gurdwara.Kuljeet Singh, a farmer from Ludhiana who has been at the protest site since it began 13 days ago, said, “We have built a farmers’ movement at a huge scale and need all the strength to sustain it as well as to fight for our rights. This is why a gurdwara was set up here. So that farmers, protesters, sympathisers across religions can come here and seek blessings.”Apart from distributing prasad to devotees, the place also holds regular kirtans, often punctuated with stories of fighting injustice. On Tuesday afternoon, several farmers visited the makeshift gurdwara, kneeling and touching their forehead to the ground in front of a blue private bus housing three Sikhs reciting the “akhand path” which will go on till Wednesday. This will be followed by an “ardas” or prayer for the well-being of all.Balbir Singh, in charge of the management at the gurdwara set up by Shiromani Panth Akali Budha Dal, said, “We have parked a tractor at the entrance of the enclosure to ensure that nobody has their backs to the sacred texts else it would be disrespectful. Everybody is welcome to the gurdwara. We set up this to help our farmer brothers derive strength from the words of Guru Granth Sahib.”There are at least two gurdwaras around the protest spot, but many protesters said they weren’t aware of the locations. Narendra Pal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, said that the makeshift gurdwara saw a steady flow of visitors throughout the day. “More people than usual visited the gurdwara on Gurpurab (November 30). People find peace here, and sit and listen to kirtans or pray on their own,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-set-up-gurdwara-at-protest-site-to-derive-strength/story-P4bicd69DYDtPi3YybZCeP.html
09-12-2020||Chandigarh||Activists, cops injured in clash during protest against farm laws in Chandigarh||As many as eight police personnel and nearly 10 youths were injured after a protest march by over 600 activists of the Yuva Kisan Ekta turned violent in Sector 34 on Tuesday.The activists had gathered near the Sector-34 gurdwara around 1pm to march towards the BJP office in Sector 33. They had planned to lock its main door as part of their protest against the farm laws.But the police had set up security barricades to stop them. Trying to bulldoze their way through, the protesters broke the barricades with a tractor and jeep, and pelted the cops with stones, forcing the police to use water cannon and mild lathicharge. Amid the melee, some protesters climbed atop the water cannon and damaged the vehicle to turn the water off, while others snatched batons from the policemen. “They wanted to lay siege to the BJP state office Kamalam and were stopped at the barricading in Sector 34, but the protesters became violent,” a police officer said. The clash left eight policemen injured, even as around 10 protesters also sustained injuries on the head, as their turbans came off following use of force by the police. But, braving the lathis and water cannon, the protesters managed to reach the BJP office and raised slogans against the party.They tried to burn an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but were stopped by the police.A dharna followed, until senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal arrived and asked them to leave.Though no one was arrested, a case under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 3 of the Damage to Public Property Act was registered at the Sector 34 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/activists-cops-injured-in-clash-during-protest-against-farm-laws-in-chandigarh/story-ZsCSgfrS0wRh2SbPBsGkbL.html
09-12-2020||Pune||Punjabi community support Bharat Bandh in Pune||Pune: Members of Singh Sabha Gurudwara of Rasta peth, including senior citizens, women and children with some coming from Punjab, participated in the Bharat Bandh strike by protesting at Alka Talkies chowk on Tuesday. Around 100 people of the Punjabi community joined the protest in support of farmers. Mandeep Singh, a farmer from Amritsar, Punjab, who had come to Pune said, “The farmer laws brought by the central government are not necessary and we oppose them. I have come from Amritsar to spread the word of protest and feelings of farmers from Punjab to Punekars.” Another protestor Baljeet Singh, who is from Pune, said, “We all gathered at the gurudwara in the morning and walked towards Alka Talkies chowk to protest and support today’s Bharat Bandh. These new farmer laws will adversely affect farmers, there is no need of privatisation in the agriculture sector which the Modi government wants to bring through these new laws. Soon the time will come when there won’t be farmers remaining in the country due to this law and ultimately no food cultivation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/punjabi-community-support-bharat-bandh-in-pune/story-h0pBpfPXBEYTvFqlp3xsDO.html

The building under construction is in a neglected state and misused by anti-social elements. Some people also use the space for parking vehicles. At a time when the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is planning to lease out public amenity spaces in the city and augment its revenue by Rs 900 crore with residents opposing the move, the neglected school building exposes civic administration’s seriousness regarding utility of spaces. The school project was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on January 26, 2016. According to area corporator Prakash Kadam, the project is incomplete as PMC is yet to sanction adequate funds. When the project was okayed after it was taken up by corporator Bharati Kadam, the ward was under Prabhag 76 before it came under ward number 41 as per the revised ward schedule of the corporation. The school project envisaged construction of a five storied building with two parking facilities at the ground level. Only parking facilities and three stories were readied. As of today, according to PMC officials, only 40 per cent of the construction work is complete during the past five years due to lack of funds. The flooring work, plastering, painting and electricity supply work is yet to be carried out. A visit to the spot revealed the structure in a state of neglect with the basement filled with dirty rainwater. The absence of security guard at the site leaves the space to be used by anti-social elements. Prakash said, “Initially the project came under ward number 76 and work started after funds were sanctioned. Later, the ward was revised and the corporation is yet to release funds to complete the project.” PMC construction department head and executive engineer Shivaji Shankar said, “A number of developmental works are being done by PMC. We take up plans on priority. There is a 40 pc cut in funding of various projects due to the Covid situation. The school project will be completed after adequate funding is made available by the administration.” Sujay Mahale, a resident said, “The e-learning school project will benefit the poor and middle class children of the neighbourhood. The administration should take up this incomplete plan on priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/e-learning-school-project-at-katraj-public-amenity-plot-gathers-dust-due-to-lack-of-funds/story-1elhCVlBizwx8I1ozkiziP.html

Across the city, traders and shop owners kept their shops closed in the first half of the day, but later, resumed business.The Federation of Traders Association of Pune (FTAP) had extended their support to the bandh, but several shops across the city remained open, claiming already having suffered a lot financially due to the Covid-19 lockdowns.“There was a bit of worry among shop owners on Laxmi road about opening due to the Bharat Bandh. Half of the shop owners preferred to remain shut, but most opened. We have fully supported the protest and the strike called by farmers, but at the same time we cannot keep our shops closed anymore. There are heavy financial losses already due to four months of lockdown and we cannot afford to keep shops closed,” said Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi Road Ganpati Chowk Traders Association. Similarly, vegetable traders at Market Yard kept their daily work on, as a few vegetable trucks arrived at the market.“Usually on weekdays, we get vegetable supply of around 1,000 trucks. Today, 188 trucks arrived at the wholesale market. The attendance of loaders and other workers was also negligible. As vegetables are perishable goods, it cannot be stored for too long. Goods trucks which had already started their journey three days back cannot turn back. We have supported the farmers by keeping our trading open,” said Vilas Bhujbal, leader of the association of traders and commission agents at Market Yard.In other prominent markets like Tulshibaug, Bohri Aali, Raviwar peth market and at Appa Balwant chowk a mixed response was seen during the day.

Health Canada said it received Pfizer’s submission on October 9, and “after a thorough, independent review of the evidence”, determined that the “vaccine meets the Department’s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada.”It also said that “strong monitoring systems” will be in place as the vaccine is rolled out, adding, “Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will not hesitate to take action if any safety concerns are identified.”Canada is expected to receive 249,000 doses of the vaccine very soon and early recipients will include healthcare workers and residents of long term care homes, considered among the most vulnerable demographics.Another four million doses are expected to be available by March next year, while Canada has nearly 20 million doses of this particular vaccine on order. The Pfizer vaccine has to be delivered in two doses and brings with it logistical challenges having to be stored at temperatures below -70 degree C.The country has established 14 distribution centres where the vaccinations will take place in the beginning.Health Canada said the vaccine is for use in people 16 years of age or older, but noted Pfizer-BioNTech are running further clinical trials on children of all age groups and that could change.Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart.Pfizer and BioNTech said it will supply a minimum of 20 million doses to Canada through 2021 and as many as 76 million.Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers as well.The government has said 14 distribution centres will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be at least one in each province and two each in Canada’s four largest provinces.“This is phenomenal news for all Canadians as we take the next step toward ending this pandemic. As soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil, we will be ready to deliver and administer them,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a tweet.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-becomes-second-nation-to-approve-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine/story-iCUSDwTWq9Yb7Don2LDmMJ.html

Absolutely clueless! So disappointed with his response...But it might help if our PM actually knew what he was talking about!”Dhesi last week coordinated a letter signed by 36 MPs from various parties to foreign secretary Dominic Raab, asking him to raise the farmers’ issue with the Indian government. A protest demonstration was held outside the Indian high commission in Aldwych on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-issue-a-matter-for-india-pak-to-settle-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-AIXMchYfGe9Kf5GVe3FAwL.html

Pfizer, along with its German partner BioNTech, has developed the vaccine which has an efficacy rate of nearly 95%.On Tuesday, it cleared a major hurdle after the FDA released documents in which it raised no new red flags over the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.“The vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for emergency use authorisation,” Reuters reported citing FDA official.The agency typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but is not required to do so. It is not clear how many days or weeks the FDA will take to make a decision, but states are prepping for vaccine deliveries in mid-December.Meanwhile, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said earlier that he is expecting a “very intense” meeting with a US vaccine advisory panel. However, remaining optimistic about the approval, Bourla said that is counting on the panel of outside experts to sign off on his company’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate.“I think they will vote ‘yes’ given the strength of the data,” Bourla said.On Wednesday, Canada became the second country to approve Pfizer vaccine. It has already been approved by the United Kingdom.Besides the US, European Medicines Agency (EMA) is also assessing data to approve the vaccine.The United States is the worst affected country due to coronavirus disease. As per the figures by the John Hopkins University, as many as 15,189,410 people have been infected by the viral disease pushing the healthcare system under the crumbling pressure.

It is the only Brazilian company with the model in its fleet.The Boeing plane was grounded globally in March 2019, shortly after a 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia. A prior crash in Indonesia involving the model occurred in October 2018. In all, 346 people died.Brazil’s aviation regulator lifted its restrictions on the 737 Max in November, clearing the way for the plane to resume flights in Latin America’s biggest country.Similar restrictions have been lifted in the U.S. and Europe, where commercial flights with the plane are expected to resume soon, likely starting with American Airlines on Dec. 29.“The MAX is one of the most efficient aircraft in aviation history and the only one to undergo a complete recertification process,” Gol’s chief executive officer, Paulo Kakinoff, said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-737-max-back-in-air-2-years-after-grounded-by-crashes/story-EvQNxmHOdBGP4lNyBj2EkP.html

Moscow and Washington have discussed extending the pact, but differences have remained.New START was signed in 2010 by then-US President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify complianceAfter both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries still standing.Arms control advocates have warned that its expiration would remove any checks on US and Russian nuclear forces, in a blow to global stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-conducts-drills-of-its-strategic-nuclear-forces/story-WKHILGKZrpfhSURRZxhaDK.html

This and other questions answered||After the United Kingdom rolled out Pfizer-Biotech vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), several countries, including India, are gearing up to grant emergency use authorisation to different vaccine candidates. While the governments around the world will be targeting frontline workers and people at higher risk to inoculate them against the virus, some groups may have to wait longer even after the vaccine becomes available for the general public.The National Health Service (NHS) of the UK is currently offering Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in some hospitals to health care workers at high risk, people aged 80 and above who already have a hospital appointment in the next few weeks, and those who work in care homes. But the health care provider has also advised some groups to wait for the vaccination.Also Read | UK issues precautionary advice on Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine after two allergic reactionsHere’s the list of people who should avoid Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for now:Pregnant women: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been assessed in pregnancy, so the NHS has advised that until more information is available, those who are pregnant should not have this vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) wants to see more non-clinical data before finalising the advice in pregnancy.Planning to get pregnant: The NHS has advised delaying the vaccination for those who are planning to get pregnant in the next three months. Alternatively, they can start the two-dose course now and avoid getting pregnant until at least 2 months after the second dose.Breastfeeding: Such a group should wait until they have finished breastfeeding and then have the vaccine. “If you were breastfeeding when you had the first dose you are advised not to have the second dose until you have finished breastfeeding,” says NHS.People with a history of allergic reactions: The UK regulators have advised people who have a history of “significant” allergic reactions to not get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

09-12-2020||World||France unveils draft law to fight Islamist radical ‘enemy’||A draft law aimed at arming France against Islamist radicalism was unveiled Wednesday, a measure promoted by President Emmanuel Macron to rout out what he calls “separatists” undermining the nation.Parliament is expected to open what is likely to be a lively debate on the draft law in the months ahead. The measure, long in the making and refined until days before its presentation, has gone through various name changes and is now known by the delicate title “Supporting Republican Principles.”Prime Minister Jean Castex said those whose project is to “divide and spread hate and violence” are at the center of “separatism.”Separatism is especially dangerous because it “is the manifestation of a conscious, theorized, political-religious project with an ambition to make religious norms predominate over the law,” he said at a news conference.In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde he said the nature of a law is long-term and it would apply to any political ideology that threatens French values, “even if today it is radical Islamism that we try by all means to fight.”Castex and others insist that neither Islam as a religion nor regular Muslims are targeted by the draft law. Neither is named in the text made up of about 50 articles aimed at enabling better oversight of mosques, associations, public services and schools. The aim is to reduce the space where radicals can operate and ensure that French values, including secularism, are guaranteed.Among notable measures is making school obligatory from age 3 with the ability to opt out in favor of home schooling for special cases only. The measure is aimed at ending so-called clandestine schools run by fundamentalists with their own agenda.Another article encourages mosques to register as places of worship, so as to better identify them. Many of the nation’s more than 2,600 mosques currently operate under rules for associations. Foreign funding for mosques, while not forbidden, would have to be declared if more than 10,000 euros.The draft law would make it a crime punishable by fines and up to one year in prison for a doctor to provide a young woman with virginity certificates, sometimes demanded ahead of marriage.To do away with forced marriages, a measure requires the couple to meet separately for an interview with an official when there is a doubt about free consent. If the doubt persists, the official must take the issue to a prosecutor who could forbid the marriage.Those practicing polygamy would be forbidden French residence cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-unveils-draft-law-to-fight-islamist-radical-enemy/story-sFf2ANRVbWSkpyOFLn6ZKL.html

But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 for years to come.”So far, the alliance said, all of Moderna’s doses and 96% of Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots have been acquired by rich countries.It added: “In welcome contrast Oxford-AstraZeneca has pledged to provide 64% of their doses to people in developing nations. Yet despite their actions to scale up supply they can still only reach 18% of the world’s population next year at most“Oxford-AstraZeneca deals have also mostly been made with some of the big developing countries like China and India, while the majority of developing countries have not done deals and have to share the COVAX pool of vaccines between them.”This demonstrates that one company alone cannot hope to supply the whole world, and that only open sharing of technology between vaccine producers can make this possible, the alliance said.It called on pharmaceutical corporations to openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organisation Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, so that billions more doses can be manufactured and safe and effective vaccines can be available to all who need them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-nations-hoarded-enough-covid-vaccines-to-inoculate-their-populations-thrice/story-kd16kHVbEvbyQQ0PgdQe9N.html
09-12-2020||World||US Democratic- controlled House approves defense policy bill with a veto-proof margin||The Democratic-controlled House easily approved a wide-ranging defense policy bill, defying a veto threat from President Donald Trump and setting up a possible showdown with the Republican president in the waning days of his administration.The 335-78 vote in favor of the $731 billion defense measure came on Tuesday hours after Trump renewed his threat to veto the bill unless lawmakers clamp down on social media companies he claims were biased against him during the election.Trump tweeted Tuesday that he will veto “the very weak National Defense Authorization Act,’‘ or NDAA, unless it repeals so-called Section 230, a part of the communications code that shields Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants from content liability. Trump also wants Congress to strip out a provision of the bill that allows renaming of military bases that now honor Confederate leaders.Congressional leaders vowed to move ahead on the hugely popular bill — which affirms automatic 3% pay raises for US troops and authorizes other military programs — despite the veto threat.The final vote represented approval from more than 80% of the House — well above the two-thirds support required to override a potential veto. A total of 140 Republicans joined 195 Democrats to back the bill, which now goes to the Senate.Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, urged Trump not to follow through on his veto threat, but added that if he does veto it, “We should override.’‘If Trump vetoes the bill, “we will come back to vote to override,” said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.But with Trump pressuring Republicans to stand with him, it was unclear until the final tally whether the bill would receive the two-thirds support needed to override a veto. The House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly three-dozen conservatives, backed Trump’s position Tuesday and opposed the bill.“We stand with the president,’‘ said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., the group’s chairman. “This particular NDAA bill is filled with flaws and problems,’‘ including limitations on troop withdrawals ordered by Trump in Afghanistan and Germany, Biggs said.Smith and other lawmakers noted that many defense programs can only go into effect if the bill is approved, including military construction. The measure guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.Troops should not be “punished” because politicians failed to enact needed legislation to ensure their pay, said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services panel. The $731 billion measure increases hazardous duty pay for overseas deployments and other dangerous job assignments, hikes recruiting and retention bonuses and adjusts housing allowances.The dispute over social media content — a battle cry of conservatives who say the social media giants treat them unfairly — interjects an unrelated but complicated issue into a bill that Congress takes pride in having passed unfailingly for nearly 60 years. It follows Trump’s bid to sabotage the package with an earlier veto threat over Confederate base names.Measures approved by the House and Senate would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood named for Confederate generals, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The fight erupted this summer amid widespread protests over police killings of unarmed Black men and women, and Trump used the debate to try to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy.Smith and Thornberry said in a joint statement last week that lawmakers had “toiled through almost 2,200 provisions to reach compromise on important issues affecting our national security and our military.”For 59 straight years, they added, the NDAA has passed because lawmakers and presidents agreed to set aside their own preferences “and put the needs of our military personnel and America’s security first. The time has come to do that again.”The powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the defense bill is not the place for the big tech fight.“I agree with his sentiments — we ought to do away with 230,” Inhofe told reporters. “But you can’t do it in this bill.”Trump’s veto threat in the final months of his administration is his latest attempt to bend the norms. From redirecting money intended for military bases to build the border wall with Mexico to installing acting nominees in administrative positions without Senate confirmation, Trump has chipped away at the legislative branch throughout his term.If he does veto the defense bill, Congress could cut short its Christmas recess to hold override votes, senior House members said.“I think we can override the veto, if in fact he vetoes,’‘ House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday before the vote. “I hope he does not veto, I hope he reconsiders. And I think he will get substantial pressure, advice (from Republicans) that, you know, you don’t want to put the defense bill at risk.’‘White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump’s attempt to pressure Congress on Section 230 was justified.“Twitter has become a publisher, choosing to fact-check content,” she said. “And when you’re a publisher, there are certain responsibilities with that and you should not be immune from liability.”Past presidents have certainly threatened to veto defense bills, which set annual policy with troop levels, equipment priorities, pay raises and other matters.The defense bill is typically a widely bipartisan measure, one of the few areas of common ground. Over the summer, the Senate approved its version, 86-14, while the House similarly passed its effort, with opposition coming mostly from the liberal and conservative flanks.Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have railed against the social media companies, especially during the heated November election. McCarthy, R-Calif., voted for the bill Tuesday but said he would not support overriding the veto.Some Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, agree the Section 230 provision could be revisited, even as they disagree with Trump’s tactic of attaching it to the defense bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-democratic-controlled-house-approves-defense-policy-bill-with-a-veto-proof-margin/story-eeZP8krgjbPTm0YkeCATTI.html

Extending Washington’s continuous support to Hong Kong, Sullivan said that the US stands united against China’s assault on freedom of Hong Kong.“We stand united with our allies and partners against China’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms--and to help those persecuted find safe haven,” the tweet read further.This comes after the police arrested eight more activists on Tuesday over a pro-democracy demonstration in July, the latest move by authorities in a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the region.The arrests have come days after media mogul Jimmy Lai, the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, on Thursday was reported to have been charged with fraud and then denied bail.In August too, the tycoon was arrested under the national security law.Pro-Beijing administration in recent times has launched a crackdown against pro-democracy activists and politicians, and have several arrests since the passing of security law, which is deemed as draconian by people of Hong Kong and countries like the United States.The United States on Monday slapped sanctions against 14 Chinese officials for undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong.US State Secretary Michael Pompeo, in a statement, said that Beijing’s “unrelenting” assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition.“Today, the Department of State is holding accountable those responsible for these brazen acts. We are designating 14 Vice-Chairpersons of the NPCSC in connection with developing, adopting, or implementing the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” the statement read.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers have been arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian national security law was imposed on the city by Beijing. The law criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the Parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.Several countries have criticised China, with the European Council saying the move to disqualify opposition lawmakers constituted a “further severe blow” to freedom of opinion in the city and “significantly undermines Hong Kong’s autonomy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-aide-deeply-concerned-over-china-s-assault-on-hong-kong/story-a0rWawKzwhE2v2WO7tUKPM.html

The prosecution can also seek to have the person deported from Denmark.The Russian Embassy in Copenhagen identified the suspect as a man and said in a statement that it considers the arrest a mistake and hopes for his acquittal.“We expect the Danish judiciary to take an unbiased approach to the case,” the Embassy said. “We hope that the court will acquit our citizen and set him free.”No date has been set for the criminal case, which is is expected to be held behind closed doors. Denmark’s TV2 broadcaster said the trial would be held in Aalborg, northern Denmark.In 2012, Finnish national Timo Kivimaki who was working with the University of Copenhagen as a researcher, was sentenced to four months in prison for spying on Denmark on behalf of Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-charges-russian-citizen-with-espionage/story-4RGWzzp9QH0ZaQEbLF2vRK.html

In 2019, seven jihadist terrorist attacks were carried out in the EU, and twice that number of plots were thwarted by law enforcement.“Member states should urgently complete the modernisation of our external border management within the agreed roadmaps, with the ambition of developing the world’s most modern border management system,” the commission said.Under the Schengen Information System regulations implemented two years ago, national authorities are already required to create alerts related to “terrorist offenses” and member states need to share information with Europol.“Despite the progress made, more work is needed,” said the commission, which plans to strengthen the EU agency for law enforcement with an increased budget and larger competences, including the possibility to issue its own alerts on foreign fighters.The EU’s executive branch also plans to work with member states to improve access to digital evidence and encrypted information used by criminals.The commission estimates that 5,000 EU residents have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadist groups, including 1,500 who are still in the area and could return with plans to hit European targets.“All those entering the EU, citizens or not, must be checked against the relevant databases,” said the commission, which will also propose that individuals who have been denied a firearm for security reason in one EU country can’t apply for a weapon in another member state.In its proposals, the commission urged EU countries to ensure the interoperability of their information systems and to share intelligence on foreign fighters in a bid to carry out efficient, systematic targeted checks.Last month, after France was hit by consecutive attacks in October, French president Emmanuel Macron pleaded in favour of a reform of the Schengen agreement, through which most EU countries abolished their national borders, to reinforce European security. The topic is expected to be discussed during a meeting of EU leaders starting Thursday in Brussels.France has already reintroduced border checks since the Paris attacks and is planning to further reinforce its police and military presence at its own borders. More recently, Austria, Sweden and Denmark also reintroduced reinforced controls, citing security reasons.As part of its strategy to fight radicalisation, the EU’s executive branch also urged member states and EU lawmakers to quickly adopt legislation proposed in 2018 and still being discussed that would ensure that terror content would be removed from the internet within an hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-to-boost-border-security-against-extremist-attacks/story-GYgNQxGEtxwWM7imbgEpaP.html

Rehman denied media reports that the PPP was reluctant to resign from parliament. Observers said that the party, which enjoys a majority government in the Sindh province, does not want to leave provincial assemblies or let go of its provincial government.The PML-N, at the same time, has started full scale preparations for a PDM rally in Lahore on Sunday. It is believed that if PDM makes a good show in Lahore, the Imran Khan government will come under pressure to enter talks with opposition party leaders. The PDM has demanded the removal of Khan and holding of general elections. A successful rally in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, which is the political heartland of Pakistan, could force the army to rethink its strategy about supporting the Khan government and press for changes and compromise, say observers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-lawmakers-to-quit-en-masse-threatens-joint-alliance/story-Er8AXQINqt189YwlT8OiLO.html

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued precautionary advice to the National Health Service (NHS) after two health care staff members experienced allergic reactions.NHS England confirmed that both staff members have a significant history of allergic reactions to the extent that they need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector with them. Shortly after the two staff members were administered with the first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine, they developed symptoms of “anaphylactoid reaction”. They are currently recovering after receiving appropriate treatment, reported the British media.The MHRA has advised that people with such “significant” allergic reactions to medicines, food or vaccines should not get the vaccine jab. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, testified to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, where she acknowledged that the cases of allergic reactions didn’t feature in the extensive clinical trials.“We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature. But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations – the groups have been selected as a priority – we get that advice to the field immediately,” said Dr Raine.Also Read | UK looking at allergic reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccineOn Tuesday, Britain rolled out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, becoming the first Western nation to start inoculating its general population.

Since 2017 many more households, including families with children, have been pushed to the brink,” the JRF’s research said.The foundation defines destitution as when a household cannot afford two or more of the essentials we all need to live, like shelter, food, heating and clothing.According to the report, of the 2.4 million people that experienced destitution at any point during 2019, around 550,000 were children. It also found that one in five destitute people are homeless or suffer from drug and alcohol problems, while some 54 per cent have a chronic health problem or disability.“I’m appalled, I’m ashamed and I’m angry. Nearly 2.5 million people experienced destitution in 2019. That’s more than a 50 per cent increase since 2017. More than half a million children are growing up with the experience of destitution,” JRF director Helen Barnard said in a video published on Twitter in which she called for improving social security, building more social homes and creating better paid, more secure jobs.The study said although destitution has risen sharply across the UK, the highest levels are in northern cities and towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-over-2-million-uk-families-likely-to-plunge-into-poverty-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-I8p7RLYg8hdxGveyAp94NO.html

09-12-2020||World||Explained: Why did height of Mount Everest change?||The world’s highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world’s highest peak will likely ensure the question isn’t settled for good.GEOLOGICAL UPS AND DOWNSThe mountain’s height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest’s height earlier this year.“Nature tends to strike a balance,” he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.MEASURING MOUNTAINSThere’s more than one way to measure a mountain.Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest’s peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain’s height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.AND THE ANSWER IS ...China and Nepal presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The agreement announced Wednesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between the two countries.The new height is 0.86 meters (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries’ two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The two had diverged for year over the mountain’s actual height.Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.HAWAII’S UNDERWATER GIANTHow high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain’s height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.As measured from the Earth’s core, Ecuador’s Mount Chimborazo is the world’s highest, standing more than 2,072 meters (6,800 feet) above Everest.

09-12-2020||World||China set to bail out Iraq with multibillion-dollar oil deal||Iraq is poised to sign a multibillion-dollar contract with China ZhenHua Oil Co., a bailout from Beijing for the cash-strapped government which will receive money upfront in exchange for long-term oil supplies.The deal is the latest example of China, via state-controlled trading companies and banks, lending to struggling oil producers such as Angola, Venezuela and Ecuador, with repayment in the form of oil barrels rather than cash. This year’s crash in oil prices has hammered Iraq’s budget and the government has failed to pay teachers and civil servants on time.The Iraqi agency in charge of petroleum exports, SOMO, picked ZhenHua after asking oil traders for bids, according to people familiar with the matter. Cabinet spokesman Hassan Nadhim said on Tuesday there had been “several offers” and they were being studied before Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi makes the final decision.Under the terms of a letter SOMO sent last month, the winning bidder will buy 4 million barrels a month, or about 130,000 a day. They will pay upfront for one year of supply, which at current prices would bring in more than $2 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations. The deal runs for five years -- but the upfront payment is only for one year.The deal attracted widespread interest among major oil traders, according to the people. The deadline for the tender was extended from late November to allow companies more time to bid.ZhenHua Oil didn’t reply to an email seeking comment that was sent to its headquarters in Beijing after normal business hours on Tuesday.All major producers have taken a hit from oil’s coronavirus-triggered plunge. But Iraq, where crude accounts for almost all government revenue, is in a worse position than most. Its economy will contract 12% this year, more than that of any other OPEC member under a production quota, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.Thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets in recent months to protest about worsening living conditions. The government has struggled to fulfil its commitments to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which agreed at the height of the pandemic in April to cut output. Baghdad has pumped above its cap on several occasions, angering OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia.Rare DealEnergy-rich nations short on revenue have often relied on pre-payment deals to raise money, but Baghdad hasn’t done so until now. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq has used similar contracts in the past, as have Chad and the Republic of Congo.In a pre-payment deal, the oil buyer effectively becomes a lender to the country. The barrels are security for the loan.Iraq’s woes make it harder for the government to raise money more conventionally, such as through the bond market. The country’s dollar yields average 7.5%, one of the highest levels for any sovereign. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this week that Iraq was among the most vulnerable bond issuers heading into 2021.The pre-payment part of Iraq’s contract is one of the largest in recent history, although less than the record $10 billion that Russia’s state-run Rosneft raised in 2013 from trading houses Vitol Group and Glencore Plc.Besides its size, the Iraqi deal is rare because it allows the winner to ship crude to wherever it wishes for a year. Normally, Middle Eastern crude is sold with strict clauses preventing traders and refiners from re-selling the barrels to different regions.The exclusion of that clause was probably seen as advantageous enough to compensate for the fact the pre-payment money is effectively interest-free for Iraq. A country usually pays a yield for the cash it receives upfront.Revitalize ChinaZhenHua produces and trades oil. The company has played a large role in Beijing’s so-called “going global” policy for energy. It has invested in oil concessions in the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Myanmar, and trades crude originating from the likes of Kuwait, Brazil and the Republic of Congo.The company was founded in 2003 as a subsidiary of the largest Chinese state-owned defense contractor, known as Norinco. According to its website, ZhenHua trades about 1.3 million barrels a day of oil and finished products.Other major Chinese traders include Unipec, Chinaoil and Sinochem. Shrouded in relative secrecy in the past, these state companies are gaining prominence as China’s oil consumption rises. It’s set to soon overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest crude importer.ZhenHua, meaning “Revitalize China” in Mandarin, started a joint-venture with SOMO to market barrels into China in 2018, though it was later scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-bail-out-iraq-with-multibillion-dollar-oil-deal/story-AVA37OYwkRXgqlNMRhr4EK.html
09-12-2020||World||UK looking at allergic reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine||People with a history of allergic reaction should not have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, British health officials said on Wednesday, after two individuals who received it on Tuesday showed strong adverse reaction.“We’re looking at two case reports of allergic reactions,’’said Dr June Raine, head of the UK’s medical regulatory agency as she testified on Wednesday to a Parliamentary committee. “We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature.”Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the new advice is that people with a significant history of allergy to vaccines and drugs should not have the vaccine.Stephen Powis, England’s medical director, said: “As is common with new vaccines the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday. Both are recovering well”.Thousands of people were vaccinated with the vaccine across the UK on Tuesday, with more attending clinics and hospitals on Wednesday. The initial supply of 800,000 doses is to be followed by 4 million more from Belgium before the end of the month.Raine said: “Even last evening we were looking at two case reports of allergic reactions. We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature, that if we need to strengthen our advice now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations - the groups have been selected as a priority - we get that advice to the field immediately”.She said it was possible to approve the vaccine expeditiously because the MHRA adopted a “novel or innovative” regulatory process, known as the rolling review of data from trials.“Normally, all the data on a vaccine’s safety, quality and effectiveness, and all required documentation, must be submitted together to start an evaluation to approve a medicine or a vaccine”.“But in this case, in the case of a rolling review, we reviewed data in packages or tranches as soon as they became available from the ongoing studies, on a staggered basis. By reviewing data as soon as it became available, we could reach an opinion sooner on whether the medicine or the vaccine could be approved.”Raine added that the flexibility and the agility of the clinicians and scientists at the MHRA, coupled with their familiarity with vaccine development and approval, and the access to independent expert advice was key to its ability to progress in the shortest time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-looking-at-allergic-reaction-to-pfizer-biontech-vaccine/story-mwk3Xklr2kdUKDGUIVuxSL.html
09-12-2020||World||Poles voice fears of ‘Polexit’ as govt defies EU over budget||As the Polish government plays a game of chicken with the European Union over its next long-term budget, some Poles are voicing fears that a drawn-out conflict could put their country on a path toward an eventual departure from the bloc, or “Polexit.”Poland’s conservative government, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Law and Justice party, denies that it has ever wanted to leave the 27-member bloc and popular support for EU membership runs extremely high.But critics fear the combative tone of Polish leaders — who have recently compared the EU to the Soviet Union and used terms like “political enslavement” to describe Poland’s predicament in the standoff — could create momentum, which if unstopped, could accidently bring the nation to the exit door.The fears are rooted in a threat by the Polish and Hungarian governments to block the EU’s 1.82 trillion-euro ($2.21 trillion) budget for the next seven years, including a coronavirus recovery package. The veto threat comes after other EU members voted to introduce a new rule that would allow the bloc to cut funding to EU nations that violate the rule of law.Both countries, under their nationalist right-wing governments, have eroded judicial and media independence, creating concerns about democratic backsliding.That issue will be debated at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday.Similar concerns about a “Huxit” are mirrored to a lesser extent in Hungary, where the government has often portrayed the EU in Brussels as a foreign, despotic power that aims to bend Hungary to its will — especially on immigration.In November, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban echoed Polish parallels between the EU and Soviet Union, saying the EU budget’s rule of law conditions resembled the “ideological blackmail” practiced by the USSR.But both Poland and Hungary are so dependent on EU funding — and their populations so favorable toward the freedom it gives their workers to cross borders — that it seems unlikely they would ever truly take the self-defeating step of leaving.Still, Polish critics have been urging the government to chose a more conciliatory path, arguing that if Poland ever finds itself outside the EU, its difficult geographic position in central Europe would leave it vulnerable like Ukraine and Belarus, exposed to the Kremlin’s considerable influence.“Due to its position, Poland cannot be neutral,” Senate Speaker Tomasz Grodzki of the opposition Civic Platform party said in a nationally televised address on Nov. 27 in which he appealed to the government to drop its tough position. “Either it is in the family of Western civilization or among the authoritarian dictatorships of the East.”The ruling party countered that Grodzki has no authority to conduct foreign policy and that his position is harmful because it contradicts the government’s official negotiating position. Both Polish and Hungarian governments argue they are actually the ones upholding rules set out in the EU treaty, which does not contain a mechanism to link funding to rule of law.As the governments in Poland and Hungary dig into their stance, other EU countries have begun considering options that would allow the bloc’s 25 other nations to launch the coronavirus recovery plan without them.The fears of a hypothetical Polexit are fueled by Brexit, Britain’s messy divorce from the EU, which is seen as accidental. It was set in motion when former British Prime Minister David Cameron called for a referendum, actually intending to keep the EU in, but lost the vote.Those who see Polexit as extremely unlikely point to the very different national perceptions of EU membership.For the British, EU membership mainly brought access to a larger market, and with that came regulations and costs deemed burdensome by many.But for Poles, joining the EU in 2004 — five years after joining NATO — ushered them fully into the Western fold after decades of Soviet-imposed authoritarian rule. It also opened up enormous opportunities for Polish workers to earn higher wages abroad.“Our emotional attachment is stronger than in the UK,” said Piotr Buras, director of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.If the Polish government would ever decide to leave the EU for ideological and political reasons, it would essentially mark the rejection of the Western democratic model of society and politics, he said.“I cannot imagine Poland outside of the European Union remaining a democratic and liberal country,” Buras said. But he also argued that “Poles would never tolerate a government that would basically decide to leave the European Union in order to stay in power.”Warsaw stands to lose billions of euros if it is bypassed in the coronavirus recovery fund. Also at risk are study abroad plans by Polish students for the next academic year as part of the popular Erasmus exchange program.Poland’s three living former presidents, noting their own long efforts to build a democratic nation, asked the government in a joint appeal this week “to stop blackmailing other European Union countries.”“This is harmful to Poland and its place in a united Europe,” Lech Walesa, Aleksander Kwasniewski and Bronislaw Komorowski wrote.Last week 50 Polish cities turned off lights on key buildings, bridges and other landmarks, symbolically showing the darkness that would come if municipalities are stripped of EU development funds.Grodzki, the Senate speaker, had a warning for the nationalist government.“If you cause Poland to lose gigantic money for further development and reconstruction, if you also lead us out of our European home, history and the people will not forgive you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poles-voice-fears-of-polexit-as-govt-defies-eu-over-budget/story-gJyNcPDyLs0t4U5EYSgP5I.html

But some countries such as the United States have not signed up, having secured bilateral deals.COVAX hopes to deliver some 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 but that would still only represent about 20% of the populations of countries that are part of the mechanism.“Nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against Covid-19 next year unless urgent action is taken,” Amnesty International said, based on recent calculations.“Updated data shows that rich nations representing just 14% of the world’s population have bought up 53% of all the most promising vaccines so far,” it said.Amnesty said Canada was the country that had bought the most shots when considering the size of its population with enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian five times.The organisation urged support for a proposal made by South Africa and India to the World Trade Organisation Council to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amnesty-rich-countries-have-bought-too-many-covid-19-vaccines/story-i2wdw8J1rE1P1hiCa58WxK.html
09-12-2020||World||How the world is preparing for ‘a different Christmas’ during Covid-19 pandemic||Governments and scientists all over the world are mulling over if and how families should celebrate Christmas and New Year while the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic rages on. Governments fear that relaxing rules and restrictions might usher in another spike in the number of cases when many countries are already witnessing a second wave.After a year of battling losses, families are anxious to get together during the holiday season. The US, which is the worst-hit country, saw increased travelling around thanksgiving, when people decided to travel back home to their families despite experts warning against it. Dr Hans Kluge, regional director of WHO’s Europe office, said on Thursday, “It will be a different Christmas, but that does not mean that it cannot be a merry one”.Here’s a breakdown of the world wide measures announced so far.ItalyItaly approved new restrictions in the end of November with hopes of avoiding a renewed surge of Covid-19 cases around the holiday season. The European country - one of those badly hit by the pandemic, Italy banned midnight mass and halted inter-town movements. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged people on national television to not invite guests over for Christmas celebrations. Between December 1 and January 6, movement between the country’s 20 regions has been limited to emergencies and for work. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day, Italians will not be allowed to leave their respective towns. FranceFrench President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the majority of the lockdown measures will be eased from December 15 for the festive break. Shops, cinemas, and theatres will reopen just in time for Christmas. Domestic travel will be allowed without any restrictions, the nation-wide curfew that is scheduled to come into force on December 15 will be lifted for Christmas Day so people can visit their families. Restaurants, cafes, bars, and nightclubs will be closed for the foreseeable future. Religious service for Christmas will be permitted but with a limit of 30 people. All the hugely popular french ski resorts will, however, remain closed this year. GermanyGermany has been placed under a light lockdown until January 10. The German government has imposed travel restrictions during the festive period, and limited indoor gatherings over the Christmas holidays to 10 people (children below 14 are exempted from this limit). Christmas markets and New Year’s firework displays both have been cancelled. USUS has no uniform travel restrictions in place for the holiday season, as states have the freedom to impose their own restrictions. Currently, 22 states have imposed travel restrictions, with Alaska, California, Hawaii, Connecticut asking travellers to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Illinois has asked travellers arriving from states with a huge number of coronavirus cases to quarantine for 14 days. Meanwhile, New Jersey authorities have strictly advised against any non-essential travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-world-is-preparing-for-a-different-christmas-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-elFn2V3YYonTieEULgoQMI.html

Tickets for a 15-minute trip costing 300 euros ($364) are already on sale.Volocopter completed a demonstration flight over Singapore’s Marina Bay area in October last year, and the first commercial route is likely to fly tourists over the same district, offering spectacular views of the skyline, the company said. Later services could including cross-border journeys.Singapore is at the forefront of plans to introduce flying taxis thanks to a more welcoming regulatory regime than in some other countries. While the craft could replace helicopters and light aircraft on some routes, they’d also be small and nimble enough to fly deep within cities and land with minimal space.“Singapore is renowned for its leading role in adapting and living new technologies,” Volocopter Chief Executive Officer Florian Reuter said, adding that local capabilities in battery research, material science and route validation for autonomous operations will be central to the project.Volocopter, which counts computer chip manufacturer Intel Corp. and automakers Daimler AG and Geely as investors, plans to set up a team of 50 pilots, engineers and operations specialists to support the Singapore flights.The craft will initially carry a pilot and one customer, though services could switch to two passengers once approvals for autonomous operation are received. Ticket prices should fall sharply once flights become more widely available, according to Volocopter.Obtaining necessary approvals from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency will be a prerequisite for flights, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-electric-air-taxis-set-to-fly-in-singapore-by-2023/story-UNNcm9M035KBCiG2OPTaKN.html

Nations such as France and the UK, which had harsher lockdowns, are gradually easing measures.While vaccinations will start in the first quarter, she warned that the country won’t be able to carry out enough immunizations over the winter to change the course of the pandemic. The latest incidence rate stands at 149 infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days, nearly three times the government’s target of 50.“What will people say looking back at a once-in-a-century event if we can’t find a solution” for the coming weeks, the visibly emotional chancellor said. “If we have too many contacts before Christmas, and it turns out to be the last Christmas with the grandparents, we will have missed an opportunity.”Germany had record Covid-19 fatalities over the past 24 hours, highlighting the government’s struggles to contain the disease.

09-12-2020||World||Emissions hit new record, world on track for 3C warming, says UN||Greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high last year, putting the world on track for an average temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius, a UN report showed on Wednesday.The report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - the latest to suggest the world is hurtling toward extreme climate change - follows a year of sobering weather extremes, including rapid ice loss in the Arctic as well as record heat waves and wildfires in Siberia and the US West.On Monday, researchers at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the hottest-ever November on record.“The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director.The annual “emissions gap” report measures the gap between anticipated emissions and those consistent with limiting the global temperature rise this century as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement.Under the global climate pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5C.Also Read |  UK energy networks given 20% more to spend on net zero goalEmissions have, however, grown by an average 1.4 percent per year since 2010, with a steeper increase of 2.6 percent last year due, partly due to a large increase in forest fires.Total 2019 emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) hit a new record of 59.1 gigatonnes.This year, there has been a temporary emissions dip as economies slowed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The resulting drop in travel, industrial activity and electricity generation are likely to work out at a 7% reduction in emissions, the report said. That translates to only a 0.01C reduction in global warming by 2050.Green investment under government stimulus packages to pull economies out of the pandemic-induced slump could cut up to 25% off emissions predicted in 2030.Such packages could put emissions in 2030 at 44 GtCO2e - within the range that gives a 66% chance of holding temperature rises to below 2C, but still insufficient to achieve the 1.5C goal.The United Nations and Britain are holding an online event on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and governments are under pressure to come forward with tougher climate targets before the end of the year.A growing number of countries have committed to net zero emissions by mid-century but these need to be translated into strong near-term policies and action, the UNEP report said.“The levels of ambition in the Paris Agreement still must be roughly tripled for the 2C pathway and increased at least fivefold for the 1.5C pathway,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emissions-hit-new-record-world-on-track-for-3c-warming-says-un/story-08cm7FyhYjVWC7O0jWj1cI.html

However, the downward trend in infections has flattened, with the number of confirmed new cases rising to above 13,000 on Tuesday.Health officials acknowledge the 5,000 target is almost certainly beyond reach by Dec. 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-will-delay-easing-of-lockdown-if-necessary/story-WaxJv8Mes7oznSxsAitw8I.html

Trump says the result was fraudulent, but no court has found evidence to support his assertions.Last week, a district court in Nevada ruled that the Trump campaign had not proven a claim that there had been a malfunction in voting devices and the contest between Trump and Biden had been manipulated.“We also are not convinced that the district court erred in applying a burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, as supported by the cases cited in the district court’s order,” Nevada’s Supreme Court said in its judgement.Nevada’s Republican Party said it was “extremely disappointed” by the decision.“We were not afforded an opportunity to write our brief or argue the case in front of the Court,” Nevada’s GOP said in a statement. “Full denial of legitimate due process and appellate rights is truly unprecedented, shocking and extraordinary.”Biden won Nevada by a 33,596-vote margin, giving him the state’s six votes in the Electoral College which choses the president. The electors are scheduled to meet on Dec. 14 to formalize the outcome, with Biden having won 306 votes to 232 for Trump.Tuesday was marked as the so-called safe harbor deadline for states to resolve disputes arising from the election. Under US law, Congress will consider a state’s election result to be “conclusive” if it is finalized by the safe harbor date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nevada-s-top-court-rejects-trump-campaign-s-appeal-to-overturn-election-results/story-gDrtJvkjYsxiFiMa19w4kN.html

But his idea was overruled by others, chiefly by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the The Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).It is believed that en masse resignation is the only way to bring the government on its knees and force it to call early elections.The PPP government in the Sindh province was considered as a hurdle as it was not sure if that it would sacrifice its government to help the Opposition alliance.The leaders also agreed to go ahead with a rally in Lahore on December 13 as a show of power to the government. It will be the sixth rally after similar gatherings held in Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar and Multan.The Opposition parties succeeded in attracting a huge number of people despite hurdles created by the government.Prime Minister Imran Khan rejected the demand to step down or call early elections and consistently advocated that Opposition was protesting to put pressure to stop probes in corruption cases against their leaders.Speaking to a group of senior journalists and columnists on Tuesday, he said that “by-election will be held on the vacant seats” and no concession would be given to the protesting parties.However, experts and Opposition leaders argue that when hundreds of lawmakers resign from the national and provincial assemblies, it would be virtually impossible to avoid general elections.“The government will be forced to call general elections, otherwise the legitimacy of the entire process will be questionable,” said PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal, warning the more protests would follow in case elections were not held.The Opposition alliance has alleged that Khan was supported in elections by the ‘establishment’ and also failed to run the country and address chronic issues.PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has directly named Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI head Lt Gen Faiz Hameed for meddling in political affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-lawmakers-to-resign-en-masse-to-paralyse-govt-pdm-chief-rehman/story-QLjDiUakRwuaDMmygA3SYI.html
09-12-2020||World||China using big data to detain Muslim minorities in Xinjiang: Report||The Chinese government is using big data to arbitrarily detain Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, a leaked list of more than 2,000 detainees from the province suggests.A new report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), which carried the list, says the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a predictive computer programme, analyses data and selects members of minority communities to be detained.“A big data programme for policing in China’s Xinjiang region arbitrarily selects Turkic Muslims for possible detention… A leaked list of over 2,000 detainees from Aksu prefecture provided to HRW is further evidence of China’s use of technology in its repression of the Muslim population,” the report released on Wednesday said.The IJOP programme automatically selects possible detainees for the controversial camps set up in the remote region according to parameters including studying the Koran, wearing religious clothing or travelling internationally.“The Aksu List (from 2018) provides further insights into how China’s brutal repression of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at HRW.“The Chinese government owes answers to the families of those on the list: why were they detained, and where are they now?”“The Aksu list is the first time we have seen the IJOP in action in detaining people,” said Wang.Experts from the UN and human rights advocates have said that at least a million from Muslim Uyghur community have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).China has denied that Uyghurs were incarcerated in the camps, saying the government had set up vocational training institutes, which were also meant to de-radicalise locals and fight terrorism, separatism and extremism.The inmates have been released from the camps, Beijing has said.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.“Xinjiang issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion at all, but about combating violence, terrorism and separatism. The series of measures Xinjiang has taken are not only in accordance with China’s laws but are also concrete steps and manifestations of China’s implementation of the international counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation initiatives,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier this year.China, however, has been strongly criticised for its treatment of Muslim minorities in the vast northwestern province.“The mass surveillance and arbitrary detention of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims violate fundamental rights under China’s constitution and international human rights law. Article 37 of the constitution states that all arrests must be approved by either the procuratorate (the state prosecution agency) or the courts,” the HRW report added.“‘Predictive policing’ platforms are really just a pseudo-scientific fig leaf for the Chinese government to justify vast repression of Turkic Muslims,” Wang said. “The Chinese government should immediately shut down the IJOP, delete all the data it has collected, and release everyone arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-big-data-to-detain-muslim-minorities-in-xinjiang-report/story-qYxaQDzWdo0LbjhyTfYHjP.html

If they do, we will study the data,” EMA’s Executive Director Emer Cooke told Italian daily la Repubblica, when asked about the Chinese and Russian vaccines.China has approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac and state-owned Sinopharm for emergency use.Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, doing so before large-scale trials were complete, stirring concern among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot.The Russian vaccine Sputnik V is being developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute and marketed by Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).Cooke said the agency was not under any pressure to accelerate procedures to authorise the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech or one by Moderna .“If anything, the pressure is scientific, because we want to be certain to do what is best for citizens” she said, adding that EMA acted independently.She said the agency was still expecting to complete its review of the Pfizer and BioNTEch vaccine by Dec 29 and to finalise its review of the Moderna vaccine by Jan 12.The European Union Commission authorises vaccines based on EMA’s scientific advice after consultation with the 27 EU states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-have-not-sought-ema-s-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccines/story-ux6n9mfXj6FQmmo62HfKnO.html
09-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca vaccine better at stopping Covid-19 than slowing transmission: Report||A vaccine from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc shows only a limited ability to stop transmission of the coronavirus despite preventing Covid-19 illness in a majority of those who are infected.As promising vaccine data keeps rolling in, one of the central unanswered questions has been whether inoculations can not only stop people from getting sick but also slow the spread of the virus, a key element for reopening economies.Oxford and Astra are the first vaccine developers to unveil data on asymptomatic infection rates in people who received their shot. Overall, it reduced such transmissions by 27% in a large study, according to peer-reviewed results published in the Lancet medical journal on Tuesday.That’s well below the vaccine’s 70% effectiveness at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 cases overall, though even those results are clouded by questions over its benefits in older recipients.Researchers tested more than 6,000 study participants in the U.K. for Covid-19 infections on a weekly basis and found 29 asymptomatic infections in the vaccinated group. That compared with 40 cases in the control group, which was roughly the same size.Smaller GroupVaccine efficacy against asymptomatic transmission was higher, at 59%, in a smaller group that received a half dose, followed by a full second dose, rather than two full shots. The data support Oxford’s preliminary finding that the low-dose, full-dose regimen appears to elicit a stronger immune response, preventing 90% of infections. Two full doses were only 4% effective against asymptomatic transmission.Although vaccines that prevent illness but not transmission could be widely used and help lower the disease’s death toll, they could also lead to complacency within populations, experts say. Those who are immunized with them could still spread the virus to other, more vulnerable people, including those who’ve yet to receive a shot or can’t get one for medical reasons.Andrew Pollard, the Oxford professor who led the study, called the data “tantalizing” but said it was too early to draw firm conclusions. He said researchers are trying to analyze the amount of virus in the swabs to determine whether vaccination reduced viral loads, which would help limit contagion.“What would be fantastic would be vaccines that prevent transmission so you reach the point where you not only protect the people who are vaccinated but also those who can’t be vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated yet,” he said in an interview.Similar questions surround other early Covid vaccines, including one from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that’s been approved in the U.K. -- where the first shots were given Tuesday. It’s possible that shot didn’t work as well at preventing asymptomatic cases as it did at preventing illness, according to a report by staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Pfizer expects to report data on whether or not its vaccine stops transmission of the virus within the first quarter of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-better-at-stopping-covid-19-than-slowing-transmission-report/story-wMC0v2fCW9McifQziPjHgP.html

The original bones are those of a Hoplophoneus -- not technically cats, they are an extinct genus of the Nimravidae family and once stalked the plains of North America.Such extinct predatory mammals are commonly known as sabre-toothed tigers.Also on sale was a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth which fetched just over $6,000, while a 85-cm long fin from a mosasaur -- a marine reptile that in the Cretaceous period was at the top of the submarine food chain -- was bought for almost $8,000.A 75-million-year-old ammolite -- an opal-like organic gemstone in shades of red and orange -- measuring 40 cm long by 36 cm wide remained unsold because the reserve price was not met.Debate rages as to the right balance between the scientific value of such items and their worth on the open market. Some palaeontologists insist animal or plant fossils are not decorative objects for collectors, but witness to the evolution of life on Earth and therefore scientific articles that ought to be studied and then shared with the public in museums.Before the sale, Swiss collector Yann Cuenin told AFP: “If we’re talking about the sabre-toothed tiger, for example, it’s not a skeleton which is of major scientific interest, in the sense that it’s something which is already known to science. “I am all for museums, but I am also in favour of objects living among us; for there to be collectors, for pieces to be bought and sold -- that’s what brings culture to life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sabre-toothed-tiger-skeleton-sells-for-70-000-a-year-after-discovery/story-A0mQgEbZIqDHLtxjnj2EKN.html

The Astra-Oxford shot looks less effective than that vaccine and another from Moderna Inc., which each showed 95% efficacy in trials, but is expected to be cheaper and easier to deploy.The Lancet report provides the first peer-reviewed data from any of the leading vaccines.The initial data from Astra and Oxford last month appeared positive but raised concern over how much protection the shot would offer after the trials produced two different results from two dosing regimens. The partners said their vaccine was 90% effective when a half-dose was given before a full-dose booster, and that two full doses showed an efficacy of 62%.It later emerged the lower dose was the result of a manufacturing mistake and only tested in a younger group. Astra Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in an interview last month the company would set up an additional, probably global, trial to verify the 90% result. On Tuesday, the company said it’s still deciding whether to hold an additional study, while Pollard said Oxford had no plans for an extra UK trial at present. A separate study is underway in the US.No RushWhile the vaccine’s efficacy rate may be enough to get it approved, the variability in different subgroups and lack of data for older people should give regulators pause in rushing this through, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli.“I would wait until at least the US trial, which is much more tightly controlled in terms of dosing and intervals between doses, reads out before approving the vaccine,” said Fazeli.The US study has recruited 17,000 participants out of its 40,000-person target, and won’t yield initial results until late January or early February, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific officer of the US Operation Warp Speed project. That means a potential emergency-use authorization could come toward the end of February or early March, he said Tuesday.The results published in The Lancet, based on advanced trials of 11,636 people in the UK and Brazil, were reviewed after 131 participants contracted Covid-19. Of those, 30 were in the group that received the vaccine and 101 in the control arm, equating to an efficacy rate of 70%, according to The Lancet data.Also Read | Covishield vaccine trial: Six out of 249 volunteers drop out ahead of second dose in MumbaiWhile the vast majority of 175 severe adverse events were deemed unrelated to the Covid-19 or control shots, one case of the neurological disorder transverse myelitis may be linked to the shot, the paper said.Astra shares were little changed early Wednesday in London.More StudyFurther trials to substantiate the findings and an investigation of efficacy in older adults are needed, Maria Deloria Knoll and Chizoba Wonodi of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in an article accompanying the data.The authors noted “limitations” with the results, including less than 4% of participants who were older than 70 years of age, as well as the finding that no participants older than 55 received the mixed-dose regimen. Still, they said that the expected lower price of the vaccine holds promise for lower- and middle-income nations.“Despite the outstanding questions and challenges in delivering these vaccines, it is hard not to be excited about these findings and the existence of three safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccines,” they wrote.The lack of clarity over the true efficacy of the Astra-Oxford jab and plans for the additional study aren’t expected to hold up regulatory approvals in the UK and European Union, Soriot said last month, with a green light in Britain possible by year-end. US approval won’t come until 2021, after trials there were paused for nearly seven weeks following the incident of suspected transverse myelitis in the UK study. The British trial resumed in less than a week.The Oxford-Astra data will be scrutinized around the world, with many countries counting on the vaccine to protect their populations. It will cost a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and BioNTech, and the shot from Moderna. The Astra vaccine should also be easier to deploy, with storage temperatures of between two and eight degrees Celsius, compared with minus 70 for Pfizer’s shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-effective-but-questions-remain-for-elderly/story-C9X7E0KTjuzjvMpLRdDHBO.html

In one case in February off the coast of Japan, passengers were stuck for weeks aboard the Diamond Princess with over 700 guests and crew infected. “A guest was feeling unwell and tested positive for Covid-19...We are asking all guests to remain in their state rooms to prevent the spread of illness,” the captain of the Quantum of the Seas told passengers over the tannoy in a video shared on social media. “We kindly ask all guests with urgent medical or health situations like diabetes, heart disease etc to contact guest services,” he said, adding that the ship had returned to Singapore a day before the end of its planned four-day sailing. Confirming the positive test, Royal Caribbean said in a statement that all guests and crew who had close contact with the infected guest have subsequently tested negative for the virus.“Emergency response plans have been activated according to guidelines including immediate isolation of close contacts, contact tracing and deep-cleaning of the ship,” Annie Chang, director of the cruise segment at Singapore Tourism Board said.Passengers will be able to disembark and medical support will be provided if necessary, she added. Royal Caribbean’s ‘cruises-to-nowhere’ from Singapore began last week, marking the firm’s first sailing since it halted its global operations in March due to the pandemic. The cruises are a part of Singapore’s plans to revive its tourism industry that has been battered due to the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 67.72 million people globally and killed 1,548,575​.Singapore, which has had just over 58,000 cases and 29 deaths, has been reporting less than a handful of local infections in recent weeks. The case on board is another setback for Singapore after a plan to open a quarantine-free air travel bubble with Hong Kong last month was postponed at the eleventh hour.Part of the precautions for the resumption of cruises in Singapore involves pre-departure testing and for guests to carry an electronic contact tracing device and to social distance at all times. The infected case’s close contacts will be placed in quarantine or health surveillance, the Straits Times newspaper reported citing an advisory from the health ministry. Others will need to monitor their health, while continuing regular activities including going to school or work, and undergo a swab test at the end of a 14-day monitoring period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-cruise-to-nowhere-turns-back-after-covid-19-case-aboard/story-whqjzvHVpHvAJ6mteMQZQN.html

Notably, the State Department did not accept the recommendation.India has rejected the USCIRF’s observations against the country in its annual report.“We reject the observations on India in the USCIRF Annual Report. Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels. It has not been able to carry its own Commissioners in its endeavour,” the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi in April in response to media queries on the observations in the USCIRF Annual Report.“We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly,” the spokesperson said.On Tuesday, US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Samuel Brownback defended the action taken against Pakistan.Also Read | US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushback “(In) Pakistan – a lot of their actions (violations of religious freedom) are done by the government. In India, some of them are done by the government and the law that was passed, and much of it’s communal violence. And then when that takes place, we try to determine whether or not there has been effective police enforcement, judicial action after communal violence takes place,” he told reporters during a conference call.Brownback was responding to a question as to why Pompeo designated Pakistan as a country of particular concern and not India. The top American diplomat said that half of the world’s people that are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy are in Pakistani jails.“We just had really a difficult webinar this morning on forced brides into China, and one of the source places is Pakistan religious minorities, Christians and Hindu women being marketed as concubines or forced brides into China because there’s not effective support, and then there’s discrimination against the religious minorities that make them more vulnerable,” he said.“That doesn’t mean that India doesn’t have problems. … The violence is a problem. We’ll continue to raise those issues, but those are some of the basis as to why Pakistan continues to be on the CPC list and India is not,” Brownback said, adding that he has made several trips to both the countries.There were several recommendations made by the commission that the Secretary did not follow, and this was one of them, Borwnback said when asked why India was not designated as a country of particular concern.“We watch the situation in India very closely. The Secretary’s travelled there multiple times. These issues have been raised in private discussions at the government – high government level, and they will continue to get raised,” he said.“I can’t go into the decision-making process that the Secretary went through. He’s well aware of a lot of the communal violence that’s happening in India; he’s well aware of the statute that has been enacted and the issues associated with the (Narendra) Modi government. And as I said, he’s raised it at the highest levels, but just decided at this point in time not to place them on a CPC or a Special Watch List,” Brownback said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violation-of-religious-freedom-in-pak-by-govt-in-india-much-of-it-s-communal-violence-us-diplomat/story-UqxpP9k4xhcm101zXRGvLI.html

Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The UAE’s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they “have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG’s interim analysis of the Phase III trials.”“The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,” the statement said.It wasn’t immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving “official registration” without elaborating on what that meant. Emirati officials could not be immediately reached for comment.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious Covid-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80% of its adults in an operation starting this month that’s relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus’ spike protein using RNA.Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-backed-sinopharm-virus-vaccine-has-86-efficacy-says-uae/story-cBHNAAlEtDW4dwJ6eopgrI.html
09-12-2020||World||West has policy to engage India in ‘anti-China games’, says Russian foreign minister Lavrov||Western powers have adopted an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies”, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. Lavrov also accused Western powers of trying to undermine Russia’s “close partnership and privileged relations with India”. The comments, made during the general meeting of the state-run think tank Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday, reflected Moscow’s traditional suspicion of the Indo-Pacific concept. The remarks are also significant as Russia has been nudging India and China to resolve the border standoff. Criticising Western and European powers for their “notorious concept” of a rules-based order and use of sanctions for alleged chemical and cyber-hacking violations, Lavrov said such moves are made without the involvement of global bodies under the UN. He accused Western powers of presenting their positions and initiatives to the world as the “only correct ones”, saying Russia is convinced it is better to work within global organisations despite existing differences. The West is also trying to restore the unipolar world order but poles such as “Russia and China are unlikely to be subordinate to it”. Lavrov said, “However, India is currently an object of the Western countries’ persistent, aggressive and devious policy as they are trying to engage it in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called ‘Quad’ while at the same time, the West is attempting to undermine our close partnership and privileged relations with India.” The “very tough pressure” from the US on India in relation to military-technical cooperation with Russia is part of the efforts to undermine the partnership, he said, without giving details. Lavrov was apparently pointing to the US threat of imposing sanctions on India under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Lavrov’s remarks. In the past, India has said that its relations with Russia are time-tested and unaffected by developments in ties with other partners such as the US. Lavrov also said the US-led West had rejected trends towards the formation of a multi-polar world, sidelined Russia and China and is “trying to draw all others into a unipolar world by any means possible”. Russia, he said, will promote a unifying agenda and the G20 is the “only mechanism outside the UN Security Council where it is still possible to come to terms based on a balance of interests”. This is because the G20 represents the G7 and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and other states that share the philosophy of Brics such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Argentina, Indonesia and Egypt, he said. Russia has attempted several times in recent months to push India and China towards a negotiated settlement of the border standoff. In September, Russia hosted in-person meetings of the foreign and defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that facilitated meetings of the Indian and Chinese ministers. Though external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed on a road map for disengagement at that meeting, the two sides haven’t been able to move forward with de-escalation efforts on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-has-policy-to-engage-india-in-anti-china-games-says-russian-foreign-minister-lavrov/story-WbNfR30MEFMeBd3LDibekJ.html
09-12-2020||World||Trump set record sanctions use that Biden is likely to maintain||The Trump administration has imposed sanctions at a record-shattering pace of about three times a day during the president’s time in office: a slew of measures targeting companies, individuals and even oil tankers tied to Iran, North Korea, China, Venezuela and Russia.President-elect Joe Biden’s team is promising a top-to-bottom review of sanctions operations, but don’t expect a significant slowdown on his watch.About seven weeks before the inauguration, Biden’s picks for top administration slots are making clear that economic restrictions on countries will remain an essential tool, even if they don’t like everything about the way Trump used them.Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo, chosen by Biden to be the No. 2 official at Treasury, plans to review how the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence unit, or TFI, at Treasury operates, people familiar with the matter said. That includes an evaluation of current programs, staffing and budgets, according to the people.Yet the conviction that sanctions remain crucial underscores just how central they have become to the way the US conducts foreign policy, using its economic might as much as its military power to get what it wants abroad, even when close allies disagree. And as much as Biden wants to distance himself from Trump’s policies, experts and observers say he is likely to keep up Trump’s aggressive approach.In their determination to push through an “America First” approach to geopolitical crises, Trump’s team innovated new forms of economic coercion, melding run-of-the-mill sanctions designations with tariffs, export controls and secondary sanctions to punish friends and enemies alike.“They’ve used these tools, tariffs, export controls as a one-two-three punch going after folks like China and others,” said Adam Smith, a former senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s sanctions unit and now a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.Trump went after NATO ally Turkey over its detention of an American pastor and threatened to punish Germany for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.Ignoring the warning that China’s economy was too big, and too closely intertwined with America’s, Trump repeatedly sanctioned Chinese officials and firms, including 14 top legislators on Dec. 7. He blew past warnings that unilateral sanctions against Iran would be ineffective, crippling that country’s economy, without the help of European partners.“We had never seen an administration so creatively use these diverse tools in a seemingly coordinated way,” Smith said.Under Trump, the administration took more than 3,900 distinct sanctions actions, according to data collected by Gibson Dunn, with a surge in 2018, when the administration reintroduced many Iran penalties after it pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal backed by allies including the UK, France and Germany. No previous administration had exceeded 700 sanctions actions a year.Biden’s team, wary of showing its cards before taking office, has been vague about which of Trump’s sanctions it will keep or lift, though the president-elect called for returning to the Iran nuclear deal, which would require easing sanctions in some fashion. In a CNN article in September, however, Biden said his administration would “continue the use of targeted sanctions against Iran’s human rights abuses, its support for terrorism and ballistic missile program.”“We must also remain laser-focused on the Treasury Department’s critical role protecting our national security,” Adeyemo said when his nomination was announced Dec. 1. “This includes using our sanctions regime to hold bad actors accountable.”One challenge Biden will face is that US sanctions have now become so sprawling and complicated that they’re more difficult to enforce or manage without risking serious blowback on the American economy.“What you’re seeing is multiple major economies targeted with sanctions,” said Justine Walker, head of global sanctions and risk at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists. “The industry exposure is so much greater, and I think that’s where there’s a potential concern.”Critics argue that the Trump administration has wielded sanctions too bluntly and indiscriminately, using them as a catch-all for any and every foreign policy problem.In addition, Treasury’s sanctions unit has been depleted of key staff, starting at the top. The unit has had no undersecretary since Sigal Mandelker stepped down in October 2019.A number of civil servants have also left the unit during Trump’s tenure, even as the use of the economic measures have increased in sheer volume and sophistication. Adeyemo plans to address staffing issues and consider increasing the unit’s budget, the people said, assuming he’s confirmed by the Senate.Broadly, the incoming Biden team argues that if it uses sanctions, it will do so in concert with others, not against them. Two countries of focus will be Russia, where the new administration may target oligarchs allied with President Vladimir Putin, and China, where the US under Trump has imposed sanctions on its own rather than working with other nations with similar interests.“What I do expect to see is an overarching strategy that does look more toward multilateral alliances and partnerships,” Adam Szubin, a former acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said at a National Security Institute conference on Dec 1. “Wherever possible, you’ll see an effort to stand on a united front and call China on its behavior where that’s necessary.”The US approach under Trump was more hostile, with the argument being that companies would fall into line whether they liked it or not because access to the US financial system was too precious to them. Complaints that the overuse of financial sanctions would undermine the dollar’s primacy were quickly dismissed.As Biden prepares to take office, there’s no bigger sanctions target than Iran. According to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, the US targeted 1,500 people and entities in Iran in 77 separate rounds of sanctions, accounting for almost half of the administration’s sanctions actions.“We have deprived the regime, according to their own words, of some $70 billion for terror,” Pompeo said at a conference last week. “We know our campaign is working because now the Iranians are desperately signaling their willingness to return to the negotiating table to get sanctions relief.”Sanctions experts argue that while the Trump administration’s sanctions were often effective, there were times when they seemed to serve as public relations more than sound economic policy, something they say they don’t expect to see from Biden’s administration.“I don’t think they will be scaling back on sanctions, they will be scaling back on the misuse of sanctions,” said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador, assistant secretary and State Department sanctions coordinator under Democratic and Republican administrations. “Scaling back on use of sanctions as a purely messaging tool or a media-cycle management device -- sanctions because you want to look like you’re being tough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-set-record-sanctions-use-that-biden-is-likely-to-maintain/story-WsKlzp66IwLzM9qxLC0esN.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden vows 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in first 100 days||President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday laid out his plan to fight the coronavirus pandemic during his first 100 days in office, saying his administration would vaccinate 100 million Americans, push to reopen schools and strengthen mask mandates.Biden, who formally introduced his public health team on Tuesday, also announced he would nominate retired Army General Lloyd Austin as the country’s first Black defense secretary.He also picked US Representative Marcia Fudge of Ohio to lead the Housing and Urban Development Department, and Tom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary, to fill the same role again, according to news reports on Tuesday. At a briefing in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said he needed Congress to fully fund delivering vaccines to all corners of the United States. Getting children back to school will be a national priority in the first 100 days, Biden said.Also Read | US Supreme Court rejects Pennsylvania Republicans’ attempt to block Biden victory“In 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,” said Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. “Whatever your politics or point of view, mask up for 100 days.”Biden’s first few months will likely be dominated by the pandemic, which is straining hospitals amid a nationwide resurgence.The coronavirus has killed more than 283,000 Americans and caused millions to lose their jobs.Effective vaccines would help the Biden administration turn its focus to healing the ailing US economy. The US Food and Drug Administration released documents on Tuesday raising no new issues about the safety or efficacy of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, which could receive emergency authorization this month. Biden introduced California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Latino former congressman, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services. Becerra has a long record of supporting the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.PUSHBACK ON PENTAGON PICKBiden picked Austin as defense secretary nominee, despite pushback from some Democrats in Congress unhappy with the idea of a former military man running the Pentagon.“The fact is, Austin’s many strengths and his intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and our government are uniquely matched to the challenges and crises we face,” Biden wrote in The Atlantic magazine. “He is the person we need in this moment.”The confirmation of Austin, 67, who oversaw US forces in the Middle East under former President Barack Obama, would require Congress to approve a waiver because he has been out of the military fewer than the seven years mandated by a law designed to ensure civilian oversight of the armed forces.Outgoing President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary, former Marine General Jim Mattis, also needed a waiver.At least two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal and Jon Tester, expressed opposition to waiving the law, casting doubt on whether Austin’s nomination will pass a closely divided Senate.Fudge will be Biden’s housing and urban development secretary, Politico and Bloomberg News reported, citing unnamed sources. If confirmed, Fudge would face a housing crisis stemming from the pandemic, which has seen millions of people miss rent and mortgage payments because of business shutdowns.Biden has asked Vilsack, who was agriculture secretary during the Obama administration, to return to the position, Axios reported. Vilsack campaigned for Biden in Iowa, where he was governor for two terms, and served as an agricultural policy adviser.The transition team did not immediately comment on the Fudge and Vilsack reports. Earlier on Tuesday, Fudge told reporters she would be honored, but did not confirm she would be nominated.Also Read |  Iran says US sanctions preventing purchases of Covid vaccinesCIVIL RIGHTSThe nominations of Austin and Fudge, who is also Black, add to Biden’s effort to assemble a Cabinet and administration that reflect the country’s diversity. Earlier on Tuesday, Biden met for nearly two hours with leaders of seven leading civil rights organizations who have pressed Biden to select more people of color as his top advisers. Biden won the White House in large part because of support from the nation’s Black community, and the president-elect has made addressing civil rights one of the main pillars of his administration, promising to expand support for Black-owned businesses and reform the justice system. The Rev. Al Sharpton, head of the National Action Network, said he again told Biden to nominate a Black attorney general. “The least we could have is someone with a proven civil rights background,” Sharpton said.Trump has refused to concede his Nov. 3 election defeat, citing unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, Texas filed a lawsuit asking the US Supreme Court to throw out the results in four other states in a long-shot bid to reverse the election’s outcome.The Trump campaign and allies have filed numerous lawsuits challenging vote counts in multiple states, with little success. State officials have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-100-million-covid-19-vaccinations-in-first-100-days/story-oaSgR4JELKQncxCEKVlR8O.html
09-12-2020||World||Iraqis slowly rebuild Mosul, with little aid from government||Anan Yasoun rebuilt her home with yellow cement slabs amid the rubble of Mosul, a brightly colored manifestation of resilience in a city that for many remains synonymous with the Islamic State group’s reign of terror.In the three years since Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, liberated Mosul from the militants, Yasoun painstakingly saved money that her husband earned from carting vegetables in the city. They had just enough to restore the walls of their destroyed home; money for the floors was a gift from her dying father, the roof a loan that is still outstanding.Yasoun didn’t even mind the bright yellow exterior — paint donated by a relative. “I just wanted a house,” said the 40-year-old mother of two.The mounds of debris around her bear witness to the violence Iraq’s second-largest city has endured. From Mosul, IS had proclaimed its caliphate in 2014. Three years later, Iraqi forces backed by a US-led coalition liberated the city in a gruelling battle that killed thousands and left Mosul in ruins.Such resilience is apparent elsewhere in the city, at a time when Baghdad’s cash-strapped government fails to fund reconstruction efforts and IS is becoming more active across the disputed territories of northern Iraq.Life is slowly coming back to Mosul these days: merchants are busy in their shops, local musicians again serenade small, enthralled crowds. At night, the city lights gleam as restaurant patrons spill out onto the streets.The UN has estimated that over 8,000 Mosul homes were destroyed in intense airstrikes to root out IS. The nine-month operation left at least 9,000 dead, according to an AP investigation.Memories of the group’s brutality still haunt locals, who remember a time when the city squares were used for the public beheading of those who dared violate the militants’ rules.The Old City on the west bank of the Tigris River, once the jewel of Mosul, remains in ruins even as newer parts of the city have seen a cautious recovery. The revival, the residents say, is mostly their own doing.“I didn’t see a single dollar from the government,” said Ahmed Sarhan, who runs a family coffee business.Antique coffee pots, called dallahs, line the entrance to his shop, which has been trading coffee for 120 years. An aging mortar and pestle, used by Sarhan’s forefathers to grind beans, sits in his office as evidence of his family’s storied past.“After the liberation, it was complete chaos. No one had any money. The economy was zero,” he said. His business raked in a measly 50,000 Iraqi dinars a day, or around $40. Now, he makes closer to about $2,500.But even as Sarhan and other merchants are starting to see profits — despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic — ordinary labourers are struggling. Sarhan employs 28 workers, each getting about $8 a day.“It is nothing ... they will never be able to rebuild their homes,” he says.Since the ouster of IS in 2017, the task of rebuilding Mosul has been painfully slow. Delays have been caused by lack of coherent governance at the provincial level; the governor of Nineveh province, which includes Mosul, has been replaced three times since liberation.With no central authority to coordinate, a tangled web of entities overseeing reconstruction work — from the local, provincial and federal government to international organizations and aid groups — has added to the chaos.The government has made progress on larger infrastructure projects and restored basic services to the city, but much remains unfinished.Funds earmarked for reconstruction by the World Bank were diverted to help the federal government fight the coronavirus as state coffers dwindled with plunging oil prices. Meanwhile, at least 16,000 Mosul residents appealed for government cash assistance to rebuild their homes.Only 2,000 received financial assistance, said Zuhair al-Araji, the mayor of Mosul district.“There’s no money,” he said. “They have to rebuild on their own.”Mosul residents eye government policies with suspicion and suspect local officials are too corrupt to help them.“Whatever funds are provided, they will steal it,” said Ammar Mouwfaq, who spent all his savings to re-open his soap shop in the city last year.A photo of his father hangs inside the shop, which he took over in the 1970s. Neat stacks of the region’s famous olive oil soap, imported from the Syrian city of Aleppo, tower above him.“What you see now, I did alone,” he added.On one thoroughfare the ruins of cinemas bombed by IS — the militant group’s strict interpretation of Islam banned such forms of entertainment — are a stark contrast to the shops and restaurants abuzz with customers.The Old City, with its labyrinth of narrow streets dating back to the Middle Ages, now serves as an eerie museum of IS horrors. Misshapen iron rods jut out of what’s left of houses they were designed to fortify. Smashed pieces of alabaster stone and masonry, once extolled by historians for architectural significance, lie among the debris. Signs of a former life — a pair of women’s shoes, a notebook covered in hearts, shells from exploded ammunition — are untouched.“Demolition is forbidden” reads a graffiti written on a slab of wall surrounded by rubble, a testament to Mosul’s unwavering dark humor.The Mosul Museum, where IS militants filmed themselves smashing priceless antiquities to dust, partially re-opened in January. But apart from occasional contemporary art exhibits such as that of Iraqi sculptor Omer Qais last month, there is nothing to see.On the other side of town, Sarhan, the coffee trader, invites anyone who cares to see his collection of antique swords, plates and bowls he painstakingly hunted down. In the 12th century, Mosul was an important hub for trade; a century later, its intricate metalwork rose to prominence.“This is our history,” said Sarhan, holding up a rusting bronze plate, engraved with 1202, the year it was made.“If I don’t protect it, who will?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqis-slowly-rebuild-mosul-with-little-aid-from-government/story-SLXPzL63BcCDNnalRmCR1K.html
09-12-2020||World||Google and Facebook risk big fines under draft Australian news law||Google and Facebook would risk multimillion-dollar fines if they failed to comply with proposed legislation introduced into the Australian Parliament on Wednesday that would make the tech giants pay for journalism they display.Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg introduced the so-called News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code and revealed details of his plan for Australia to become the first country to force the digital platforms to compensate news media for journalistic content.“We are not seeking to protect traditional media companies from the rigor of competition or technological disruption, which we know benefits consumers,” Frydenberg told Parliament. “Rather, we are seeking to create a level playing field where market power is not misused and there is appropriate compensation for the production of original news content.”Details of the draft legislation will be scrutinized by a Senate committee before lawmakers vote on it next year.Breaches of the code, such as failure to negotiate in good faith, would be punishable by a fine of 10 million Australian dollars ($7.4 million) or the equivalent of 10% of annual turnover in Australia.Also Read | UK to launch new watchdog next year to police tech giantsIf a platform and a news business cannot agree on a price for news after three months of negotiations, a three-member arbitration panel would be appointed to make a binding decision for payment over at least two years.The panel would usually then accept in full either the platform or the news business’s final offer.In “very limited circumstances” when neither option is in the ”public interest,” the panel “may amend the more reasonable of the two offers,” government documents say.The bill does not specify how payment would be made. The platform and the media business could agree on a lump sum or regular payments based on the amount of news content used.Facebook and Google have said they would read details of the draft legislation before commenting.Facebook has previously warned it might block Australian news content rather than pay for it.Google has previously said the proposed laws would result in “dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube,” put free services at risk and could lead to users’ data “being handed over to big news businesses.”The government is concerned that Google was taking 53% of online advertising dollars while Facebook took a 28% share without paying for the news that the platforms share with their users.Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australia, one of the nation’s largest media organizations, welcomed the legislation on Tuesday as a significant step toward fairness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-and-facebook-risk-big-fines-under-draft-australian-news-law/story-EgsX9U2xCCqC7gYYEfx8jM.html
09-12-2020||World||IIT-Guwahati researchers develop technology to harvest water from air||Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati claimed to have developed a new technology to harvest water from the air by using the concept of hydrophobicity.A team, led by Uttam Manna, Associate Professor of Chemistry, along with his research scholars Kousik Maji, Avijit Das and Manideepa Dhar, published the results of the “path-breaking” work in the journal of Royal Society of Chemistry, IIT-Guwahati said in a release.“Such water-harvesting techniques use the concept of hydrophobicity or water-repelling nature of some materials.The concept of hydrophobicity can be understood by looking at the lotus leaf,” Manna said.The research team from IIT-Guwahati has used the concept of chemically patterned SLIPS for the first time, to effectively harvest water from moist air, he added.“A patterned hydrophilic SLIP was produced by spraying a sponge-like porous polymeric material on top of a simple A4 printer paper. Further, chemically modulated hydrophilic spots were associated on the coating, prior to lubricating with two distinct types of oils.“This surface could harvest water from foggy/water vapour laden air without the need for any cooling arrangement,” the release said.With increasing water scarcity throughout the world, there have been attempts to collect and conserve water through non-traditional means and the IIT-Guwahati scientists have turned to nature to design ways of water harvesting, it said.“We have produced a highly efficient water harvesting interface. The researchers have also compared the performance of their pitcher-plant inspired SLIPS materials to other bio- inspired ideas and have found theirs to be superior in terms of efficiency of water harvesting,” Manna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iit-guwahati-researchers-develop-technology-to-harvest-water-from-air/story-uyDdakna9kSYAZeRsHBs9O.html

The party was dissolved hours after Beijing passed a contentious national security law for the city on June 30 amid fears it could be targeted under the legislation.Chow was also arrested in August under the new security legislation on suspicion of “colluding with foreign forces,” but is yet to face any charges.Under the national security law, Beijing punishes what it broadly defines as sedition, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-agnes-chow-denied-bail-after-landmark-sentencing/story-QJscu9SlBv2kK5EqrKR3iO.html

Brownback made the remarks during a briefing on Tuesday on the designation by the US of China, Pakistan and eight other states as countries of particular concern for systematic violations of religious freedom. He was responding to a question regarding the US Commission for International Religious Freedom’s recommendation for India to be also designated in a similar manner. “There were several recommendations made by the commission that [secretary of state Mike Pompeo] did not follow, and this was one of them. And we watch the situation in India very closely. The secretary has travelled there multiple times. These issues have been raised in private discussions at the government – high government level, and they will continue to get raised,” he said. Also read | How a suspected Chinese spy targeted California politicians for 5 yearsPompeo is “well aware of a lot of the communal violence that’s happening in India” and he is also aware of the Citizen (Amendment) Act and “issues associated with the Modi government”, Brownback said. “And as I said, he has raised it at the highest levels, but just decided at this point in time not to place them on a CPC [country of particular concern] or a special watch list,” he added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Brownback’s comments. In the past, India has dismissed criticism of such matters by the US administration and American bodies as interference in the country’s internal matters. Brownback also sought to make a distinction between the situation related to religious freedoms in India and Pakistan, saying the US had extensively reviewed the situation in both countries. “Pakistan – a lot of their actions are done by the government. In India, some of them are done by the government and the law that was passed, and much of it’s communal violence. And then, when that takes place, we try to determine whether or not has there been effective...police enforcement, judicial action after communal violence takes place,” he said. He pointed out that Pakistan accounts for half of the people in prison around the world for apostasy or blasphemy, and problems such as “forced brides” or women from Pakistan’s Christian and Hindu minorities being “marketed as concubines” in China. Besides, there is also discrimination against Pakistan’s religious minorities that makes them more vulnerable, he said. “And that doesn’t mean that India doesn’t have problems. The statute...that was asked about earlier is a problem. The violence is a problem. We’ll continue to raise those issues, but those are some of the basis as to why Pakistan continues to be on the CPC list and India is not,” Brownback said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-privately-raised-issues-with-india-says-ambassador-for-religious-freedom-sam-brownback/story-urrj4dOJas8DpPMfeit97J.html
09-12-2020||World||Supreme Court dismisses GOP lawsuit; Biden names Austin as defence secretary||US Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s Republican allies from Pennsylvania seeking to overturn the election outcome in the state, even as President-elect Joe Biden announced retired Gen Lloyd Austin as his nominee for secretary of defence.Austin will become the first Black person to lead the Pentagon if he is confirmed by Senate. Announcing the nomination, Biden said Austin had shown “exemplary leadership, character, and command”.He also spoke about having worked with the general as vice-president in the Obama administration.Biden also presented his health team to lead his administration’s fight against Covid-19 and announced a three-step drive for his first 100 days in office — to urge everyone to wear masks, ensure the widest distribution of vaccines and safe and secure reopening of schools.Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden suffered a severe blow with the nine justices of the Supreme Court, including the three nominated by him, dismissing the lawsuit with a terse one-line order: “The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice (Samuel) Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied.” This was the first case seeking to the dispute the 2020 White House race to reach the highest court of the nation.Biden’s team had no direct response to the order. But Ron Klain, his chief of staff, retweeted a post that summed up the situation succinctly: “Biden won again today so that’s kinda great.”Trump might have hoped for a somewhat different outcome. “Now, let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court, or a number of justices of the Supreme Court — let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right,” he had said at a White House event just ahead of the court’s order.Trump’s Republican allies in Texas have also filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking it to declare the election results Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia to be declared “unlawful”. The court has asked the four battleground states that the president lost to respond by Thursday.The president is still in no mood to give up yet, but his legal challenges have been futile, as are his political attempts to get state legislatures and Republican legislators to overturn the results. Democrats keeping a count said the president and his allies’ scorecard is one legal victory to 50 defeats. And now Rudolph Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, his lawyers spearheading those legal challenges and the political machinations, have both tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-dismisses-gop-lawsuit-biden-names-austin-as-defence-secretary/story-YPPzx52xVudCdJ7steUtKK.html

He also opposes language in the bill that would possibly slow down troop reductions.The bill also includes language that would sanctions companies help facilitate the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and Turkey over the acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defence system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-advised-to-veto-national-defense-authorization-act/story-yU7VMYbtprVhRQNsVSEeFK.html
09-12-2020||World||US Supreme Court rejects Pennsylvania Republicans’ attempt to block Biden victory||As another blow to the legal effort by incumbent United States President Donald Trump and allies to overturn the election, the US Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Pennsylvania Republicans to nullify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the state.According to The Hill, the Tuesday order, which was unsigned and included no noted dissents, came ahead of the midnight “safe harbour” deadline, which provides states with a kind of immunity from congressional oversight into the election results that are certified in time.It further reported that the justices’ move leaves intact Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf’s certification of Biden’s victory by a margin of more than 81,000 votes.The verdict also represents a “lengthy string” of defeats for Trump’s legal campaign, claiming widespread voter fraud. The incumbent President, in his Tweets, continuously called the election a fraud and claimed that he “won the election, by a lot”.The American daily further reported that one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court petition was Republican Representative Mike Kelly.The challengers’ original complaint was filed in the state court last month that sought to strike down “an expanded” mail-in ballot policy that Pennsylvania put in place in 2019 after it was passed by the state’s GOP (Grand Old Party, or the Republican Party)-led legislature.According to an analysis of the Pennsylvania Department of State data by The Philadelphia Inquirer, the former US Vice-President won three out of four mail-in ballots cast in the state.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected the case late last month, citing the litigants’ undue delay in bringing the challenge, prompting the petition to the US Supreme Court. The attorneys argued that the top state court had violated their due process rights and other constitutional guarantees.“No court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor’s certification of presidential election results,” they argued in a brief as quoted by The Hill. “The loss of public trust in our constitutional order resulting in this kind of judicial power would be incalculable.”The court’s denial came just hours after Trump expressed hope that the Supreme Court would embrace his claims of having won the election.“Let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court,” Trump said during a coronavirus vaccine summit.He added, “Let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right.”Biden is being projected as the winner of the Presidential elections in the US after he clinched the state of Pennsylvania to take him past the required 270 Electoral College-vote mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-rejects-pennsylvania-republicans-attempt-to-block-biden-victory/story-6eWX1R4GY0SkXSVFoGDuFN.html

Banks were unwilling to process transactions and convert the won into dollars, he said on Instagram.In a statement, a spokesperson for Gavi said there was no “legal barrier” to Iran procuring vaccines through COVAX as the US Treasury’s Office on Foreign Assets Control had issued a license covering coronavirus vaccine procurement.A Million CasesBut an Iranian government official said the OFAC license had little effect. The money would have to be cleared through a US bank in order to be converted into dollars and then into euros before being transferred to COVAX, said the official, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak on the matter.South Korea has told Iran that it can’t provide an assurance the money won’t be seized or blocked when it’s transferred to a US bank, the official said.Gavi didn’t respond to an email requesting further details or an interview about Iran’s access to the facility. US sanctions are meant to exclude purchases of food and medicines.So far, more than a million Iranians have contracted Covid-19 and more than 50,000 have died. Officials say the numbers significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak.The Trump administration reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iran from 2018 as it sought to force the country into a tougher agreement on its nuclear program and downgrade its presence in the Middle East. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to re-engage with the Islamic Republic, triggering optimism in Tehran that sanctions could be removed.Iran is preparing to start human trials of its own vaccine, which has been renamed after a top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, assassinated late last month, but at the earliest it will only be available next summer.Earlier Tuesday, the semi-official Mehr news agency removed a report from its website that said Iran’s Health Ministry was in talks with AstraZeneca Plc to secure 20 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine it’s developing with Oxford University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-us-sanctions-preventing-purchases-of-covid-vaccines/story-KgJW166V8XkteQI6xw8QtL.html
09-12-2020||World||Minneapolis eyes deep police cuts after Geroge Floyd’s death||Minneapolis City Council members who tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the police department in response to George Floyd’s death are voting Wednesday on whether to shrink it, a move that could imperil the entire city budget because the mayor is threatening to use his veto to protect public safety amid soaring crime rates.The plan, which supporters call “Safety for All,” is the latest version of the “defund the police” movement that Minneapolis and other cities have considered since Floyd’s May 25 death ignited mass demonstrations against police brutality and a nationwide reckoning with racism.Eleven of the 13 council members have already cast committee votes in favor of the largest parts of the plan, signaling that passage is likely. It would cut nearly $8 million from Mayor Jacob Frey’s $179 million policing budget and redirect it to mental health teams, violence prevention programs and other initiatives.“I am actively considering a veto due to the massive, permanent cut to officer capacity,” Frey said in a statement Monday night. Reducing the authorized size of the force by 138 officers before enacting alternatives is ”irresponsible,” he said.Cities around the US, including Los Angeles, New York City and Portland, Oregon, are shifting funds from police departments to social services programs in an effort to provide new solutions for problems traditionally handled by police. Such cuts have led some departments to lay off officers, cancel recruiting classes or retreat from hiring goals.In Minneapolis, violent crime rates have surged since the death of Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed and pleading for air for several minutes while Derek Chauvin, a white former officer, pressed his knee against his neck. Chauvin and three others were charged in Floyd’s death and are expected to stand trial in March.Police have recorded 532 gunshot victims this year as of last Thursday, more than double the same period a year ago. Carjackings have also spiked to 375 so far this year, up 331% from the same period last year. Violent crimes have topped 5,100, compared with just over 4,000 for the same period in 2019.“This summer happened because George Floyd was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department and it wasn’t an accident, it’s because the system of policing we know now is not just racist, but it doesn’t create safety for all,” said Oluchi Omeoga, a cofounder of Black Visions, which supports “Safety for All” as a step toward more transformational change.Due to austerity forced by the coronavirus pandemic, the mayor’s proposal already bakes in a $14 million cut to the department compared with its original 2020 budget, mostly through attrition. Frey aims to hold the number of sworn officers around 770 through 2021 with hopes of eventually increasing the force to 888. “Safety for All” would cap the number at 750 by 2022. The department is already down by about 120 — partly due to officers claiming post-traumatic stress disorder from a summer of unrest — with more preparing to leave amid retirements and poor morale.Passions ran hot on both sides as more than 400 citizens signed up to speak during a marathon hearing last week that ran into the early hours Thursday, with many expressing alarm that the council was even contemplating cuts.“I think we need to make bold decisions on a path forward,” said Council Member Steve Fletcher, a coauthor of the proposal. While acknowledging that it would mean fewer officers, he defended the plan by saying it would reduce the department’s workload by shifting 911 calls away from armed officers to other specialists such as mental health professionals.“Combined those investments add up to a safer city for everybody and an approach that creates a more sustainable public safety system for our city,” Fletcher said in an interview.On the other side are those like Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo who say there’s no need for an either-or decision — that it’s possible to reform policing without cutting officers. The mayor and 12 of the 13 council members are Democrats; one council member is from the Green Party.If the council approves the plan Wednesday night, Frey would have five days to veto if he chooses. The council could override him with a two-thirds majority, or nine council members.A proposal over the summer to dismantle the department and replace it with a “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention” initially had support from a majority of the council but faltered when a separate city commission voted against putting it on the November ballot. The city was paying $4,500 a day at one point for private security for three council members who reported getting threats after supporting defunding.Bill Rodriguez of Minneapolis, part of a community group called Safety Now Minneapolis that formed recently in response to rising crime, said his group supports police reform by funding many of the programs the council wants to fund: expanding violence prevention programs, programs aimed at intervening safely with people suffering mental health issues and finding ways to respond to some 911 incidents without police officers.But he said cutting police officers is a bad idea and was sharply critical of council members who he said “can’t get beyond” their vow this summer to abolish or defund police.“They are hell-bent on their agenda,” Rodriguez said. “Everything they do has that taste on it. ... They’re still making this up as they go along. We’ve got a City Council being run by a bunch of inexperienced activists who have never run anything in their lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-eyes-deep-police-cuts-after-geroge-floyd-s-death/story-IjxFHSSDo3tohhSG5qrU5I.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s attorney general search is focused on Jones, Garland||Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland are emerging as the leading contenders to be nominated as President-elect Joe Biden’s attorney general, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.A decision hasn’t been finalized and the dynamics could shift in the coming days as Biden builds out his Cabinet with an eye to ensuring diverse leadership in the top ranks of his administration.But Jones, who lost reelection last month, and Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination was snubbed by Republicans, appear increasingly well positioned ahead of other rivals. Democrats are particularly concerned about the prospect of Biden nominating former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, fearing she could face a difficult confirmation in the Senate because of her role in issues related to the Russia investigation.Biden’s thinking was described by people with knowledge of the presidential transition’s internal thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly. Andrew Bates, a representative for the transition, did not comment for this story.The president-elect is facing pressure to ensure that Black and Latino leaders are prominently positioned in his administration. He selected retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin this week to become the first Black secretary of defense.Also Read |  ‘Highest stock markets, best employment’: Trump hopeful of continuing as US prezJones, who is white, has had a long-standing personal relationship with Biden dating back to Biden’s first presidential campaign in 1988. The former US attorney prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who were responsible for a 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and later served as the US attorney there from 1997 until 2001.Biden met with civil rights activists on Tuesday to discuss diversity in his Cabinet. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended the meeting, encouraged Biden to select a Black attorney general but gave him room to select someone of another race as long as they had a background in civil rights.“I said the least we could have is someone that has a proven civil rights background that’s someone that’s going to handle this heightened racist bigoted atmosphere,” Sharpton told reporters.It’s unclear whether Garland would fit that standard as easily. He is an experienced judge with a reputation for moderation who held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Garland was put forward by President Barack Obama for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to hold hearings in the final year of Obama’s term. The vacancy was later filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch during the Trump administration.The incoming attorney general would inherit a Justice Department that has endured a tumultuous four years and would likely need to focus on not only civil rights issues and an overhaul of national policing policies after months of mass protests over the deaths of Black Americans at the hand of law enforcement, but also on concerns from Democrats about politicization of the department in the Trump administration.Biden has said he will not be involved in Justice Department investigative decisions even as some Democrats have openly wished for probes into President Donald Trump and his associates after he leaves office.Supporters of Yates view her nearly 30-year Justice Department career in both Democratic and Republican administrations, and experience ranging from civil rights cases to national security matters, as making her uniquely qualified to lead the department as it looks to move on from the Trump era.Still, Republican senators would be likely to focus a Yates confirmation hearing on her final year at the department, when the FBI closed out the Hillary Clinton email investigation and opened an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia, which later morphed into special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Yates has repeatedly discussed both, including before the Senate committee that has oversight of the confirmation process. She has made clear that she disagreed with the way the FBI conducted some of the most heavily scrutinized actions of both investigations, including the decision to hold a press conference about the Clinton probe and then to alert Congress days before the election that it had been reopened.Also Read |  Joe Biden taps General Lloyd Austin as first black Pentagon chiefEven so, Republicans would nonetheless press Yates on problems with the Russia probe that were revealed by a Justice Department inspector general investigation, including errors and omissions in applications to surveil a former Trump campaign aide, and about how she would handle a special counsel inquiry focused on the FBI’s actions in that case.Yates has said that she would not have signed off on the surveillance had she known of the problems in the applications. But the appointment of John Durham as a special counsel to review the Russia probe suggests the inquiry is likely to endure into the Biden administration, creating a backward-looking focus for a new attorney general just as Yates would try to turn the page from the issue.Jones would not comment Tuesday on the possibility of a nomination as attorney general.“They have a process and we’ll let that process play,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.The Biden team has also been considering a number of other potential candidates for the post, including former Justice Department official Lisa Monaco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-attorney-general-search-is-focused-on-jones-garland/story-SJLAWKY7pAV4Y4NedK86FP.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden vows 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in first 100 days of administration||US President-elect Joe Biden has said that in the first 100 days of his administration, he would mandate everyone to wear a mask, ensure 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations and reopen the majority of schools as he assured Americans that his “crisis-tested” team of experts will deliver better healthcare and revive the economy. The US is in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has infected almost 15 million Americans and killed 286,000. Globally, there are 68.2 million Covid-19 cases and the pandemic has claimed more than 1.5 million lives. Announcing his national health team, Biden asked the Trump administration to act now to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the US population and the world. “This can be fixed. If it does, my team will be able to get at least 100 million vaccinations done in my first 100 days. Third, it should be a national priority to get our kids back into school and keep them in school,” he said on Tuesday. “If Congress provides the funding we need to protect students, educators, and staff, and if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow, then my team will work to see that the majority of our schools can be opened by the end of my first 100 days. That’s right, we will look to have most of the schools open in 100 days if Congress provides the funding we need,” he added. He said masking, vaccinations and reopening school were three key goals for his first 100 days. “But we will still have much to do in the year ahead. And sadly, much difficulty, too. We will be far, far from done. Yet, it is possible that after 100 days, we will be much further along in the fight against the pandemic,” Biden said. Biden named Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Indian-American Dr Vivek Murthy as his Surgeon General. He named Dr Anthony Fauci as Chief Medical Adviser to the President on Covid-19, while Dr Rochelle Walensky has been named as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith as Covid-19 Equity Task Force Chair. “It’s a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields. Crisis-tested. Defined by a deep sense of duty, honour, and patriotism. They are ready on Day One to spare no effort and get the pandemic under control, so we can get back to work, back to our lives, and back to our loved ones,” he said. “They will lead the COVID-19 response across our government to accelerate testing, fix our supply chain, and distribute the vaccine. They will work with my economic team — because controlling the pandemic, delivering better health care, and reviving the economy go hand in hand. They will work with my foreign policy and national security team — because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere,” Biden said. Biden announced that in consultation with Dr Fauci, his team has developed the first three objectives and new initiatives that he is asking them to complete during his first 100 days in office. “My first 100 days won’t end COVID-19. I cannot promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly, and it’s going to take time to fix. But I am convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,” he said. “First, my-100 day masking plan. It starts with my signing an order on Day One to require masks where I can — like federal buildings and interstate travel on planes, trains, and buses,” he said. “Second, this team will help get at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in 100 days. We will follow the guidance of scientists and get vaccines to those most at-risk. That includes health care personnel and people in long-term care; and, as soon as possible, that will include educators,” he said. Biden said it will be the most efficient mass vaccination plan in US history. “I credit everyone who has gotten us to this point, but developing the vaccine is one herculean task. Distributing it is another. And vaccines in a vial only work if they are injected into the arms of people, especially those most at risk,” said the president-elect. “We are going to require masks wherever possible, but this goes beyond government action. And so, as a new President, I’m going to speak directly to the American people. We need your help. Wear a mask for 100 days,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-100-million-covid-19-vaccinations-in-first-100-days-of-administration/story-WfLddH3ZYUxxIdO62dZtFN.html

She added that the North has been unresponsive to South Korea’s offer for cooperation to jointly tackle the pandemic.The North Korean leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, responded in a statement carried by state media.“It can be seen from the reckless remarks made by her without any consideration of the consequences that she is too eager to further chill the frozen relations between North and South Korea,” she said.“Her real intention is very clear. We will never forget her words and she might have to pay dearly for it,” Kim said.The remarks show how sensitive North Korea is to what it considers any outside attempt to tarnish its image as its guards against the pandemic and the economic fallout.Despite its zero-virus case claim, North Korea’s state media have repeatedly said there is a “maximum emergency” anti-epidemic campaign in which it has closed its international borders, flown out diplomats and isolated residents with suspected symptoms.The North’s border closure with China, it’s biggest trading partner, is wrecking its already fragile economy. The North has admitted it’s facing “multiple crises” due to the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent US-led sanctions imposed over its nuclear programme.Experts have said a major disease outbreak in North Korea could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its fragile health care system.South Korea’s foreign minister told a forum in Bahrain on Saturday that the pandemic had “made North Korea more North Korea — that is, more closed, very top-down decision-making process where there is very little debate on their measures in dealing with COVID-19”.“They still say they do not have any cases, which is hard to believe,” Kang said. “So, all signs are the regime is very intensely focused on controlling the disease that they say they do not have.” Also this week, US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is in Seoul for talks on North Korea and other issues.South Korea’s spy agency recently told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un had ordered diplomats overseas to refrain from any acts that could provoke Washington because it is worried about President-elect Joe Biden’s expected new approach toward North Korea.Some observers say North Korea could still do something provocative to try to draw Biden’s attention and create the need to restart stalled nuclear talks in which it could win concessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-s-sister-slams-seoul-over-questioning-zero-virus-claim/story-EuJkKkJvPJvTzXiD8W6xpN.html
09-12-2020||World||‘No safety concerns in Pfizer shot’||US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Tuesday that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95% protective against Covid-19.The FDA review comes before a Thursday meeting where independent experts will scrutinise the data and vote on whether to recommend use of the vaccine. The vote isn’t binding but the FDA usually follows the group’s guidance. A US decision to allow use of the vaccine is expected within days.The review also said that, while the vaccine prevents symptomatic cases, it’s not clear if it keeps the disease from being transmitted. That highlights a major unknown: How effective they’ll be in stemming the spread of coronavirus at a population level. Data from 38,000 US trial participants “suggest a favourable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance” of emergency use nod, the review said.Meanwhile the UK, which on Tuesday started its vaccination drive, is planning to test the Pfizer shot in combination with another jab from AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Studies aimed at determining if using the two vaccines together can enhance immunity are planned for next year, said the UK Vaccine Taskforce. The group disclosed the plans as it published a report on its work so far, including deals for 357 million doses from seven makers and investments in three sites to expand the nation’s manufacturing capacity.Approval for the Oxford shot is likely by year-end, setting the stage for the combination trials, which will involve initial shots from one vaccine, followed by a booster jab from the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-safety-concerns-in-pfizer-shot/story-arnWECqdLRya7U4oyWuQVL.html

The US tech giant said it’s set to roll out the anti-tracking feature next year and warned it could kick apps off its widely used App Store if they don’t obey its requirements. Called App Tracking Transparency, it will require apps to clearly ask for users’ permission before tracking them. It was due to be launched this year but was delayed to allow developers more time to make changes. “Its aim is to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites,” Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. “Developers who fail to meet the standard can have their apps taken down from the app store,” Federighi said in an online keynote speech to the European Data Protection and Privacy Conference. Privacy campaigners say the move is a vital step that could strengthen respect for privacy but tech rivals like Facebook that make money from digital advertising that tracks users have pushed back against the measure. Federighi said tech users should be empowered to have more control of their data and dismissed arguments from advertisers and tech companies who say the anti-tracking feature will hurt the online ad industry. “When invasive tracking is your business model, you tend not to welcome transparency and customer choice.” In a separate policy update, apps in the App Store will soon start giving users more details about the personal data they use, Britain’s competition watchdog said. Each app’s listing will highlight key information about the data collected and a summary of its privacy policy. The changes, which were announced earlier this year, will take effect shortly for users worldwide, though a specific date wasn’t given. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said it worked with counterparts in the Netherlands and Norway to push for the changes, based on concern users were not being told clearly whether their data was being shared with third parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-to-tighten-app-privacy-remove-apps-that-don-t-comply/story-qFtvltjYriUXSkgHJyxyZO.html
09-12-2020||World||On Covid-19 vaccine testing, Pfizer chief insists ‘we didn’t cut any corners’||Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said Tuesday he understands concerns around the speed at which pharmaceutical companies have produced Covid-19 vaccines, but insisted that no corners had been cut.As Britain on Tuesday became the first Western country to start a mass coronavirus vaccine campaign, using the new Pfizer-BioNTech jab, Bourla said people should feel confident that it is safe and effective.“We didn’t cut any corners,” he told a virtual media briefing hosted by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA).The vaccine, based on new technology, has been tested “in the exact same way as we are testing any vaccine that is circulating out there,” Bourla assured.In fact, he added, “this vaccine actually was tested, because of the scrutiny, with even higher standards in terms of how we do things.”The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said data from trials of Pfizer-BioNTech drug revealed “no specific safety concerns”.The Pfizer-BioNTech jab is one of several vaccine candidates approaching approval in a number of countries, bringing hope for an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people worldwide and ravaged economies. ‘Big mistake’Pfizer and BioNTech have said they should be able to produce 50 million doses by the end of this month, and 1.3 billion next year.Two doses of the vaccine are required to reach the 95-percent protection levels seen in the tests, Bourla said.While one jab alone will provide around 50 percent protection, he stressed the importance of getting both.“It is a very big mistake if anyone tries to do it with only one dose, when with two you almost double the protection,” he said.Getting vaccines to the people who need them is meanwhile a major undertaking.“When you are embarking on such a monumental project, every day we have zillions of challenges,” Bourla said A particular issue with the Pfizer vaccine is that it needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit), leaving hospitals and other medical hubs as the only places able to deal with such ultra-low temperatures.Bourla said the companies were currently “working also on a new formulation that will be able to avoid the -70, and can be stored in simple refrigeration.”But in the meantime, he insisted that the ultra-cold-chain demands of the current vaccine were no too difficult, thanks to “the ingenuity of our mechanics” who have found ways to more easily transport and distribute the jabs.“We have started already in the UK and things are going very well,” he said, adding that the ultra-coldchain was not really that difficult to deal with “at least in countries with basic infrastructure, like a road for example or a place to store things.”‘Weak link’A major challenge meanwhile remains in convincing people it is safe to take the vaccines. Bourla said he understood the concerns around the speed at which the vaccines had been developed. “Always there are people who are sceptical about vaccines, but I have to say they are wrong,” he said.“I can imagine that in this case, because the products, the vaccines or the medicines are developed very fast that it is even worse because it has been severely politicised, particularly in the US.“That makes people confused. They don’t know who to believe and what to believe, because the discussion was happening on political rather than on scientific terms.”But he stressed that the companies were intent on ensuring that only safe and effective vaccines make it to market, and “the regulators are very careful.”For those wary of getting a jab, Bourla said: “I understand their concerns, but they need to think twice.“The decision to vaccinate, or not, is not affecting only your health. It is affecting the health of others, and likely the health of people you love,” he said.“If you don’t vaccinate you are becoming the weak link that will allow the virus to replicate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-covid-19-vaccine-testing-pfizer-chief-insists-we-didn-t-cut-any-corners/story-UyxNedzPFvPH2tr8N12HKP.html

He is well-known both to Biden and farm groups, having spent eight years as agriculture secretary, Barack Obama’s longest-serving cabinet member.Biden chose Vilsack as he tries to build support among constituencies that favored Trump, especially in rural America.Biden settled on Vilsack after also considering Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge, whose case had been pressed by a key ally, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina.Fudge will be nominated instead to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a person familiar with the transition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-picks-tom-vilsack-to-reprise-role-as-agriculture-secretary/story-K1xHegRFahVT9puNDFlE1H.html

09-12-2020||World||Pfizer vaccine moves closer to getting the OK in US||US regulators has released their first scientific evaluation of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine and confirmed it offers strong protection, setting the stage for the government to green light the biggest vaccination effort in the nation’s history.The analysis by Food and Drug Administration scientists on Tuesday comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend vaccinating millions of Americans. A final FDA decision and the first shots could follow within just days.They are among a whirlwind of developments that are expected to make multiple vaccines available by early next year, in the US and beyond.Britain on Tuesday began vaccinations with the shot made by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. The FDA later this month will consider one developed by Moderna. Also Tuesday, a medical journal published early data suggesting a third vaccine candidate, AstraZeneca’s, also protects people, though not as much as the two other frontrunners.The vaccines emerged from an all-out worldwide race and are reaching the market less than a year after the virus was even identified — a remarkable scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.The encouraging developments come as the coronavirus continues surging across much of the world. The scourge has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, including over 285,000 in the US, the highest toll of any country.FDA scientists reanalyzed data from Pfizer’s huge, still-unfinished study and found that so far, the vaccine appears safe and more than 90% effective across patients of different ages, races and underlying health conditions. The FDA specifically confirmed it works well in older people, who are especially vulnerable to the virus.Thursday’s public meeting will be closely watched by health authorities around the world and is considered key to bolstering confidence in the shots amid scepticism about vaccine safety among many Americans.“We want people to see this discussion, to see the issues that are brought up, and have a vigorous discussion of the data elements by the outside experts,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in an interview. “That will be an important part of showing what goes into our decision making.” The FDA is expected to follow its committee’s advice, and first in line once vaccinations begin would be health care workers and nursing home residents.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to predict how quickly FDA might issue a decision.“They need to take as much time as they need to feel comfortable. It’s very important for the trust of the vaccine from the people,” he said.Pfizer and BioNTech previously reported the shots appeared 95% effective at preventing mild to severe COVID-19 disease, based on the first 170 infections confirmed after participants’ second dose. Only eight of the infections were among volunteers who had been given the real vaccine; the rest were among those who had gotten a dummy shot.Moderna has reported nearly identical protection in tests of its vaccine, which was developed with the US National Institutes of Health.A third option, from AstraZeneca and Oxford University, appears safe and about 70% effective, according to early test results from Britain and Brazil. But that report, in the medical journal Lancet, showed that questions remain about how well it helps protect those over 55.Still, British regulators are considering emergency use of that vaccine, too, and if it pans out, it could become the vaccine of choice in the developing world because it doesn’t need to be kept in the deep freeze like Pfizer’s formula.A big question for all the coming vaccines is how long protection lasts.FDA said partial protection appears two weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer shot, and greater protection seems to last at least two months after the second and final dose.As for safety, the FDA found no serious side effects among the more than 37,000 volunteers who have been tracked for at least two months after their last dose, the period when vaccination problems typically appear.The main side effects were injection-site pain or flu-like reactions that tend to last a day or two: More than half of adults under 55 experienced fatigue or headache, about a third reported chills or muscle pain, and 16% had a fever. Older adults were less likely to experience those reactions.Once mass vaccinations get underway, the government intends to conduct unprecedented monitoring of recipients to watch for any side effects that didn’t show up during testing. Even studies of tens of thousands of people can’t spot a complication that strikes, say, 1 in a million.Among the additional questions ahead of Thursday’s meeting: Were the shots adequately tested in Black, Hispanic and other communities hard hit by the pandemic? Does the vaccine protect against infection with no symptoms, or could the vaccinated still unknowingly spread the virus? What should pregnant women be told about vaccination, since they weren’t tested in Pfizer’s study? Studies in children as young as 12 are just beginning.Answering some of those questions may require keeping Pfizer’s 44,000-person study going even after vaccinations begin. Health authorities are wrestling with how to do so in a way that’s fair to participants who got a dummy shot but would want the real thing now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-moves-closer-to-getting-the-ok-in-us/story-SHisUXPw279zfx4Hwl3FNN.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden taps General Lloyd Austin as first black Pentagon chief||US President-elect Joe Biden named retired army general Lloyd Austin on Tuesday to be secretary of defence, who if confirmed will become the first African-American to lead the Pentagon.“Throughout his lifetime of dedicated service -- and in the many hours we’ve spent together in the White House Situation Room and with our troops overseas -- General Austin has demonstrated exemplary leadership, character, and command,” Biden said in a statement.“He is uniquely qualified to take on the challenges and crises we face in the current moment.”The four-star general was the US commander in Iraq and then the head of the US Central Command covering over all of the Middle East in 2010 to 2016 when Biden was vice president.But he was a surprise choice for secretary of defence, bypassing a highly qualified former senior Pentagon civilian official, Michele Flournoy.By choosing Austin, Biden will have to persuade the US Senate to waive a law that says the US military must be led by a civilian or, if a former military official, someone who has been out of the service at least seven years.The law has been waived only twice before, including in 2017, when former general Jim Mattis was made defence secretary under President Donald Trump.The Biden campaign called Austin “a trusted and crisis-tested leader who has overseen some of the most complex and impactful operations in the history of the armed services,” citing the campaign against the Islamic State group and the withdrawal of nearly 150,000 military personnel from Iraq before that.“I look forward to once again working closely with him as a trusted partner to lead our military with dignity and resolve, revitalize our alliances in the face of global threats, and ensure the safety and security of the American people,” Biden said in the statement.‘Back on track’In a separate piece in Atlantic magazine explaining why he picked Austin, Biden wrote: “I’ve sought his advice, seen his command, and admired his calm and his character.” He acknowledged the issue of nominating someone recently in military service to helm the department of defence, and said he hoped Congress would grant a waiver and that his nomination would be quickly approved.“Austin also knows that the secretary of defence has a different set of responsibilities than a general officer and that the civil-military dynamic has been under great stress these past four years,” Biden wrote.“He will work tirelessly to get it back on track.”Austin spent four decades in the army, graduating from West Point Military Academy and following a career with a wide range of assignments, from leading platoons to running logistics groups and overseeing recruiting, to senior Pentagon jobs.In March 2003, he was the assistant division commander of the 3rd Infantry Division when it marched from Kuwait into Baghdad in the US invasion of Iraq.From late 2003 to 2005, he was in Afghanistan commanding the Combined Joint Task Force 180, the principle US-led operation seeking to stabilize the security situation in the country.In 2010, he was made commanding general of US forces in Iraq, and two years later became the commander of the Central Command, in charge of all Pentagon operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.That put him in charge of the fight against the Islamic State as it captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria.Since retiring, Austin has been on the board of one of the Pentagon’s largest weapons suppliers, Raytheon, as well as other companies.He also was part of a small group of shareholders in an investment group, Pine Island Capital Partners, that included Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and his rival for the Pentagon job, Flournoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-taps-general-lloyd-austin-as-first-black-pentagon-chief/story-5WkFzp1OuiAFOuSRluPPAP.html
09-12-2020||World||Covid-19 aid in balance as Congress buys time for talks||Top Washington Republicans are convening Tuesday to sort out their end-of-session business on government spending and Covid-19 relief, as they take advantage of an additional week’s time and a moment that’s teed up for potential gridlock-breaking action.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are meeting by conference call.Already, Capitol Hill leaders are moving a government shutdown deadline to the end of next week, but progress is slow and key decisions are yet to be made. And the negotiating dynamic isn’t entirely clear since there are parallel Covid-19 relief talks among both a group of more pragmatic lawmakers and the battle-scarred congressional leadership.Lawmakers are struggling to figure out how to deliver long-delayed pandemic relief, including additional help for hard-hit businesses, further unemployment benefits, funding to distribute Covid-19 vaccines and funding demanded by Democrats for state and local governments.A flashpoint is a demand by McConnell, R-Ky., to award businesses and universities, among others, a shield against lawsuits for Covid-related negligence. McConnell and business allies like the US Chamber of Commerce say such suits threaten businesses with financial hardships from opportunistic lawsuits.“Contrary to the majority leader’s dire predictions, there has been no flood of Covid lawsuits. In fact, quite the opposite,” said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York. “Far from the pandemic of lawsuits, there’s barely been a trickle.”Separately, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., spoke by phone on Monday to try to kick start talks on a separate $1.4 trillion government-wide spending bill. That measure is held up over issues like the sage grouse, the Census and accounting maneuvers being employed by lawmakers to squeeze $12 billion more into the legislation.Leaders had previously told lawmakers that this week would probably be the last of the session, but talks are going more slowly than hoped and both sides were quick to endorse a stopgap measure that would prevent a government shutdown through Dec. 18.Three main items of legislation are at issue: a defense policy bill that President Donald Trump is threatening to veto; the $1.4 trillion government-wide spending bill; and perhaps $900 billion in long-sought Covid-19 relief.There are two sets of talks on Covid-19 relief — on the leadership level and by a group of Senate moderates — occurring at the same time, and it’s unclear how the negotiators might sort themselves out, lending an air of confusion to the process.The bipartisan Senate group was set to meet again Monday evening. But a long weekend of talks pushed senators apart on one difficult negotiation, the proposed liability protection that has been a priority of McConnell.Republicans initially proposed a sweeping five-year liability shield, retroactive to December 2019, to protect companies and organizations from Covid-19-related lawsuits. Democrats, along with their allies in labor and civil rights groups, roundly dismissed that approach as a danger to workers.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she wants to make sure “we’re not sacrificing the rights of people who have been made sick or killed by their employers with a pro-corporate liability release.”Lawmakers heard from a coalition of 142 labor and civil rights groups urging them to resist granting companies liability for Covid claims.“Any type of immunity would directly harm Black, Latino, and other workers of color who are overrepresented in ‘essential’ and in-person, reopened jobs,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Congress.Negotiators suggested a scaled-back liability shield, but a six-month proposal was panned by Republicans and there is no agreement yet from Democrats. The powerful AFL-CIO said Monday it opposes even a short-term liability provision.It’s clear that McConnell’s Republican majority is demanding the liability protection in exchange for the Democrats’ push for additional money for states and cities battling the Covid-19 crisis.“The leader had made clear that state and local money is tied to liability protection, so there’s either going to be none for both of those or both of those are going to be provided for,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters. “My hope is we’ll do both.”White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that Trump is comfortable with a deal along the lines of one being put together by the group of Senate moderates and pragmatists. That $900 billion plan does not include the direct payments sought by Trump before the election.Without another round of fresh aid, after the $1,200 checks sent to Americans in spring, lawmakers on the left and right said they would have trouble backing the package.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said last week he would need direct payments for his support, and GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said Monday that he encouraged Trump to reject any package without them.“I urged him to veto,” Hawley said he told the president during a recent phone call.If an agreement isn’t possible on the omnibus bill, lawmakers might have no option but to pass another continuing resolution that would keep the government running on autopilot and permit them to punt the unfinished spending bills into next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-aid-in-balance-as-congress-buys-time-for-talks/story-31yklqQxo8pYvHmeARProI.html
09-12-2020||World||UN expert demands Julian Assange’s release, 10 years on||A UN rights expert on Tuesday urged Britain to release Julian Assange immediately following a decade of “arbitrary detention”, insisting the WikiLeaks founder should await a decision on extradition to the United States outside prison.The 49-year-old Australian was first arrested 10 years ago on December 7, 2010.He is currently being held in the top-security Belmarsh jail in London awaiting the next hearing, due on January 4, on a US extradition request, in a case seen by his supporters as a cause celebre for media freedom.“The British authorities initially detained Mr. Assange on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by Sweden in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct that have since been formally dropped due to lack of evidence,” said UN human rights expert Nils Melzer.“Today, he is detained for exclusively preventative purposes,” said Melzer, the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.“Mr. Assange is not a criminal convict and poses no threat to anyone, so his prolonged solitary confinement in a high-security prison is neither necessary nor proportionate and clearly lacks any legal basis.”UN rights experts do not speak for the United Nations but report their findings to it.Assange faces 18 charges in the United States relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.If convicted in the United States, Assange could be jailed for up to 175 years.‘Severe suffering’In 2012, while on bail, he dodged an extradition attempt by Sweden by claiming political asylum in Ecuador’s embassy in London.He remained in the small diplomatic mission for seven years and the Swedish charges were later dropped.But he was turned over to British police in April 2019 after a change of government in Quito, and jailed for having skipped bail. Washington then served a formal extradition request.Melzer said the “progressively severe suffering inflicted” on Assange “amounts not only to arbitrary detention, but also to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.Melzer said Assange, “who suffers from a pre-existing respiratory health condition”, should be released from prison during the coronavirus pandemic.He said the former computer hacker could potentially be placed under guarded house arrest.“Mr. Assange’s rights have been severely violated for more than a decade,” said Melzer.“He must now be allowed to live a normal family, social and professional life.”Assange should not be extradited to the United States due to serious human rights concerns, the UN expert added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expert-demands-julian-assange-s-release-10-years-on/story-JaOVWS7FR0M43laDTpDvWK.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden diversity push turns tense over unfilled top-tier profiles||President-elect Joe Biden’s early picks for top administration jobs made history for elevating women, people of color and immigrants. But advocates want to see more racial diversity closer to the center of power, putting pressure on Biden as he moves to a new round of selections next week.He is now drawing criticism over the makeup of his inner circle from Black and Latino lawmakers, and groups like the NAACP and UnidosUS are demanding more say on selections. Amid those objections, his transition team slowed its decision on a Defense secretary, and its choice of a health secretary is emerging as a new flashpoint before an announcement as soon as next week.The incoming administration broke major barriers with the selection of Kamala Harris as the first Black and Indian-American woman for vice president, along with two Black women, a Latino immigrant and an Indian-American woman for key economic and national security posts. Yet advocates say those officials won’t be as close to the seat of power as the White people the president-elect chose for key posts -- including Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary, Antony Blinken for Secretary of State and Ron Klain as chief of staff.“The reality is that there are not enough Black people in his inner circle,” said David Clunie, the executive director of the Black Economic Alliance and a former Obama administration official.Also Read | Biden weighs pick for agriculture chief from diverse slateBiden acknowledged, and even welcomed, the pressure and promised to follow through.“I promise you, it will be the single most diverse cabinet based on race, color, based on gender that’s ever existed in the United States of America,” he said at a Friday press conference. Pressed on whether he’d be choosing people of color to the Defense secretary and attorney general, he declined to say.He said in a CNN interview on Thursday that he was hearing from advocacy groups but recognized “it’s their job to push me.”Latino advocates have been pressing top Biden advisers to choose New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham as Health and Human Services secretary after the transition team moved away from her for that position. In response, the Biden camp leaked to reporters that they had picked her for Interior secretary and that she turned them down in the hopes of getting HHS.When the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with three of Biden’s top advisers on Thursday, members had believed Lujan Grisham was the most likely Latina to get a spot in the Biden cabinet and they publicly expressed dismay at the leaks suggesting she may not get a job at all.“This was to kind of throw her under the bus,” Arizona Representative Raul Grijalva said. During the meeting, “almost all the members commented on that, how they felt that that was a raw deal that the governor got -- that that kind of publicity was meant to undermine any effort of her getting HHS.”Klain and transition co-chairs Ted Kaufman and Jeff Zients told the CHC on Thursday they want Lujan Grisham in the administration, though they didn’t reveal whether she still had a shot at HHS, a Democrat on the call said.The growing concerns over the health-secretary pos reflect the chagrin expressed by Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and other Black lawmakers over the number of African Americans selected so far for key roles. This week, Biden unveiled his economic team during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware, including four women, one Black man and one White man -- with the cabinet-level jobs all going to women, including Yellen. All spoke of their humble beginnings and pledged to fight to close the wealth gap.Two days later, Biden announced in a written statement the appointment of a White man, Brian Deese, to head the National Economic Council. TIAA Chief Executive Officer Roger Ferguson, who is Black, had also been under consideration for the job. Deese is an executive at BlackRock Inc.Clyburn and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus have made clear their preference for Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge, who is Black, to be Agriculture secretary. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus last month wrote to Biden asking him to include Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in his cabinet.The Biden team slowed its selection process for Defense secretary after Black leaders expressed concerns that Biden might not name an African American to any of the top four cabinet departments -- Defense, Justice, State or Treasury. He had been widely expected to tap Michele Flournoy, who is White, to be the first female Pentagon chief, but she wasn’t announced with the rest of his national security team two weeks ago.Two Black candidates, retired four-star General Lloyd Austin and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have been reported to be among those Biden is now considering to lead the Pentagon, and Johnson has also been discussed as an option for attorney general.Biden also faces pressure for diversity in political ideology. Progressive Democrats have also made clear their opposition to a range of potential picks and nominations, targeting people they see as potentially leading Biden away from his campaign promises to the left.“I don’t envy them,” Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS, said of the Biden transition team. “This is a very challenging time in terms of meeting the commitments that have to be met.”‘Making Everybody Happy’Murguia, who worked in Bill Clinton’s White House, nevertheless said her expectations were high. “For some of us, we were part of administrations that had at least three or four Hispanics 25 years ago, 30 years ago. So the bar is very high in terms of making everybody happy,” she said. “I know that’s likely not going to be possible. I do understand that. But it also underscores why we have to keep promoting that high-water mark for representation.”Also Read | Joe Biden says jobs report ‘grim,’ relief package needed now and in JanuaryMurguia asked Biden Thursday to meet to “discuss our shared goal of ensuring that government at all levels reflects the diversity of America and works well for all families.”She’s not alone in requesting a session with the president-elect. So have a coalition of Black civil rights groups including the NAACP and the National Urban League, who say they’re concerned about Black representation in key positions and want Biden to make clear that civil rights will be a central issue for his administration.“We want to make sure that issues concerned with civil rights is a top priority. And it’s not secondary and it’s not talking points,” said NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who is scheduled to meet with Biden on Tuesday.But Johnson added that he shouldn’t have had to ask for the meeting.“We shouldn’t have to guess what he’s thinking; it should be a direct line of communication,” he said, pointing out that Biden’s agency review teams include people from business, environmental and labor groups but not civil rights groups.A transition official said Biden’s team has been working with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which is independent of the NAACP, and the National Urban League. It’s also in regular contact with the Congressional Black Caucus, which is recommending personnel.Keeping Certain People OutThe advocates also are fighting to keep certain people out of the administration.At the top of their lists is Rahm Emanuel, the former Obama chief of staff and former Chicago mayor who is rumored to be under consideration for Transportation secretary or another post. They say he should be disqualified because of his handling of the response to the 2014 killing in Chicago of Laquan McDonald, an unarmed Black teenager, by a White police officer.“Is that the type of person you would want to have as a part of your legacy?” Johnson said.The transition declined to comment on whether Emanuel is under consideration for an administration job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-diversity-push-turns-tense-over-unfilled-top-tier-profiles/story-rcwolAqFopVoJQtZ6TqnjO.html
09-12-2020||India||Opposition leaders meet President Kovind, ask for repeal of farm laws||A delegation of opposition parties on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind to seek repeal of the three new farm laws enacted in September, alleging that the government had “insulted” the farmers by getting these passed in Parliament in an “undemocratic” manner without discussion and consultation.The meeting came a day after a Bharat Bandh called by farmers’ unions in protest against these laws. Thousands of farmers are currently protesting at Delhi’s borders after they were denied entry into the Capital. Odisha cabinet passes resolution urging Centre to implement MSPs for all cropsThe five-member delegation of opposition leaders included former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India general secretary D Raja and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader TKS Elangovan. The delegation was limited to five because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Farmers’ protest: Centre sends proposal to farmers “We urge upon you, as the custodian of the Indian Constitution, to persuade your government not to be obdurate and accept the demands raised by India’s annadatas,” the opposition leaders said in a memorandum submitted to the President. “The new agri laws, passed in Parliament in an anti-democratic manner preventing a structured discussion and voting, threaten India’s food security, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers, lay the basis for the abolishment of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multi-national agri-business corporates and domestic corporate,” it added. The memorandum said over 20 political parties, including those running states, extended their solidarity with the farmers over their struggle and supported their bandh call on December 8, demanding the repeal of the agri laws and the electricity amendment bill. “We met the President and informed him of our views regarding the three farm laws. We have asked for their repeal. We informed him that it is critical that they are taken back,” Gandhi told reporters after the meeting. “The way the farm laws were passed in Parliament, we feel it was an insult to farmers and that is why they are protesting in the cold weather against them. They will not relent and will continue their peaceful agitation till the laws are taken back,” he said. The former Congress chief claimed that the new laws were aimed at handing over the farm sector to the “friends” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “But the farmers are fearless and will not back off. They have lost faith in the government,” he added. Pawar said various political parties requested the President that these farm laws should be repealed as they were not discussed with either stakeholders or in a select committee of Parliament. “Not a single suggestion offered by opposition leaders in Parliament was accepted by the government and all these bills were passed in haste,” he said. “In this cold, the farmers are on the streets protesting peacefully, expressing their unhappiness. It is the duty of the government to resolve this issue,” Pawar added. His views were echoed by Yechury. “We told the President that the three farm laws were passed undemocratically in Parliament and have sought the repeal of these laws,” he said. The CPI(M) leader said the government should repeal the acts in view of the widespread protests by farmers. “The Prime Minister has been saying that these laws are in the interest of farmers, but the question is if these laws are in their favour then why are they protesting out in the cold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-leaders-meet-president-kovind-ask-for-repeal-of-farm-laws/story-eYOhL0I8SGaTDzJewXpXII.html
09-12-2020||India||Odisha cabinet passes resolution urging Centre to implement MSPs for all crops||On a day protesting farmers in Delhi rejected the proposals of the Narendra Modi government on amendments for the three contentious farms laws, the Naveen Patnaik government adopted a cabinet resolution urging the Centre to implement all the recommendations of MS Swaminathan Commission on MSP for all crops.“Farmers are the soul of our economy and the fundamental strength behind our socio-economic dynamics. The nation and society thrive with the prosperity of farmers. The state government considers MSP an essential tool for providing income security to farmers. National Agriculture Commission chaired by eminent agriculture scientist Dr. MS Swaminathan had recommended an MSP 50 per cent higher than the average cost of agricultural production. We all should take care that no farmer is deprived of the appropriate price for his produce. It’s his right,” the government said in a statement Wednesday evening.The state cabinet in its resolution said when almost all the sectors are facing a slowdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, the farm sector like an oasis in the desert, has helped the economy to survive. It noted that in last 16 years, the agricultural GDP has doubled in Odisha with agricultural growth rate reaching 4.5, higher than national average of 3.1.“Farmers’ income must grow proportionate to the growth of income in other sectors. In agriculture sector, the income enhancement must be considered keeping the cost of production in view. To make farming profitable and protect the farmers from all types of volatility, the MSP must be fixed on realistic basis. The state government reiterates the need for implementation of all the recommendations of Swaminathan commission regarding MSP fully across all crops,” said the state cabinet resolution.The State Assembly had unanimously adopted resolution twice, in 2017 and 2018, for enhancing MSP as per Swaminathan Commission’s recommendations.The Congress said the resolution was perfunctory as the Naveen Patnaik government just wanted to guard its image.“Had they been serious, then BJD MPs would have opposed the farm Bills in Parliament. But they just walked out. In all these years, the state government has not added an extra Rupee to the MSP announced by the centre,” Odisha’s Congress unit chief Niranjan Patnaik said.Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal which rode back to power in 2019 assembly polls on the back of KALIA, a cash transfer scheme for small and marginal farmers of the state, has already shelved two of its farm laws that would have triggered reforms in the agriculture sector. Having opposed the twin farm laws of Centre in September on opening of agricultural sale and marketing outside the APMC mandis for farmers, as well as allowing contract farming, the Naveen Patnaik government has quietly buried the Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, and Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020.The two ordinances promulgated in May this year aimed at registration farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity and amendment of Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1957, for geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce including livestock across the state and country.While the ordinance on contract farming was not re-promulgated in November this year, the second ordinance was brought in as a Bill in the winter session of the Assembly which concluded early this month. However, it could not be passed. The government meanwhile has re-promulgated the Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 keeping it alive for the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cabinet-passes-resolution-urging-centre-to-implement-msps-for-all-crops/story-ArBanATXWfpU7VeHa6gS6H.html

Describing 5G as a “gamechanger”, Vaghela said it will be widely used not only within telecom but by all other sectors, and help bridge urban-rural divide. “To reap its benefits, the country’s policies, licensing and regulatory environment also need to be evolved to enable 5G,” Vaghela said addressing India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2020. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is working “whole heartedly” in this direction, said Vaghela. Supporting policies need to be evolved to position India as global destination for technology products, Vaghela said. He further said 5G would usher seamless coverage, ultra-high speeds, and highly reliable communications for mission-critical applications. “5G promises new range of services to consumers and enterprises, beyond traditional voice and data, through enabling technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, augmented reality and virtual reality and host of new emerging applications,” he said. It would also bring use cases like smart cities, smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, and industrial automation, amongst others, besides encouraging spectrum and network efficiency. “5G is likely to transform industries and Indian society, accelerating them on unprecedented growth trajectory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policies-regulatory-regime-need-to-be-evolved-to-reap-full-benefits-of-5g-trai-chief/story-SNPTjKjTWXAMmjnzXI04GM.html

If some affected areas have been left out, the damage there should also be taken into account and a report should be filed by district collectors and I have directed them on this aspect,” he said adding that the crops affected include paddy fields and banana plantations.The Central government has been urged to depute its team to assess damage due to Burevi cyclone as well and they would visit Tamil Nadu for sure, he said.An inter-ministerial Central team that assessed damage caused in Tamil Nadu due to the ‘Nivar’ has completed its task and called on Palaniswami at the Secretariat in Chennai on Tuesday before leaving for Delhi.Apart from damage to crops, 9,907 houses have been affected due to the two recent cyclones, Palaniswami said.Fishermen panchayat leaders submitted a memorandum appealing for suitable corrective measures to strengthen the rubble mound wall at the Tarangambadi fishing harbour that was damaged during the recent cyclones.Reiterating his government’s support for the farm laws, the Chief Minister said even the DMK’s election manifesto for 2016 Assembly polls assured a new policy for marketing farm products by overcoming barriers like middlemen.“The farm laws are being opposed out of political vendetta,” he alleged.On DMK chief M K Stalin hitting out at the proposed caste-wise survey as an election stunt, he said,”He (Stalin) will only comment in such a manner. The survey will be completed for sure.” Palaniswami commenced his tour after offering special prayers at Vailankanni church and Nagore dargah.The Chief Minister, who inspected the deluge-hit Cuddalore on Tuesday inspected Nagapattinam, and Tiruvarur districts today and distributed relief materials to the affected people.Also, he visited damaged houses and also gave an order to a beneficiary for rebuilding his house under the green house scheme (Chief Minister’s Solar Powered Green House Scheme).Accompanied by Ministers and officials, Palaniswami participated in a special prayer at the shrine Basilica in Vailankanni.He also prayed at the dargah of Saint Hazrath Syed Shahul Hameed Quadir Wali at Nagore.Later, he visited the Dharmapuram Aadhennam, an ancient Shaivite Math, in Mayiladuthurai and sought the blessings of the pontiff Sri Sri Masilamani Desika Gnanasambandha Paramacharya Swami, along with his Cabinet colleagues.Palaniswami stopped his convoy at many places and interacted with the farmers and listened to their grievances and assured relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-visits-rain-hit-regions-says-over-80-000-hectares-of-crops-affected/story-mpAPhfLXFIs8coSIdMkcnK.html

Criminals looted Rs 1.5 lakh from his possession. Minutes after the incident, a veterinary doctor was gunned down in Ghoraghat of Gaya district. The BJP has flagged the disconcerting statistics of crime in the state as a matter of concern. In the last two months, the state has witnessed 505 murders, 176 rapes, 13 abductions for ransom, 5073 theft and 704 burglaries, according to official figures of the police headquarters. Faced with the challenge to controlling crime, Nitish Kumar has now issued a directive that in case of crime, accountability would not be fixed on the police station concerned only, but also on senior officers.“The rule of law must be enforced and the anti-social must fear law. It is important to give emphasis on speedy trial and proper investigation and prosecution. The senior officials must do regular monitoring,” he said at the meeting according to a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO).He also asked officials to explain the reason behind spurt in crime and why police patrolling was not proper. The CM directed the officials to focus on foot patrols with a large number of policemen, identify habitual offenders and book them at the earliest. “The DM and the SP must hold a joint meeting once in a month to solve only land-related disputes. The SDO and the SDPO will hold similar joint meetings at the sub-division level once in a fortnight while the circle officer and the station house officer will do so once a week. The officials should take stern actions against those who are found guilty of doing wrong in land disputes,” he said.The RJD claimed that Nitish Kumar has lost grip over administration“The growing number of cases reflects the round reality – criminals are free to prosper with the police failing to keep them in check. The CM has lost grip over administration and his claim of establishing the rule of law has fallen flat. He has surrendered before criminals in his self-proclaimed good governance,” said RJD leader Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav.In another tweet in Hindi, he asked, “Why is ‘maharaja’ of the maha jungle raj silent?” Wednesday’s heist at a jewelry shop in Darbhanga evoked a sharp response from the BJP’s Sanjay Saravagi, the MLA from the town. Saravagi said the fear of the police has reduced among criminals. Congress MLC Premchand Mishra demanded a full-fledged home minister in the state. Nitish Kumar currently holds that portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-reviews-law-and-order-for-second-time-in-10-days-as-crime-spikes/story-O6nfzvtoENEErpx5YlseiI.html
09-12-2020||India||Stop playing games with farmers: SAD to Centre on farm laws||The Shiromani Akali Dal on Wednesday asked the BJP-led Centre to “stop playing games” with innocent farmers and withdraw the three farm laws “immediately and unconditionally”.The SAD, which had pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance amid the consistent digs at it by the Congress after the enactment of the laws, also backed the farmers’ rejection of the Centre’s proposal on these laws.“These proposals were nothing but delaying and diversionary tactics and tricks which have rightly been rejected by the farmers,” it said.“We are with the farmers in everything and in every way,” it added.Farmer leaders on Wednesday rejected a government proposal on the three contentious agriculture-marketing laws and said they would intensify their agitation against the legislations with a nationwide protest on December 14.In a statement here, senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia said there was nothing new in these proposals.”These are the same proposals which had been rejected by the SAD before quitting the government and the NDA to stand with farmers,” he said. “It is so tragic that the country’s ‘annadata’, the farmers, are battling cruel and biting cold along with their family members ranging from barely 14-day-old infants to elders in their late eighties and nineties,” said the Akali leader.He urged the government to “abandon its stubborn refusal to listen to farmers and announce an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of their demands”. “The government says the farm laws are meant for farmers’ welfare. If the farmers don’t want these, it is absolutely unreasonable, wrong and undemocratic to thrust these laws upon them,” said the former minister.The senior Akali leader expressed grave concern over how “our country’s soft and civilised image is taking a huge beating with the government’s repressive handling of a peaceful stir”.“What an irony that people and institutions from all over the world, including the UN, have felt deeply touched and extended solidarity with our brave but beleaguered farmers while our own elected government continues to be utterly callous and insensitive to their sufferings,” alleged Majithia.“The unspeakable miseries, which the country’s breadwinners are braving, present a touching human spectacle that can move even the most heartless enemy,” he said.The Akali leader alleged that the government’s “apathy” towards its people and its “love and preference for the rich corporates” have brought back memories of the “colonial rulers”.“The pity is greater because the rulers today are not foreigners but our own elected representatives. People elected them in the hope that they would address their problems as does a parent in a family. Unfortunately, the parent has turned cruelly and heartlessly against its own children,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-playing-games-with-farmers-sad-to-centre-on-farm-laws/story-2h0NFNHKk1mQq0sjdn0ifI.html
09-12-2020||India||Covid-19: Expert panel seeks more data from Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech||The expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Wednesday sought additional safety and efficacy data from the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for their coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, after deliberating upon their applications seeking authorisation for the shots.At a meeting to review the emergency authorisation of vaccine makers, the CDSCO’s subject expert committee (SEC) reviewed the authorisation sought by Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech but did not consider a similar application from Pfizer-BioNTech because their US experts could not attend the meeting.An official with direct knowledge of the matter told news agency Reuters that a decision on the vaccines would be taken “in toto” and it was too early to say whether they would be rejected or accepted, even as the government has said that some vaccines may be approved in the coming weeks.Another official said: “The CDSCO just wants more data on efficacy and safety before making a decision. It is part of the process”.While considering Serum Institute’s application, the CDSCO is learnt to have asked for updated safety data of phase-2 and phase-3 clinical trials in the country, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India, along with the outcome of the assessment of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), news agency PTI quoting government officials said.As for Bharat Biotech, after detailed deliberations, the SEC recommended that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase-3 clinical trial in the country for further consideration, the officials said.Pune-based Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, requested approval for the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, on December 6.US drugmaker Pfizer sought Indian approval on December 4 after securing clearances in the UK and Bahrain. On Monday, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech became the third vaccine manufacturer to apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use authorisation for its indigenously-developed vaccine, named Covaxin.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has shown an efficacy of 62% when volunteers were given two full doses of the vaccine, but a higher 90% when the first was a half-strength dose, according to interim results from trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil. In India, the vaccine’s trials are being carried out by Serum Institute, which is also producing a billion doses of the shot.According to top-line data released by Pfizer, its vaccine has 95% efficacy.The candidate of Bharat Biotech still undergoing large scale Phase 3 clinical trials and the data from the combined Phase 1/2 trials is not public yet.To be sure, the only locally made vaccine anywhere close to being approved is the SII-manufactured AstraZeneca/Oxford one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-expert-panel-seeks-more-data-from-serum-institute-of-india-bharat-biotech/story-AUlmJ8VDnWB4X3Ip7OewGK.html

The cancellation of the launch of the stamp marking the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties had created a flutter on Tuesday because it occurred against the backdrop of the nearly eight-month standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “Regarding cancellation of joint issue of commemorative stamp to mark 70th [anniversary of diplomatic ties between] #China & #India, the reason is Indian side had not given feedback before launch time agreed by both sides,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a tweet. “China State Post Bureau made the notice according to customary practices,” she said, without giving further details. There was no official response to the development from Indian officials. India and China haven’t organised any of the 70 events they had planned to mark 70 years of diplomatic ties. Each side was to have held 35 events, and the activities were initially put off due to the Covid-19 pandemic before being totally derailed by the border standoff that began in May. When the two sides exchanged messages between their presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers on April 1 to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations, the external affairs ministry had said in a statement that they were holding talks on “commemorating this historic anniversary in a manner truly reflective of its significance”. It also said the two sides were working to jointly design a logo to mark the celebrations. Chinese state media had quoted a statement posted on the postal service’s website on Tuesday to report the cancellation of the joint launch of the stamp. “The State Post Office has decided to cancel the planned joint issue of stamps between China and India in the 2020 special stamp-issue programme,” the brief statement said. The launch of the stamp and the other events had been agreed on during the second informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Chennai in October 2019. Though the standoff began in May, diplomatic ties have been particularly tense since June, when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Beijing hasn’t revealed the casualties of the People’s Liberation Army. Several rounds of talks between diplomats and military commanders – the last one held on November 8 – have not helped push forward disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-says-joint-launch-of-stamp-cancelled-due-to-lack-of-feedback-from-india/story-IByc8VMOFxilX6BUAyvtTL.html
09-12-2020||India||Karnataka assembly passes anti-cow slaughter bill amid bedlam||Amid bedlam by main opposition party Congress legislators, the Karnataka legislative assembly on Wednesday passed the ‘Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle ill 2020.’ The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators sporting saffron shawls shouted ‘Gau Mata Ki Jai’ and cheered the passage of the contentious bill even as opposition members trooped to the well of the house protesting against the provisions of the bill.Speaker Vishweshar Hegde Kageri called on the minister of animal husbandry Prabhu Chauhan to table the bill even as Congress members claimed that they had not been informed about the bill being tabled and this was not discussed in the business advisory committee. Earlier Chauhan wearing a saffron shawl had worshipped cows in front of the assembly before coming in and tabling the bill.Leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah said that they had not been given a copy of the bill and that introduction of such key legislation after the announcement of Panchayat Raj polls was a violation of the model electoral code of conduct.Another senior Congress leader and former rural development minister H K Patil accused the Speaker of being partisan and running the house like his ‘party’s office’ and claimed that ‘rules and regulations of the house were not being adhered to.’ The Speaker, however, overruled the objections and the bill was declared passed by a voice vote.For some time, the opposition and ruling party members tried to drown each other with slogans before the Congress decided to walk out of the assembly. Speaking to the media outside the house, Siddaramiah said that the rural economy would be destroyed because of the bill. “They did not provide even a copy of the bill. In states like UP and MP because of the introduction of such bills animal husbandry has taken a hit. In UP alone there are now 10 lakh fewer cows because of the bill as farmers steer away from taking up animal husbandry,” he claimed.Accusing the Speaker of being a puppet of the ruling party, Siddaramiah said that his party would approach the EC and complain that the bill has violated the model code of conduct. He also said that his party would boycott the assembly on Thursday which is the last day of the truncated winter session.The session which was originally to run for a week was later cut short to four days. Siddaramiah said that the bill had been introduced with a communal mindset and was aimed at dividing the society.The Congress leader also said that all those whose jobs depended on beef would lose their livelihood and that ‘bill had been prepared by the RSS.’The BJP state unit chief Nalin Kumar Kateel expectedly welcomed the passage of the bill and said ‘I congratulate the CM Yediyurappa for introducing this historic legislation which is in the interest of the farmers. We worship the cow as our mother and the rural economy will benefit because of this bill.’ Other senior leaders of the party including MP Shoba Karandlaje welcomed the blanket ban on slaughter of cows in the state.The BJP unit in Karnataka is planning to celebrate the passage of the bill by conducting Gau Pooja (cow worship) in front of the party’s headquarters in Bengaluru on Thursday. All party MLAs and senior leaders including the CM are expected to attend the ceremony. This even as CLP leader Siddaramaiah called for an emergency meeting of the legislature party to decide on the next course of action against the anti-cow slaughter bill.In 2010 too the then Yediyurappa led BJP government had introduced and passed a similar anti-cow slaughter bill but this had been repealed by the Siddaramiah led Congress government when it assumed power in 2014. However, there are a few key differences between the 2010 and the 2020 bills with the new one prescribing much harsher punishment for any transgression.In the new bill any cow or bull under the age of 13 cannot be slaughtered. A violation would invite jail term between 3-7 years and a fine between Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakhs. Repeat offenders would have to pay between Rs 1-10 lakh and a jail term of 7 years.A permit would be needed from relevant state government authorities for interstate movement of animal husbandry and transportation should be done according to central government norms. Any violation would invite a jail term of 3-5 years with a fine of Rs 50,000. The stance of the regional JDS party wasn’t clear though some of its senior MLA’s including Shivalinge Gowda were seen supporting the Congress members.The ruling BJP would need JDS support if it wants to pass the bill in the legislative council where it has only 31 members in a house of 75. JDS leaders were not immediately available to comment on the party’s stance on the anti-cow slaughter legislation. Political analyst Manjunath said that in spite of Congress’s protestations, the BJP government had clearly indicated its intention of introducing anti-cow slaughter and in the next session ‘love jihad’ related legislation. “Congress seems to have been caught by surprise only by the speed with which the state government has got this passed, otherwise the discussion around it has been in air for months. All parties are signalling to their respective voter base and that is the reason why BJP has passed this ahead of panchayat polls and Congress has opposed it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-assembly-passes-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-amid-bedlam/story-8BFyVCloS5UYKx8N0jLlYN.html

Modi, who goes online to participate in most of his events due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will be physically present at the function and deliver a speech. Twelve dharma gurus of different faiths and religions will participate in prayers for the new building that will be triangular in shape with all modern facilities and more space for MPs to sit in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The new complex would also see expansion of the parliament estate and two government offices would be razed to build offices for individual MPs - a first such facility for Indian lawmakers. “All former Prime Ministers and former Lok Sabha Speakers have been invited. Efforts are also on to ensure all political parties also send their representatives at the function even if their top leaders are unable to attend,” said a senior Lok Sabha official. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, custodian of the Parliament complex is in charge of all the arrangements. Apart from PM and Birla, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi, urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh and other guests will be present. The programme will start at 1 PM with the bhoomi pujan and the laying of the foundation stone. After the multi-faith prayer ceremony, Harivansh Narayan Singh will read out messages from President Ram Nath Kovind and vice president Venkaiah Naidu. The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Centre to immediately stop all construction and ancillary activities in the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi where a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices are planned to be built. The Apex court, however, allowed the government to proceed with the foundation stone laying ceremony on December 10, and procedural paperwork stating that there cannot be alterations to the site. The deadline for completing the new Parliament complex is 2022. According to Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) order, the construction is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the “highest standards of quality and workmanship”. “The new building is an intrinsic part of the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ and will be a landmark opportunity to build peoples’ Parliament for the first time after independence, one which will match the needs and aspirations of ‘New India’ in the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022,” the PMO said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-lay-foundation-stone-of-new-parliament-building/story-mMyz1sZc1zA2uBl0dZx6xI.html
09-12-2020||India||ED files charge sheet over kickbacks in UPA-era Embraer aircraft deal||New Delhi: Twelve years after India signed a deal with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer for the supply of three fully modified EMB-145 aircraft for Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet alleging that the company paid commission worth $5.6 million (around Rs 41 crore according to Wednesday’s forex rates) in return for a $210 million (around Rs 1,544 crore) contract. According to ED’s investigation, shared by an officer at the agency on condition of anonymity, Embraer entered into an agreement with alleged middleman, NRI arms dealer Vipin Khanna, in 2005 for his services at a commission of 9%, three years before the contract with IAF was signed (on July 3, 2008). The agency has named in its charge sheet Embraer SA, and companies and individuals used for routing the money including Singapore based firm -- Interdev Aviation Services Pte. Ltd, KRBL Ltd , which is one of the largest Basmati rice exporting firms and whose brands include India Gate basmati rice, its joint managing director Anoop Kumar Gupta, his nephew Anurag Potdar, and others, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). In a statement to the stock exchange late on Wednesday, KRBL termed the allegations “false, frivolous and baseless”.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case in October 2016 against unknown officials of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), Embraer, Vipin Khanna and other unknown persons on the basis of which ED had initiated its money laundering probe in the case. The allegation is that Khanna received $5.6 million from the Sao Paulo based firm in return for influencing the ministry of defence (MoD) and DRDO officials for the contract to supply three fully modified EMB-145 aircraft to the Government of India as a platform for the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) project. In September 2016 , Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported that Embraer was under investigation by the US Justice Department since 2010 over a contract with the Dominican Republic. According to details accessed by HT, Embraer entered into an agency agreement with Khanna’s company, Cleveden Limited, somewhere around February 8, 2005 for his services at a commission of 9%. “This agreement was kept in a safe box in London. Three years later, Embraer signed a contract with IAF (on July 3, 2008) for providing three highly specialised military aircraft for approximately $ 210 million. The very next day, Vipin Khanna contacted Embraer and demanded his commission,” said an ED officer. ED said in a statement on Wednesday that its probe has established payment of commission by Embraer. It said “the kickbacks were routed by M/s Embraer SA through its subsidiaries to M/s Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd, Singapore in lieu of sham agreement.” “The kickbacks to the tune of around USD 3.275 million were further routed from M/s Interdev Aviation Services to M/s KRBL DMCC, Dubai (a 100% owned subsidiary of KRBL Ltd) in lieu of sham agreement to finally reach India through M/s KRBL Ltd projecting the same as untainted money. Further, investigation revealed that Anoop Kumar Gupta, Director of KRBL Limited, signed the sham agreement held between Interdev Aviation Services and KRBL DMCC (Dubai) to receive Proceeds of Crime (PoC) which were finally received in the bank account of KRBL Ltd in which he is one of the directors,” ED statement said. The agency has, so far, attached immovable properties worth Rs 16.29 crore belonging to KRBL in the case. “At the outset we would like to state that the allegations leveled by the Enforcement Directorate are false, frivolous and baseless. KRBL Ltd has not entered into any sham agreement with any entity. We have been cooperating with the entire investigation by the Enforcement Directorate for the last 3 years and have given all documents asked by the Enforcement Directorate, none of which in any way cement the allegations advanced by the Enforcement Directorate. The prosecution complaint has been filed by the Enforcement Directorate, only with the sole intention of attempting to justify its illegal attachment orders, wherein they have failed to take possession of the property due to the interference of both the Hon’ble Appellate Tribunal and the Hon’ble High Court. KRBL shall defend such actions of the Enforcement Directorate as it has done before and shall succeed in due course,” the KRBL statement said.Email queries sent to Embraer were not answered. Interdev’s representatives and Khanna could not be located.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-charge-sheet-over-kickbacks-in-upa-era-embraer-aircraft-deal/story-cuV7DTUlnAVu5QvCvJrAbO.html

09-12-2020||India||Opposition leaders meet President, seek repeal of farm laws||A delegation of opposition parties on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind to seek repeal of the three new farm laws enacted in September this year, alleging that the government had “insulted” the farmers by getting these passed in Parliament in an “undemocratic” manner without any discussion and consultations. The meeting came a day after the Bharat bandh called by various farmers’ unions in protest against these laws. Thousands of farmers are currently agitating on various borders of Delhi. The five-member delegation of opposition leaders included former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India general secretary D Raja and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader TKS Elangovan. The opposition delegation was limited to five because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. “We urge upon you, as the custodian of the Indian Constitution, to persuade your government not to be obdurate and accept the demands raised by India’s annadatas,” the opposition leaders said in a memorandum submitted to the President. “The new agri-laws, passed in Parliament in an anti-democratic manner preventing a structured discussion and voting, threaten India’s food security, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers, lay the basis for the abolishment of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multi-national agri-business corporates and domestic corporate,” it added. The memorandum further said over 20 different political parties, including those running state governments, have extended their solidarity with the farmers over their ongoing struggle and also supported their ‘Bharat bandh’ call on December 8, demanding the repeal of the agri-laws and the electricity amendment bill. “We met the President and informed him of our views regarding the three farm laws. We have asked for their repeal. We informed him that it is critical that they are taken back,” Gandhi told reporters after the meeting. “The way the farm laws were passed in Parliament, we feel it was an insult to farmers and that is why they are protesting in the cold weather against them. They will not relent and will continue their peaceful agitation till the laws are taken back,” he said. The former Congress chief claimed that the new laws were aimed at handing over the farm sector to the “friends” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “But the farmers are fearless and will not back off. They have lost faith in the government,” he added. Pawar said various political parties have requested the President that these farm laws should be repealed as they were not discussed with either stakeholders or in the select committee of Parliament. “Not a single suggestion offered by opposition leaders in Parliament was accepted by the government and all these bills were passed in haste,” he said. “In this cold, the farmers are on streets protesting peacefully, expressing their unhappiness. It is the duty of the government to resolve this issue,” Pawar added. The NCP chief said the MSP has not been mentioned in the new farm laws and that is why the farmers are disturbed. His views were echoed by Yechury. “We told President that the three farm laws were passed undemocratically in Parliament and have sought the repeal of these laws,” he said. The CPI (M) leader said the government should repeal the acts in view of the widespread protests by farmers. “The Prime Minister has been saying that these laws are in the interest of farmers, but the question is if these laws in their favour then why are they protesting out in the cold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-leaders-meet-president-seek-repeal-of-farm-laws/story-Mtjcn8XS59ZvG5EjftGHnI.html

Calling it an “anti-farmer” laws, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi slammed the Centre for passing the laws without consulting with the opposition parties and the farmers. Gandhi pointed out that the way the bills were passed is an “insult to farmers” who are out on the streets, protesting in cold weather.“The manner in which these three bills were passed, without any discussion, without any conversation with the opposition parties and certainly without a discussion with the farmers of this country, who have built India, is an insult to the kisans (farmers) of this country,” Gandhi said. The Congress leader was addressing the media after his meeting with the President over the farm laws.The delegation leaders said that they have urged the President to take back the laws. Gandhi said that the farmer no longer believes in the government’s intention. “The kisan (farmer) has lost faith in the government. The kisan does not believe that the government is acting in their interest and that is why lakhs of them are on the streets, non-violently and compassionately. They are struggling in cold weather with complete respect. So, we have informed the President that it is absolutely critical that these bills are taken back,” he added.Also read | Farmer leaders reject govt proposal, call for nationwide protest on Dec 14, to block Delhi-Jaipur highway on Dec 12The five-member delegation of opposition leaders that met the President on Wednesday also included CPI general secretary D Raja and DMK leader TKS Elangovan.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi alleged that the true agenda of the three farm laws is to “handover India’s agriculture system to PM’s friends”. “Our prime minister said that these bills are for the benefit of our farmer, if that’s true, then why are they (farmers) on the streets? Why is the farmer so angry? Because the true agenda of the three farm bills is to handover India’s agriculture system to prime minister’s friends, and the kisan is very well aware of this,” the former Congress chief said. “Nobody can stand in front of a farmer’s strength. The government should have no misunderstanding that the farmers will move, will get scared because India’s farmers will not move until these bills are taken back,” he added.Earlier today, the farmer unions rejected the proposal sent by the Centre to end the protests over the agri laws and said that they will block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway by December 12 and hold demonstrations protesting the farm laws in several parts of the country on December 14.Rahul Gandhi urged the farmers to not be afraid and assured complete support of opposition parties. “Government should have no misconception. Our farmers will not compromise because they know that if they compromise today, then they will have no future in the country. And I am telling this to our farmers, that if you do not stand up today, then you will be silenced forever, and we are standing with you. You are Hindustan,” the Congress leader said at the end of press conference.

Though the highly infectious disease caused by the bacteria called ‘Bacilhus anthracis’ had earlier been detected in cattle in the state, this is likely to be the first confirmed case of Anthrax in wild elephants in Assam. Forest officials had found the carcass of a sub-adult female aged nearly 10 years in the Soraipung range of the forest on December 3. Two days later, carcass of another female elephant aged around 18-20 years was found few hundred metres away from the spot where the first carcass was found. Both elephants are believed to be from the same herd. Usually, carcasses of wild elephants are buried, but since forest officials suspected the deaths to be due to Anthrax, the two elephants were cremated using safety measures. “We had conducted autopsy on both the elephants along with veterinarians from the state forest department. The lab result of the autopsy of the first elephant has tested positive for Anthrax,” said Khanin Changmai, a veterinarian with the WTI. ‘We are still waiting for result of the autopsy of the second elephant. Though there have been cases of Anthrax infection in livestock, this could be the first case of the disease in wild elephants in Assam,” he added. Senior forest officials did not respond to calls on what measures have been taken following detection of Anthrax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carcass-of-wild-elephant-in-assam-tests-positive-for-anthrax/story-2ijwbTyW5IJc2m8CKqtiRM.html

FCI buys food grains from farmers and stores them in silos built through a public-private partnership. While private players are paid a fee for building and storing the food grains, the ownership of the commodity as well as its marketing and distribution rights, belong to FCI. FCI, it said, controls the procurement and movement of food grains for the Public Distribution System (PDS).The statement came as farmer groups in their agitation against the three farm reforms bills that among other things give farmers the freedom to sell their produce to anyone, alleged that the legislations were brought to favour Ambani and Adani.Some farm groups have alleged that the Adani group is building grain storage facilities for hoarding food grains and selling them at a higher price later.“We do not own any food grains procured from farmers, and are in no way connected to the pricing of grains,” it said.Adani Group said it is in the business of developing and operating grain silos for FCI since 2005. It sets up storage infrastructure after winning competitive and transparent tender by the Government of India.Private rail lines that it built as part of these tenders are to facilitate the movement of grains from silo units to their distribution centres across India, the statement said.FCI, it said, awarded such contracts with a view to modernising the storage and transport infrastructure in the country so that food grains could be safely stored and quality stuff is supplied to the PDS system.“Using ongoing issues for mudslinging is a clear attempt to not only tarnish the reputation of a responsible corporate but also misguide public opinion and hurt their sentiment,” Adani Group said. FCI has partnered with private investors to commission high tech silos equipped with latest fumigation and preservation techniques for food grains for two to four years and dispatch it in bulk form through special trains across India. It is estimated that since inception, some of the prominent private food storage facilities have registered an average direct receipt, from farmers, of around 80,000 tonnes per year in the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adani-group-clarifies-it-does-not-buy-food-grains-from-farmers-only-manages-storage-for-fci/story-qp4xcAnFXP9ClqBorRjbWP.html

Specialisation, domain-specific knowledge and skills are key to success and will also determine employability of the youth, who form India’s demographic dividend and an advantage the country shall have into the second half of 21st century, according to Bhattacharyya.Speaking on ‘The Future of Work -- Creating Globally Competitive Skilled Workforce’ the senior MEA official said India was well-positioned in traditional labour markets in the Gulf and Europe.“India’s success story in the Gulf is well-known and there are over 9 million Indian workers and professionals in these countries,” he said. “The leadership in the Gulf has acknowledged their contribution to the development of the region and Indians are the preferred option for Gulf countries.” Noting that India’s share in the European labour market has also shown positive signs, Bhattacharyya said a recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation (OECD) study revealed that of the 12 crore migrants living in OECD countries, 30-35 per cent were highly-educated with academic and vocational training.India was ranked at the top with more than 3 lakh highly-educated Indians in the OECD countries, which is reflective of the skilled and trained workforce that India possesses, he said.Bhattacharyya said the signing of the India-EU Declaration of Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility in 2016 affirmed the shared objectives of better organising and promoting regular migration at all levels, maximising the development impact of migration and mobility for mutual benefit.“We are also working to provide enabling frameworks through Migration and Mobility Partnerships. While the agreement has been concluded with France, agreements with Portugal, Germany, Benelux, UK and Japan (outside EU) are in the pipeline,” he said, adding that several other countries were also interested in such agreements.“India stands ready to improve the presence of highly skilled workers and professionals through mutually beneficial arrangements with Europe, the US and Japan,” Bhattacharyya said.“India is well-positioned geo-economically and geo-politically to create and provide globally skilled workforce due to our competitive advantage, the English language, and strong core skills in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects,” he said.Strengthening English and other business language programmes like German, Spanish, French or Japanese will ensure greater mobility, employability and readiness to join the global workforce, he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-well-positioned-to-provide-globally-skilled-workforce-mea-official/story-et03dz4Hsea7nCY8H840aJ.html

So I embarked on my new journey. I remember how after much struggle, when things were not working, my mother asked me to come back and I was like, ‘Mummy fail toh ho jaane do theek se…varna malal rahega…’ But thankfully, I was able to get work, and the rest is history.”The singer feels that as he is known as a composer - singer, very few songs of other composers come to him to sing. “I’m a born music lover and want to sing for all music composers as well but due to some false impression many makers feel that I prefer to make my own music and sing, though I’m equally comfortable in both. At the end of the day, it is good music that matters to me, so I’m open to offers,” said, the ‘Dil Darbadar’ singer (from the blockbuster ‘PK’).Ankit s worked tirelessly in the last few months on the music of various music albums, films including ‘Ek Villan 2’ and singles, “Besides, I’ll also be seen on TV next year for Indian Pro Music League, a fun musical show where I’ll be captain of Team Uttar Pradesh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-want-to-sing-for-all-music-composers-says-ankit-tiwari/story-qjdxKuGvEklWj74rbMQcSL.html

Anything can be termed as not being proper,” the bench said, adding that it appeared to be a “bogus matter”.“Without doing any homework this petition has been filed. No details have been given. It appears that this is a publicity interest litigation. It is not a public interest litigation (PIL) at all,” the bench said and directed that the cost of Rs 20,000 be deposited within four weeks in favour of the Delhi Legal Services Authority.The court said the amount would be used for access to justice programmes.The plea was filed by the Anti-Corruption Council of India Trust, through advocate Ashok Kumar Singh, claiming that according to news reports several schools are allegedly collecting fees under various components, other than tuition fees, and are denying access to online classes to those students who are unable to pay the amounts demanded.It contended that such actions are in violation of the Delhi government’s directions to schools not to charge anything more than tuition fees during the prevailing pandemic when schools are closed.It had claimed that according to the Delhi Parents Association there are 76 private schools which are in violation of the Delhi government direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-junks-pil-claiming-overcharging-of-fees-by-private-schools-imposes-rs-20k-in-cost/story-CMJWbumPfF6ytB60PEkjOK.html

The five-member delegation of opposition leaders included Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D Raja and DMK leader TKS Elangovan. The opposition leaders submitted a memorandum to the President that said, “We urge upon you, as the custodian of the Indian Constitution, to persuade your government not to be obdurate and accept the demands raised by India’s annadatas.” The memorandum also said, “The new agri-laws, passed in Parliament in an anti-democratic manner preventing a structured discussion and voting, threaten India’s food security, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers, lay the basis for the abolishment of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multi-national agri-business corporates and domestic corporates.” The memorandum to President further said that more than 20 different political parties, including many parties running state governments, have extended their solidarity with the ongoing historic struggle of the Indian peasantry and extended wholehearted support to their call for a Bharat Bandh on December 8, demanding the repeal of the retrograde agri-laws and the Electricity Amendment Bill.“We met President and informed him of our view regarding the three farm laws. We have asked for their repeal. We informed the President that it is critical that they are taken back,” Gandhi told reporters after meeting President. He said the way the farm laws were passed in Parliament, “we feel it was an insult to farmers and that is why they are protesting in the cold weather against them”.“The farmers will not relent and will continue their protests till the laws and taken back,” he said. The former Congress chief said the new laws appeared aimed at handing over the farming sector to the “friends of the prime minister”, but the farmers are fearless and would not back off and will continue with their peaceful agitation.NCP leader Pawar said various political parties have requested President that these farm laws should be repealed as they were not discussed with either stakeholders or in the Select Committee of Parliament.

He said the MSP has not been mentioned in the new farm laws and that is why the farmers are disturbed. Yechury said, “We told President that the three farm laws were passed undemocratically in Parliament and have sought the repeal of these laws.” He said the government should repeal the acts in view of the widespread protests by farmers. The opposition leaders said the prime ministers have been saying that these laws are in the interest of farmers, but the question is if these laws in their favour then why the farmers are protesting out in the cold. The opposition delegation was limited to five because of the Covid-19 situation. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-delegation-meets-president-seeks-repeal-of-farm-laws/story-oItMgz4ChjpBxqhFpNoCSL.html

Further, YouTube is a service run by foreign agencies that may change its terms and conditions at any time and may cease to operate at any moment. In such an event, AIR will have no means to keep records of its broadcast materials intact, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-asks-prasar-bharati-to-treat-as-representation-plea-seeking-to-resume-all-air-units/story-43L1IKKXCBCkNsAdb3F6ZO.html

Hence, the impugned order is bad in law as well as on facts and deserves to be quashed, it added.“The CIC failed to consider that the SPG was raised in 1985 with the intention to provide proximate security cover to the Prime Minister, former Prime Ministers and their immediate family members. It was only after the assassination of former Prime Minister Late Indira Gandhi by her own bodyguards in 1984, the need for a specialised and dedicated force arose,” the plea said.“The SPG has strict protocols concerning the security of the Prime Minister and even the details regarding the name and number of SPG personnel engaged in the personal security of the Prime Minister of India are not brought into the public domain as unfortunately there have been assassinations of two previous Prime Ministers,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-s-entourage-can-t-be-brought-into-public-domain-iaf-challenges-cic-order/story-cH2HKWcQg4SZyk6mInZPdI.html

Bhattacharjee, one of the senior leaders of the CPI(M), has been suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for more than a decade. Bhattacharjee’s wife, daughter and several leaders of the CPI(M) were present at the hospital. In September last year, the CPI(M) leader was admitted in the same hospital after he complained of an acute breathing problem. His blood pressure was found to be quite low and his oxygen concentration had also deteriorated. Bhattacharjee, however, recovered in a few days. The hospital authorities said Bhattacharya tested negative for Covid-19 when a rapid test was done. A four-member panel of doctors has been formed for his treatment. Bhattacharjee will undergo several tests, including a CT scan.

09-12-2020||India||Farmer leaders reject govt proposal, call for nationwide protest on Dec 14, to block Delhi-Jaipur highway on Dec 12||The farmer unions on Wednesday rejected the proposal sent by the Centre to end the impasse over farm laws. The farmers protesting near national capital Delhi said that they will block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway by December 12 and hold protest demonstrations in many parts of the country on December 14.The protesters also urged farmers from other states to reach Delhi.“Agra-Delhi Expressway will be blocked on December 12; no tax to be paid on that day at any toll plaza in country,” farmer leader Darshan Pal said.“We will block all roads in Delhi one by one if the three farm laws are not scrapped,” the farmer leaders present at the Singhu border (on the Haryana side) near Delhi said. They also said that no decision has been taken on next round of talks with central government.The protest against the farm laws has been going on since November 26. On Tuesday, the farmers unions had enforced a Bharat Bandh (nationwide strike) from 11 am to 3 pm, which was peaceful. The central government has held five rounds of talks with the farmer leaders, but no breakthrough has been achieved.Union home minister Amit Shah had called the farmer leaders on Tuesday evening for informal negotiations, and informed them that a list of proposal will be shared with them. That list, with seven proposed amendments, was handed over to the leaders of 13 farm unions on Wednesday.The leaders held discussions and rejected the proposal on Wednesday. “There is nothing new in government proposal; we will continue our protest against three agri-marketing laws,” farmer leader Prahalad Singh Bharukheda said.In the proposal, the government had agreed to give a written assurance on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP), one of the main concerns raised by the protesters. It had also tried to allay their fears over mandis (marketplace) and taking over of farmlands by big corporates. But the farmers are firm with their demand that the farm laws should be repealed.Meanwhile, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reached home minister Amit Shah’s residence on Wednesday evening for discussions.The farmers are protesting against three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reject-govt-proposal-will-block-delhi-jaipur-highway-on-dec-12-farmer-leaders/story-42av5yEJggVp4Y7S9EMU5M.html

The demonstrators condemned the new farms laws and shouted “J P Nadda murdabad, BJP murdabad” (down with J P Nadda, down with the BJP). The agitators were not carrying flags of any political party.It was a snap demonstration that caught the police and BJP workers by surprise. The demonstrators climbed on the cars parked outside the office and raised slogans. This is the first time any BJP leader in Bengal faced a demonstration on the farm law issue. The demonstration started when Nadda was leaving the BJP office for the city’s Bhawanipore area to take part in an outreach programme. “We are with the farmers,” the agitators shouted. BJP workers rushed out and got into verbal exchange with the demonstrators. Stones were also thrown from both sides. The demonstrators dispersed on their own in 20 minutes. No police officer or BJP leader commented on the incident till 3.45 pm . The Bengal BJP lodged a complaint at Hastings police station in Kolkata. Nadda arrived in the city around 1 pm as his plane from Delhi took off late due to delay in flight operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-boss-jp-nadda-shown-black-flags-in-kolkata-agitators-condemn-farm-laws/story-SY95ixXPBSm6FSWD6g27QI.html

Those named in the charge sheet under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) are M/s Embraer SA, Brazil; Singapore based firm - M/s Interdev Aviation Services Pte. Ltd, owner of a Basmati rice exporting firm - Anoop Kumar Gupta (Director of KRBL Limited), his nephew Anurag Potdar and others. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case in October 2016 against unknown officials of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), Embraer, NRI arms dealer Vipin Khanna and unknown persons on the basis of which ED had initiated its money laundering probe in the case. Also read | ICICI bank fraud: Drivers, gardeners were directors in Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot’s companies, says EDIt was alleged that Khanna had received USD5.6 million – as kickbacks– from the Sao Paulo-based firm to influence the ministry of defence (MoD) and DRDO officials for the contract to supply three fully modified EMB-145 aircraft to Government of India as a platform for the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) Project. In the first week of September 2016, Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported that Embraer was under investigation by the US justice department since 2010 over a contract with the Dominican Republic. According to a statement issued by ED on Wednesday, its investigation has revealed that Embraer SA obtained the contract for supply of aircraft to Indian Air Force (IAF) after paying commission of USD5.76 million to a middleman named Vipin Khanna for influencing the said contract in its favour. It said, “the kickbacks were routed by M/s Embraer SA through its subsidiaries to M/s Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd, Singapore in lieu of sham agreement.” “The kickbacks to the tune of around USD3.275 million were further routed from M/s Interdev Aviation Services to M/s KRBL DMCC, Dubai (a 100% owned subsidiary of KRBL Ltd) in lieu of a sham agreement to finally reach India through M/s KRBL Ltd projecting the same as untainted money. Further, investigation revealed that Anoop Kumar Gupta, Director of KRBL Limited, signed the sham agreement held between Interdev Aviation Services and KRBL DMCC to receive Proceeds of Crime (PoC) which were finally received in the bank account of KRBL Ltd in which he is one of the directors,” ED statement said. The agency has, so far, attached immovable properties worth Rs16.29 crore belonging to KRBL in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-charge-sheet-in-upa-era-embraer-defence-deal-says-commission-were-paid-for-contract/story-kcarJiL4Ppm6VGY0gwrjmM.html

It proposal, sent by Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal, also tried to allay their fears about the weakening of the mandi system.The proposal was sent to 13 farmer unions, part of the protest which has been going on since November 26. In total, the government proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues.However, the proposal did not mention anything about the main demand of protesting farmers for the repeal of the laws. The farmers have said that they will hold discussion on the proposal before saying anything.Here are the key points from the government proposal sent to farmers:• On concerns raised by farmers about the scrapping of the MSP regime and shifting of trade to private players, the government said it is ready to give a written assurance that the existing MSP will continue.• On farmers’ fears that mandis would weaken after the new laws, the government said an amendment can be made wherein state governments can register the traders operating outside mandis. States can also impose tax and cess as they used in APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) mandis on them.• On concerns that farmers may be duped as anyone having just a PAN card is allowed to trade outside APMC mandis, the government said to rule out such apprehensions, the state governments can be given the power to register such traders and make rules keeping in mind the local situation of farmers.• On the issue of farmers not getting the right to appeal in civil courts for dispute resolution, the government said it is open to making an amendment to provide for an appeal in civil courts. Currently, the dispute resolution is at SDM level.• On fears that big corporates will take over farmlands, the government said it has already been made clear in the laws, but still, for clarity, it can be written that no buyer can take loans against farmland nor any such condition will be made to farmers. On attaching farmland under contract farming, the government said the existing provision is clear but still it can be clarified further if required.• On demands to scrap the proposed Electricity Amendment bill 2020, the government said there won’t be any change in the existing system of electricity bill payment for farmers.• On farmers’ demand to scrap the Air Quality Management of NCR Ordinance 2020, under which there is the provision of penalty for stubble burning, the government said it is ready to find an appropriate solution.“The government has tried to address the concerns of farmers with an open heart and with respect for the farming community of the country. The government appeals the Kisan unions to end their agitation,” the government said in the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-send-proposal-to-farmer-unions-list-of-7-amendments-proposed-in-it/story-QUFaCCaH3jHWP8f8qLgGhJ.html

The affidavit was filed this week by the office of Assam state coordinator for NRC in the court of justice Manojit Bhuyan and justice Soumitra Saikia in connection with a petition. According to the affidavit, while verifying details of 10,199 persons on the updated list released in August last year, the NRC office detected 4,795 ineligible persons. These persons included doubtful (D) voters, declared foreigners, persons against whom cases are pending in foreigners’ tribunals and their family members—all categories which were to be excluded from the updated NRC. Similarly, among the 10,199 persons whose details were verified, names of 5,404 persons which should have got included in the NRC didn’t make it to the list.Also read | Beware of BJP’s NRC, NPR agenda, Mamata Banerjee tells coal belt votersIn October this year, the court had asked the NRC state coordinator to file a comprehensive affidavit on how some ineligible persons managed to get included in the final NRC list. The court was hearing a petition by Rahima Begam, a resident of Mukalmua in Nalbari district, who had challenged a 2019 order of a foreigner’s tribunal that had declared her a foreigner. But despite the tribunal’s order, Begam’s name was in the NRC list which aimed to weed out illegal foreigners. The court noted that the present case was of “great importance” and was not a “solitary instance” and stressed that insertions of names of ineligible persons in the NRC list was “against the law”. The updated NRC released in August last year had excluded over 1.9 million of the 33 million persons who had applied to be included in the list that sought to identify genuine Indian citizens in Assam and weed out illegal immigrants. The list, which was an update of a similar list in 1951, was drawn following a Supreme Court order and the exercise was conducted under its supervision. Soon after its release, almost all political parties and organisations in the state denounced the list, stating it included names of ineligible persons and left out many genuine citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-4-800-ineligible-persons-in-assam-nrc-state-coordinator-informs-gauhati-hc/story-atDqhS0P57oDsiHR91WXkJ.html

The farmers have been protesting near Delhi for nearly a fortnight seeking the repeal of three farm laws passed by Parliament. The government and the farmers have held five rounds of talks so far but the impasse is still continuing.The government talked about written assurance on MSP in a proposal sent to 13 agitating farmer unions on Wednesday. The government also said it is ready to provide all necessary clarifications on their concerns about the new farm laws enacted in September.

09-12-2020||India||Rajasthan, Telangana and Arunachal poll results show people prefer BJP: Javadekar||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) performance in the zila parishad elections in Rajasthan, in the local body elections in Telangana and in the gram panchayat elections in Arunachal Pradesh is an indication that the people prefer the party and that there is groundswell of support for reforms in agriculture, said Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday. “Despite the Corona pandemic, global economic crisis and the Opposition’s propaganda against the farm reforms, people everywhere are opting for the BJP,” he said, addressing the media. The party has won 14 of the 21 zila parishads in Rajasthan which is a Congress-ruled state. “The election result is phenomenal for BJP. The people in the rural areas have given a decisive mandate to the BJP defeating the Congress with a huge margin,” Javadekar said.“The margin of wins is also big. In (deputy CM) Sachin Pilot’s Tonk area, the zila parishad election has also been won by the BJP. At least four ministers could not save the zila parishad in their respective areas. This is an indication of what is to come. It shows how voters across India prefer BJP,” Javadekar said. He said since a bulk of the voters who cast their ballot in the zila parishad polls are farmers or those associated with agriculture, it shows people support the farm reforms. “In Rajasthan, a trend has been reversed. There, zila parishad elections used to be won by the party in power; it happened in 2010 when the Congress was in power and in 2015 when the BJP was in power. But this time, the BJP has won,” he said. Referring to the recent gains that the party made in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections where it won 49 seats, up from the previous terms four seats, the minister said there is a pan India preference for the BJP. “It is notable that while the BJP won 49 seats and the TRS 55, it is the BJP that bagged more votes than the TRS,” he said, suggesting the popularity of the party in the southern state.“Even in Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP has got success. Out of the 240 seats in the zila panchayat, it won 96 unopposed. Of the 8,291 gram panchayats seats, the BJP won 5,410 seats unopposed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-telangana-and-arunachal-poll-results-show-people-prefer-bjp-javadekar/story-qTcrbMkgDWf15DXtsFL0OM.html
09-12-2020||India||Nine states implement ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ system: Finance ministry||As many as nine states have completed One Nation One Ration Card reform following which the central government has allowed them to raise an additional Rs 23,523 crore, said an official release on Wednesday. The states which have successfully completed the Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms are Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is the biggest beneficiary with an additional borrowing window of Rs 4,851 crore, followed by Karnataka Rs 4,509 crore and Gujarat Rs 4,352 crore. Department of Food and Public Distribution in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution is the Nodal Department to certify that a State has met the conditions stipulated for this reform, the Finance Ministry statement said. Further, to become eligible for additional borrowing, the States have to complete the reforms by December 31, 2020, it said, adding, it is expected that many more states will complete this reform before the stipulated date. In addition to the One Nation One Ration Card, it said, other reforms specified as a precondition to avail additional borrowing are : ease of doing business reform, urban local body/utility reforms and power sector reforms. In view of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic for mobilisation of financial resources, the Indian government has strengthened the hands of the States through multiple measures including grant of additional borrowing permission of 2 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) during 2020-21. This has enabled the States to mobilise additional financial resources to fight the pandemic and maintain the standards of service delivery to the public, it said. However, it said, to ensure long-term debt sustainability and prevent any adverse impact on future, a part of the additional borrowing was linked to the States carrying out reforms in the sectors critical for service delivery to the citizens. One of the sectors identified for reforms is the Public Distribution System, it said, adding, out of the additional borrowing limit of 2 per cent of GSDP, 0.25 per cent is linked to implementation of “One Nation One Ration Card system”. This was aimed to ensure that the beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other welfare schemes, especially the migrant workers and their families, get ration from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) across the country. Other aims of the intended reform were to better target beneficiaries, elimination of bogus/duplicate/ ineligible ration cards and thus enhance welfare and reduce leakage, it said. For this, it said, the reform conditions stipulated Aadhar Seeding of all Ration Cards, biometric authentification of beneficiaries and automation of all the Fair Price Shops (FPS) in the State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-states-implement-one-nation-one-ration-card-system-finance-ministry/story-sg9U175eMS7kxyfLy4IUQJ.html

Local officials have also conducted a large number of RT-PCR tests on school teachers and non-teaching staff before reopening schools,” Gaikwad said.At least three lakh students from classes 9 to 12 have been attending schools in 25 districts of the state since November 23, the minister said, adding that the figure has increased to five lakh as per a review taken last week.As of Tuesday, Maharashtra overall Covid-19 caseload stood at 18,59,367, including 47,827 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-to-reopen-for-classes-5-to-8-after-health-dept-gives-nod-maharashtra/story-YUa3f3DGXE8eSpWvwrfThK.html
09-12-2020||India||Indian-origin scientist’s rapid test can detect Covid-19 in less than 5 minutes||A team led by an Indian-origin scientist has developed a rapid, ultrasensitive Covid-19 test using a paper-based electrochemical sensor that can detect the presence of the novel coronavirus in less than five minutes. The researchers from the University of Illinois in the US created a graphene-based electrochemical biosensor with an electrical read-out setup to selectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. According to the research published in the journal ACS Nano, there are two components to this biosensor: a platform to measure an electrical read-out and probes to detect the presence of viral RNA. To create the platform, the researchers led by professor Dipanjan Pan first coated filter paper with a layer of graphene nanoplatelets to create a conductive film. They then placed a gold electrode with a predefined design on top of the graphene as a contact pad for electrical readout.Both gold and graphene have high sensitivity and conductivity which makes this platform ultrasensitive to detect changes in electrical signals, the researchers noted.“Graphene exhibits unique mechanical and electrochemical properties that make it ideal for the development of sensitive electrochemical sensors,” said Maha Alafeef, a graduate student at the University of Illinois Grainger College of Engineering.Current RNA-based Covid-19 tests screen for the presence of the N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they said.In the new research, the team designed antisense oligonucleotide (ASOs) probes to target two regions of the N-gene.Targeting two regions ensures the reliability of the sensor in case one region undergoes gene mutation, according to the researchers.The gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are capped with these single-stranded nucleic acids (ssDNA), which represents an ultra-sensitive sensing probe for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.The team tested the performance of this sensor by using Covid-19 positive and negative samples.The sensor showed a significant increase in the voltage of positive samples compared to the negative ones and confirmed the presence of viral genetic material in less than five minutes.The sensor was able to differentiate viral RNA loads in these samples. Viral load is an important quantitative indicator of the progress of infection and a challenge to measure using existing diagnostic methods.The researchers noted that this platform has far-reaching applications due to its portability and low cost.The sensor, when integrated with microcontrollers and LED screens or with a smartphone via Bluetooth or wifi, could be used at the point-of-care in a doctor’s office or even at home, they said.Beyond Covid-19, the research team also foresees the system to be adaptable for the detection of many different diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-origin-scientist-s-rapid-test-can-detect-covid-19-in-less-than-5-minutes/story-cuuvRP9bgMxUeUpJALRuPM.html

Back in 2018 a team of three specialists were dispatched from “Opificio delle Pietre Dure e Laboratori di Restauro di Firenze” (A restoration laboratory in Florence, Italy), who studied the artefacts from May 27 to June 3, 2018 had sounded the alarm and urged that the casket must be attended to with top priority or else, it would fall apart within the next 10 years.“The ASI Chemical Branch from Aurangabad, who are specialists in conservation, have taken the initiative under the mandate from ASI Dehradun to commence the work to conserve and restore the Mastrillian Casket. The negotiations began long back, ever since ASI Delhi ordered that the treatment be done by their specialists in India. The work will be done at the Basilica itself under strict security and will commence from December 10,” Fr Patricio Fernandes, the Rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, said. The silver casket dates back to 1624 when, for the first time the mortal remains of the saint were taken away from public view and ensconced in a silver casket and kept atop a specially constructed mausoleum within the Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa. Fr Marcello Mastrilli, an Italian Jesuit priest who was miraculously revived from near death on two occasions, and who believed it was through St Francis Xavier he was saved, had commissioned the work on the silver casket as a thanksgiving to the saint in 1633. Fr Mastrilli, however, did not live to see the casket being completed after he was killed in Nagasaki in Japan barely months prior to it being readied.The mortal remains of Francis Xavier in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa draws tourists and devotees from around the world. Once in a decade the relics are lowered from the high altar at the mausoleum and placed in a glass casket for viewing as part of an exposition. Church authorities had earlier insisted that the restoration be done by experts from Italy, who had offered to do the restoration for free, but the Archaeological Survey of India declined permission, instead saying that they would do it themselves with the help of in-house experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asi-to-begin-restoration-of-st-francis-xavier-s-400-year-old-casket-in-goa/story-gRCBD5kSylvDpYIqITVgCK.html
09-12-2020||India||Pwc India’s study finds India leads in AI adoption during Covid-19||The pandemic that hit the world a year ago crippling the lives of both individuals as well as organisations, has created a winner -- high technology adoption across the globe, with Indian organisations leading such upgrades.According to a global study by PwC India, the highest increase in use of artificial intelligence (AI) during Covid-19 times has been witnessed in India.The study also showed that 94 per cent of the over 200 chief executives in India surveyed said they’ve either adopted or are planning to implement AI in their companies. While the survey for India was conducted between August and September, globally it was conducted among 670 high ranking officials in September-October. The study said India witnessed the highest increase in AI use compared to major economies like Britain, Japan and the US, with over 70 per cent of Indian organisations having implemented AI in some functional areas in 2020 as compared to around 62 per cent last year. Also, over 90 per cent companies are implementing or planning to invest in AI solutions to address current business concerns, the survey said.According to the survey, AI adoption in India was led by the travel and hospitality sector with 89 per cent of the surveyed firms doing so, followed by telecom, media & technology firms (86 per cent), financial services (82 per cent), and 73 per cent of healthcare and pharma companies adopting it during the year.AI is deployed across business functions like customer service, finance and tax, HR, IT and cyber security, manufacturing and operations, R&D, risk, legal and compliance, sales and marketing, supply chain and logistics, among others.The survey also shows that optimism with regard to AI in reducing cost and maximising revenue has gone up significantly from 72 per cent to 92 per cent in India , and 45 per cent of organisations have increased the use of AI since the pandemic hit them.Further, 94 per cent of the respondents have either implemented or are planning to implement AI in their organisations. AI is now regarded as a key enabler for organisations to emerge from the present crisis, plan for transformation and making fundamental changes to the operating model for lasting competitive advantage, said Sudipta Ghosh, a partner and leader for data and analytics at PwC India. To get the best out of AI, businesses need to start viewing it as a necessity rather than a luxury and weave it into the organisational fabric, he added.However, companies also find adopting AI difficult and fail to realise the optimum value from their AI investments. For instance, 37 per cent of them find it challenging to identify the right use cases for AI and 28 per cent lack high-quality data for use in AI solutions, the survey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pwc-india-s-study-finds-india-leads-in-ai-adoption-during-covid-19/story-2kUMXmBBDbvLnFKOdkFJ1K.html

To bring down cases of neonatal mortality and mortality below 5 years of age, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, starting within the first hour of birth is recommended,” said Dr Devajit Sarma, paediatric and neonatal care specialist at SCH. “In India, there are many cases of newborns not getting enough milk in the first few days as the mother could be sick, have some infectious disease or not produce enough milk. The human milk bank will be the best option for such babies,” he added. In India, the practice of wet-nursing (breastfeeding by someone in the family or an acquaintance) exists. But doctors say such practice has drawbacks, for instance, the breastfeeding woman may have some infection that could then be transmitted to the baby. “The best option for babies in such case is pasteurised donor milk, stored in a milk bank. In the milk bank, we will collect milk from lactating women who are willing to donate. It will then be pasteurised and stored in deep freeze. The milk can be stored from 6 months to 6 years,” said Dr Sarma. “We have over 100 deliveries in our hospital per month and can collect milk from some of those mothers. We will also encourage other lactating mothers to donate to the bank. In coming days, we might even include some incentives for the donors,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-s-first-human-milk-bank-opens-in-guwahati/story-ceLqbxzHJFdVcO0EE64uzM.html

India-China ties have been “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of agreements on maintaining peace and tranquillity on the LAC, and extensive contacts at different levels between the two sides have so far failed to address the basic issue that “agreements are not being observed”, he said in an online conversation with the Australian think tank Lowy Institute. With the India-China border standoff in its eighth month, Jaishankar said, “We are today probably at the most difficult phase of our relationship with China, certainly in the last 30 to 40 years...or even more.” Noting that the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the clash at Galwan Valley on June 15 were the first military casualties on the LAC since 1975, Jaishankar said the relationship has been “very significantly damaged” because all positive developments in the past 30 years – including China becoming India’s second largest trade partner and engagements in tourism and travel – were based on the fact that the two sides had agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity in border areas while trying to solve the boundary question. Also read | West has policy to engage India in ‘anti-China games’, says Russian foreign minister LavrovPointing to multiple agreements signed since 1993 that committed both parties not to bring large forces to the LAC, he said, “Now for some reason, for which the Chinese have to date given us five differing explanations, the Chinese have violated it. “The Chinese have literally brought tens of thousands of soldiers in full military preparation mode right to the LAC in Ladakh. Naturally the relationship would be profoundly disturbed by this.” Jaishankar didn’t go into the details of the five explanations offered by the Chinese side. While there were arguments and face-offs between troops in the past, there had never been a major breach of understanding, he said. With soldiers of the two sides very close to each other this year, it was “not entirely surprising that something went horribly wrong”, he said in a reference to the Galwan Valley clash that resulted in 20 Indian casualties and “completely changed national sentiment”. Getting the relationship back on track is now a “very big issue”, though communications between the two sides aren’t an issue, Jaishankar said. He had personally spoken on phone with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and met him on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow, while there were also meetings and contacts between the defence ministers, military commanders and diplomats. “Communication is not the issue, the issue is the fact that we have agreements and those agreements are not being observed,” he added. Jaishankar said China had, since 2008-09, evolved into a “very much more nationalistic” country, and this was being expressed “down the line in a variety of ways and in policies”. All of this was happening at a time when the global order is witnessed the creation of a new architecture and new norms and regimes because of rebalancing and multi-polarity, he added. Responding to a question on India’s relations with the US under president-elect Joe Biden, Jaishankar said the former vice president had made a “big contribution” to bilateral ties while in the Senate foreign relations committee and his “goodwill for India is very manifest”. Deep convergences in many areas have brought India and the US closer since the time of former president Bill Clinton’s administration, and Washington now realises New Delhi’s more prominent role in a multi-polar world as it needs more partners while going beyond the traditional system of alliances, he said. Jaishankar expressed satisfaction at the rapid expansion of ties between India and Australia in the past 18 months, saying the two “cricket-playing Commonwealth democracies” can contribute to shaping the emerging global order. The two countries are expanding an existing trilateral with Japan and looking at shaping new ones with Indonesia and France, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-given-five-differing-explanations-for-troop-build-up-on-lac-says-jaishankar/story-4cb08AoFdVQg9PAJXlrNFI.html

09-12-2020||India||What Covid-19? Life is all normal in Lakshadweep||The world may be in the grip of Covid-19 pandemic, disrupting daily schedules and robbing many of their weekend getaways, but life seems to be normal in the small Lakshadweep islands, which is yet to record the first positive case of coronavirus.No masks, no sanitisers, and many rules of Covid-19 are not in place and every human activity, including marriages and public gatherings continue, thanks to strict Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that bars easy entry of people to the island in the Arabian sea.According to P P Mohammed Faizal, who represents the islands in the Lok Sabha, Lakshadweep has staved off the Covid-19 pandemic since its outbreak earlier this year, reporting zero cases as of December 8.“So far not a single case of coronavirus has been reported from Lakshadweep because of the exemplary precautionary measures we have taken”, Faizal told PTI.Gaining entry to the 36 sq km island comes with its set of strict measures. Whether it is a common man, officials or people’s representatives-- they will have to fulfill the measures including a mandatory seven-day quarantine at Kochi, the only point from where transportation via ships and helicopters to the Union Territory is allowed.Faizal said no Covid-19 restrictions have been imposed on the people in the islands.“No masks, no sanitisers because it is a green area.Lakshadweep is the only place where the schools are open and classes are being conducted. From September 21 onwards, the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi )has allowed to open the schools.” “It is like normal. All the functions, including religious ones and others like marriages are being held as usual. Everything is normal here”, the two-time MP said.The smallest UT in the country, Lakshadweep is an archipelago consisting of 36 islands with an area of 32 sq km. All the islands are 220 to 440 km away from the coastal city of Kochi in Kerala. According to Census 2011, it has a population of 64,000.Faizal said the moment Kerala reported the first case of Covid-19, also the country’s first, in January, the local administration mounted a strict vigil.The first concern was to stop the arrival of tourists-- both international and domestic.“In the month of March 2019, we stopped it”, the MP said.The administration then stopped the entry permit to each of the islands from the mainland and allowed access only to capital Kavaratti from Kochi with the approval of the administrator, officials said.By curtailing the issuance of entry permit, the administration could control the inflow of non-islanders to Lakshadweep, they added.For the entry of islanders who work in other parts of the county and abroad, officials deployed in Lakshadweep and those who travel to mainland for treatment purpose, a standard operating procedure was formulated. Accordingly, those who want to come to Lakshadweep will have to undergo seven days institutional quarantine in Kochi, with the administration bearing the cost involved in it.To ensure proper testing of samples of islanders quarantined in Kochi, the administration has provided a testing machine to the Kalamassery Government Medical College.“Those who tested negative will be allowed to come to Lakshadweep. Once they reach their particular island, again they have to be home quarantined for a week. That has been strictly monitored by medical and police departments,” Faizal said.The Parliamentarian said he has travelled thrice to Delhi during the pandemic period and followed all the sets of laid down rules before returning to the islands, including getting quarantined for seven days in Kochi.“After testing negative, I come back to Lakshadweep where I undergo one (more) week of quarantine at my house,” said Faizal, who attended the monsoon session of Parliament and two official meetings in Delhi during the period.He said many cases of coronavirus were reported when they were quarantined in Kochi.“Those infected people will be shifted to the administration’s special facility in Kochi where they will have to stay for 10 days,” he said.After 10 days they will be tested again.“If they test negative they will have to spend 14 more days in the administration’s facility and taken to the island only after conducting one more test”, he said.A Kerala Health department official said those outsiders who test positive for the virus in the state will be included in its list of cases but the states they belong will be mentioned along with it.Fazial further lauded the steps taken by late administrator of Lakshadweep, Dineshwar Sharma, for being instrumental in making Lakshadweep green.“He was so particular to make our island green in all the ways possible. He has gone the extra mile for this and he was such a nice person”, Faizal said.Sharma died at a Chennai hospital on December 4 following severe lung disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-covid-19-life-is-all-normal-in-lakshadweep/story-KQv7CFsG2ePoxAsPVYsnfJ.html

According to reports, Sarania and two of his supporters were detained over allegations of distributing money among voters ahead of the second and final phase of polling on Thursday to the council which administers four districts. “There are allegations of violation of the model code of conduct by the MP. Police have also recovered some cash from his possession. He was released on bail on Wednesday,” Rakesh Raushan, superintendent of police, Kokrajhar, said. A case has been registered against the 51-year-old MP under section 171C of IPC on charge of undue influence at election. “These are false charges. Along with some associates, I had gone to a party worker’s house at Jaregaon in Salekati, after campaigning ended on Tuesday, to have dinner and discuss poll strategy. But some young men arrived there and started attacking our candidate from the area,” Sarania said on Wednesday. “My security guards tried to chase them away... I was first taken to Salekati police station and then to Kokrajhar. I immediately informed the deputy commissioner of the district about what happened. We have secured bail and are ready to face any probe,” he added. A former United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) rebel-turned-politician, Sarania had won the Lok Sabha polls as an Independent candidate from Kokrajhar in 2014 and 2019. Recently, he floated a party called Gana Surakha Party which is contesting 35 of the 40 seats in BTC. Voting for the first phase of BTC polls took place on Monday in 21 seats in Baksa and Udalguri districts.

09-12-2020||India||Farmers harden stance, say ‘if government is stubborn, so are we’||As the Centre on Wednesday sent a new proposal, including the assurance of minimum support price, change in the APMC act, tax on private players etc., the protesting farmers hardened their stance and said if the government is stubborn to not withdraw the laws, then the farmers are stubborn too to carry on with their protests. “Farmers won’t go back. It’s a matter of their respect. Will government now withdraw laws? Will there be tyranny? If the government is stubborn, then so are farmers. Laws have to be withdrawn,” Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, indicating no thaw in the ongoing stalemate, which has laid siege to the Capital.The farmers’ protests against the three farm laws that they fear would corporatise farming have entered the 14th day on Wednesday, as all the attempts to come to an understanding so far have failed. The farmers now demand a complete withdrawal of the laws while the Centre has made it clear that there will be amendments to the provisions to which the farmers have objection but the laws will not be repealed. Starting from September — after the laws were enacted — there have been five meetings between farmers and the Centre. Three meetings have been held after ‘Dilli Chalo’ protests began on November 26. The sixth meeting scheduled to have taken place on Wednesday was cancelled as no side is ready to blink first.As the talks began, the farmers expressed their apprehension over the abolition of the MSP, which the government allayed. The Centre also agreed to strength APMC mandis, create a level-playing field with private markets. A provision would be created for farmers to approach higher courts for dispute resolution, the Centre assured. But the situation has now boiled down to the question whether the laws will be withdrawn. A five-member delegation of the opposition parties including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, a representative of the DMK, CPI general secretary D Raja and CPI(M) general secretary Sita - will meet the President today at 5pm.As the protests continued, traffic was disrupted at border points with farmers agitating on Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-harden-stance-says-if-government-is-stubborn-so-are-we/story-4kcs7SGNcDq2k3C9SLTkEO.html

DA Mehta committee will probe the Ahmedabad fire incident, besides the fire tragedy at a Covid-19 hospital at Rajkot which is already being inquired into by the panel.At the outset, the law officer said he would request the Gujarat government to appoint a judge to probe the fire incidents in hospitals if the apex court suggest any name to head such an inquiry.  “It is upon the discretion of this court,” Mehta said.Mehta said the Centre has asked all the states and Union Territories (UTs) to send status report on the implementation of fire safety guidelines to prevent recurrence of fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes.A detailed report on fire safety would be prepared after getting the inputs from states, he said.The bench then asked about the fire safety audit of Gujarat and hospitals there and said as to how many nodal officers have been appointed.  It then enquired about the steps taken to enforce the Covid-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks in public and adhering to the social distancing norms.  “You file a detailed affidavit giving all steps taken,” it said.  Earlier, the apex court had said that people are violating “with impunity” the Covid-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks at public places and are not adhering to social distancing norms.It had pulled up the authorities for not ensuring strict compliance of these measures to contain coronavirus and had asked the Centre and states to give suggestions so that appropriate directions can be issued to implement these guidelines.The top court had however stayed the Gujarat High Court direction to send people caught without wearing masks to do community service at the Covid-19 patient care facilities.It had taken note of the submissions of the Gujarat government that the order was harsh, having serious repercussions on health of the violators.The top court had asked the Gujarat government to strictly enforce the Covid-19 guidelines.  The apex court had also expressed concern over the spurt in number of Covid-19 cases across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-reply-from-centre-states-on-covid-19-guidelines-fire-safety-in-hospitals/story-SQ9B1VDoOmQsyo7dxLlZSO.html

CBI filed supplementary charge-sheets in the court of special magistrate in Gwalior on Tuesday against 126 accused including candidates, impersonators, parents/guardians and middlemen related to PMT-2009 conducted by Vyapam now known as Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB). “CBI had registered the case on August 21, 2015 on the orders of Supreme Court of India. During CBI investigation, it was found that 36 candidates had allegedly arranged impersonators to appear in the written examination of MPPMT-2009 on their behalf with the help of middlemen, parents and accordingly they illegally passed the examination and got admission in a private medical colleges,” said CBI public relation officer RK Gaur said.He suggested it required voluminous work by the CBI to nab the accused. “CBI had prepared a database of around 16 lakh students including the students who were taking coaching of PMT in various institutes, MBBS students of various medical colleges and registered doctors of MP and Uttar Pradesh. CBI also took expert opinions from forensic experts on photographs and handwritings available on the OMR answer sheets of accused candidates,” said Gaur.

According to an investigating officer, this investigation took about more than four and a-half-years after the CBI had filed a charge-sheet against the accused booked by State’s special task force (STF) in June 2016. In all, 3,500 people were made accused by the CBI in different cases and 250 of them are new accused, who were not identified by the probe conducted by STF.The Vyapam scam came to light in July 2013 when Indore police arrested 20 impersonators appearing for medical entrance examination helping undeserving candidates to secure high ranks. The cheating net also involved a clique of politicians and bureaucrats that facilitated the fraud in exchange for bribes, according to investigators. The CBI took over the case in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-cast-a-wide-net-scrutinised-16-lakh-people-to-nab-vyapam-scam-accused/story-CKqnZ3FfTTRLwBF5GjPMDM.html

As per the data released by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the jump in the sale of American weapons to India comes at a time when sale of weapons from the US to other countries has dipped to USD 50.8 billion in 2020 from USD 55.7 billion in 2019.In 2019, the sale of US weapons to foreign countries was USD 55.7 billion. In 2017, it was USD 41.9 billion, it said.Major buyers of American weapons in 2020 were India (USD 3.4 billion up from USD 6.2 million in fiscal year 2019), Morocco (USD 4.5 billion up from USD 12.4 million), Poland (USD 4.7 billion up from USD 673 million), Singapore (USD 1.3 billion up from USD 137 million), Taiwan (USD 11.8 billion up from USD 876 million), and the United Arab Emirates (USD 3.6 billion up from USD 1.1 billion), the data showed.Several countries reported a drop in purchase of weapons from the US.Prominent among them were Saudi Arabia which came down from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 1.2 billion in 2020, Afghanistan (USD 1.1 billion down from USD 1.6 billion), Belgium (USD 41.8 million down from USD 5.5 billion), Iraq (USD 368 million down from USD 1.4 billion), and South Korea (USD 2.1 billion down from USD 2.7 billion).According to the 2020 edition of the Historical Sales Book, India purchased weapons worth USD 754.4 million in 2017 and USD 282 million in 2018. Between 1950 and 2020, US sale of weapons to India under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) category was USD 12.8 billion. For Pakistan, the official figures reflected that sale of weapons under FMS did happen, even though there was a freeze in any military and security assistance to Islamabad from the Trump administration. In 2020, US sale of weapons to Pakistan was USD 146 million, in 2018 it was USD 65 million and in 2017 it was USD 22 million.In 2019, there was no sale of US military weapons to Pakistan. In fact, the US refunded USD 10.8 million to Pakistan, taken for the purchase of weapons. Between 1950 and 2020, Pakistan purchased weapons worth USD 10 billion from the US under FMS. However, the total supply of American military weapons to Pakistan is much more, as a major chunk of weapons to Pakistan has gone from United States as military and security assistance. According to the Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Clarke Cooper, fiscal 2020 saw a total of USD 175.8 billion in US government-authorised arms exports. This is overall a 2.8 per cent increase since fiscal year 2019. The overall value of State Department-authorised government-to-government FMS cases implemented by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency decreased 8.3 per cent from USD 55.39 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 to USD 50.78 billion in Fiscal Year 2020. “The dollar value of potential FMS sales, formally notified to Congress, also rose by more than 50 per cent from USD 58.33 billion to USD 87.64 billion. This was driven by the July potential sale of USD 23.11 billion worth of F-35 aircraft to Japan, which was the second largest single FMS notification ever authorised by the Department of State,” Cooper said.The Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which is the Department of State-authorised commercial export licenses, totalled USD 124.3 billion in fiscal year 2020, and this was up from USD 114.7 billion in fiscal year 2019, he said. “This represented an 8.4 per cent increase. This total value covers authorisations of hardware, defense services, and technical data. The total number of licences issued decreased by 20-per cent from 36,111 in Fiscal Year 2019 to 28,800 in Fiscal Year 2020,” Cooper said.The top commercial DCS notified to Congress in Fiscal Year 2020 included a USD 8.39 billion sale to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for F-35 components. This also included a USD 3.2 billion sale to Australia for P-8 aircraft parts, and a USD 2.48 billion sale to United Kingdom and Australia for E-7 airborne early warning and control aircraft, Cooper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-weapons-procurement-from-the-us-jumps-to-usd-3-4-billion-in-2020/story-0FZOxhkUGyieHw0UIIt8zL.html

During his presentation to the senior diplomats, Ella pointed out that the medical industry is working to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of making vaccines available for humanity. Covaxin in India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV). Bharat Biotech recently started phase-III trials for Covaxin, which seems to have been largely safe and significantly triggered the immune response needed to fight off the infection. Ella also told the heads of missions that 33% of global vaccines are produced in Hyderabad’s Genome Valley, a high-technology business district spread across 600 sq km. Hyderabad also has the largest US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine facilities, he said. The diplomats will also visit Biological E, whose vaccine candidate is set to start early phases I and II trials. The visit by the diplomats to Hyderabad is part of India’s efforts to develop partnerships for the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines. It is also a follow-up to the November 6 briefing for the diplomatic corps in New Delhi on trials of vaccines underway in the country and efforts to manufacture and deliver the doses.

Besides representatives of countries in the region such as Afghanistan and Bhutan, the group included South Korean envoy Shin Bong-kil and heads of mission of African countries. “More than 60 heads of missions are being taken to leading biotech companies in Hyderabad. This is the first such visit and it will be followed by trips to facilities in other cities,” a person familiar with planning for the visit said. Others familiar with developments said India has been contributing significantly to global efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic and there is a lot of interest in India’s vaccine development and manufacturing efforts. The November 6 briefing, led by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, was attended by envoys and senior members of the diplomatic corps. Niti Aayog member VK Paul, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and other senior officials were part of the briefing, which was one of the key Covid-19-related interactions handled by the external affairs ministry. Given India’s position as the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, many countries, especially developing nations, are looking to New Delhi for a helping hand with the doses. Amid the pandemic, India had rushed essential medicines and equipment to some 150 countries around the world. India is looking for partners to co-produce vaccines so that they can be manufactured faster and distributed on a larger scale. New Delhi could offer free supply or trial partnerships to South Asian, European, West Asian, African and Latin American countries for the vaccine to ensure they can adequately protect their populations from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-more-than-60-envoys-in-hyderabad-to-visit-vaccine-facilities/story-O1gDIKiWqkwly6y8nsS9iJ.html

09-12-2020||India||Unsurprising that India’s farmers are worried about agricultural reforms, says US lawmaker||In the midst of a global pandemic, it is unsurprising that India’s farmers are worried about the impact of the recent agricultural reforms, a top American lawmaker has said, coming out in support of the agitating farmers who have been protesting against the new farm laws. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September. Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. “In the midst of a global pandemic, it’s unsurprising that India’s farmers are worried about the impact of recent agricultural reforms. As we know from our own experience in the US, citizens have every right to protest peaceably, be accommodated and their concerns listened to,” Congressman Brad Sherman, Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, said on Tuesday.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Free fuel to protesters heading to Delhi “As chair of the Caucus on India & Indian Americans, I’ve proudly championed the close partnership between the world’s largest and oldest democracies. It’s a partnership built on both interests and values, including a shared dedication to human rights and freedom of speech,” he said in a series of tweets. India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted”, asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country. “The farmers yearning to be heard are another powerful example of how peaceful protest is just one of the many cherished democratic traditions binding our countries together,” Sharman said. Congressman-elect David G Valadao also supported Indian farmers. “As farmers peacefully make their voices heard, the Government of India has a responsibility to allow their citizens to exercise this right to assemble,” Valadao said. Farmer leaders have been firm on their demand for repeal of three new farm laws. They have claimed that the laws will benefit corporates and end the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime. The government has maintained that it is committed to the welfare of farmers and have presented these laws as major reforms for their benefits. A late-night meeting called by Home Minister Amit Shah ended in failure on Tuesday as farmer leaders rejected the government’s offer to amend new farm laws, saying they would settle for nothing less than the scrapping of the legislations, while many of them threatened to boycott Wednesday’s scheduled talks with ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unsurprising-that-india-s-farmers-are-worried-about-agricultural-reforms-says-us-lawmaker/story-CTK5HTSV3tmGaznrXuvDdM.html

They didn’t know, says ED||A charge sheet filed by Enforcement Directorate (ED) last month in the ICICI Bank bribery scandal involving its former managing director Chanda Kochhar reveals how her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot had appointed drivers, gardeners, office boys, and other junior employees as dummy directors in their companies. Statements of these employees, which are now part of the charge sheet, were recorded by the ED. Some of them have claimed that they never even heard about the companies in which they were made directors. HT has seen the charge sheet, filed on November 3. The ED charge sheet says Kesharmal Nensukhlal Gandhi, who worked as a cleaner at Dhoot’s bungalow in Ahmednagar since 1994, was director in IRCL (Indian Refrigerator Company Ltd). He told ED that he was “neither aware about the company IRCL, nor aware about his directorship in IRCL and others. He was also unaware about transactions carried out by the company”. Gandhi told ED he used to sign documents on the directions of Dhoot and hadn’t attended any board meetings of the company.Also read | Rahul Nanda’s aide held in Topsgrup case Another employee, Laxmikant Sudhakar Katore, who worked as a gardener in M/s Videocon International from 2001 till 2016, told ED he was unaware about his directorship in various companies and 50% shareholding in RCPL (Real Cleantech Pvt Ltd). Katore received only his salary – Rs10,000 from the company. Similarly, one Vasant Sheshrao Kakade, who worked with Videocon since 1998 and looked after administration, banking, filing of income tax and service tax returns, was made director in more than 100 companies of Videocon group, and was made director in IRCL. He was also director of Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL) from 2008 till 2011 but never saw any documents before signing them. Deepak Kochhar too appointed people who had nothing to do with the business of his companies as directors. For instance, he made his childhood friend Anand Mohan Dalwani director in six companies. Dalwani told ED he used to sign documents only on Kochhar’s instructions. Chanda Kochhar’s brother’s wife Neelam Mahesh Advani was made director in various companies of Deepak Kochhar including – Pacific Capital Services Pvt Ltd (PCSPL) – but she was a dummy director like others and a “benami person holding shares of these companies”, ED has said. An office boy in Deepak Kochhar’s company – Echanda Urja Pvt Ltd – Sharad Shankar Mhatre, who also takes care of Kochhar’s father and often works as a driver for the family, was made director in PCSPL and made to sign various documents even though he was not aware about the business/transaction of these companies. The Central anti-money laundering agency has presented a strong argument that Rs64 crore investment by Videocon group into Deepak Kochhar’s company NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) was bribe money. “No board resolution was passed by board of directors of SEPL, IRCL, RCPL and VIL (Videocon Industries Ltd) for investment of Rs64 crore in NRPL and assigning of loans to IRCL and Real Appliances Pvt Ltd later. Also, no documents were created among these companies for the same,” ED charge sheet. Kochhars’ lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has slammed the ED charge sheet saying the allegations are baseless and that the charges will not stand scrutiny in court of law. Dhoot could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icici-bank-fraud-deepak-kochhar-s-driver-office-boy-and-gardener-were-dummy-directors-says-ed/story-OLti1BAnYlUsS3sSFna5BL.html

We are doing this with the help of the local youth and our NRI friends,” Gursharan Singh, a SAD worker said.A day after Bharat Bandh, the protest seems more on track as the late-night talk between the farmers’ union leaders and Amit Shah offered no way out of the ongoing impasse. Meanwhile, traffic in and around the Capital remained congested as Singhu, Auchandi, Piao, Mangesh borders remain closed.Earlier, the farmers had said that unless their demands are met, they are prepared to be on the road. They have set up langar at Singhu border. The farmers have come with ration, cylinders, stoves and other necessities. Arrangements of WiFi, tractors with amenities, air-conditioning are also there. If the protest goes on till May, June, we can conduct our meetings in the tractor, a protester said.The farmers were supposed to meet Union ministers for the sixth round of talks over the farm bills that were enacted in September, but after the meeting with Amit Shah where, as farmer leaders claimed, it was made clear that the Centre won’t repeal the laws, the meeting stands cancelled. The Centre will send a draft proposal to the farmers and the next course of action will be decided after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-free-fuel-to-protesters-heading-to-delhi/story-mVF8GJppbayklNyqQkF1EM.html

An official confirmed that the crucial sixth round of talks with protesting farmers’ unions has been cancelled due to farm leaders’ refusal to attend, according to news agency PTI. “We’ll hold a meeting over the draft that will be sent by the Centre. That meeting is cancelled. Draft will be discussed & further course of action will be decided. We hope things will be clear by 4-5 pm today,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Also Read: Farmers’ protests enter day 14, deadlock persists despite Amit Shah-farm unions’ meet The announcement comes a day after a group of 14 leaders of the agricultural community met Union minister Amit Shah to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation triggered by agri laws that they say will hurt their incomes and benefit large corporations. according to Hanan Mollah of the Kisan Sabha, Shah had said the government would propose amendments related to a fee structure in notified agriculture produce market committees (APMCs), stricter provisions to safeguard farmers’ land rights, strengthening of notified markets, and a guarantee on minimum support prices (MSPs) in Wednesday’s meeting. Follow latest updates on farmers’ protest here The farmers, however, have demanded a complete rollback of the three legislations that the government pushed in September to deregulate farm markets and permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which officials say will spur investments in supply chains. Farmers say government-controlled notified markets will collapse due to competition from deregulated markets under the new laws, as trade in the latter will be free of any fees or service charges.“The government is likely to present a plan spelling out specific measures to strengthen notified markets, such a fee structure so that both new free markets and notified markets can co-exist in a true competitive spirit,” an official said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the legislations since November 26 when they launched their “Dilli Chalo’ march following which several of the national capital’s borders have been choked. They are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/today-s-meeting-with-centre-cancelled-will-discuss-after-draft-proposal-farmers-leader/story-swMSQ3oDpCptQsvzS8mWtL.html

09-12-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Applications of Pfizer, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute to be reviewed today||The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which is the National Regulatory Authority of India, will review the applications of Pfizer, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — the three pharma companies that have sought emergency use authorisation for their Covid-19 vaccine candidates. The Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had on December 4 sought approval for its vaccine from the central drug regulator, after the firm secured such clearance in the UK and Bahrain. On December 6, Pune’s Serum Institute of India sought a nod for its Oxford Covid-19 vaccine. Subsequently, Bharat Biotech applied for the same on December 7. What does India’s regulatory framework say about emergency authorisation?There is no law by the name of emergency use authorisation law for granting licence to vaccine makers in India. But there are provisions for the purpose. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has said that the exact phrase — emergency use authorisation — is not used but the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, clearly specify that under specific special situations, relaxation, abbreviation, omission, or deferment of data including local clinical trial data may be considered for approval.How will India review the applications?It will be a very deep scrutiny, ICMR director-general Balram Bhargava has said. “It involves looking at voluminous data. We hope the decision would be expeditious but it will never compromise on scientific rigour and the processes therein,” he said. The experts will grant the authorisation only when they will be satisfied with the risk-benefit ratio that is if the benefit is more than the risk.Addressing a press meet in which the details of India’s proposed vaccination drive were revealed, Health secretary said that in the next few weeks some vaccine-makers will get licences. “But it is difficult to foretell which one will get or when. Most of the vaccines consist of two to three doses and there will be a gap of a few weeks between doses. Even after vaccination, precaution must be taken,” Bhushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-applications-of-pfizer-bharat-biotech-and-serum-institute-to-be-reviewed-today/story-GPiijVvCn7PynvSvYYtb2L.html

With a high number of Covid-19 patients recovering every day and the sustained fall in the mortality rate, India’s steady trend of registering dipping active cases continued with the country’s active caseload remaining below 400,000 at 378,909, which is merely 3.96% of the total confirmed cases. While there were 10 lakh cases of Covid-19 on September 18, the tally came down to four lakh on December 6 and have since been dropping. Maharashtra continues to report the maximum number of active cases in the country at 74,460 followed by Kerala with 59,873 active cases whereas Delhi has reported 22,310 active cases, 5,65,039 recoveries and 9,763 fatalities, according to the Union health ministry. India also witnessed a steady decline in the number of daily deaths recorded in the country. Less than 400 new deaths were recorded in the country in the last 24 hours. In the absence of a vaccine against the deadly disease, the number of recoveries continue to bind the hopes of the citizens. As many as 36,635 recovered from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours pushing the total number of recoveries to 9,215,581. India’s recovery rate stands at 94.59%, according to the health ministry.

09-12-2020||India||Don’t confuse forests for farms: Environmentalist Wanjira Mathai||A new study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) to be released on Wednesday on the potential of restoring land in Sidhi, a remote district in eastern Madhya Pradesh, has estimated that as many as 363,000 hectares have potential for restoration.If restored, it could sequester over 7 million metric tonnes of carbon over 10–20 years and increase forest carbon stock (carbon sequestered from the atmosphere) by 37%. To achieve the full restoration potential, 39.5 million saplings would need to be planted, creating employment opportunities of 3.75 million person days over two years.One of India’s nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to achieve a cumulative carbon sink of 2.5–3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 so the Centre has been mooting an agro-forestry policy that could help achieve the target. Wanjira Mathai, WRI’s regional director for Africa and former Chair of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya said such a goal was achievable by being radially inclusive and by not confusing indigenous forests for farms. Excerpts from an interview:How do you think such a large goal of creating a massive carbon sink can be achieved, especially when most people in India have small landholdings and common lands are often encroached on?The business of restoration has to be radically inclusive. The only models that have worked in the past are where local communities have been engaged and empowered. We saw it in Kenya’s Green Belt Movement. The planning and design of restoration initiatives have to be developed as per local land use practices. Both the quality of plantation material including seedlings, and survival of plantations are dependent on people. We have found that the element of nurturing the plantations is critical.Why do you think local people or villagers will participate in land restoration? Any learnings from Wangari Mathai’s (Wanjira’s mother and the first African woman to win the Nobel Prize) Green Belt Movement?The first thing to know about the Green Belt Movement was that it evolved around a need—the need for fodder, fuel wood and the need for nutritious food and the movement was established to address those issues that are fundamental in sustaining life as we know it. The model of ‘how’ was created directly with women. It involved working with women who in many communities, including in India, are the ones who bear the brunt of fetching firewood, fetching drinking water and ensuring there is a nutritious meal on the table.Also read | India lost 118 billion work hours due to heat in ’19: StudyThey were feeling the pressure of the lack of those resources. They were very responsive to coming together to plant trees. Planting of fruit and fodder trees, branches that could be cut for firewood, was a real winner for the movement. But I think the genius of the Green Belt Movement was involvement of local grassroots women, the idea that many would understand the patience and commitment to grow and find quality seedlings. Women were like foresters. The Green Belt Movement deliberately organised women because of the scale that was needed. There was clarity that for this movement to be successful, it needed to be at scale.How did you ensure the movement covered a very large area? Since 1977, the movement has ensured plantation of over 51 million trees in Kenya.Volume was incentivised. Women farmers were encouraged to form groups of 5 to 20, not all from the same family, and to mushroom those groups. Those groups gave themselves a name, opened a back account and were ready to engage with the movement in a transactional way. They could receive cheques as part of their accountability so the structure of groups was quite important. In the first phase of the movement, they planted in public spaces—in schools, around their homes, in market places etc. They began to make these farms of green around their communities and restored greenery outside gazetted forests. The women were also being compensated for seedlings that survived first for three months, and then for six months, which was also a very important aspect of the campaign. For seedlings that survived, they got a token amount of 2 US cents when the movement started. That was the incentive for volume. It was fun and transformative for women. It later moved to larger scale projects like gazetted forests. And gradually fostered a tripartite partnership between government, people and the Green Belt Movement. Governments usually have a hard time in producing such quality planting material. I think the Green Belt Movement is the most powerful model for inclusive land restoration.In India, we have a compensatory afforestation policy where, every time that forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes like mining or industry, the user agency is supposed to pay for planting forests over an equal area of non-forest land, or when that is not available, twice the area of degraded forest land. But there is a massive shortage of land for such plantations. Most private lands have been exhausted.We have to begin to look at the utility of the infrastructure we are building for our people. Going forward and what Covid-19 has taught us is that we have to be urbanising in ways that are a lot greener and inclusive and climate resilient. A lot of traditional infrastructure is not that. There will not be an infinite amount of land to plant trees but on the other side of the equation, we need to study what we are building. Who does it serve and is it actually inclusive? In Kenya, a lot of infrastructure is not serving the majority. It is not moving people, it’s moving vehicles. Pedestrian infrastructure and micro-mobility, for example, is so important for health, pollution and the climate. There should be a valuation of the quality of the tree that is being cut. Sometimes, it could mean cutting a hundred-year-old tree and putting ten small ones instead. There should definitely be a big disincentive to that. The focus should be on how to make sure that we don’t just clear and plant somewhere else because that becomes the easy route.How can we ensure survival of plantations?Survival of plantation is mainly dependent on the quality of planting material but it’s also crucial to ensure that we are not planting very young seedlings. In the Green Belt Movement, you could not plant a tree that was less than 2 feet tall. They were still nurtured for a couple of years to take care, to do spot weeding etc. Ensuring survival of trees is all about the quality of planting and nurturing, so it’s an investment. The government will have to invest in it and not consider it a cheap solution. Restoration is a job creator. As far as species are concerned, local wisdom is very important. World Agroforestry Institute has a tool that helps you identify species that are best suited for a particular area.How do you think India can meet our carbon sequestration NDC effectively?What is important at the moment is that we don’t confuse forests with farms. Forests have very dense biodiversity, they are teeming with life. Forests are not monocultures of trees. It’s important that we don’t confuse protection of indigenous forests and biodiversity for farms of trees. Covid-19 as a zoonotic disease reminds us how important it is to maintain a barrier between indigenous forests from plantations. It’s also important that we don’t encroach on forests in our thirst for commercial plantations. Commercial plantations have their place. People can plan their life around cash crops or commercial plantations. It’s a matter of getting our priorities right and safeguarding our forests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-confuse-forests-for-farms-environmentalist-wanjira-mathai/story-kGVq70rNK2Hdt8G0pstIKN.html

He is scheduled to inaugurate the BJP’s new office in Hastings. Party leaders said this would be the BJP’s war room for the forthcoming assembly polls. He would also virtually inaugurate nine BJP offices in various districts across the state. “Around 3pm, he is scheduled to take part in the Griha Samparka Abhijan (door-to-door campaign) in Bhowanipore area and later, offer puja at the Kali temple in Kalighat. Union home minister Amit Shah had also performed puja at the temple during his visit to the state earlier this year,” said a BJP leader. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 election, in which the BJP won 18 out of the state’s 42 parliamentary seats, the party is now hoping to replicate the performance in the 2021 West Bengal assembly. On Thursday, Nadda is expected to camp in Diamond Harbour, another TMC stronghold, adjacent to Kolkata in south Bengal. Diamond Harbour is Abhishek Banerjee’s constituency, who is TMC MP and nephew of the chief minister. The BJP president will address a press conference and also party cadres and will interact with members of the fishermen community. Top BJP leaders in West Bengal had earlier said that Shah and Nadda are expected to visit the state separately every month till the assembly elections are over. “He will also participate in a community outreach programme on BJP’s mission of Aur Noi Anyay,” Anil Baluni, the national media in charge of the party said.On Saturday, the party launched a campaign against what it calls the misrule of the Mamata Banerjee government in the state.

Senior party leaders and Union ministers have been deputed to work in the state. Nadda’s tour is part of his 120-day national tour that is aimed at strengthening the parties presence across the country.Meanwhile Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress chief, who is camping in the districts of south Bengal, is scheduled to address a rally in Bongaon, a seat dominated by the Dalit community and won by the BJP for the first time in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Banerjee has been taking on the BJP from public rallies in the districts where the BJP has made deep inroads. On Wednesday, she would address the rally at Bongaon, a bastion of the Matuas, a Dalit community. The Matua community has a presence across at least 70 out of 294 assembly seats in the state. In the 2019 elections, the Matuas supported BJP’s Shantanu Thakur who defeated his aunt, ruling Trinamool Congress’s Mamata Bala Thakur, from Bongaon. Before the 2019 polls the All India Matua Mahasangha, a Dalit body, had played host to a rally addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-nadda-to-begin-two-day-bengal-tour-today/story-AEEP6E9neABWmsbXSm0ohJ.html

09-12-2020||India||Bad-air law drafted, cleared in less than a week||It took less than a week in October for the environment ministry to draft and promulgate an ordinance mandating a commission to monitor air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR), a Right to Information (RTI) reply has revealed, showing that the process of framing the law started only after the top court ordered the formation of a committee (a different one) to track pollution.On October 16, the Supreme Court said it was setting up a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur for monitoring stubble burning and air pollution in the NCR and nearby areas, considered to be some of the most polluted in India, particularly in the winter months when post-harvest crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana causes the capital to be shrouded by smoky haze.Five days after the SC order, the ministry started the process of setting up CAQM (Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas) with statutory backing and on October 24, it requested the court not to constitute the panel. The SC agreed to the request. “The first draft of the Ordinance was created on October 23, 2020,” the reply to an RTI application filed by this correspondent said. And the Ordinance was promulgated on October 28, it added.The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 mandated the statutory body to adopt a consolidated approach towards monitoring, tackling and eliminating causes of air pollution in Delhi-NCR by coordinating with state governments which, however, were not consulted on the law.The ordinance replaced the 22-year-old Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) which introduced several important interventions to control pollution. According to the Ordinance, based on court orders, various ad hoc committees like the EPCA had been formed to assist in the implementation of court directives, but the new commission would subsume them.The commission works under the supervision of the central government and comprises members from all NCR states and the Central Pollution Control Board, apart from ministries such as petroleum and natural gas, agriculture and commerce. The commission is empowered to take decisions and act against sources of pollution under various laws like the Environment Protection Act and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Former petroleum secretary MM Kutty was appointed as the first chairperson of the commission on November 7.Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Prasoon Tripathi, in the RTI reply on December 2, admitted that there had been no consultations with the states or public on the draft. This was in reply to a question whether the state governments and public had been consulted on the important air pollution mitigation legislation.“The ministry of law and justice was consulted. The ministry of law and justice promulgated the draft for its promulgation,” the reply said.He did not provide the file notings and different versions of the draft law before the ordinance was promulgated, saying the file was not with him. “As and when the file is received to the undersigned, the relevant information will be provided.” An environment ministry functionary familiar with the development said the commission was set up in a short time to initiate a coordinated effort to control air pollution in NCR. “The government was swift to act and provided a platform of all stakeholders including the civil society to become part of the government’s effort to control air pollution,” he said, requesting anonymity. Legal experts said the new commission had become a hub of civil servants.“It is obvious that the environment ministry was not keen on another SC appointed committee to monitor air pollution. So, it promulgated the Ordinance, (creating the commission) which is dominated by bureaucrats. Of the 15 members, only three members represent NGOs. The majority of ministries engaged in actions that contribute to the pollution such as that of power, housing and road transport are there but crucial ones such as rural development and health are missing. No farmer body has been included even though stubble burning is said to be main cause of air pollution in northern India,” said Ritwick Dutta, an environment lawyer. The central government has effectively taken control of anti-pollution measures in the Delhi-NCR, as is evident from the fact that the chairperson of this commission is a central government appointee, said Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank.  “The enforcement mechanism is clearly top down and so far there is no indication that it will include third-party monitoring and citizen-driven enforcement,” she said.On Tuesday, the air pollution levels in Delhi and National Capital Region was between very poor to severe with Ghaziabad being the most polluted city with Air Quality Index (AQI) of 415. Many towns in Uttar Pradesh such as Bulandshahr and Kanpur reported AQI of more than 400. Delhi had AQI of 386, which meant that the capital’s air quality was poor despite lesser number of vehicles on road because of Bharat Bandh called by farmer bodies demanding repealing of three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-air-law-drafted-cleared-in-less-than-a-week/story-RX2ixxLQ2NnmM85n0rD3fO.html

A top court bench, headed by justice SK Kaul, also shot down a request by the government and the CERC to let the commission resume its work, saying the court cannot help consumers when the “government does not seem to be interested in coming to the aid of the consumers or making the commission functional”. The CERC – a regulatory body to determine power tariffs – has been non-functional since August after a restraining order by the court.In 2018, the court had ordered the CERC and all state commissions to make certain they appoint a member-law, who must be either a sitting or a retired judge, or a person with substantial knowledge and practise of the law whenever the next vacancy arises. Subsequently, a contempt plea was moved this year to point out that the government had appointed two members in the CERC without complying with the judgment to first appoint a member-law. On Monday, the SC underlined that as many as 177 judgments and orders were pending disposal before the CERC. “The Executive cannot be expected to act nor permitted to act in breach of the judgment of this court. This would be an invitation to anarchy! The mutual respect of the three pillars of democracy requires each of them to respect the role and functioning of the other,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/executive-not-following-court-orders-will-lead-to-anarchy-sc/story-xRJDQ0v5Nd4aMBSOVKrDVK.html
09-12-2020||India||Amit Shah’s meet with farmers makes no headway; today’s talks hang in balance||After Union home minister Amit Shah’s meeting with farmers protesting against three contentious agricultural laws failed to make headway on Tuesday, the course of Wednesday’s meeting, the sixth round of talks between farmers and the central leadership to end the deadlock remains uncertain. Shah met a group of 14 peasant leaders on Tuesday evening, however, the meeting failed to reach a breakthrough as the farmers refused to negotiate. Demanding just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from the home minister, the farmers reiterated that their only demand is the scrapping of the legislations that liberalise farm trade.Follow latest updates on farmers’ protest here Shah said agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar would present a concrete proposal in Wednesday’s talks and propose key amendments in the contentious agricultural laws that have triggered protests, according to farmers’ leaders, who attended the meeting at the state-run Indian Council of Agriculture Research’s (ICAR) Pusa Complex. In Wednesday’s meeting, Shah said the government would propose amendments related to a fee structure in notified agriculture produce market committees (APMCs), stricter provisions to safeguard farmers’ land rights, strengthening of notified markets, and a guarantee on minimum support prices (MSPs), according to Hanan Mollah of the Kisan Sabha.Also Read: Farmers’ protests enter day 14, deadlock persists despite Amit Shah-farm unions’ meet While there was no official word from the government on the status of Wednesday’s scheduled meeting, many farm union leaders said there is no question of attending it and that they will take a call on their next course of action after studying the government’s written proposal. “We have rejected the proposal. And we will now discuss amongst ourselves whether to go ahead with tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) talks...what’s the point?” said Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella platform under which various farm unions are spearheading the protests at Delhi’s borders, will hold a meeting at 10am Wednesday to decide their course of action, farmers’ leaders said.Also Read: Opposition may meet President Kovind over farm stir todayWednesday’s meeting, if it takes place, will be the sixth time the two sides will be holding talks over farmers’ demand of scrapping the three pro-market agricultural laws they say will hurt their incomes and and leave them at the mercy of large corporations. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 against three farm laws- the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020- enacted by the Centre during the monsoon session of Parliament. The protesting farmers on Tuesday enforced a national shutdown from 11am to 3pm, which remained largely peaceful.

09-12-2020||India||Top court gives nod for Chennai-Salem highway||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that the Centre was within its power to acquire “any land” for developing national highway in any state under public purpose, upholding the decision of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to acquire land for the construction of the ambitious 277-kilometre eight-lane national highway connecting Chennai, Krishnagiri and Salem in Tamil Nadu.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, said, “The availability of a highway in any part of the state paves way for sustainable development and overall enhancement of human well-being.” The Madras high court had on April 8, 2019, set aside the acquisition of land by NHAI, faulting the government body for not obtaining prior environment clearance before proceeding with the acquisition. NHAI had issued the notification under the National Highways Act, 1956, declaring the stretch from Tambaram (Chennai) to Harur as NH-179B and the stretch from Harur to Salem as NH-179A.The project, which was part of the Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I and is expected to cost ₹10,000 crore, was envisaged to reduce the distance between Chennai and Salem by 40km and to diversify the traffic from the congested Chennai-Krishnagiri section of Golden Quadrilateral and Chennai-Ulundurpet section of the Chennai-Madurai Economic Corridor. The NHAI notification under Section 3A(1) of the 1956 Act led to filing of a public interest litigation (PIL) before the high court, which had set aside the order.The land owners, too, had moved the Supreme Court against the haste shown by the central government to mutate the title of land soon after the notification was issued.On Tuesday, the top court agreed that for construction of any development project, prior environment clearance under the notification issued by ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on September 14, 2006, is a must. However, this stage will only arrive before the start of actual construction. In the present case, the bench noted, the project was at the stage of “planning” and “finalisation”.In a 140-page judgment, the bench went to the extent to suggest, “On a thorough perusal, the judgment (of the high court) does not reveal any just circumstance for invoking the judicial review jurisdiction.The top court agreed with the HC that until acquisition process stood completed, it was wrong on the part of the executing agency to alter the mutation entry possessed by landowners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-gives-nod-for-chennai-salem-highway/story-1wxqDr8CBAN4ca1MlLFD1L.html

The decision was made when Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the telephone with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani. The two leaders also looked at potential Qatari investments in the entire energy value chain in India. The move came ahead of an expected visit to Qatar and Kuwait by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and a trip to Oman by minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan. The leaders of India and Qatar discussed the “robust cooperation” in investment flows and energy security, and decided to “create a special task force to further facilitate investments by Qatar Investment Authority into India”, the ministry said. They also decided to explore Qatari investments in the energy value chain in India and reviewed developments in investment and energy sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-qatar-to-set-up-task-force-to-facilitate-investments-into-india/story-H5J4MVBP4IJxnEVNc16YAL.html
09-12-2020||India||Agencies to examine Christchurch shooter’s 3 month stay in India||Indian intelligence officials said on Tuesday that they will look into 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant’s three-month visit to India to find out details of the places he visited and the people he met. According to a comprehensive 792-page New Zealand Royal Commission of Inquiry report released on Tuesday, the Australian-born attacker was in India between November 21, 2015 and February 18, 2016. HT has seen a copy of the report. The report added that Tarrant travelled extensively, always alone, between April 15, 2014 and August 17, 2017 to various countries before moving to New Zealand. In all, the inquiry report lists 57 countries spread over Asia, most of Europe and Africa, where he travelled during the three years. He came to India immediately after finishing a 23 day-trip to Nepal. In fact, his longest stay during those three years was in India. “The longest visit the individual (Tarrant) made to any one country was to India where he stayed between 21 November 2015 and 18 February 2016,” the report said. He visited several countries for about a month or more, including Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Myanmar, Russia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. A senior Indian counter-terrorism official said Indian agencies will enquire about the cities he visited, and the people he was in touch with or stayed with. “We will seek information from regional FRROs (Foreigners Regional Registration Offices) about his travel in India,” said this officer, who requested anonymity. He added, “There is no formal enquiry or investigation in India as of now. We will look into his travel on the basis of Royal Commission of Inquiry report. If required later, we may seek further inputs from New Zealand authorities”. The report says that “while extremist groups (including violent extremists) can be found in some of the countries the individual (Tarrant) visited, there is no evidence that he met with them”. “Likewise, there is no evidence that he engaged in training or investigated potential targets,” the report stated. Tarrant, 30, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in August after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder for killing 51 Muslim worshippers including five Indians at two mosques during Friday prayers in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. The report says Tarrant lived off the money that he received from his father and income from investments made with it. “With the money from his father, the individual travelled extensively. First, in 2013, he explored New Zealand and Australia and then between 2014 and 2017 he travelled extensively around the world,” it said. The Royal Commission has concluded that when Tarrant moved to New Zealand in August 2017, it was with a fully developed terrorist ideology based on his adoption of the Great Replacement Theory and his associated beliefs that immigration, particularly by Muslim migrants, into Western countries was an existential threat to Western society and that the appropriate response (at least for him) was violence. The Great Replacement Theory , popular among white supremacists and right-wing groups is that there is a conspiracy to replace white people with non-whites, largely through migration. The report adds the purpose of the travel was not to meet up with extreme right-wing people or groups or engage in training activities or reconnaissance of possible targets. “Put simply, he travelled widely because he could and had nothing better to do,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agencies-to-examine-christchurch-shooter-s-3-month-stay-in-india/story-hpHSyDLmknHlzg6Ulsao6O.html

As protesting farmers continue to sit on the outskirts of Delhi, occupying various highways leading to the national capital, sixth round of talks between the Centre and farm leaders is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, though its fate hangs in balance after “informal” talks between Union home minister Amit Shah and farmer leaders, which took place late Tuesday night, failed to break the deadlock.Here’s all you need to know about the farmers’ stir as it enters day 14:1. Farm union leaders will on Wednesday decide whether to proceed with sixth round of talks, scheduled to take place later in the day. Speaking to news agency ANI, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who attended the meeting with Shah, said the government will give a proposal to farmers which, he said, will be discussed.Also Read | No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollback2. 13 farm union leaders attended the meeting with Shah. While the meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 7pm, it got delayed as there was confusion over the venue. Some leaders arrived at Shah’s residence while others reached Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s (ICAR) guesthouse in Pusa, where the talks finally took place.3. At the meeting, leaders reiterated their demand for a complete rollback. Shah, however, said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar would present a “concrete proposal” in Wednesday’s talks. The two sides have thus far held five rounds of talks, including three last week, on December 1, 3 and 5.4. A nationwide Bharat Bandh was organised on Tuesday against the three farm laws. The bandh, which was supported by almost all Opposition parties, was largely peaceful. There were, however, stray incidents of protesters blocking highways and railway tracks.5. On Tuesday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged party convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had been put under “house arrest” by the Delhi Police, which refuted the claims. After AAP workers, including deputy CM Manish Sisodia sat on a ‘dharna’ outside Kejriwal’s residence, the police gave them permission to go inside.6. Later, addressing AAP workers, Kejriwal claimed he was put under house arrest as the Centre was “angry” with him for rejecting Delhi Police’s request to turn nine stadiums into temporary prisons and for meeting protesting farmers at Singhu border on Monday. “I planned to go at the border today not as a CM but as common man but I think they came to know about my plan,” he said.Also Read | They did not let me go, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, counters police version on ‘house arrest’7.

Farmers, most of whom are from Punjab, have been protesting against what they call “black laws” since September, the month these legislations were passed. Initially they sat on railway tracks in Punjab but later announced ‘Dilli Chalo’ march for November 26.9. While on their way to Delhi, the protesting farmers faced stiff resistance from the Haryana Police but managed to reach the capital city. Most are protesting at various borders leading to Delhi while some are at the Nirankari grounds in Burari, the site allotted to them by the Delhi Police.10. Farmers have repeatedly said they only want a complete rollback and will not settle for anything less. They have also threatened to block all highways leading to Delhi and claim to have enough ration and other essential items with them to last for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protests-enter-day-14-uncertainty-around-today-s-sixth-round-of-talks-10-points/story-a7nuasVNT66XR3mnfsy5KK.html

I’ve been detained once again because I wanted to visit Budgam where hundreds of families were evicted from their homes,” Mufti tweeted.In the video shot near the entrance of her official residence at Fairview, on Srinagar’s Gupkar Road, she can be heard saying that she is not being allowed to move out.“GOI wants to continue inflicting oppression & zulm {cruelty} on the people of J&K without any questions asked,” she tweeted, posting another video in which the former chief minister, along with PDP spokesman Suhail Bukhari, can be seen arguing with security personnel deployed at her house.This is not the first time that the PDP president has not been allowed out of her house since her release in October after 14 months in detention. The police also didn’t allow her to travel to Pulwama to meet the family of PDP’s youth wing president Waheed Parra in November, a day after his arrest by the National Investigation Agency in New Delhi.Police had then cited security reasons. She visited Pulwama later and met relatives of Parra at Naira village. Mufti has also visited Pahalgam and met Gujjar families who were asked to vacate forest land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/detained-ahead-of-budgam-visit-says-mehbooba-mufti/story-hI6eJ4msxjIvXjLsKbdjDJ.html
09-12-2020||India||Tough reforms difficult in India, says Niti Aayog CEO||Tough reforms are difficult in India’s democratic set-up without political determination and strong administrative will, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Tuesday, adding that the current government has shown the courage and determination to carry out hard-headed reforms across sectors.“Tough reforms are very difficult in the Indian context. We are too much of a democracy. For the first time, the government has had the courage and determination to carry out hard-headed reforms across sectors,” said Kant. “Mining, coal, agriculture, labour, these are very difficult reforms. The easier reforms were done away with. You needed a huge amount of political determination and administrative will to carry out these reforms that are being done,” he added.Kant said that many more reforms were needed – across logistics and power, for example. “But this government has at least demonstrated its political will to do hard-headed reforms and we need to see them through to become a manufacturing nation. It’s not easy to compete with China,” he said. “It requires a very hard-headed ground-level approach which is being attempted for the first time in India,” he said at the webinar titled “Strategic Enablers and Policy Ecosystem for Atmanirbhar Bharat” organised by Swarajya in association with Vedanta Resources Limited.Kant also spoke about the emphasis of the government’s new Production Linked Incentive scheme for manufacturing being focused on creating a few “champions” as he termed them in specific sectors rather than trying to do too much by looking at all kinds of companies across sectors. Kant said that the agriculture sector needed to be reformed, and argued that the mandis, or government controlled market yards, were not being done away with. “The mandis will be there and the MSP will be there. But the farmer will get alternative choices…I am a great believer that the farmer must get a choice,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tough-reforms-difficult-in-india-says-niti-aayog-ceo/story-SVOEBBRUROfs3sUtGpMiBK.html
09-12-2020||India||Saarc potential can be realised when terror ends: PM Modi||In a veiled reference to terror emanating from Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that the full potential of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) can only be realised in an atmosphere free of terrorism and violence. Modi, however, underscored India’s commitment to work with other countries in the region for post-Covid-19 recovery in a message on the occasion of the 36th charter day of Saarc. The eight-nation grouping’s functioning and activities have virtually stalled because of the strained relations between India and Pakistan. Besides a virtual meeting in March on the Covid-19 situation, Saarc hasn’t had any significant engagements since India pulled out of the summit that was to be held in Pakistan in 2016 in the aftermath of the Uri terror attack. “The full potential of Saarc can only be realised in an atmosphere free of terror and violence. On this 36th Saarc Charter Day, let us re-commit ourselves to defeating the forces that support and nurture terrorism, and to work collectively towards a secure and prosperous South Asia,” the Prime Minister said. India, he added, “will continue to work with other countries in the region to ensure a robust recovery after the pandemic”. India is also committed to an “integrated, connected, secure and prosperous South Asia”, and will support the economic, technological, cultural and social development of the region. “The early coordination between Saarc countries for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic is an example of the benefit that our region can derive from greater collaboration,” he said, referring to the meeting held in March and the creation of an emergency Covid-19 fund with an initial contribution of $10 million from India. Saarc leaders had participated in the virtual meeting at Modi’s initiative. However, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan skipped the meet and the country was represented by its de- facto health minister, who created a controversy by raising the Kashmir issue. The charter day marks the signing of the Saarc Charter in 1985 by the leaders of the member countries at the grouping’s first summit in Dhaka. The grouping now includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a separate message on the occasion, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said the Saarc Charter reflects the region’s “shared vision, collective resolve and mutual pursuit to promote peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia through eradication of poverty, accelerated economic growth and advancement in socio-cultural development”. He described the pandemic as an “unprecedented challenge affecting not only health and economy but also social life and livelihoods in the region and beyond” and said it had compounded existing challenges such as poverty, terrorism, transnational crime and climate change. “There is a need for greater regional cooperation today than ever before,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saarc-potential-can-be-realised-when-terror-ends-pm-modi/story-nFb8L0u1sfciqn4aLkRK2N.html
09-12-2020||India||Opposition may meet Prez Kovind over farm stir today||Six opposition party leaders are likely to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday to discuss the farmers’ campaign against three newly enacted agricultural laws that have angered farmers, and seek the repeal of the legislation pushed through by the Centre in September.On Tuesday, the Congress said it was not against farm sector reforms, but the laws introduced by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government did not reflect reforms. The party also reiterated its demand for convening a special session of Parliament to scrap the three laws. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said opposition leaders will hold talks to forge a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting the President at 5 pm. “Tomorrow 5-6 people from different political parties are going to sit, discuss and take a collective stand. We will present our collective stand before the President,” Pawar said.The recent reforms in the antiquated farm sector allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of private buyers.Also Read: Bharat Bandh largely peaceful in borders, crowd swells at protest sitesApart from the NCP, other opposition parties likely to attend the meeting include the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC), a last-minute addition to the delegation. The opposition parties also supported Tuesday’s Bharat Bandh, or shutdown strike, called by the farmers’ unions against the three new agricultural laws. Farmers have massed at Delhi’s borders to protest against the laws. Besides Pawar, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D Raja and TKS Elangovan of the DMK will meet the President. The ongoing protests by farmers have triggered a war of words between the government and opposition parties. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said Pawar, as the agriculture minister in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, had asked states to amend the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act that governs the mandi system and had even warned them that the Centre will not provide them financial assistance in the absence of the three reforms. The ruling BJP also cited letters written by Pawar at that time to chief ministers. Pawar said the BJP was trying to divert public attention by creating a controversy over his letters asking chief ministers to amend the APMC Act. “I had said APMC act should continue but needed some reforms. There is no doubt that I had written the letter. But the new laws do not even mention APMC. The BJP is just trying to divert the attention. No need to give importance,” he told a press conference in Delhi. Meanwhile, former Haryana chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said agricultural reforms should be discussed afresh in Parliament and new laws enacted after consulting all stakeholders. He said a minimum support price mechanism had to be incorporated into the legislation to protect the interests of farmers. He alleged that the farm laws introduced by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had been passed without any consultations with farmers, and noted that these were pushed through amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollback“We are not against reforms but current laws must be immediately repealed and a fresh reform process initiated after consultations with all stakeholders and discussion in Parliament,” Hooda told a press conference. The former chief minister also alleged that the BJP-led Haryana government had lost the trust of the people of the state and of the assembly because it had “mishandled” the farmers’ protests. “I have written to governor demanding immediate convening of the Haryana assembly as the state government has insulted farmers and lost the trust of the people,” he said. Hooda said the Congress would move a no-confidence motion against the Manohar Lal Khattar government of Haryana, citing support extended to the farmers by some legislators. He also said a 2019 Congress manifesto promising abolition of the APMC Act was being misrepresented by the BJP. “We had promised to create procurement centres and mandis in nearby areas for farmers. We did that in Haryana, some even in a village with a small population of 10,000,” Hooda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-may-meet-prez-kovind-over-farm-stir-today/story-HdFJImEXYeY3oI9ttY68LN.html
09-12-2020||India||After Covid recovery, SC judge urges people to strictly follow norms||About halfway through the day, a bench of three judges in the Supreme Court was reduced to a composition of two. For the third judge, who has recently recovered from Covid-19, was requested to rest by a colleague on the bench. On Tuesday, only after justice Rohinton F Nariman inquired about the health of fellow judge, justice Krishna Murari, those attending the proceedings came to know that the latter had been detected with the viral disease and that it was his first day in court after recovering.“Justice Murari has recovered from a terrible Covid attack. I advised him not to come today as well but he still wanted to sit for some time,” justice Nariman announced in the court. He then addressed justice Murari: “Brother, this matter will go on for long. We can hear it as a two-judge bench matter. You may please take rest. And take care of yourself.” Justice Murari, who looked exhausted after more than an hour of proceedings, accepted the advice and called it a day. This is the first confirmation of a Supreme Court judge having contracted Covid-19. Hindustan Times later spoke to the judge, who said people must not let their guard down since the pandemic is still not over. “I do not interact or meet with too many people. I still do not know how I contracted it. Therefore, I will urge people to never disregard the precautions. Everyone must wear mask, use sanitiser and maintain social distancing,” he said. Justice Murari tested positive on November 19, a day after he felt a sudden weakness while sitting in court. He had mild symptoms, and cough and fever during the illness. “The Supreme Court administration was quick to respond. They made all the arrangements of quarantine etc and provided all the support required. Fellow judges also kept checking on my health and lent their support,” said the judge. Justice Murari, 62, has now been advised to go slow before he undertakes his normal duties. “I feel fatigue and exhaustion when I sit in the court for a long time. I am taking all precautions and I hope to get back to my normal self very soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-covid-recovery-sc-judge-urges-people-to-strictly-follow-norms/story-BKj4sF38uaP1qcMF4rGD4I.html
09-12-2020||India||60 envoys to visit two Hyderabad vaccine facilities||At least 60 heads of foreign missions are set to visit two Hyderabad-based biotech companies working on Covid-19 vaccines on December 9 as part of India’s efforts to develop partnerships for the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines. The visit by diplomats to the facilities of Bharat Biotech and Biological E will be a follow-up to the November 6 briefing for the diplomatic corps in New Delhi on trials of vaccines underway in the country and efforts to manufacture and deliver the doses, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. “More than 60 heads of missions are being taken to leading biotech companies in Hyderabad. This is the first such visit and it will be followed by trips to facilities in other cities,” said one of the people cited above. The people said India has been contributing significantly to global efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic and there is a lot of interest in India’s vaccine development and manufacturing efforts. “India is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis,” the person cited above said. Bharat Biotech recently started phase-III trials for Covaxin, which is India’s first vaccine candidate. Covaxin seems to have been largely safe and significantly triggered the immune response needed to fight off the infection, according to officials. Covaxin was developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology using inactivated Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Biological E’s vaccine candidate is set to start early phases I and II trials. The November 6 briefing, led by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, was attended by envoys and senior members of the diplomatic corps. Niti Aayog member VK Paul, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and other senior officials were part of the briefing. Given India’s position as the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, many countries, especially developing nations, are looking to New Delhi for a helping hand with the doses. Amid the pandemic, India had rushed essential medicines and equipment to many countries in the neighbourhood and in Africa. India is also looking for partners to co-produce vaccines so that they can be manufactured faster and distributed on a larger scale. New Delhi could offer free supply or trial partnerships to South Asian, European, West Asian, African and Latin American countries for the vaccine to ensure they can ramp up their drive to protect their populations from Covid-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-envoys-to-visit-two-hyderabad-vaccine-facilities/story-8ua9XtZlQ2jh36uYTivFGO.html
09-12-2020||India||Priority groups may get vaccine shots at same time, says Centre||The three groups in the government’s coronavirus vaccination priority list may get inoculations simultaneously if there are enough supplies, the Union government said on Tuesday, raising hopes that members of the public above the age of 50 or with significant comorbidities could get access sooner than previously thought.The priority list, which identifies people at most risk, has front line health workers, essential service workers like the police and army, and people above of 50 and those it who have significant comorbidities. “The immunisation process across the groups will not be sequential; it can also happen simultaneously depending upon the availability of vaccine,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, while adding that these were the recommendations from NEGVAC, or the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19. The health ministry estimates there are around 10 million health care workers, 20 million frontline workers, and another 270 million people in the last group. Officials at the routine health briefing held on Tuesday also said that India’s apex drug regulator will likely consider the emergency use authorisation (EUA) applications of all three vaccines that have applied, despite the candidate of Bharat Biotech still undergoing large scale Phase 3 clinical trials and the data from the combined Phase 1/2 trials not being public. Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe other vaccine candidates that have applied for EUA with the country’s apex drug regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) include the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine by Serum Institute of India (SII) and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 95% effective in international trial while the Oxford vaccine showed between 62-90% efficacy. “The Phase 1 and 2 data has been submitted to the regulator,” said the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research Dr Balram Bhargav, refusing to comment on when the data would be made public. Bharat Biotech had partnered with ICMR to develop India’s completely indigenous vaccine candidate Covaxin. According to Bharat Biotech’s filings with the Clinical Trials Registry of India, the first two phases are meant to judge safety and immune response, with Phase 3 being the point where they would check for efficacy – the vaccine’s ability to prevent infections.The Phase 3 trial of the vaccine started in mid-November and volunteers have so far received only one trial dose, with the other to be administered 28 days after the first. So far, 5,000 volunteers of the total 26,000 planned across 25 sites in India have been enrolled, as per the DG ICMR. Efficacy data is measured only 42 days after first shots, which means it will not be available till the end of this month. Bhargava suggested that assessments may be made with more preliminary data.“For temporary licensure, the regulator has to be satisfied with the risk-benefit ratio. In this emergency situation, if the benefit is more than the risk clearly then it may be considered for approval. From phase I and II trial, we get the safety and immunogenecity data, which is available for several months for certain studies. As for efficacy, the WHO says if it is more than 50% it can be used. The phase III data available for other vaccines is for a very small number of people,” said Bhargava.Also Read: Pfizer vaccine moves closer to getting the OK in USThere are currently nine vaccine candidates in advanced pre-clinical or human trials in India, Bhushan said. “India’s regulatory framework has a specific provision for EUA, without the particular phrase being used. The new drugs and clinical trial rules mentions that under specific special situations relaxation, abbreviation, omission, deferment of data including local clinical trial data may be considered for approval,” he said. Bhushan also gave details about vaccine logistics, saying the government has created a digital network called CoWIN, which will help register those eligible for a vaccine, tracking those vaccinated, creating a schedule, and monitoring the availability of resources on a real-time basis. The platform comes with an app that can be used by people for registering themselves for a Covid-19 vaccine. For the first phase of vaccination, states have already started collecting details of health care workers who will be the first to be administered the vaccine once it becomes available. A detailed list is being uploaded to CoWIN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priority-groups-may-get-vaccine-shots-at-same-time-says-centre/story-vGsNjqhQdjGzWEkQGHkvJN.html

On Tuesday, farm unions across the country held a nationwide Bharat Bandh against the three laws from 11am-3pm, which was largely peaceful. Late last night, in a bid to break the deadlock, Union home minister Amit Shah chaired a meeting with 13 farm leaders.

Nepal until now had recognised the height of the mountain as 8,848m as measured by the Survey of India in 1954. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Nepalese counterpart Bidya Devi Bhandari announced the new height of the tallest mountain in the world through an exchange of letters. It marked the end of a debate between Beijing and Kathmandu over a “three-metre” height difference they had on the mountain’s height.Also Read: Climate scientists turn Mount Everest into a lab||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mount-everest-grows-as-china-nepal-agree-on-new-height/story-aNsadIymz0MR9NZSEbMa3J.html

Western Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, too, felt the impact of the strike observed between 11am and 3pm.The impact was moderate in states such as Bihar, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, among others, and negligible in northeastern states — except Assam — and Goa.The Bharat Bandh was successful and the central government now knows it doesn’t have a way out, a farmers’ leader, Gurnam Singh Chadhuni, said at the Singhu border connecting Delhi and Haryana. It is one of the key entry points to the national capital and has been blocked since farmers reached the borders on November 27 to press their demands. Also Read: No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollbackThe shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, said Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav. “Fisher folk, railway workers, trade unions and artists are among many organisations who have supported us,” he added.The agricultural laws passed in September allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called mandi system controlled by the government, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs) and would leave them at the mercy of private buyers.Left leaders said the Opposition had taken a conscious decision to stay away from protest sites, even though most of them extended support to the bandh call. Farmers’ leaders, who are in talks with the Centre and say they demand nothing short of repeal of the legislation, had called for an apolitical protest.“It is a conscious decision on our part to stay away from the protest sites. The farmer groups themselves also told us that they would want it this way. So, we have no party banners at the protest sites.“However, our MPs are there, as parliamentarians, to show solidarity. We do not want to politicise the issue. It’s not just the Left parties, but all opposition has taken this call that except MPs, no leader will join the farmers,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury.Nevertheless, workers of political rivals of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) joined the protests in several states. The police detained protesting leaders in several states, including Gujarat Congress leader Paresh Dhanani and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad.In Punjab and Haryana, farmers blocked national highways and other key roads at many places. Shops and commercial establishments remained closed at most places in Punjab and several places in Haryana as traders backed the agitating farmers.Also Read: Bharat Bandh largely peaceful in borders, crowd swells at protest sitesPublic and private transport services were shut in Punjab. In Haryana, inter-state and intra-state bus services were disrupted.Over 50,000 government employees took mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira.Agitators blocked several key roads, including Chandigarh-Delhi, Amritsar-Delhi, Hisar-Delhi and Bhiwani-Delhi national highways. They parked tractors, trucks and other vehicles in the middle of the carriageways.In West Bengal, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee has supported the farmers, local train services were impacted in North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly districts due to the demonstrations.Supporters of the Congress and Left parties blocked railway tracks at several places and held demonstrations on roads to enforce the shutdown. The bandh partially affected the state with private vehicles remaining off the roads, while fewer public transport vehicles, including buses and taxis, were in service.Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel chased away Left workers at Howrah station when they blocked the entrance. Congress workers in Kolkata and other districts forced shops and petrol pumps to shut in some areas. In Jaipur, a clash broke out between National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) members and BJP Yuva Morcha workers outside a BJP office. Agriculture markets remained closed and public transport remained off the roads in Rajasthan on Tuesday, just like in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh.In Uttar Pradesh, the bandh called by farmer unions drew a mixed response with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party (SP) held protests in a number of districts and blocked a train in Allahabad.SP leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow. SP members of the legislative council Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it.Also Read: AAP says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal put under house arrest; BJP, police refute claimHowever, life in state capital remained mostly unaffected with district magistrate Abhishek Prakash saying that attendance in offices was absolutely normal.In Bihar’s Jehanabad, the movement of the Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police.Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers’ organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore.Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads. Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh were deserted with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away.In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress combine extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities such as Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities. Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were closed in many parts of the state.In Assam, shops pulled down shutters, protesters blocked traffic and demonstrations were staged but most offices were functioning. Dozens of protesters were detained, officials said.The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and opposition parties, including the Congress and various unions, held protests across Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and its allies, including the Congress, held protests across the state but life was mostly unaffected. In the union territory of Puducherry, ruled by the Congress, however, the bandh call evoked a good response.The bandh evoked a mixed response in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh. In Gwalior district, police used water cannons to disperse agitators who were led by a Congress leader. Shops remained open in several cities even as Congress workers took out rallies appealing shop-keepers to down shutters.Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. Many organisations in the state came out in support of the bandh. In some states, including in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shops-transport-take-a-hit-as-bharat-bandh-impacts-states/story-HL8dkTQpfxjJ5czM2nnkzK.html
09-12-2020||India||No headway as farmers tell Amit Shah they want full rollback||Union home minister Amit Shah met a group of 14 leaders of the agricultural community in the Capital on Tuesday evening, but their informal negotiations a day ahead of crucial delegation-level talks between the government and farm unions to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation failed to reach a breakthrough. At the meeting at the state-run Indian Council of Agriculture Research’s (ICAR) Pusa Complex, Shah said agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar would present a concrete proposal in Wednesday’s talks and propose key amendments in the contentious agricultural laws that have triggered protests, according to farmers’ leaders who reiterated that their only demand is the scrapping of the legislation that liberalise farm trade.“We have rejected the proposal. And we will now discuss amongst ourselves whether to go ahead with tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) talks...what’s the point?” said Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union, signalling the uncertainty surrounding the future of the dialogue process.Also Read: Protesting farmers forced to take shower at odd hours, women stand in long queues to use toiletsFarmers’ leaders said a meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella platform under which various farm unions are spearheading the protests at Delhi’s borders, will hold a meeting at 10am Wednesday to decide their course of action.In Wednesday’s meeting, Shah said the government would propose amendments related to a fee structure in notified agriculture produce market committees (APMCs), stricter provisions to safeguard farmers’ land rights, strengthening of notified markets, and a guarantee on minimum support prices (MSPs), according to Hanan Mollah of the Kisan Sabha.There was no official word from the government on what transpired at the talks.Wednesday’s meeting, if it takes place, will be the sixth time the two sides will be holding talks over farmers’ demand of scrapping the three pro-market agricultural laws they say will hurt their incomes and benefit large corporations. Farmers on Tuesday enforced a national shutdown from 11am to 3pm, which was peaceful. At least two farmers invited to talks with Shah said before the meeting they expected the government to offer concessions, such as amendments to the three laws, but said they would accept nothing short of a repeal of the laws.Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakaji of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, a farmer union leader, said before heading into the huddle that farmers would repeat their demand to withdraw the laws.“The government is expected to suggest amendments. Our stand is that we want the laws withdrawn,” he said. “One of the issues we will raise before the home minister is the arrest of several farmers in and around Delhi, including Karol Bagh,” he added. Also Read: Farmers today are much better informed, says Congress leader Kamal NathTens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, are protesting a set of pro-market agricultural laws by camping on Delhi’s borders. The farmers have stocked up on months of supplies, preparing to dig in for months. The government pushed the three laws in September to deregulate farm markets and permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which officials say will spur investments in supply chains. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana depend heavily on decades-old tightly regulated markets to sell staples at assured prices to the government.Farmers say government-controlled notified markets will collapse due to competition from deregulated markets under the new laws, as trade in the latter will be free of any fees or service charges. Since free markets, which could even be a farmer’s doorstep or a warehouse under the new laws, don’t have any applicable fees for trading, farmers feel traders will abandon traditional markets. Large traders and intermediaries control these markets and exert influence over farmers. They buy their produce and often provide credit to farmers, creating dependencies. “The government is likely to present a plan spelling out specific measures to strengthen notified markets, such a fee structure so that both new free markets and notified markets can co-exist in a true competitive spirit,” an official said. Rakesh Tikait, the leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Tikait faction, a farmers’ union, said: “Efforts to resolve the farmers’ protests are going on. Our bandh today has been successful and peaceful.” Although previous rounds of discussions led by agriculture minister Tomar have showed no signs of ending the impasse, the home minister has been informally talking to farmers’ representatives to facilitate a solution. The third round of talks was facilitated by several rounds of phone conversations between Shah and key farm union leaders, which took place on December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-headway-as-farmers-tell-amit-shah-they-want-full-rollback/story-lloUKJonCsGpvRc2hqSanL.html
09-12-2020||India||GoM bats for Universal National Social Profile||India should create a Universal National Social Profile in order to have a more immediate and thorough record of people entitled to government benefits, a group of ministers (GoM) looking into e-governance and e-education has said, suggesting the information also include details about people’s families.The suggestions are part of a report by the GoM and details ways in which delivery of services and benefits through digital means can be overhauled, identifying 12 specific strategies such as creating a unified data system for all government offices, ensuring personal records are digital from when a person is born and improving digital literacy as well as infrastructure in order to ensure these reach to every corner of the country. The report, which also includes suggestions on improving e-education, was seen by HT. “A Universal National Social Profile capturing individual and family benefits may be created and updated on a real-time basis. This would help in minimizing inclusion /exclusion errors... This should enable a holistic assessment of the requirement for assistance from the government based on the family/individual’s real-time situation and have the feature of national portability of entitlements,” according to the report, which adds that such a measure would “improve the present arrangement where such information is available through SECC data collected once in 10 years”. The GoM is headed by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan with Arjun Ram Meghwal as coordinator and Rao Inderjit Singh and Sanjay Dhotre as the other members. Their report also suggested creation of a multidimensional, secure, real-time, geo-tagged, robust, and accessible unified data system for all interactions that a citizen makes with the different levels of governments.They pitched for simplification of government procedures so that they can get services from anywhere in the country or the world. This simplification can be done by creating a single sign-in facility, ensuring that any office can serve functions of any other government office location, setting up a proactive platform that will present citizens with options for services and benefits and unify certifications.“The number of available services and the number of services that need to be made available through e-governance may be first identified. Then action needs to be taken accordingly. National Digital Platforms may be developed in line with National Digital Health Mission for various domains,” the report said. The report also suggested strengthening information and providing affordable access to the Internet as a pre-requisite for going entirely towards digital services. The report notes that there are rural areas with connectivity issues and has suggested last mile connectivity through innovative technologies.“The privacy issue should be appropriately addressed even as every effort is made for transparent and efficient implementation of government schemes with fidelity. Citizens should have control over their data. They should be able to decide what they would like to share voluntarily. Suitable precautions should be taken so that both ends are achieved,” the panel has recommended. “Any model of e-governance should act as an enabler and facilitator in addressing public interest. With regard to issues concerning personal records and personal data it should align with the architecture as defined in various judicial pronouncements, particularly the SC judgement of Nov 2019, SC vs Subhash Agarwal, as also private data protection bill under consideration,” said former Union secretary Bimal Julka who also served as the chief information commissioner.Eminent expert Nilanjan Sircar said while e-governance improved services, it was important that the data is anonymised to prevent any misuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gom-bats-for-universal-national-social-profile/story-dFIzkG7Obc5XOuz00EoYbI.html
09-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Regular readers of this column are aware that my reading of scientific journals and papers increased significantly (actually went from 0 to 60 in under 10 seconds, to borrow a metaphor from the automobile business) during the coronavirus disease pandemic.With a handful of vaccines for Covid-19 clearing Phase 3 trials; the vaccination of the general population in the UK beginning on Tuesday; and an indigenously developed vaccine applying for emergency use authorisation (on the basis of Phase 1/2 data, but more on this shortly), I was reminded of a May article in the British Journal of Pharmacology that claimed that identifying a drug or drugs to treat the coronavirus disease would take less time than the 12-18 months it would take to develop a vaccine. It has been a year and 10 days between the first published account of the strange illness in Wuhan, China, and the administration of a vaccine that has cleared Phase 3 trials to a member of the general population, so the authors of that article got that right. But they got the drugs bit completely wrong.A clutch of antiretrovirals that initially showed promise do not work. Nor does hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Remdesivir mostly does not work. Ditto with most autoimmune therapies. And plasma therapy, too, does not seem effective in most cases. Monoclonal antibodies may work, but the treatment is expensive. Indeed, the only drugs that have been conclusively proven to work in the treatment of Covid-19 are steroids such as dexamethasone. That does beg the question as to why hospitals are continuing to treat people with some of these (expensive) drugs and therapies, but I shall move on in the spirit of caveat emptor and all that...Still, it is surprising that we now have not one or two, but a bouquet of successful vaccines that can prevent Covid-19, but just one drug that can treat it.Also Read: Oxford University-AstraZeneca first to publish final-stage Covid-19 vaccine trial resultsThen there are the promising vaccine candidates, among them, Covaxin, Bharat Biotech’s Made in India one that applied for emergency use approval on Monday. I’m a little surprised by the application for regulatory approval. The company started its Phase 3 trials on November 11. According to available information, the trial involves injecting people with two doses of the vaccine or a placebo at a 28-day interval and then waiting for 14 days to test for efficacy. That would mean that even interim data from the Phase 3 trials will become available only in late December. It also suggests that the regulatory approval is being asked for on the basis of the unpublished (so far) Phase 1/2 data. If the company wanted to apply for emergency use approval on the basis of this, it could have done so at any time and it is not clear why it has waited till now.To be sure, the very fact that the company has moved from the combined Phase 1/2 to Phase 3 trials, and that these were approved by the drug regulator, suggests that the results of Phase 1/2 were successful, that the vaccine provoked an immune response in the small sample of people tested. But as much as I’d love to see a local vaccine become available soon — the benefits of this are huge — it is important that due process is followed. The developer, and its partner, the Indian Council of Medical Research, must release the Phase 1/2 data. And the drugs regulator may do well to wait for at least interim data from the Phase 3 trials before approving the vaccine.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMore a digression than a post script: My colleague and the person who has edited more of these columns than anyone else in the newsroom used to be one of the country’s top sports journalists. His usual feedback on my column is along two dimensions. One, on the quality of the column itself, and whether, in his opinion, it has covered fresh ground (getting tougher as the number keeps increasing, I can tell you). And two, on the cricketing significance of the number — he started doing this after Dispatch crossed the 100 mark. But even I know the significance of 221 (today’s number): it was Sunil Gavaskar’s epic double century in an unsuccessful fourth innings chase of 438 (needed in 445 minutes and 20 mandatory overs) at The Oval. The match was eventually drawn, with India falling nine runs short, and with two wickets in hand. Many consider it Gavaskar’s finest innings ever. Some believe the match saw India’s best chase ever. It also challenged the limits of possibility. Just as vaccine development has.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-Jy86m5rY4gOZ7ANzpBBdsL.html
09-12-2020||India||Deepak Kochhar tweaked firm’s books, says Enforcement Directorate||Soon after ICICI Bank Limited launched an internal investigation against its then managing director Chanda Kochhar in August 2016, her husband Deepak Kochhar tweaked his company’s books to show that Rs 64 crore received from Videocon Group was a genuine business transaction and that he intended to return the money, according to a charge sheet filed by Enforcement Directorate (ED).The charge sheet was filed on November 3 this year, but these details are just emerging. According to ED, on August 18, 2016, when the internal inquiry was initiated by ICICI Bank into allegations against Chanda Kochhar for improper grant of loans extended to companies affiliated with Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL) and its promoter Venugopal Dhoot in return for quid pro quo investments in Deepak Kochhar’s company NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL), “accounting entries in the books of Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL) were made to give an appearance of genuineness to the transaction”. SEPL is also controlled by Deepak Kochhar and was used for transfer of the money, believed by ED to be a kickback, in 2009 from Videocon to NRPL, according to ED. A provision of Rs 32 lakh against redemption premium was created in the balance sheet of FY2016-17, to project the proceeds of crime as genuine transaction and “to project that SEPL intended to return funds”. “…Had it been a genuine transaction between SEPL and VIL, the provisioning would have been done in 2009 itself. But the provisioning was created (that too of an amount of Rs 32 lakh only) first time in FY2016-17 by SEPL,” according to the ED charge sheet, which has been reviewed by HT. ED says that when ICICI Bank forwarded a press release to the Bombay Stock Exchange on March 28, 2018 ,putting its weight behind Chanda Kochhar, “being assured that ICICI has closed the matter and no enquiry or action is pending, the provisioning (of Rs 32 lakh) was reversed by SEPL in FY2017-18.” According to ED, there was never any intention (on the part of either NRPL or SEPL) to repay Rs 64 crore to Videocon but this change in the account books was part of a conspiracy of reviving a broken link for returning the funds. The post-enquiry irregularities didn’t stop there, according to the agency. The charge sheet says that Real Cleantech Private Ltd (RCPL), a company of the Videocon Group, through which Rs 64 crore came to NRPL, was allowed a slow death i.e. it was struck off by Registrar of Companies (RoC) in 2018 due to non-filing of records. However, a day after Justice (retd) B N Srikrishna interviewed Deepak Kochhar on January 2, 2019 for the enquiry entrusted to him by ICICI Bank, Dhoot filed an application in RoC Mumbai for revival of RCPL and subsequently Deepak Kochhar shared the application document with justice Srikrishna. ED said the revival of a company struck off by RoC can only be sought from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Only after a formal investigation was initiated both by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in January 2019 did Dhoot apply to the NCLT for revival of RCPL in February 2019. The company was ultimately revived in September that year. Kochhar’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “Only the label is different in the complaint filed by the prosecution before the special judge PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act). It is verbatim same as that filed before the adjudicating authority, wherein vide detailed 800 pages order, all their allegations have been held to be baseless. So, this old wine in new bottle is not fit for drinking.” Dhoot could not be reached for comment.In March 2018, the board of ICICI Bank gave a clean chit to Chanda Kochhar and said there was no question of favouritism, nepotism or conflict of interest on her part in granting loans to Videocon or any other company. In October the same year, she resigned from the bank, with which it had been associated for 34 years, Months later, the bank sacked her, deciding to treat her resignation as termination, after the Srikrishna panel found that she violated the bank’s policies and other rules and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deepak-kochhar-tweaked-firm-s-books-says-ed/story-fiyHvK4JqWXAkO1AlOi7XJ.html
09-12-2020||India||Farmers’ stir: Talks between Amit Shah, farmer leaders fail to make breakthrough||Talks between Home Minister Amit Shah and a select group of farmers’ representatives failed to make any breakthrough on Tuesday night with the union leaders insisting on their demand for repeal of three new laws and rejecting the government’s proposal for amendments.Some leaders also threatened that they will boycott the scheduled sixth round of talks with the government on Wednesday at Vigyan Bhawan here, while others said their next course of action will depend on what amendments the government assures in writing, which they claimed was promised by Shah in today’s meeting.Another leader said, “There is no chance of tomorrow’s meeting. Whatever they have decided to give in writing we won’t accept those amendments as we want complete repeal of the laws. There is no question of meeting again.” However, a few leaders who attended the meeting with Shah appeared to be in favour of necessary amendments and assurances on the minimum support price (MSP) regime and the mandi system rather than a complete repeal of the laws enacted in September, indicating some kind of divisions among the unions.Also Read| Farmers’ protest: Confusion over meeting venue, Amit Shah meets farmers at ICARAfter the meeting which ended around midnight, All India Kisan Sabha general secretary and CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah said, “The home minister has made it clear that the government will not repeal the laws. Shah-ji said the government will give tomorrow in writing the amendments which the government is keen to. We will decide about attending the meeting after discussing the written amendments with all 40 farmer unions.” At the same time, he also added, “We don’t want amendments, we want repeal of laws. There is no middle path. We will not attend tomorrow’s meeting.” Mollah said a final decision on attending the sixth round of talks will be taken at a meeting of union leaders Wednesday noon at Singhu border, where thousands of farmers have been camping for the last 12 days demanding the repeal of the laws.After the fifth round of talks on Saturday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said that the next meeting had been scheduled for 11 am on December 9.Tomar, Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Parkash, who have been leading the government’s consultations with the agitating farmers, were present at the meeting Shah had with the 13 farmer leaders at National Agricultural Science Complex, Pusa.Also Read: ‘Bharat Bandh’ ends peacefully, life hit in some states as farmers take national centre stageFarmer leaders have claimed that the laws will benefit corporates and end the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime.The government has maintained that it is committed to the welfare of farmers and have presented these laws as major reforms for their benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-not-ready-to-repeal-farm-laws-say-farmer-leaders-after-meet-with-home-minister-amit-shah/story-NUcC0kRwvPA7xvu76Hs55J.html
09-12-2020||India||Neurotoxins suspected to have triggered mysterious disease in AP’s Eluru||The mysterious disease that claimed one life and led to the hospitalisation of more than 500 people with complaints of epilepsy, convulsions, seizures and giddiness in Andhra Pradesh’s coastal town of Eluru was a case of “neuro-toxicity” caused by heavy metals like lead and nickel, a preliminary study by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalagiri has found.The AIIMS authorities submitted a preliminary report to the state medical and health department on Monday night. The authorities have called for some more tests to corroborate the report. “We have tentatively identified the primary cause of this strange phenomenon, but it is not yet clear what its source is and how and why it has happened. For instance, the chemicals were found in the bodies of the patients but not in either water or any other food substance,” state health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar, who has been monitoring the situation in Eluru, told Hindustan Times. A three-member expert team from the Centre led by AIIMS emergency health care head Dr Jamshed Nair, National Institute of Virology expert Dr Avinash Devashtawar and NDCC deputy director Dr Sanketh Kulakarni is expected to reach Eluru in the evening to assess the situation. “We are hoping to get a clear picture of the situation in a day or two as experts are probing all angles to find out the root cause of the disease,” Bhaskar said. He clarified that the mysterious disease was neither a bacterial or viral infection nor a contagious disease. “It is a sudden onset of symptoms of convulsions and epilepsy which could be treated symptomatically,” he said. Officials of sanitation wing, food safety division and drinking water supply department of Eluru municipality have been collecting samples from various localities like South Street, North Street, West Street, Arundhatipet and Ashok Nagar areas to find out whether they have any contamination. There is panic in these localities which lack basic sanitation facilities – the narrow lanes are stinking with open drains and garbage dumps but people are hardly bothered about the conditions. “Every house has a drinking water connection, but you can notice drinking water pipelines are passing through sewerage lines. There is no elected body for municipality and so, no official pays any attention to these problems,” said Chode Venkata Ratnam, former deputy mayor of Eluru municipal corporation. Sai Ram (18) from South Street, who had undergone treatment in the government hospital for two days, said he did not know what happened to him all of a sudden. “I was playing with my friends in my backyard when I suddenly collapsed and developed fits. I never had this problem before,” he said. A 20-year old woman Sai Laxmi, who was rushed to the government hospital on Tuesday morning from the same South Street, was also very healthy till she developed these strange symptoms. “This happened despite taking all precautions,” her mother Padma said. Another victim – Rama Krishna (25), a physically challenged man, returned home after treatment, but the symptoms continue to surface now and then. “He had an epilepsy problem in the past and it has recurred now,” his mother C V L Appayamma said. The teams of World Health Organisation and that of AIIMS, Mangalagiri, are also touring the affected areas to get firsthand information about the conditions of the patients. As on Tuesday afternoon, as many as 505 cases have been reported from different parts of the town. “Of them, 332 were discharged after treatment,” hospital authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neurotoxins-suspected-to-have-triggered-mysterious-disease-in-ap-s-eluru/story-VnNyfUwJVKKrTh3D0OpMgM.html
09-12-2020||Editorials||The trouble with Russia | HT Editorial||Russia has become the Cheshire Cat of Indian foreign policy, in danger of slowly fading away, with a friendly smile its last visible remnant. Russia remains close to India, but increasingly only when it comes to secondary interests. There is shrinking convergence when it comes to India’s most important strategic concerns. New Delhi’s task is to manage this important bilateral relationship, preferably by reimagining Indo-Russian bonds but otherwise by dragging out the process of dissolution. The source of dissonance between India and Russia is a third party, China. Even before events in Ladakh, the growing aggression of Beijing was becoming India’s overriding strategic problem. Even relations with Pakistan are often little more than an offshoot of the larger Sino-Indian confrontation. For Russia, on the other hand, the Middle Kingdom has become the primary geopolitical and economic partner, especially when it faces Western sanctions. Squaring a spiky China circle with Russian desires to remain friends with India is proving increasingly difficult.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov recently claimed that the Indo-Pacific and the Quad are Western attempts to seduce a naïve India into joining an anti-China alliance. This is untrue. India’s embrace of these strategic concepts, including its increased proximity to the United States (US), has been driven by unilateral Chinese acts of hostility over the past decade. Moscow’s attempts to serve as an intermediary between New Delhi and Beijing are an implicit recognition of where the problem lies. India has sought, equally unsuccessfully, to reduce friction between the US and Russia. That Vladimir Putin can publicly contemplate the possibility of a formal Sino-Russian alliance is a sign the China gap is almost too wide to bridge.India and Russia continue to cooperate closely in almost any diplomatic arena that does not involve Chinese interests. New Delhi has defied US sanctions to preserve its defence relations with Moscow, but as relations with China worsen, there will be an inevitable erosion of confidence in Russia. On the positive side, there is a widening economic relationship revolving around energy and, potentially, strategic minerals. While this will mean a relationship on a less intimate level than that which once existed, they are the sort of new foundations that would help mitigate the hard geopolitical logic that is driving these two middle powers apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-trouble-with-russia-ht-editorial/story-cOBbuCRLZmjWzck8bkq6CN.html
09-12-2020||Editorials||Farm groups must not be maximalist | HT Editorial||The farm protests are an expression of the democratic will of an important segment of India’s citizens — even though their method of disruption is unwarranted and has caused inconvenience to other citizens. The strength of the movement, primarily in Punjab, comes from real or perceived apprehensions about the recent farm laws. By sustaining their protest for weeks, mobilising large numbers of people, calling a Bharat bandh, farm unions have made their point and forced the government to the negotiating table. They have also got the Centre — which, as this newspaper has argued, made a mistake in not engaging in enough prior consultations — to make important concessions. These include a written reassurance on continuation of minimum support prices, enabling state governments to register and impose a cess on new markets, and an amendment to the law to ensure appeals to a civil court.Yet, there is a deadlock. And it must be said that this is due to a position of maximalism adopted by farm leaders. The all-or-nothing approach — reflected in the demand for an outright repeal of laws and unwillingness to settle for anything less — is not a mature way to approach political negotiations. Even as the voice of farmers is important, so is the fact that the government had the mandate to push its legislative agenda and Parliament has passed the laws. It would be far more productive for the agitating forces to negotiate in a more constructive manner, extract concessions on safety nets, but also recognise the current political reality of the government’s determination to stay the course. Moderation is key to a solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farm-groups-must-not-be-maximalist-ht-editorial/story-qhRGfhQundArasusdeksHO.html
09-12-2020||Editorials||India’s evolving energy diplomacy | HT Editorial||The recent decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to allow a muted increase in production in the first quarter of next year was welcomed by petroleum and natural gas minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, because of what it means for price stability rather than the hope it means cheaper oil.India stands to gain because oil producers need to generate revenues necessary to maintain the investment levels to ensure steady oil supply. India’s relations with the largest oil producers, notably the Persian Gulf monarchies and Russia, also increasingly revolve around them ploughing their earnings into India’s oil and gas sector. New Delhi’s ambitious plans for energy transition partly depend on the financial status of the largest OPEC members — a partnership OPEC acknowledged at the recent India-OPEC institutional dialogue. Mr Pradhan was notably more interested in potential OPEC investments in India than the ups and downs of oil production.Despite OPEC’s earlier production cuts and its projected increases, global prices have remained in the $40 to $50 a barrel range. Thanks to record foreign exchange reserves, India today can absorb somewhat higher global oil prices, and shift focus on attracting the massive investments needed for its natural gas and renewable energy plans. Implicit is the recognition oil is rapidly ceasing to be a strategic commodity. The real challenge for India’s energy diplomacy is preparing the ground for a post-oil future in a manner that ensures oil markets abet rather than disrupt this larger transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-s-evolving-energy-diplomacy-ht-editorial/story-9UyHkF00O0Xkuz27VmY3UP.html
