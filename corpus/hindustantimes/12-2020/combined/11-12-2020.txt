11-12-2020||News||A manifesto for the climate summit||The year 2020 teaches us that “super shocks” do not just come and go; they transform our ways of life. The climate crisis is another super shock, which will keep hitting harder going into the future. As we close out the pandemic year, the world’s largest polluters must pledge resources towards mitigating the climate super shock. That should be the metric to judge the Climate Ambition Summit on December 12.The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General said, recently, “Our planet is broken”. He promised that the UN’s goal for 2021 would be to build a global coalition around reducing emissions to net zero, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions or removing them from the atmosphere. He envisions a carbon price, eliminated fossil fuel subsidies, carbon taxes on polluters, and support for those already facing adverse impacts.The December 12 summit, on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate, is co-hosted by the United Kingdom (UK) presidency of the conference of the parties (COP-26, now scheduled for next year), the UN and France, in partnership with Chile and Italy. World leaders are expected to make major announcements on mitigation, adaptation and support.The prospect of more speeches hardly sounds encouraging in the backdrop of a rapidly-unfolding climate crisis. Summits serve three purposes. High-level participation allows leaders to negotiate knotty issues, building on personal rapport and the promise of grand bargains. Alternatively, leaders could set a new agenda, drawing others to their cause. This was why India and France promoted the International Solar Alliance in 2015. Further, heads of state/government could make unilateral announcements, baiting other countries to match in ambition. The 12/12 summit is primarily designed around the third objective.To that end, four kinds of announcements are expected: Upgraded Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement; long-term ambitions for net-zero emissions; commitments for more climate finance; plans and policies for adaptation.India, the only G20 country with NDCs consistent with a 2 degree Celsius goal, could legitimately ask, “Why should we upgrade NDCs when other major emitting countries should catch up with us?” Long-term ambitions are flaky. Thirty years ago, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had not even been drafted. Since then, humanity has pumped out about 302.3 (±25.8) gigatonnes of carbon. With what crystal ball can the world hold countries accountable for their 2050 or 2060 net-zero targets?Moreover, the statements on December 12 will be made against the backdrop of the pandemic. Amid talk of building back better, governments must deliver on jobs, growth and sustainability. Fiscal resources are limited. Returns on investment on restarting growth and creating new jobs would have to be quicker than waiting three decades for net-zero emissions. As the capital of global finance, the UK has a chance to connect climate ambition with sustainable recovery by triggering a real effort at sustainable finance. Here are four ideas.First, make clean energy access a centre-piece of climate action. Energy poverty remains one of the key barriers to sustainable development. Access to distributed clean energy is also a route to energising small businesses in rural and urban settings. In India alone, there is a $50 billion market for using clean energy for productive enterprises in rural areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money has helped to push the adoption of solar home systems. Now is the chance to bring together developing countries with a package that offers access to capital to finance such systems. With the potential to power labour-intensive businesses, this will signal that high-level summits have the interests of common people in mind.Second, help small and medium industries become more energy-efficient. Again, lack of access to clean fuels or regular electricity supply means that often polluting (and more expensive) fuels are used. These make small industries uncompetitive, a double whammy for the economy and the environment. Energy-efficient production processes need access to cheap working capital so that businesses can pay off the higher upfront costs for efficient equipment against their lifetime savings. This is not rocket science but needs dedicated attention from the financial industry.Third, aggregate clean energy projects across developing countries via a common risk mitigation mechanism to reduce the cost of finance. Financing costs are the largest component in the levelised cost of electricity in developing countries. Bundling non-project (macro, offtaker and political) risks and bundling projects for clean energy and sustainable transportation could increase their creditworthiness. It could also standardise investments across countries, thereby helping to scale up bond market capital flows into regions with growing energy demand.Fourth, fund the measures that can increase resilience against climate shocks. According to Swiss Re, economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in 2019 were $146 billion. But the insurance industry covered only $60 billion. A global risk pooling reserve fund could combine climate risks across countries to spread them and ensure a payout when climate disasters above severe thresholds strike. Plans to build resilience will be worth little if the most vulnerable countries and communities have no insurance cushion against climate-induced loss and damage.If we could earn cents for every climate speech made, we would all be rich and resilient by now. The road to next year’s big climate talks (COP26) could be paved with the soft ground of promises or punctuated by the hard milestones of delivery. The rest, as they say, will be just words on paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-manifesto-for-the-climate-summit/story-VVM0kNaBhG9YD1i2mFVbMK.html
11-12-2020||News||What to expect when the vaccine rolls out||With Pfizer/BioNtech becoming the first company to get its vaccine approved for public use in the United Kingdom (UK), the wait for a post-Covid world seems to have got shorter. New developments are taking place each day; in India, the Serum Institute of India (SII)’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin stand just weeks away from getting regulatory clearances led by Pfizer, claiming the waiver of clinical trials in accordance with special provisions under the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 and based on the results of its United States (US) trials. Who would’ve thought that vaccine generation which had till date been a decades’ long process would get abridged to a period of a year? Given the magnitude of this feat, it is only fitting to earmark 2020 in golden letters in the legacy of science.However, does vaccine inception guarantee its distribution to one and all? While the vulnerability and essentiality clauses of the selection criteria call for prioritising front line workers and senior citizens as the first beneficiaries of the inoculation drive and with politicians and bureaucrats in the mix, ordinary citizens will ultimately bear the brunt. Indians are very shrewd when it comes to making connections for claiming benefits. This will manifest in the form of those having political connections and resources getting an upper hand in the vaccination drive. By 2021, it has been estimated that 800 million Indians would have to be inoculated to meet the requirement of the herd immunity objective. Nonetheless, with no clear public vaccine rollout plan in place, it remains to be seen who all will make the cut.Vaccines are our best bet against the virus, but not much is known about their capability to break the chain of transmission or indeed the efficacy of each vaccine. Apart from this, side-effects after being inoculated have also not been explored properly till date, courtesy of emergency approvals. When the news of an officer-bearer contracting Covid-19 after being injected with Covaxin made the rounds recently, the question of vaccine efficacy was raised again. Also, there is news of several volunteers of the same vaccine testing positive during trials. Given this, it would not be wise to let our guards down at such a critical stage. This calls for a need to tone down our over-optimism regarding the vaccine and adhere to the social vaccine which demands adherence to the 3S principle- social distancing, shielding through masks and sanitising. Even if the vaccines get accelerated approval, their storage and transportation will prove challenging. With Pfizer requiring temperatures as low as minus 70 degree Celsius for storage, its distribution in India will be problematic. But with new developments and use of dry ice, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated (2-8 degree Celsius) conditions. Given the burgeoning demand for the vaccine, this should not be that difficult to manage. Covishield, on the other hand, can be originally stored at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius) without a need for thawing. With the Centre and states bolstering cold chain infrastructure, it is the administration that remains. Here is where we can reap the benefits of our past experiences. Our Universal Immunisation Programme and Pulse Polio have won wide appreciation. With lakhs of centres across the country, the polio vaccine can be stored at minus 20 degree Celsius. Through our learning curve developed under these programmes and utilising support from Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), ASHA workers and ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwives), a network of professionals can be established to ensure that the vaccination reaches every beneficiary. Besides, Electronic Vaccination Intelligence Network (e-Vin)) transformed into Co-VIN will provide a schedule of all beneficiaries along with the dates allotted to them for vaccination, their vaccine centres as well as who administered the vaccine to whom. The objective is to ensure real-time monitoring of the beneficiaries to determine any adverse effects of the jab. Work is in progress to boost the database with the details of the beneficiaries. If we are able to execute this plan well, then last mile connectivity issues will no longer be an arduous task.Another point that must be considered is long the vaccine-induced immunity will last? This is crucial given the fact that immunity developed against the Sars-CoV-2 is not indelible. No wonder, even after four rounds of sero-surveys in Delhi, the average percentage of people exhibiting antibodies remains just 25%. This is so because antibodies developed against the transmissible virus wane after a period of time. This implies that even people infected with the virus remain at a risk of reinfection as witnessed in a number of cases worldwide. On that account, does it make sense to inoculate such a vast number of people without knowing the duration of immunity post injection? What if a new strain develops before achieving the target? Other than this, demands are being made to categorise the vaccine as a public good. Is this a worthwhile request given the uncertainty looming the immunisation? With the government facing a fiscal crunch, it needs to be examined whether the vaccine will be subsidised and, if so, whether the recipient will be a person from the below poverty line cardholder category or whether everyone can avail of it. Finally, can the vaccine emancipate us from the reign of protective equipment, face masks and sanitisers? We, as doctors, will scrutinise the UK closely since it was the first country to approve the mass vaccine rollout. With all these considerations, it might be premature to be over-optimistic about the vaccine. Let us wait for things to become clearer.

11-12-2020||News||What the Paris Agreement means for the climate crisis||The adoption of the Paris Agreement on December 12, 2015, marked the beginning of a journey towards limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C. The agreement is different from its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, in several ways. The design of the accord nudged nationally-determined voluntary action towards the climate crisis, keeping into account the economic development and historical responsibility of each party. The mechanism also enabled a ratcheting up of these commitments every few years and taking stock of implementation of existing commitments. The first such stock-taking is scheduled for 2023 and every five years thereafter. The Paris accord kick-started a journey of relentless and collective action towards achieving a global common good, accomplished through diverse, locally appropriate, but carbon-emission reducing actions. Five years hence, the need to achieve these goals and the opportunities to do so have increased. This decade has been the hottest since record-keeping began about 140 years ago. The years between 2015 and 2018 have seen the hottest temperatures recorded till date, with global CO2 emissions increasing by an additional 4%. Further, as highlighted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Reports, the gap between achievement of the 1.5°C target and the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) scenario, has widened to 32 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide (GTCO2e) in 2019.This first half-decade of the accord has seen domestic actions in key economies in and around the energy sector, together with multi-sectoral energy efficiency improvements, and the beginning of decarbonisation in the agriculture, transport, and industrial sectors. One of the success stories is India, which, according to the Climate Action Tracker, continues to be the only country among the G20 whose Paris pledges and subsequent actions place it on track to a below 2°C global warming future. This is largely because of the steep decline of renewable energy tariffs, which declined by 64% just between 2015 and 2019; hitting a historic low of Rs 2/kWh ($0.0270/kWh) in a bid opened on November 23. Solar electricity is now the most inexpensive electricity in India, and its newly-discovered price is less than the cost of coal alone in more than two-thirds of the coal-based electricity generated. A similar achievement happened earlier in the case of LED bulbs, whose prices fell by about 82% between 2014 and 2020. These experiences, focusing on increasing sales volumes by conscious market expansion strategies accompanied by reducing prices due to bulk procurement, have been made possible through a combination of policy levers, institutional innovation, technological support and mobilisation of finance. Another reason why renewable energy achieved the scale that it currently operates at is that, after the initial policy nudge, deployment and uptake of renewable energy made for an economically strong case. As a next scalable task, the deployment of infrastructure for the wide-scaled uptake of electric vehicles, especially buses and two-wheelers will not only be economically viable but will also reduce local air pollution and the emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. These will improve public health while reducing ecological damage. From this point onwards, the global community finds itself in a stronger position on at least two accounts. First, the pledges on achieving carbon neutrality by China, Japan and South Korea are positive announcements. The unwillingness of the United States (US) to participate in the global agreement as seen in the last four years is likely to be overturned with the US being officially back on board with the agreement. Second, the pace of advancement and availability of technology will continue to make it possible to undertake economically viable transformations which can further limit global emissions across geographies. This can be achieved as long as best practices and access to best available technologies are made available to influence climate action in vulnerable regions. This can be assisted by developing long-term strategies embedding climate in social, economic and developmental discourse; and strengthening global collaboration and multilateral support in nudging towards climate-friendly pathways. India’s experience with collaborations like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a successful case in point. The next phase of the Paris Agreement must further build on this.The Paris Agreement creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity for India to substantively contribute to development and climate action in developing countries. This can be done through strong partnerships that bring together here-and-now development benefits with longer-term climate benefits, and at prices that are attractive. Capturing this opportunity will depend on the actions we take now. However, the agreement has been able to bring together the vulnerable countries and high-emitting players to tackle a collective problem, and has enabled us to move to the successful first step in the decarbonisation discourse.

Mishra is in-charge of BJP’s affairs in 48 assembly constituencies in West Bengal.Mishra, who recently visited West Bengal, announced on Friday to meet Bengali community families after the attack on the convoy of BJP chief JP Nadda and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) affairs in charge in West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya on Thursday.Mishra sought blessings of Bhaduri while touching her feet and apprised her of the present political situation in West Bengal. He urged her to give her blessings for a nationalist and BJP government in the state under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre.He also told her that there are about 2.5 lakh Bengali families members living in Bhopal and the BJP would soon convene a meeting of all the community members to create a conducive atmosphere for the BJP in West Bengal seeking their support.Also read: ‘Independent ties with countries’ - India pushes back against Russian minister’s commentsAfter calling on Indira Bhaduri, who lives at Shyamla Hills in Bhopal, Narottam Mishra said, “West Bengal has given several legendary personalities to the country and it has contributed chiefly to country’s literary, spiritual and religious fields. The state played a leading role in the freedom struggle. But when we see such a sorry state of affairs in West Bengal caused by its chief minister Mamta Banerjee, it pains us.”He said, “West Bengal used to give employment to many but many industries are being closed down in the state and there is poverty and unemployment galore under Mamta Banerjee government. We will meet Bengali community members in the entire country, particularly in Madhya Pradesh. I have requested century’s great actor Amitabh Bachchan’s mother-in-law Indira Bhaduri to appeal to her community members to help BJP restore law and order in West Bengal by forming its government.”Reacting upon Mishra’s visit to Indira Bhaduri’s residence and his recent visit to West Bengal, state Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “home minister Narottam Mishra who has been made in-charge of BJP affairs in 48 assembly constituencies in West Bengal is extremely busy with canvassing for the party. Hence, he should be dropped from the state cabinet so that a new home minister could pay attention to deteriorating law and order situation in Madhya Pradesh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-home-minister-meets-jaya-bachchan-s-mother-to-reach-out-to-bengali-community-ahead-of-bengal-polls/story-DcSh18GEh0RWkLzMLEqLKI.html

He demanded the release of social activists, professors, students, and journalists who have been arrested by the Central and state governments under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.“Many thinkers have been arrested on false grounds of participating in anti-national activities. The farmers are also being branded as anti-nationals. To ease the tension, the government should repeal the three anti-farmer laws and release the people incarcerated on false grounds,” said Bains.‘BJP TARGETTING PEOPLE SUPPORTING FARMERS’The district unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) condemned the recent alleged attack by BJP goons at the residence of Delhi deputy chief minister Munish Sisodia.“The BJP, alarmed by the farmers’ massive movement, is now resorting to such despicable acts to target those who are supporting the farmers in their struggle,” said Aman Mohie, joint secretary, Punjab unit, and Suresh Goyal, AAP district in-charge (urban), in a statement issued from party headquarters on Friday.Goyal said that ever since the AAP ministers, MLAs, and workers started working for the struggling farmers as their “servants”, the BJP has been resorting to cheap gimmicks to target them.He added, “In a democratic system of governance, people are within their legitimate right to protest peacefully pressing for their demands, but the BJP government, through the Delhi police, have been suppressing such rights of the people. Such hooliganism of the BJP would prove disastrous for the country and its people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lok-insaaf-party-to-join-farmers-stir-at-singhu-border/story-bS1uyVcgJjgukv6NZsGv2J.html
11-12-2020||City||Punjab SCERT postpones scholarship exams scheduled for today, tomorrow||The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) have postponed the National Means and Merit Scholarship (NMMS) exam and Punjab State Talent Search Exam (PSTSE), and National Talent Search Exam (NTSE) scheduled to be held on December 12 and 13 in the state due to administrative reasons.A letter regarding the same was issued by council director Jagtar Kulria on Friday afternoon, a day before the PSTSE was scheduled to be held.PSTSE, which is conducted annually by the state government for students of classes 8 and 10 to provide financial help, will now be held on December 19. NTSE (stage 1), a national level scholarship exam conducted for Class 10 students, and NMMS, a centrally sponsored scheme for Class 8 students, will now be held on December 20. A total of 5,561 students have registered online to appear for PSTSE, 4,379 for NMMS, and 4,376 for NTSE.As per the council, the time, roll number, and centres will remain the same. New admit cards will not be issued. This move by the council will give extra time to students to prepare for the exam.The principals of over 50 government schools had been on their toes on Friday to make arrangements for the upcoming scholarship exams. Teachers of the district stated that they had even made transportation arrangements to ferry the students to the exam centres.A government school principal said, “We had got the rooms sanitised and had made proper seating plans to ensure social distancing, but now the authorities have postponed the exams. Teachers were informed about their examination duty on Friday morning and had to be informed about the postponement in the evening.”Students who qualify for the NTSE, become eligible for an annual scholarship of Rs 15,000 (Rs 1,250 per month) for classes 11 to 12, and Rs 2,000 per month at the undergraduate level. The students who qualify NMMS exam become eligible for Rs 12,000 per annum (Rs 1,000 per month) scholarship for four years from Class 9 to 12. Those who crack PSTSE, get Rs 200 every month till the completion of Class 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-scert-postpones-scholarship-exams-scheduled-for-today-tomorrow/story-t3HGrOCfV0YymLKVMx2sFM.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Slight decline in air quality as winds change||Low wind speed and a change in wind direction led to a marginal decline in Delhi’s air quality on Friday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said Delhi and neighbouring cities are likely to receive light rainfall starting Friday night. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 295, in the poor category. On Thursday, the AQI was 284, also in the poor category. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said on Friday, the average wind speed was 6kmph, which was not enough to blow away the pollutants. However, with a western disturbance impacting the entire region, the pollution levels are not expected to worsen much over the weekend. “The wind speed reduced to 6kmph and the direction also changed from north-westerly to easterly on Friday. Some areas in Haryana have received rainfall on Friday afternoon,” said Srivastava. He said the average wind speed in Delhi is likely to remain around 8-10kmph on Saturday and Sunday, which means that the air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” zone till Monday. “The western disturbance will pass on Saturday and the wind direction will change back to north-westerly,” he added. The Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said under the influence of this western disturbance, isolated to scattered rainfall and better ventilation are expected on Friday and Saturday and the AQI is also likely to further improve to the moderate category or the lower end of poor category. “However, the respite is not expected to last long. As an aftermath of the western disturbance, high moisture availability and higher air holding capacity will result in the creation of dense fog (mainly during early morning hours). This will lead to a deterioration in air quality from December 14,” the Safar forecast said. IMD scientists also said from December 14, the temperature is also expected to start falling. On Friday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 11.3 degrees Celsius. This was two notches above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 25.8 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/slight-decline-in-air-quality-as-winds-change/story-4FeAxZZPKieG0aYtOhIjFM.html

Gauravdeep has been working to create awareness among voters with Ludhiana district administration and chief electoral officer of Punjab for several years and has influenced thousands of youngsters with his words.Gauravdeep, who has been with the farmers at Singhu border since November 27, had announced during the protest that he would be returning the award, and handed it over to additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Amandeep Singh Bains.Gauravdeep said, “After working so closely with the election commission for years to create awareness on the right to vote, I was honoured by the Modi government with the National Youth Award on January 12, 2018. However, in the last one year, this government has not worked for its voters, but for the corporate houses of this country. The essence of democracy is the right to protest and the right to express, but the way this government has been suppressing the voices of dissent in recent times makes me feel that all my hard work to strengthen democracy has gone in vain. The farmers of my country have been treated like outsiders so as a young Indian, I feel disrespected and less optimistic about my faith in the current government. Farmers have been brutally attacked and denied the right to enter their own national capital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-activist-returns-national-award/story-568mJpWFsNtMh2StHe8PYP.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||HC seeks govt response on plea challenging price cap on RT-PCR tests||The Delhi high court on Friday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea which challenged the government’s decision to cap the price of RT-PCR tests done by private labs at ₹ 800 on the grounds that the limit was set arbitrarily and without due consultations with the stakeholdersJustice Navin Chawla issued a notice to the Delhi government on the plea filed by the Association of Practising Pathologists, through advocate Neeraj Grover.The plea said the Delhi government while capping the charges for RT-PCR molecular based testing, had not taken into account the three different methods of testing -- RT-PCR (open system), CBNAAT and TRUNAT -- all loosely referred to as RT-PCR molecular tests in general parlance. The petitioner said these tests differ in their respective sensitivity as well as other factors.Grover told the court that the three tests differ on specificity, turnaround time and the cost involved. He said the capabilities of various labs in private sector to conduct such tests also differ on account of infrastructure and capital requirements.“While the costs to labs for doing an RT-PCR (open system) tests is around ₹1,200, the cost of a TRUNAT is around ₹2,000 and CBNAAT test is around ₹3,500,” the petition said.During the hearing, advocate Ramesh Singh, standing counsel of Delhi government, told the court that the price was capped only for the RT-PCR test, which is a molecular test, and not for CBNAAT and TRUNAT which are cartridge-based tests, while agreeing that all three tests are different.The government, also represented by the additional standing counsel, said a similar matter was pending in the Supreme Court and hence the plea should not be entertained. It said the petitioner did not give even a representation to the government highlighting their grievances and directly approached the court.After hearing brief arguments, the court issued a notice to the government seeking to know its stand.The plea by the association of over 240 practising pathologists said the Delhi government had failed to appreciate that the order of capping the price of the test is a “regressive” step as it was forcing path labs to do important investigations by using cheap RT-PCR open system kits which provides inaccurate results.The petition also said the Delhi government is not making timely payment of lab bills. It said most of the private labs which have committed their substantial capacity to the Delhi government and have been doing tests for them, have not been paid for doing tests for over two months while the vendors and manufacturers of kits demand an 100% advance for supplying the consumables.“Even the salaries of the staff and additional charges for Covid duties are being paid regularly. In such circumstances, the finances of the labs involved in Covid testing are draining quickly,” the plea read.The matter would be now heard on February 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-challenging-price-cap-on-rt-pcr-tests/story-U5zHcnlajGYkr6FU6aRKJM.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat case: Delhi HC dismisses plea to transfer probe against Maulana Saad to NIA||The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed a plea which had sought the transfer of investigation of a case against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad from the Delhi Police to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The case was registered against Maulana Saad for holding a congregation in March in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19.A bench comprising justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh dismissed the petition after the petitioner sought to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the Supreme Court. The court said that since one petition with a similar prayer is already pending in the Supreme Court, it cannot be heard here.“Advocate Yash Chaturvedi for the petitioner seeks to withdraw the petition with liberty to further prosecute the petition seeking similar relief instituted by him herein before the Supreme Court. Leave and liberty granted. The petition is dismissed and withdrawn,” the bench said in its oral order.A petition filed by Mumbai lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay has also sought directions to the NIA to investigate the matter in a timebound manner and requested that the probe be monitored by the high court, alleging that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite considerable the lapse of time.“It is virtually impossible for Maulana Saad to hide himself for such a long time and that too in the capital of the country. Performance of Delhi Police has been pathetic from the very inception and outset. Failure of the Delhi police is explicit from the fact that despite there being lockdown and curfew-like situation, Maulana Saad was able to arrange a gathering of thousands of people belonging to Tablighi Jamaat in the capital of India,” the plea said.The petition also alleged that the acts of omission and commission of Saad and his associates/Tablighi Jamaat constitute “terrorist acts/activities” as defined under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and hence the matter should be probed by the NIA.On March 31, the Delhi Police lodged an FIR against seven persons, including the cleric, based on a complaint by the station house officer of Nizamuddin police station for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-case-delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-to-transfer-probe-against-maulana-saad-to-nia/story-KKStGjFO2RYsE9dmEPd8XL.html

11-12-2020||City||Govt officials like ‘Kumbhkarna’, need to be woken up by using different means: J&K HC||Peeved over their casual approach, the Jammu and Kashmir high court has equated government officials in the Union territory with “Kumbhkarna”—brother of the demon King Ravana and observed that “they had to be woken up by using different means.” The acting chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir high court justice Rajesh Bindal on Wednesday expressed his displeasure over working of government officials in the UT.He made these observations while dismissing a writ petition filed by the National India Construction Company, which had challenged the rejection of its bid for construction of a road under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). “In the case in hand and what is seen in other cases filed against the government in this court, replies/objections are not filed in some cases even for a decade. It is not limited to main petitions but even in contempt petitions, a compliance report is not filed for a long time. This not only results in denying fruits of litigation to the succeeding party but even lowers public trust in the judicial institution,” justice Bindal observed. “Honourable Supreme Court had compared a litigant approaching the court after a huge delay with Kumbhkarna. I think if considered in that light, for filing of replies/objections in the cases pending in this court, the government officials are no better. As has been mentioned in Ramayana, demon King Ravana had to use a lot of noise and different means to wake up Kumbhkarna, when his kingdom was in trouble. Here also the government officials are to be woken up from slumber by using different means,” he further observed. “The way of working and attitude of shirking responsibility (by officials) will not change unless people at the helm are held accountable for their action and inaction. If officers and staff are paid salaries from amounts contributed by the public, why should the public exchequer suffer for their inefficiency and casualness?,” he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-officials-like-kumbhkarna-need-to-be-woken-up-by-using-different-means-j-k-hc/story-e0QqZXrT1BFPz5KHDQR8mI.html

11-12-2020||Chandigarh||Dushyant-led JJP risks losing farmers’ support||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala,32, and his fledgling Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) have risked losing their support base in the farming community by not coming out openly in support of the agitating farmers. The JJP and the BJP are ruling Haryana in coalition since October 2019. The farmers who have laid siege on the arterial roads leading to the national capital are demanding that the three farm laws enacted by the Centre should be repealed. The JJP prides itself being the flag bearer of farmers’ rights and its core vote bank is the farming community. However, its reluctance to part ways with the ruling BJP in Haryana or take a firm stance on the issue is not going down well with the peasantry. To add to JJP’s declining credibility, seven of the 10 party MLAs have expressed unequivocal support to the protesting farmers. Dushyant’s own stance on the issue—“I will be the first to resign if the minimum support price is discontinued”—has cut little ice with majority of his party MLAs and the farming community. “Why is this question being put to us? They (Dushyant, his MLA mother, Naina and minister, Anoop Dhanak) should be clarifying their stance on the farmers’ issue. We are clear-cut in lending our whole-hearted support to the farmers,’’ said JJP MLA, Ishwar Singh, on being asked about the stance of the top leadership. JJP’s soft stance on the issue has also given fodder to the opposition Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD). Dushyant’s uncle and INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala has announced that he is ready to quit as a legislator while the Congress has accused Dushyant of betraying the farmers. ‘Long term damage’ The deputy CM though has maintained that he is also a farmer first and will never allow the interest of peasantry to be compromised. “It’s my responsibility to get the farmers remuneration for their produce. Our government has ensured that farmers get the farm produce paycheck directly in their bank accounts. Even Punjab has not been able to do it so far. I hope when the assurance for minimum support price to farmers is given in black and white by the Centre, farmers will be quite satisfied,” he said on Thursday. Professor Ashutosh Kumar, who teaches political science at Panjab University, Chandigarh, says Dushyant and the JJP has done long term damage to their credibility by not being loud in expressing their support to the farmers. “That’s the least he could have done. By siding with the BJP led central government, he has landed himself in a difficult situation. Dushyant claims the legacy of farmer leader Chaudhary Devi Lal but by not taking an open stand, he has damaged himself politically,” professor Kumar said. He said the fact that JJP MLAs are speaking a different language showed that the leadership is under a cloud in the party. “The JJP looks like a party still in the making. It also shows that the MLAs are worried about their political career if they do not take position in favour of the farmers, given the visible anger. Another political expert said Haryana government’s handling of the agitation has not gone well with the farmers. “When water cannons were fired at the farmers, the deputy CM kept mum. He cannot absolve himself from the responsibility,” he said. A game of calculationsEven as the pressure mounts on Dushyant to pull out from the alliance, the first time MLA has chosen to bide his time and allow the storm to pass. “The age is on his side. He is just 32 and will have long innings in politics. Right now, his priority will be to strengthen the JJP – politically as well as financially. Being the deputy chief minister has given him that platform. He would not like to squander this opportunity,” said one of his top rung rivals in the state. Also, the fact that assembly elections are a good four years away is a factor playing in the minds of the top JJP leadership. Professor Kumar says Dushyant would know that if he pulls out of the alliance, his party MLAs might switch sides to join the BJP.

Therefore, we have decided to provide the same facility to the protesting farmers here,” he added.Amandeep Singh, a farmer from Ludhiana, said donors have been providing them almond, raisins, desi ghee and other items in quintals to prepare such recipes for farmers, who are protesting in the cold since last 16 days.“Most donors remain anonymous and are providing us back up support. We have been giving mixed almond and raisin (a mixture of seven items) to the protesters. Due to the dip in temperature, young farmers have been taking care of the elderly. In the coming days, we will arrange heating facilities for them,” he added.Two farmers, both from Haryana’s Fatehabad district, have provided a roti-making machine at the Singhu-Kundli border and a washing machine at Tikri border.“We donated a washing machine because the elderly protesters were struggling to wash their clothes. We washed over 50 pair of clothes on Friday. Our volunteers prepare around 1,600-1,700 rotis per day. We have never seen such support in an agitation,” both the farmers said.Haryana youths have also started providing carrot and orange juice to farmers at Tikri border. Besides, several protesters have set up solar charging panels, mobile toilets, blankets and fruits, medical facilities. Khalsa Aid India has installed foot and leg massaging machines for farmers and pictures of the same were shared on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agitating-farmers-get-energy-boosting-food-as-mercury-dips/story-KKkURldRXkhbxvrXX3dniJ.html

Allopathy doctors kept their non-emergency work closed and medical students from government and private medical colleges and post graduate students also participated in the strike, said an IMA statement. The doctors have declared a strike to oppose the central government’s decision to allow Ayurvedic doctors to perform surgeries. IMA, in a statement, said, “All the emergency services were carried out smoothly. Our doctors did not carry out any protest or public demonstrations today. We are thankful to all the associations of modern medicine and all the 45,000 members of IMA Maharashtra.” The Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) on November 20 declared that Ayurveda graduates with BAMS in their postgraduate education will be given training in 58 surgeries from modern medicine. The Indian Medical Association has strongly opposed this at national level. Reasons for IMA’s opposition is that giving Sanskrit names to these surgeries is misleading and not factual. The IMA has now demanded that the notification of CCIM should be withdrawn and that the four committees of NMC should be dissolved immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ima-s-nationwide-wide-strike-sees-clinics-shut-in-pune-as-well/story-k7ecDP7JEAUJhT1fLZqfpO.html

11-12-2020||Kolkata||‘Opposition is ruthlessly oppressed with police’s assistance in Bengal’: Governor||Lashing out at the Mamata Banerjee government over Thursday’s attack on the convoy of BJP national president JP Nadda, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Friday that any political activity by the opposition is ruthlessly oppressed by the state government with police assistance. The Governor also said that he has a list of 21 senior public servants who are acting as political workers. This list includes names of some senior IPS officials who have been appointed as advisors by the Mamata Banerjee-government, he said. “Any political activity by the opposition in West Bengal is ruthlessly oppressed with police assistance. Alarmingly, police are always on political mode in support of the ruling party. Such oppression climaxed yesterday,” he said while addressing the media at Raj Bhavan on Friday. Taking on the chief minister over the issue of branding a section of political leaders as outsiders, Dhankhar cautioned the chief minister and said that his responsibility come into play when the chief minister deviates from the Constitutional path. Also read: Situation at border over last 6 months result of China’s actions - India“I wish to caution the chief minister. What is meant by outsiders? Where are we heading when we tag Indians as insiders and outsiders? Please don’t play with fire. Stop this game of outsiders and insiders. My responsibility starts when you deviate from the Constitutional path,” he added. A day after Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee, also a TMC MP, attacked Nadda, Dhankhar urged the chief minister and the MP to take back their words and advised that it would increase her stature. “How could a responsible chief minister talk the way she did? In my tweet, I have urged her to think about the grace and depth of Bengali culture and withdraw the video (of her speech) as that would enhance her dignity. Withdrawal of the video with an apology will raise her stature,” he added. For the chief ministers’ nephew, the Governor’s advice was, “He was talking about a person much older to him and occupying a senior political position. It was unavoidable. I am sure he would heed my advice. He has a long political career ahead of him. He must be part of a system of setting high standards.” The chief minister had mocked Nadda in her speech on Thursday saying, “They (BJP) have no other work. At times the home minister is here, other times it’s Chaddha, Nadda, Fadda, Bhaddha. When they have no audience, they call their workers for doing nautanki.” The Governor also accused the chief minister and the state administration of favouritism and corruption. “Non-responsive approach of the CM to critical issues raised by the Governor is a pointer that governance is not in accordance with the rule of law and more importantly this is a cover-up for corruption, nepotism and favouritism,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/opposition-is-ruthlessly-oppressed-with-police-s-assistance-in-west-bengal-governor/story-3iET9fUr7sxWfdkbdXLkVP.html

11-12-2020||Lifestyle||International Mountain Day: Mountaineers make the most of pandemic pause||While most of us felt like hostage when asked to stay indoors due to the pandemic, the mountaineers defied this feeling. They took this break to work harder than the routine and prepared themselves to conquer new peaks once Covid-19 situation improves. On International Mountain Day, today, some Delhi-NCR mountaineers share how mountains became their muse during the pandemic, and instilled motivation and inspiration in them to stay strong. International Mountain DayThis day is celebrated on December 11 every year to create awareness about the importance of mountains to life. It even highlights the opportunities and constraints of mountain development, and builds alliances that will bring positive change to mountain people, and environments around the world.Hisar-based 19-year-old Shivangi Pathak, the youngest Indian female to reach the summit of Mount Everest, says, “I hardly ever spent so much time without being in the mountains before this. Mountains are my inspiration. They give me strength. I have learnt so much from them, and I feel that everyone must spend at least 4-5 days on mountains twice a year. During the pandemic, to keep myself fit, I wake up early in the morning when everyone is asleep and then workout. This routine started in the lockdown, and even now I’m following this regime while maintaining social distancing. I don’t wear mask while working out and that’s why I prefer to practice in the wee hours of morning. In fact, I’m in my hometown and my mother is making such amazing food, but I choose to eat healthy and stay healthy. It’s a challenge to not have that food.”“I do miss the mountains. They have given me hope and aspiration to become better each day like a personal challenge,” says Sangeeta S Bahl, a Gurugram-based mountaineer whose last summit was Mount Everest in 2018. She adds, “Nature is enthralling whilst mountains are majestic form of spirituality. Summits on top of peaks have become the defining moments of my life where adversity, insurmountable challenges became a dream that was captured. Other people seek answers from Mother Nature creating a calmness in a pristine environment. And this is why to find peace all run to the mountains and lap of nature. The pandemic was very effective for me and my husband, who is also a mountaineer.” Sangeeta’s husband, Ankur Bahl, also a mountaineer, opines, “The self-imposed isolation during the pandemic was akin to being in the mountains! Mountains to me are the epitome of sacredness and hope and people love to head to the hills for recharging themselves... All this while (during the pandemic) I’ve been constantly training in our home gym for the North Pole next year, if it so happens. Work from home and now office has kept me busier than usual and family time has been lesser in fact, but I’ve managed to play scrabble and have OTT screen time.” Sangeeta adds, “We both trained ourselves six days a week, not just physically but mentally as well. We bought new gym equipment, shoes for running and lots of books to build our mental strength; I’m also writing my autobiography. I even train aspiring mountaineers, and this year started a nutrition course for myself.”  Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/international-mountain-day-mountaineers-make-the-most-of-pandemic-pause/story-elaYThbL0K98N960u3xY4M.html

11-12-2020||Delhi||Third wave of Covid waning, Delhi still testing over 70,000 a day, says Satyendar Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the third wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was waning in the state, with the positivity rate remaining below 5% for ten days in a row. “The third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi is going down. We can now say that the peak was on November 7 when a positivity rate of 15.26% was recorded. Now, the positivity rate has remained below 5% for ten days,” said Jain in a press briefing. He said, with over 70,000 tests a day, Delhi has been conducting one of the highest tests per million in the country. As of November-end, Delhi reported the highest test per million in the country at over 330,201. The national average stood at 100,159.

But, people need to continue wearing masks and maintaining social distance. It is because people of Delhi have cooperated that we are seeing this result. I also want to thank the healthcare workers who have worked day and night,” the minister said. Delhi has tested over 71,741 samples a day on an average during December, compared to an average of 53,579 during November. Nearly half of these tests were done using the more accurate RT-PCR method. In Delhi, the ratio of tests had been skewed towards the less accurate rapid antigen tests since it was rolled out in mid-June during the first surge in the number of cases. The number of RT-PCR tests had been ramped up in the city in mid-November after a meeting with the Union home minister Amit Shah. “I agree that the reports for the RT-PCR tests, which should be given within 24 hours, is getting delayed in some places and we are trying to strengthen it. When we met with the Centre, we were asked to double RT-PCR testing. We doubled our testing, but the reports were getting delayed. Now, the situation is improving,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/third-wave-of-covid-waning-delhi-still-testing-over-70-000-a-day-says-satyendar-jain/story-R1rJRQO10jTqW1XO160uDM.html

The department would also stop providing any service to such societies, he added. There are a total of 18,200 cooperative societies registered in the state, of which 10,500 are functional, the statement said.These include Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS), Cooperative Labour and Constructions Societies, Cooperative Group Housing Societies, Cooperative House Building Societies and Cooperative Transport Societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-directs-registered-cooperative-societies-to-upload-records-on-website/story-9MIkdIqqMYtUR3Wr0Zu3GI.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- which runs all three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) -- denied the allegations, calling them baseless.“There has been misappropriation of funds to the tune of more than Rs2400 crore in the North Delhi municipal corporation. It concerns payments between the North and the South Delhi municipal corporation. We have ordered a probe into it which will be headed by an additional chief secretary-rank officer in charge of the urban development department of the Delhi government,” said Jain, who holds the health, home and urban development portfolios in Delhi.Also read | LNJP treats 10K Covid patients, Satyendar Jain hails hospital teamHe added, “Rs 2,400 crore is a big amount and such misappropriation is unbelievable, especially when the municipal corporations claim that they are not able to pay salaries to doctors, nurses, teachers, sanitation workers and other employees.”Jain’s allegations and the probe come at a time when mayors of the three MCDs have been protesting outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for more than three days now, demanding disbursement of the funds which, they claim, the Delhi government owes to the civic bodies, against the backdrop of sanitation workers threatening to go into a strike for not getting salaries .When asked about claims by the three MCDs that the Delhi government owes them Rs13,500 crore, Jain said the government has always disbursed payments to the MCDs on time, with no instance of default or delay, in accordance with the applicable finance commission report, and it is the MCDs which owe money to the Delhi government.BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “This is a baseless allegation by AAP to divert attention from the issue concerning the money that they owe to the three municipal bodies. There has been no misappropriation of funds. The south MCD owes Rs2,547 crore to the North MCD as rent for using the premises of the civic centre building in central Delhi which is officially a property of the North civic body. The rent is owed since 2012 when the trifurcation of the MCDs happened. In the current budget of the MCDs, there is also a provision for waiver on the rent payment that is due but it is awaiting approval of the House. The Delhi government can get it probed by any agency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-orders-probe-against-north-mcd-for-alleged-rs2-400-crore-fraud/story-b2DUO7PhxGVImdkWVxzkJN.html
11-12-2020||Pune||Civic sense among onlookers could have saved the gaur, says Pune forest officer Rahul Patil||The forest department was caught in an uncanny situation when an Indian bison (gaur) showed up in city on Wednesday morning. While the foresters were equipped, the sudden experience threw a challenge at them which eventually ended in the death of the wild and shy animal. Following are the excerpts from an interview with district forest officer Rahul Patil, Indian Forest Service officer, who led the rescue operation.What went wrong with the crowd management at the site?An Indian bison had first shown up in Katraj a long time ago. It was after 15-20 years that a gaur shown up again. After reaching the spot at 8 am, even we were not convinced that it was gaur (Indian bison). We cordoned off Mahatma Phule Society. Whatever equipment were required for the operation - net, tranquiliser gun, medicine, antidote - everything was available. At the same time, a mob at Mahatma Phule society was cooperative. When it left the bungalow property, it got injured and we suspect that the animal had received injury even before it strayed to Katraj. He was also unhealthy. Once he crossed over the compound wall, the crowd of watchers increased. Then he crossed the main road and even the police department’s cooperation could not help. What was required was an inherent civic sense among residents, those taking pictures, chasing him, throwing stones at the shy animal. We tried to trap him by the horns at one location, but onlookers were distracting him. This was happening to an animal who was already scared as it had left its natural habitat. The gaur does not harm anyone intentionally, but if it had dashed into anyone, it would have killed 4-5 people instantly.What was the cause of death? The perception was that forest officials could have saved the animal.The cause of death, after the post-mortem, was found to be respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular failure, stress and shock. It had sustained an injury on the nose which had already made breathing difficult. Plus, within a short period, it ran about 4-5km distance. There was internal bleeding and the body temperature was up too. As far as role of forest officials was concerned, I was part of an operation where a tigress called Shivni had killed six people and there were orders to shoot that animal. Shooters were ready too, but I did not allow them to kill the animal. Why would I do something to jeopardise this animal’s life? In fact, the regional forest officer had said that he will handle the situation and my presence was not required. During the rescue operation, I was standing near a fire brigade vehicle and the bison was near a Scorpio just in front of the fire brigade vehicle. I knew it was there but I could not sense or see him. I was trying to tell the fire officer to move him with the help of water, but it ran in my direction. Had I been even one step ahead, the dash could have been fatal. How did a bison landed in Pune city?We need to realise that the forest department can bring about restrictions only in some areas. But there are hills which are privately owned forest areas where construction has started. Subsequently, we have disturbed the wild habitat of these animals. Gaurs can be found in Tamhini ghat where construction of resorts and other buildings has happened. The corridors of these animals - the routes that provide connection between two locations - have been disturbed. The natural corridors passing through Mumbai, Lonavla, Kolhapur, Radhanagari and other areas have been destroyed. How should we prepare for such a situation?Today, it was a gaur, tomorrow it could very well be a leopard. We can only try to talk to people, not the animals. Leopards have already started showing up in Bhilarewadi area of Katraj. There is construction activity in that area. From Bhilwarewadi to Swargate is barely 10km, leopard can easily cross it. This was a major learning experience. Irrespective of NGOs, we are creating a ward-wise volunteer base of 5-10 people. We are planning to register their details like phone number. There is a golden hour after sighting. These people may save casualties in that period before foresters can reach the spot. They will be trained in wildlife management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/an-inherent-civic-sense-among-onlookers-could-have-saved-the-gaur/story-DCh1k2mWsq8ciheozYc3DJ.html
11-12-2020||Pune||Parents protest against Pune schools overcharging fees||The parents’ association in Pune organised a protest in the front of the central building on Thursday against overcharging of fees by private schools. Talking about their demands, advocate Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents’ Association, said that the schools have violated the norms of Right to Education (RTE) and the issues faced by parents should be addressed by the education department.“We want solutions to our problems. Many parents are facing salary cuts and layoffs. In the middle of the pandemic, how can these schools expect us to pay huge amounts of fees when most of the facilities are not even availed by students because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Only the tuition fees should be charged from students,” said Sahai.Kalidas Jadhav from the Parents’ Association, Pune, said that the authorities have not responded to the problems faced by parents.“Schools are forcing parents to issue post-dated cheques to pay the fee for the whole year. The student should pay for services what they are using, which is just the tuition fee. We are also demanding that this year should be declared a zero year, so that no student loses on the academic curriculum,” said Jadhav.Laxmi Sapkal, a parent, said that if the government schools were better, there would be no need to admit our children to private schools. “We are willing to give government schools the fees required, provided they improve the quality of education and provide sports facilities to the children, so that the holistic development of the child happens,” said Sapkal.Speaking during the protest, a parent on the condition of anonymity shared that many schools are not providing login details if the yearly fees is not paid. “Most of the parents have at least two children. The school is charging fees for libraries and sports as well. Financial condition of parents has deteriorated during the pandemic. Moreover, we are forced to pay the fee for the entire year otherwise our children are harassed during online classes,” said the parent. Dinkar Temkar, joint director of primary education, said that the parents were assured that relevant actions will be taken soon.“Schools which have stopped online education of selective students, who have not paid full fees, should start the online classes. Also, students who have been removed from private schools during the pandemic should be readmitted to schools immediately. We will be giving normal notices regarding the same very soon,” said Temkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/parents-protest-against-pune-schools-overcharging-fees/story-nvdjTLVBNevPJwvk9FN0JM.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||11 years on, consumer panel asks Mumbai woman to approach civil court with her grievance||It took 11 years for the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to ask a Mulund resident, who had approached the commission stating that her ornaments worth Rs1.30 crore were stolen from the locker of a nationalised bank, to approach a civil court with her grievances. This matter is not such as can be aptly adjudicated on merit in summary proceedings by a quasi-judicial forum like the consumer commission, said NCDRC presiding member Dinesh Singh. NCDRC asked Saroj Dasani to approach the civil court concerned, saying the matter is best undertaken by a civil court as it required recording of extensive oral and documentary evidence. In her complaint, Dasani had said that she had opened a locker at the Mulund (West) branch of the State Bank of Bikaner in June 2008, and had kept some important papers and valuables, like diamond jewellery, in it. When she visited the bank the next month, she had forgotten her set of keys on the desk of the bank’s locker in-charge. So she went back to the bank, checked the contents of her locker and found everything in order.But on November 17, 2008, when she visited the bank again and opened the locker, she found it was completely empty and all her documents and valuables were missing, said her complaint. She immediately lodged a complaint in writing with the branch manager. The complainant believed that someone had made duplicate keys of her locker during the time that her keys were left at the bank. Blaming the bank for the theft, Dasani said the locker cannot be opened without the master key, which is in the possession of a bank officer and hence, the bank was responsible for the theft of her valuables worth Rs1.30 crore. The bank responded to the complaint, contending that the locker was also being operated independently by complainant’s husband. The bank also asserted that the matter required adjudication of issues that involve disputed questions of facts and therefore the matter should not be adjudged in summary proceedings before the consumer commission, but by a civil court. NCDRC accepted the bank’s contention and returned the complaint, with liberty to the complainant to move a competent civil court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/11-years-on-consumer-panel-asks-mumbai-woman-to-approach-civil-court-with-her-grievance/story-T2VkwYUwtbirkyWwCJaOFL.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks state govt stand on plea against price cap on RTPCR tests||The Delhi High Court Friday sought the AAP government’s response on a plea challenging its decision fixing a cap of Rs 800 on RTPCR tests for detecting Covid-19 infection in the national capital.Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the plea by an Association of Practising Pathologists which has contended that the price fixed would not cover the cost of consumables to be used in the test.The association also contended that the price cap cannot be made applicable to TrueNat and CBNAAT tests, which are also used to detect Covid-19 infection, as they use cartridges which are very expensive.It further said that sensitivity of TrueNat and CBNAAT was 98% and 100%, respectively, which were much higher than that of RTPCR open ended system test which stood at 67-70%.It also said that approximate costs incurred by the labs on TrueNat and CBNAAT tests were Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,500, respectively and were higher than the amount of Rs 1,200 for RTPCR.The Delhi government, represented by its standing counsel Ramesh Singh and additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that the price cap was not applicable to CBNAAT and TrueNAT tests as these are different from RTPCR.The court also noted that the three tests are not common and hence a common price cannot be fixed for them.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) is a recently introduced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method for detection of TB.TrueNat is an indigenously developed portable version of CBNAAT and was also meant for detecting tuberculosis (TB).The association, in its petition, has sought quashing of the November 30 notification of the Delhi government capping price of RTPCR tests at Rs 800.It has claimed that ‘the continuance of the unreasonable price cap, would force the labs to compromise on quality of kits and testing standards and such actions would be counter-productive in the fight against Covid and the health of the residents of Delhi”.During the hearing, Singh told the court that the association ought to have first moved a representation to the Delhi government regarding their concerns before rushing to the court.He said that had they done so, they would have found out that the price cap was not applicable to TrueNat and CBNAAT tests.Singh and Narayan further told the court that even the association’s concern over the price cap of Rs 800 could have been considered had they moved a representation.They also told the court that a similar issue was being considered by the Supreme Court and therefore, the petitioners could have filed an application in the apex court.The court, however, said the notification in question was not before the top court.The court, while listing the matter for hearing on February 25, 2021, declined to go into the prayer in the petition with regard to alleged delay in clearance of bills of the private labs by the Delhi government which outsources tests to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-state-govt-stand-on-plea-against-price-cap-on-rtpcr-tests/story-t8M4RecoZDMxv9yGU9oSnJ.html

11-12-2020||Chandigarh||Non-emergency services come to halt at private medical institutes in Punjab||Non-emergency services at private medical institutes across Punjab came to a halt on Friday after the Indian Medical Association (IMA) gave a call to protest the Centre’s decision to allow post-graduate practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda to be trained to perform general surgeries. IMA members said that only Covid or other essential medical interventions such as casualty, labour rooms and emergency surgeries, will be addressed by the doctors for 12 hours from 6am on Friday. Allopathic doctors are up in arms against a central government notification on an amendment to the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) Act that allows Ayurvedic practitioners to practise modern medical practices. Also read: More than 1 lakh doctors on strike across Maharashtra todayIMA state general secretary Dr Paramjit Singh Mann described the notification as “a step to legitimise mixopathy”. He said allopathic doctors are fighting to “save the honour of the noble profession”. The contentious notification will not just kill the legacy of modern medicine but also pollute the sanctity of the Ayurveda system, he argued. “We have nearly 9,000 doctors as IMA members who have announced to suspend work in protest. Ayurvedic practitioners are not educated to perform modern medicine then how can they be allowed to work in that way. We want the Union government to withdraw the amendment,” said Dr Mann. The president of the IMA’s Bathinda chapter, Dr Vikas Chhabra, said 120 private hospitals in the district have extended support to the call for protest. He said the IMA is not against Ayurveda but the undermining of modern medicine by the Centre. “The notification of the amendment to the CCIM Act allows Ayurveda doctors to do over 55 types of surgeries, including abdominal, ENT and eye operations. One wonders how Ayurvedic doctors can perform surgeries in the absence of anaesthesia and antibiotics in Ayurveda,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/non-emergency-services-come-to-halt-at-private-medical-institutes-in-punjab/story-GsKWzae0t2B3xZ6CTbfaxK.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi and Yogi Adityanath’s former Lok Sabha constituency Gorakhpur are both in Purvanchal.The UP planning department and the DDU university organised the webinar comprising 45 sessions, to be attended by the chief minister, ministers, development experts, researchers and other stakeholders.“The region has everything to offer: nine kinds of climate, the most fertile land in the world, abundant human resources, adequate water and flowing rivers like the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Saryu and more. With such resources, we have resolved to turn this region into the most developed and most prosperous one in the country,’’ he said.“This will not be done by Harvard or Cambridge, but (we) will have to do this with the help of youth, farmers, and local artisans,’’ he said.Also Read: Yogi Adityanath says UP close to defeating Covid-19, claims model worthy of studyReferring to the state government’s One District, One Product (ODOP) scheme, he said, “Every district has at least one unique product.

Each one has a capacity of 225 litres,” said Dr MK Singh, in-charge of routine immunisation.Asked about the storage capacity of the fridges, he said, “It is still early days to talk about the number of vials per box.” Likewise, Dr Singh said, the number of ILRs that will eventually be required cannot be mentioned right away. The picture should get clearer in the days to come, he added.The ILRs, after they reached the Aishbagh cold chain storage point, were kept in the building beside the Urban Health Centre and Woman and Child Hospital. This building has been prepared exclusively to store the vaccine and a space of 2,400-sq feet has been earmarked for the ILRs and cold chain boxes. In addition to the building, two residential blocks have also been acquired nearby for vaccine storage. “With the arrival of ILRs, our cold chain system will soon be in place as we already have temperature controlled systems at all places where routine vaccination is done,” said Dr DS Negi, director general, medical health. “We have dedicated the ground and first floor for storing the vaccine,” said Dr Singh. The ILRs have compartment temperature between 2 degrees Celsius and 8 degrees Celsius for storing vaccine vials. The first round of vaccination will be for healthcare workers and their list is being prepared. The list has already crossed the 40,000-mark and should be final by next week. “Those in the frontline, including policemen and municipal corporation staff, will be vaccinated in the second phase and the next will be the elderly (above 50 years of age),” said Dr Singh. There are about 14,000 municipal corporation staff and approximately 20,000 policemen, including traffic police personnel and home guards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/special-fridges-to-store-covid-19-vaccine-arrive-in-lucknow/story-pbsvxJKGlzzn8HHZQpCsgP.html

11-12-2020||Patna||900 Bihar farmers to miss out on govt subsidy for stubble burning||In a bid to discourage stubble burning, the Bihar government has initiated strict action against 900 farmers in the last three months post paddy harvesting season by blocking government incentives and subsidies paid through direct benefit transfer( DBT) for three years in 11 districts. Bihar is the only state in India where such a system has been put in place since last year, linking government incentives for farmers with compliance to the ban on stubble burning– a major factor for air pollution. Total 1.64 crore farmers are registered with the State agriculture department for DBT transfers. With 462 penalised farmers, Rohtas district tops the list of offenders who have been denied the DBT assistance, followed by 133 in Kaimur and 100 in Nalanda, shows data assessed from the agriculture department. Rohtas and Kaimur are the major paddy growing districts in Shahabad region. Other districts where farmers have faced action include Buxar (93), Bhojpur (21), Patna (33), Gaya (40) and Jamui (7). The blocking of subsidy transfers by the government means the farmers will not get aid for procuring farm equipment, input subsidy etc, which are directly transferred to the accounts of farmers registered with the state agriculture department. “The aim of blocking the DBT to farmers is to disincentivise the practice of stubble burning. The exercise has been undertaken by strict monitoring of the farm lands by our agriculture coordinators and kisan mitras, who report about erring farmers from remote areas,” said, secretary, agriculture, N Saravana Kumar. Kumar said the government was not in the favour of filing FIRs against erring farmers but the blocking of DBT could turn out to be an effective method.“We are doing awareness programmes in the districts to tell the farmers how burning of crop-residue not only causes air pollution but is also bad for the soil as it damages the micro nutrients in the soil,” Saravana said. Last year, DBT to 376 farmers were blocked after the post-Kharif season and this year, post Rabi season in February- March, 625 farmers were blocked.“This system of blocking DBT to farmers is only in practice in Bihar. It is proving effective as farmers cannot get benefits for three years, which is a long time,” said a senior agricultural officer. Stubble burning is rampant during the post Kharief and Rabi crop season harvesting, when farmers burn the waste to dispose of the crop residue, causing air pollution. Delhi and other cities, especially in north India, have been grappling with extreme air pollution caused by stubble burning. Also Read: Bad-air law drafted, cleared in less than a weekIn Bihar, the problem of stubble burning may not have reached alarming levels like in Haryana and Punjab but farmers have been using the practice more in the last few years due to huge residue left in the farms after the harvest due to wider use of combine harvesters. “In Bihar and other states, the growing mechanisation of farming has led to heavy stubble burning in the last few years as the waste generated is huge post harvest by equipments, Besides, farmers are not much interested in keeping husk for sale as there is less demand for it in rural areas these days due to less focus on animal rearing,” said Dr Bihari Singh, environmentalist and co-ordinator, environmental sciences, Nalanda Open University. Also Read: Confronting everyday sources of pollution across the countryHe listed the ill-effects of stubble burning. “Smoke from the crop residue emits heavy quantities of carbon dioxide, suspended particulate matter and other harmful particles that affect the air quality index (AQI). It is one major reason for air pollution in cities and towns in the state,” Singh added.Singh said the practice of burning of crop residue could be checked if the government encourages farmers to make compost through short-term methods after harvesting as it would enrich the soil and cause less air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/900-bihar-farmers-to-miss-out-on-govt-subsidy-for-stubble-burning/story-viw4jYJZjcmjG948WLfECJ.html

But so far, the names of the committees have not been sent to us,” the RJD leader said in a letter, which was issued to the press by the party.Also Read: Nitish Kumar reviews law and order for second time in 10 days as crime spikes“The RJD requests that the names of committees be sent so that recommendations of party MLAs for such committees as representatives and heads could be sent,” the Yadav scion said.Political observers said that the RJD’s move to put conditions before sending names for the formation of various committees indicates it may not be in any mood to allow the panels to be set up by consensus, as has been the tradition.The RJD could be resorting to pressure politics to ensure party’s senior leaders get chairmanship in key legislative committees, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/rjd-lays-condition-for-nominating-mlas-for-bihar-house-committees-logjam-continues/story-ncLaxmtjw7XWoWhEo0EKkM.html

The man, in his complaint, told the police that his eldest son Arjun was missing and that he suspected his wife Geeta had either abducted his son or might have killed him. “When police went to search the house, they found a skeleton from the terrace. The skeleton is believed to be that of Arjun. Geeta has been arrested,” said a top official of Bidhannagar police. Some black stains were found on the floor of the ground floor which cops said could be caused by burning something. Ashes were also found on the staircase leading to the terrace. The couple was married at least 32 years ago and had three children – Arjun, 25, Vidur, 22 and Vaidehi, 20.

11-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi records its third warmest December day in 14 years||After experiencing colder than usual October and November, Delhi started off with a warmer December this year, with the maximum temperatures hovering between 28 and 29 degrees Celsius for the past two days. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 29 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for the national Capital. This was the third highest maximum temperature in December in the past 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The record for the warmest December day was set in 2014, when the mercury rose to 30 degrees Celsius. A few years before that, in 2011, December had recorded the maximum temperature at 29.5 degrees Celsius, taking it to the second spot in 14 years.On Thursday, the maximum temperature was 28.3 degree Celsius, which is four degrees above the season’s normal. IMD scientists said the absence of cloud cover was causing the day temperatures to spike. “The absence of cloud cover has led to the temperature rising during the day. From December 14, the temperatures are likely to fall again. This will be after Delhi and NCR towns receive light rain because of the impact of western disturbance on December 11 night and December 12 morning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-its-third-warmest-december-day-in-14-years/story-zQAj0JBOWL7oVZxya1MgiJ.html

The VB will submit its report in two weeks, following which action will be initiated. The contract of the project was given to Simplex Infrastructure Private Limited. A team of 15 officers including executive engineers reached the spot at around 9.30am and carried out inspection till 7pm.In 2018, the members of the Purab Premium Allottee Association had lodged a complaint with the VB alleging that GMADA had used sub-standard material in the construction of the apartments. Whatever they promised in the brochure before they had invited applications were not there in the detailed notice inviting tenders (DNIT). They had also raised objections against a huge financial irregularity during the construction.They alleged that in the brochure it was stated that there will be no water tank on the roof and 24X7 pressurised water supply will be available. As per the brochure, all the towers should be separated, but GMADA has joined six to eight towers together and there are 27 towers and four blocks.Col Dalwinder Singh (retd), general secretary of the association, said, “The team found major discrepancies and inadequacies, and samples are being collected by the team.”A senior official of the VB, who was part of the team, said, “We have collected most of the documents pertaining to the construction of the flats. People have lodged complaints as they feel that despite spending lakhs they have been cheated by GMADA.”He further said, “We are hopeful of preparing the report in the next two weeks, following which action will be initiated.”In 2017, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had constructed 1,620 apartments of three types in Sector 88. Of these, 980 houses have already been allotted of which 590 allottees have taken possession. The project has 27 towers of 60 flats each, a community centre and a sports complex with indoor and outdoor sports facilities.There are around 700 flats that are also falling into disrepair due to non-occupation and use. Further, there have been many incidents of violence and affray in the recent past in the complex.Purab Premium lacks basic amenitiesResidents of Purab Premium Apartments, Sector 88, Mohali, protested outside the office of GMADA on May 21 to raise the issue of poor civic amenities.Purab Premium Apartments Allottees’ Association president SK Loona said, “The apartments are grappling with civic issues. We do not even have basic amenities.”“The GMADA has installed a low-capacity and poor-quality water tank on the top floors of the building. The tanks are unable to bear the pressure of water, resulting in breakdown,” said Loona, adding that the authority had recently replaced only seven water tanks despite the demand being much larger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/use-of-sub-standard-material-at-mohali-s-purab-premium-apartments-punjab-vigilance-to-submit-report-in-two-weeks/story-5SQsWp3q2tC4hy8nxKtSFM.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Shahnawaz’s private rose garden||All roses here are white, though some have a pale pink flush, as if a drop of blood had spread through their veins. This is a private garden. What makes it unique is that it stands on one of Old Delhi’s highly perched rooftops, on the fourth floor, and gives a sweeping view of the historic quarter’s skyline. Look there! That’s the dome of the great Jama Masjid.And above your head, the Walled City’s ubiquitous paltu (pet) pigeons are crisscrossing their hyperlocal sky.But strangely these views, so celebrated in stories and movies, don’t seem as fascinating as these commonplace potted roses. Indeed, these blossoms appear to encapsulate the very essence of the lives of the people living here. As for the flowers themselves, they must feel pretty special to be here, for the area is so cramped and crowded, so tree-less, that it is hard to imagine any flowery refuge in the vicinity. This little rose garden was set up a decade ago by Shahnawaz Khan, an MCD (Municipal Council of Delhi) staffer, who lives with his family, composed of his father, sister, wife and children. He is in the office at the moment, and his sister Mahvish is leading the way to the rooftop escape. The garden has more than just the roses. The metal jaali that shields the dangerously steep metallic staircase is covered with money plant vines. One side of the roof has tulsi plants, an aloe vera plant, and a madhumalti. There’s a tiny lemon tree too, growing out of a pot, with dark green lemons hanging on it.The house is reached from the street by a long flight of staircases. The roof of roses lies two floors above the main residence. Sitting here in the afternoon gives a sense of great isolation from the world. Neighbourhood life shows up sporadically only—a woman is combing her long black hair on some adjacent roof, a goat is bleating on another one and an eagle is perched on a dish antenna. Flocks of birds are passing overhead frequently, their shadows momentarily crossing the surface of the roof.Now, the silent Mahvish plucks a rose. Her hand is decorated with henna—“from a cousin’s wedding, a week ago.”Truth be told, you won’t learn anything about her life from these perfectly ordinary roses, nor about the lives of the others inhabitants of this hauntingly beautiful mansion. And yet, somehow, the flowers bring you closer to their intimate world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-shahnawaz-s-private-rose-garden/story-DxdcuvI4F1OgBpAZKt0cpI.html

11-12-2020||Kolkata||Nadda convoy attacked in Bengal, MHA seeks report||The convoy of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda was attacked in West Bengal’s South 24-Parganas district, the party said on Thursday, triggering a sharp rebuttal from the state government and prompting the Union home ministry to seek a report into the matter that turned out to be the latest flashpoint in the politically charged state that will go to polls in early-2021.The BJP said some of its frontline leaders as well as workers sustained injuries after being assaulted by the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress at Shirakol in Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. TV news footage showed stones raining on the convoy and shattering windshields. Vehicles of some media houses were damaged.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, its national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were hit by stones and shards of glass from shattered windows and windshields of their cars, according to the party.Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh condemned the incident. Both of them called up the BJP president, state leaders said. The home ministry also asked state governor Jagdeep Dhankar to submit a report on law and order situation in the state and steps taken by the Trinamool government to maintain peace.“The attack on BJP president JP Nadda is condemnable. No matter how much we condemn, it will not be enough. The Centre is taking this very seriously. The West Bengal government will be answerable to the peace-loving people of the state for this,” Shah tweeted in Hindi.“Bengal has sunk into the darkness of lawlessness and oppression during the Trinamool Congress regime. The manner in which political violence is being taken to its limit in West Bengal it is painful and a matter of concern for people who have faith in democracy,” he added. Nadda, who visited Diamond Harbour as part of his two-day trip to the state, said West Bengal had plunged into a state of lawlessness, and appealed to BJP workers to ensure the party’s win in the upcoming assembly elections. The incident took place in the afternoon, when he was on his way to his destination a day after meeting voters in Bhawanipore, the chief minister’s assembly constituency in south Kolkata. “These two constituencies are the fountains of corruption and intolerance,” Nadda said. The BJP leadership alleged that the attack was planned to foil Nadda’s programme and there were no policemen along the highway connecting Kolkata to Diamond Harbour, a distance of 52 km. But CM Banerjee hit back, saying the attack was staged by the BJP to draw public attention.“They staged it to show people that they are being attacked. Why did they have 50 cars in the convoy? I move with only three. What were the cars in the tail end of the convoy doing? How could videos be made and circulated so fast? What were the central police force personnel, who accompany BJP leaders, doing at that time? I challenge this. I have asked the administration to inquire,” she said. Responding to this, Nadda said in the evening: “Mamata Ji knows nothing about administration. The central force personnel accompanying us only protect us. They do not stop stone-throwers on the streets.” Addressing a rally at Arambagh in Hooghly district in the afternoon, Abhishek Banerjee ridiculed Nadda. “Today Nadda fell into a gadda (pothole) at Diamond Harbour. What can I do if common people’s anger finds an expression in outrage? The BJP spreads fear and violence, but in Bengal they have lost balance...” Urban development minister Firhad Hakim said the BJP did not even inform the state government about the movement of its leaders. “The central government provides security cover to Nadda and other leaders. If they had asked for security cover from us, we would have arranged it,” he said. The state police said in a statement nothing happened to Nadda’s cavalcade. “Shri JP Nadda, National President, BJP reached safely at the venue, Diamond Harbour, South 24 Pgs. Nothing happened to his convoy. Few bystanders at Debipur, Falta PS, Diamond Harbour PD, sporadically and suddenly threw stones towards vehicles trailing long behind his convoy. Everyone is safe and situation is peaceful. Matter is being investigated to find out actual happenings,” the force tweeted. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had a scheduled meeting with the chief secretary and director general of police at 6pm. “CS @MamataOfficial & DGP @WBPolice called on me today at 6 PM. Unfortunately, neither came with any update on pending issues or regarding attack on convoy of BJP President JP Nadda. Their continued non responsive stance signals failure of constitutional machinery in the State,” Dhankhar tweeted after the meeting. BJP leaders fanned out across the state to protest against the incident. Roads were blocked at several places. Demonstrators got into a scuffle with policemen in Howrah town. Two police personnel and two BJP workers were injured. With elections approaching, the political temperature in Bengal is on the rise. The BJP has set a target of winning over 200 of the 294 seats in the upcoming polls in the state, which is often in news for political violence. In the 2011 assembly elections, the BJP failed to win a single seat and got a vote share of around 4%. In 2016, it did better, winning three seats and bagging a vote share of around 10%. Buoyed by the Lok Sabha performance last year (18 out of 42 seats), the BJP is now focusing on the issues of corruption and nepotism, lack of employment, and law and order in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/nadda-convoy-attacked-in-bengal-mha-seeks-report/story-0dtxBJtwkHLikzxooSDt7K.html

11-12-2020||City||1,100 visitors turn up as Chhatbir Zoo reopens after nine months||Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park, popularly known as Chhatbir Zoo, reopened after a gap of nine months on Thursday, welcoming 1,100 visitors on the first day. As part of safety protocols against Covid-19, the zoo will be allowing 2,700 visitors per day for now. Before, it was closed on March 16 in view of the pandemic, the zoo saw a daily footfall of nearly 3,000. The main attraction on Thursday was white tigress Diya’s three cubs – Amar, Arjun and Dilnoor, who were born on November 17 last year. Most of the visitors flocked around their enclosure, enchanted by the two male and one female cubs, who have an orange coat unlike their mother. Zoo field director M Sudhagar said, “We are happy with the response on Thursday and are hopeful of more footfall during the weekend.” He added that they were following the standard operating procedure to ensure the safety of visitors, employees, workers and animals. The zoo will remain open from 9.30am to 4.30pm on six days (Monday closed). Before it was closed in March, it was earning nearly Rs 1.8 lakh a day, and hence, suffered losses to the tune of Rs 5 crore over the past nine months. Hoping to become self-reliant in the next two years, zoo authorities say it will take at least six months to recover from the losses. One of the largest zoos in India, Chhatbir Zoo is spread over 505 acres of forest area in Mohali and is home to around 1,500 animals and birds, including five adult tigers and three cubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-100-visitors-turn-up-as-chhatbir-zoo-reopens-after-nine-months/story-R1ZAFWKSy9VSYZkRO8c7NO.html

11-12-2020||Chandigarh||Ongoing farmers’ agitation holding up appointment of Punjab Congress office-bearers||The ongoing farmers’ protests against the three agriculture marketing laws are holding up the appointment of office-bearers of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat, who was in Chandigarh on Thursday to meet chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and others, said the appointment of new panel is taking time as the party cannot distract its leaders from the fight being waged by the farmers. “The farmers are fighting for their land and livelihood, and the Congress leaders are making efforts to identify with them without any self-interest,” he said. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had dissolved the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee and all district committees in the state in January this year, retaining the state unit president Sunil Jakhar, to pave the way for its restructuring ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Rawat’s predecessor Asha Kumari had sent a list of office-bearers in consultation with Jakhar, but she was replaced before it could be finalised. Rawat, a former chief minister of Uttarakhand and five-time former MP, took charge in September and has held a series of meetings with the party MPs, MLAs and other leaders for feedback. The AICC general secretary said when he took charge, there were three tasks on his priority list – unity, organisational structure and elections to urban local bodies. “The first task is more or less complete as Capt Amarinder, (former minister) Navjot Singh Sidhu and (Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh) Bajwa are in dialogue. The party set-up will be finalised as and when things settle down,” he said. The party is also fully geared up for the local body polls and will announce its candidates once the election schedule is decided by the state government, he added. On the farmers’ agitation, Rawat said the Centre should accept the protesters’ demands and take back all three laws. “This is a people’s movement and the Congress is lending its support to a just cause by cooperating with and facilitating the farmers. Both Capt and Jakhar are well-recognised for taking up the issues of farmers and it works to the advantage of the party,” he said. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) do not have the farmers’ trust, he further said. “(Former CM) Parkash Singh Badal could have made a difference earlier, but (SAD president) Sukhbir Singh Badal has not been able to identify himself with the farmers. Also, they continued in the NDA government even after the farm ordinances were promulgated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-stir-holding-up-appointment-of-punjab-congress-office-bearers/story-nCgbjPnAMuIPNRRE9mvJFN.html
11-12-2020||City||Magisterial probe ordered into 40-year-old alleged carjacker’s death in police encounter at Amritsar||The district administration in Amritsar has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death of a 40-year-old alleged car snatcher in a police encounter on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway near Manawala village on Tuesday night. Inderjit Singh, a resident of Hoshiarpur who was accused of snatching an SUV in Haryana, succumbed to the bullet injuries at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital the same night. Sub-divisional magistrate (Amritsar-1) Vikas Hira on Thursday initiated the probe on the directions of deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira after the victim’s family termed the incident as “a fake encounter”. On Tuesday evening, the Amritsar commssionerate police’s crime investigation agency (CIA) unit had set up a checkpoint near the Manawala toll plaza which is under the jurisdiction of the rural police. The CIA team claimed to have got information from the Haryana Police that Inderjit was coming towards Amritsar after snatching a Toyota Fortuner in Ambala. The barricading was done without informing the rural police, it is learnt. The CIA unit members claimed that they opened the fire to save their lives after Inderjit tried to run over them with the SUV. The post-mortem on the 40-year-old’s body was conducted on Thursday by a board of three doctors at Amritsar civil hospital under SDM Hira’s supervision. “I have started the probe. The report will be submitted within three months,” the SDM said. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Jandiala, Sukhwinderpal Singh, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place, said, “Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya had written to the DC who then ordered to conduct a magisterial probe. The SDM also visited the crime spot.”“Efforts are on to collect the footage of the closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed at the toll plaza. So far, the victim’s family has not lodged a complaint against the policemen involved in the firing,” he added. On Thursday morning, the family wrote to the SDM demanding that the SUV, CCTV footage from the toll plaza be preserved besides conducting videography of the autopsy.Inderjit’s brother Maninderpal Singh said, “A case of murder should be registered against the guilty cops. Two bullets were pumped into my brother’s body. While the police claim they fired at the SUV’s tyres to stop it, there is no sign of bullets on the tyres. It appears they fired at my brother with an intention to kill him.”Maninderpal claimed that some passersby shot the video of the incident, but the cops got the clips deleted forcibly. “As per the eyewitnesses, they CIA team fired at least six rounds. It was a planned murder,” he said.Inderjit, who worked as a driver for nearly a year after having returned from abroad, is survived by his wife, mother and two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/magisterial-probe-ordered-into-40-year-old-alleged-carjacker-s-death-in-police-encounter-at-amritsar/story-1Dzup6Zt1s8ZDyDV1dRJ9K.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC confirms pre-arrest bail of lawyer accused of being part of ₹7.26-crore cheating conspiracy||The Bombay high court (HC) recently confirmed the October 29 bail order of an advocate and solicitor who was accused of being a part of a conspiracy in which a man and his son were purportedly duped of ₹7.26 crore in exchange for a plot at Lonavla.The advocate, who was involved in preparing the documents of the deal for the main accused, was allowed the bail on the grounds that he was only extending services to his client based on the facts placed before him, and had no role to play in the actual fraud. In an earlier hearing in October, the bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the anticipatory bail plea of advocate Vinod Mistry, was informed that in 2013 a man and his son had decided to buy the Lonavla plot, for which they paid varying amounts to persons who pretended to be owners as well as the tenants (including an NGO) of the plot. The accused had promised that they would relinquish their rights on receiving the payment. As each payment was followed up with memorandum of understanding (MoUs) and agreement deeds made by Mistry on behalf of the recipients, the man and his son did not find anything amiss. The complainants paid ₹7.26 crore till 2015. However, the deal remained pending after that, 2015. Later, they discovered that the land belonged to the government, and the persons who they had paid the amount were tenants. In 2019, they asked the recipients to return the amount. But when they did not get the amount back, they lodged a complaint four months ago against the recipients and arraigned Mistry as a conspirator. The counsel for Mistry informed the bench that he was a practicing advocate and had earned a reputation over 50 years of practice. The bench was informed that Mistry had simply offered services sought from him and that he had no role to play in the conspiracy. The bench was assured that Mistry would cooperate with the police and hence he should be granted anticipatory bail. On November 27, when the matter was heard, additional public prosecutor MM Deshmukh informed the court that Mistry had reported to the police station whenever he was called for investigations and there was nothing left to extract from him. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “In such circumstances, as nothing further is required to be extracted from the present applicant, in my considered opinion, the order dated 29th October 2020 requires a confirmation subject to the same stipulations. However, it is expected that the applicant will co-operate with the investigation and report to the investigating officer as and when called for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-confirms-pre-arrest-bail-of-lawyer-accused-of-being-part-of-7-26-crore-cheating-conspiracy/story-2OpZIfsFiM9NX5v9Sr2maN.html

11-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body schools, gymkhanas to be Covid-19 vaccination points||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to include civic-run schools and gymkhanas as Covid-19 vaccination points to provide faster and better accessibility to immunisation for citizens. Expecting the roll-out of the vaccine next year, BMC plans to immunise one crore of the city’s population in the first phase of the immunisation drive. Around 400 schools and gymkhanas under the civic body will be roped in along with medical colleges, peripheral hospitals and dispensaries for the purpose. “First, we will start vaccination centres at tertiary and secondary care centres. But we will also keep ready schools and gymkhanas under BMC ready if we need more centres,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, adding, “We are already using schools and gymkhanas as Covid care centres (CCC), and therefore there won’t be a problem in converting them into vaccination centres.” Based on the directives of the Union health ministry, the civic body has started preparing the blueprint for the vaccine distribution. BMC has been holding regular meetings with senior health officers, including deans of medical colleges over the vaccination drive. In Mumbai, around 1.25 lakh public and private medical staffers will be provided the first dosage of the vaccine. BMC has already registered their phone and email IDs. Once it receive the vials, each beneficiary will be informed on SMS about the nearby location and time of the vaccination. Once removed from the cold storage, a vial can sustain for around 10 hours. “For now, we’ll provide training to workers from the department of immunisation. They will train those whom we’ll recruit for the mass immunisation process,” said a the health department official. Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has cautioned against the hype about vaccines which are undergoing clinical trials. “The safety of the vaccine has to be tested widely with a large number of volunteers across the globe in different categories such as age groups, gender, race, continents and climate conditions. Any vaccine which is not tested fully with such third-stage clinical trials is not safe,” read the statement issued by Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, IMA Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-schools-gymkhanas-to-be-covid-19-vaccination-points/story-yqus0LmfbNxW22TPTcHC0H.html
11-12-2020||City||J&K DDC polls: High-stake battle in Uri’s Parenpilla seat||In the fifth phase of DDC polls, a seat in north Kashmir’s Uri has become a prestige point for the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) and Congress.Parenpilla, now a coveted seat, went for polls along with the 37 others in J&K on Thursday. Winning this seat is crucial for both National Conference (NC), an alliance partner with PAGD), and Congress. Workers of both the parties made a beeline outside polling stations to cast their votes. At the end of the day, 66.63 percent voting was recorded for this seat.At Garkote, a polling station set up inside a government school, half of the registered voters had exercised their franchise by 1pm. “We have always voted for NC as the party has done a lot for us. Today, we voted in favour of the PAGD candidate from People’s Conference. Only about half of our family voted though. Had it been an NC candidate, all of us would have voted,” said a local businessman.Garkote village is located on the LoC and has been a victim of shelling from Pakistan. At three polling stations in the village, over 3,000 voters are registered and most of them came out to vote.In Machigund, the villagers had been voting since morning. “We have always voted in elections. We hope our the new DDC member, once elected, will construct underground bunkers which were destroyed in 2005 earthquake,” said a village elder.Two-time former minister and senior Congress leader Taj Mohiudin also contested from Parenpilla DDC seat of Uri in Baramulla. Mohiudin was once pitched to be the chief ministerial candidate during PDP-Congress coalition government in J&K. He is facing a tough contest from the PAGD candidate of Sajjad Lone’s Peoples’ Conference.On Tuesday night, police had stopped and questioned a close relative of Mohiudin, near LoC, following allegations that he was distributing money among the voters at Kamalkote.Sajjad Lone accused the administration of trying to hush up a case of money distribution.“Attempts to hush up a case involving distribution of money in Parenpilla, URI, DDC constituency. The constituency goes to polls tomorrow. The L-G has a moral duty to ascertain who all r(are) behind attempts to hush up the case,” Sajjad Lone tweeted late on Tuesday night.Police, however, denied the allegations.“If Taj Mohiudin loses this election, his political career will be over. He chose to contest from this seat as it’s a reserved seat and major chunk of voters belong to the Gujjar community which could tilt the balance in favour of the former minister,” said a local resident of Uri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-ddc-polls-high-stake-battle-in-uri-s-parenpilla-seat/story-pmO4yISaxSzqcPLs7Tj9yK.html

As a part of a nationwide protest, all non-essential, non-Covid and out-patient department (OPD) services at hospitals in the state will be withdrawn from 6am to 6pm. However, all emergency services, including casualty, critical care, intensive care unit (ICU), Covid-19 care, emergency surgeries and labour room, will function as usual.General practitioners, specialists, resident doctors and medical students will take part in the demonstrations across the country.According to a statement issued by the Maharashtra branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), around 15,000 MBBS students from 36 medical colleges and 10,000 postgraduate students, too, will participate in the demonstration. The agitation is supported by 34 specialist organisations, which include the Federation of Gynaecologists (FOGCI), Maharashtra Surgical Society, Physicians Association of India, Indian Association of Paediatricians, Indian Dental Association, Association of Colorectal Surgeons, Indian Radiological and Imaging Association, among others. The Centre’s notification, which has spared the row, was issued on November 20, in which the Central Council of Indian Medicine authorised a post-graduate in Shalyathanthra and Shalakyathanthra to perform 58 general surgical procedures, which include general surgery, urology, surgical gastroenterology, ENT, ophthalmology and dental medicine, among others.“Just by giving some Sanskrit names, Ayurvedic doctors can’t perform surgical procedures. A doctor spends years to gain expertise before operating on any patient. Also, they need approval from and registration with the Indian Medical Council. To raise awareness about the issue among people, we have decided to stop non-Covid, non-essential services on December 11 between 6am and 6pm. But it won’t affect emergency services,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA, Maharashtra. “If an inexperienced doctor operates on a patient, it is like playing with the person’s life.” The IMA has termed it “mixopathy” practice, “which can increase calamities”, as per a statement released by the association. “IMA is not against Ayurveda, our contention is, such mixing of different pathies will be detrimental to the patients and Ayurveda will not grow,” reads the statement issued by IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-than-1-lakh-doctors-on-strike-across-maharashtra-today-emergency-services-won-t-be-hit/story-zwmCEaCn5O1V9soEMXYS6N.html
11-12-2020||City||Roshni Act verdict: SC asks J&K HC to decide review petition on December 21||The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday asked the Jammu and Kashmir high court to decide on December 21 the pleas seeking review of the verdict scrapping the Roshni Act which had conferred proprietary rights on the occupants of the state land.A bench headed by Justice N V Ramana considered the oral assurance of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Jammu and Kashmir administration, that no coercive action will be taken against those petitioners who have approached the top court in the matter as they are not “land grabbers or unauthorised people”.The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, adjourned the hearing of the petitions to the last week of January next year.Meanwhile, the top court asked the J&K High Court to consider the review petitions against the October 9 judgment on December 21.It may be stated here that the review petition is scheduled to come up for hearing before the division bench of the J&K high court on Friday.The SC observed that the pendency of the instant pleas will not come in the way of any petitioners approaching high court in review.The J&K HC has declared the Act void abinitio and directed the CBI inquiry against the land allotments.On Thursday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told court that the J&K government could not come in the way of common people or those who are lawful occupants. “There is no question of that that but land grabbers cannot be spared,” he said.Justice NV Ramana then asked whether an order directing no coercive action be taken during pendency of the proceedings can be recorded. The Solicitor General assured the apex court at this juncture that no such order was necessary.“We have nothing against anybody and illegalities have to be punished. A lot of confusion in this matter though,” Justice Ramana observed.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for one of the petitioners then told court that the Solicitor General’s submission was good enough.Petitioners represented by Rohatgi submitted that the HC struck down the Act in a PIL without hearing the actual land allottees.The HC had held that the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act 2001, popularly known as Roshni Act was completely unconstitutional and all acts done under it or amendments thereunder were also unconstitutional and void ab initio. The bench comprising Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajesh Bindal directed CBI investigation into allegations against former ministers, ex-legislators, bureaucrats, high ranking government and police officials for having encroached upon public lands under the Roshni Act in their favour. Following this, the UT administration sought a review of the judgment, which will be listed on Friday.Roshni Act was passed in 2001 to provide ownership of state land to people who were occupying it after it was introduced in the budget speech of 2000 by then finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather of the National Conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roshni-act-verdict-sc-asks-j-k-hc-to-decide-review-petition-on-december-21/story-zhJwW8rWnduncniv13FwaK.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||What next for Sharad Pawar at 80?||Two days before Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s 80th birthday on December 12, political circles were on Thursday abuzz with speculation that the leader may become the convener of the United Progressive Alliance – a Congress-led coalition – if the Congress agrees to give the post to a non-Congress leader. Currently, Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of the UPA. Pawar’s aides said the NCP chief was approached by a few Congress leaders. The leader, however, denied it. “There is no basis in the reports that Sharad Pawar will be made the UPA chairperson,” Pawar clarified to ABP Majha, a Marathi channel, in the evening. Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar, too, termed the reports “baseless”. NCP leaders, however, said Pawar should be given the responsibility to bring the Opposition parties together, amid the need to put a strong alternative before the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Pawar saheb has the experience and capability. He can also hold the Opposition parties together. The Maharashtra experiment can be tried on the national level. It is the right time to take the call,” said an NCP leader, requesting anonymity. “Pawar saheb came in contact with leaders from other parties when he was the chief minister and has always maintained a cordial relationship with everyone, even if he is a part of the Opposition. He has always been interested in resolving issues and doesn’t mix politics with development. Amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation, he led a delegation, including Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, to President Ram Nath Kovind and urged him to repeal the controversial laws. I don’t know beyond that,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Challenges ahead At the base of the speculation is Pawar’s experiment to bring three parties – Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena – together to wrest power from the BJP in Maharashtra. Pawar’s aides think he can bring more parties to the UPA and create confidence among voters that there could be an alternative to the BJP nationally. But as he turns 80, Pawar, the veteran of many battles, has two major challenges before him. First, to ensure the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state completes its five-year term, which he has been insisting on since the three-party alliance came to power in 2019. Second, to decide who will lead the NCP, as he may not be active in politics after a few years. Since the MVA regime came into existence, at regular intervals, there have been reports that the BJP was planning ‘Operation Lotus’ to dislodge the current dispensation by engineering a large number of defections. The BJP leaders, too, have been saying that the Thackeray-led government won’t last long. “The three-party government sees lack of coordination, but will not fall unless one of the three parties falls out of it, which seems unlikely. On the other hand, most of the legislators who defected to the BJP, to be in power, be it from the Congress or NCP, want to switch sides again. This is why senior BJP leaders have been giving statements that the government will not last,” Bal said.The successor Pawar has groomed many young leaders, including his daughter Supriya Sule, nephew Ajit Pawar and state NCP chief Jayant Patil, who are now the party’s frontline leaders, but who will become his successor is still not clear. Over the years, Ajit has emerged as his political heir, as he was the most popular leader among partymen after senior Pawar. However, there could be a trust deficit between the NCP chief and his nephew, as he tried to split the party last November by joining hands with the BJP to form a government that lasted only 80 hours. “The NCP has a big set of young leaders. I can name many who are acceptable to all – Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Dhananjay Munde. There are many in the party who possess qualities to lead,” Pawar replied to a question in a recent interview. NCP insiders say Ajit is still second-in-command in the party. “Despite his unsuccessful coup, everyone knows Ajit dada is still holding number two position. He is also the most popular leader in the party. No one is denying the contribution of other leaders, but they can’t replace him,” said an NCP leader, requesting anonymity. On the other hand, the rise of Supriya Sule in the party in past few years is an indication that the NCP chief has been grooming his daughter for bigger responsibilities. Sule is now part of the top brass and has a say is major decisions. Some party leaders opine that Pawar may not appoint a clear successor as that would lead to bad blood. It is quite possible that Ajit would not like to work under Supriya’s leadership. “Pawar is never going to retire from active politics. Politics is his oxygen. He has survived big ailments, critical surgeries and still at the age of 80, he is one of the most active leaders in the political sphere,” political analyst Pratap Asbe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/what-next-for-sharad-pawar-at-80/story-FVG7O9nsGTUhALqmijrfGK.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department initiates pilot project for reusing school textbooks||In a bid to encourage students to ‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’ the Maharashtra education department has started a pilot project of passing on the textbooks of students from one batch to another through schools. In a circular issued on Thursday, the department stated that the move aimed at creating awareness about reusing textbooks among students, and thereby reducing the use of paper and saving the environment. “Students who study under schools wherein free textbooks are distributed under the government’s Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan are urged to deposit their old textbooks (for the year 2019-20 or 2020-21) to the school. These books can then be passed on to the students in the following year,” stated the circular. Officials from the state education department said the initiative will first be tested on pilot basis, and can be expanded further after gauging the interest of students and parents. Applauding the move, a civic school teacher from Mumbai’s eastern suburbs, said, “Such a programme will also encourage children to use their textbooks well to make sure they remain good enough for other students to use in the coming years.” Once parents deposit textbooks in schools, the institutes will then send the data of such books to the education officers, following which a detailed report on the response will be collated. Every year, the government spends around over Rs200 crore for printing new textbooks under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. Under the initiative, the state distributes free textbooks to Class 1 to Class 8 students of aided and government run schools. If students reuse their textbooks, the government hopes that these costs can also be saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-initiates-pilot-project-for-reusing-school-textbooks/story-4FsJOnboReJ5WeSR0xI5DO.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to set aside FIR against traders who cheated banana farmers in Jalgaon||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently rejected the criminal application of three persons against whom farmers had lodged complaints of cheating in Jalgaon district. While elaborating the reasons for rejecting the application which sought to quash the first information report (FIR) against the three, the court said that there was an increase in instances of farmers being duped by traders and observed that the inability of farmers to afford litigation was used by traders to exploit them. While also observing that this was one of the reasons which compelled farmers to die by suicide, the court refused to quash the FIR wherein the three applicants were accused of cheating banana farmers by taking their produce but not paying them. On December 7, a division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar, while hearing the application of Mayur Khandelwal, 28, Kailashchandra Khandelwal, 58, and Akil Husonoddin Shaikh, 37, all residents of Raver taluka in Jalgaon district, was informed that the Jalgaon police had registered an FIR against them on July 28, 2017. The three were booked under sections 420 and 406 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), based on the complaint of a woman who is a broker of agricultural produce. As per the complainant Saniya Kadri, she got in touch with the owners of Khandelwal Transporters whose services she used to transport banana produce from Jalgaon district to other places. She alleged that Mayur approached her and assured her that he could get her better prices for the produce. The applicants claimed that she would get larger profits as he would use his contacts with traders who he was in touch with due to his transport business across the country. Kadri claimed that she had arrived at an agreement with Mayur on the aforesaid terms. Kadri’s advocate, SN Suryawanshi submitted that thereafter his client collected bananas from the farmers on the promise that they would be paid in a few days. When it was time to pay, the applicants told Kadri to pay the farmers from her own resources as they needed some time due to a financial crunch. Kadri complied, but thereafter, when she pursued the applicants to pay her, they started avoiding her. Hence she lodged the complaint with Jalgaon police. However, advocate KC Sant for the applicants, said that Kadri had not handed over agricultural produce to his clients for sale. He also submitted that the claim that an amount due to Kadri was more than ₹2.8 crore. Sant added that his clients had only dealt with transport-related transactions with Kadri, and it was she who was actually selling bananas directly to the traders. In light of these submissions, he sought setting aside of the complaint against his clients. After hearing submissions, the court observed, “It cannot be said that applicants had no intention to deceive. They were involved in these transactions. They had collected the money as sale proceeds, but they did not pass the amount to the informant and the farmers…There is material to make out the offence of misappropriation and also the cheating.” The bench further remarked, “Such instances are increasing day by day. It is unfortunate, but it is a fact that all the systems are not showing sensitivity to the problems faced by the farmers. The farmers have no resources, and they cannot afford to indulge in litigation. This inability of farmers is used by the traders like applicants and they make money on the agricultural produce which farmers get after working hard.” While rejecting the application, the court said, “The suicides of farmers are increasing day by day as farmers are facing all kinds of problems and present problem of cheating is an additional circumstance which is compelling the farmers to commit the suicide. Due to all these circumstances, this court holds that no relief can be granted in favour of applicants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-set-aside-fir-against-traders-who-cheated-banana-farmers-in-jalgaon/story-OedOOF6v5UL0CF92cr9vrN.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Over 2.04 lakh seats remain vacant in Mumbai after Round 2; third merit list on December 15||Over 2.04 lakh seats (including general and quota seats) across first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) remain vacant after the second round of admissions, which concluded on Wednesday. Only about 37% students who were allotted colleges in the round, ended up confirming their seats in the second general round.Colleges said students might still want to wait for the third round to see if they get their desired college before zeroing down on something.“Some students who might have missed the cut-off by a few marks might wait for the third list,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college. A total of 76,231 students were allotted seats in the second round of which 28,061 students confirmed their admissions. The state education department will announce the third merit list for FYJC at 11am on December 15. The department announced the admission schedule for the third round on its official website on Thursday. While the third merit list will be declared on December 15, students who get colleges in the list can secure their admissions by December 18. The state education department has allowed colleges to start their online classes for FYJC. Education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The FYJC admission process has been smooth this year and we are happy that admissions will complete soon. We are hoping that colleges start their classes online. We have also extended all the help by organising online classes for students across the state through the Maharashtra State Council for Educational Research and Training (MSCERT).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-over-2-04-lakh-seats-remain-vacant-in-mumbai-after-round-2-third-merit-list-on-december-15/story-AhmcCKyHLKsYriDHRUlkVP.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||Strategies planned to fight illegal wildlife trade in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||The anti-poaching unit of the Thane forest department held a meeting on Thursday with animal welfare groups working within its jurisdiction to build strategies to develop a stronger network to fight organised wildlife crime.“The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is witnessing increasing cases of illegal pet and wildlife trade, and the pattern has changed to using the web for easy access and communication. We intend to enter and break into this network,” said a senior forest official.Thursday’s meeting was held online to take suggestions and develop strategies to counter wildlife crimes with animal welfare groups such as Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW); Plant and Animals Welfare Society - Mumbai (PAWS-Mumbai); the Thane Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Spreading Awareness on Reptiles and Rehabilitation Program (SARRP); Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA); and others. Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW said that among the issues discussed at the meeting were scheduling meetings of the bird committee appointed by the Bombay high court; preparing a database of volunteers and database of members trained in wildlife rescue; the need to generate awareness; and getting help from police departments and cyber cells while dealing with illicit wildlife trade cases.At the end of the meeting, it was decided to launch a dedicated email id, helpline number, social media handles through which teams would monitor illegal social media activities related to hunting and poaching along with spreading awareness and information about conservation issues.The meeting comes a day after one person was arrested after a truck carrying 94 caged animals and birds was intercepted. According to forest officials, 62 Indian rose-ringed parakeets, 12 plum headed parakeets, seven Indian palm squirrels, and 13 albino rabbits, were being delivered to south Mumbai as the truck was on route to Crawford Market. The wildlife has been rescued. Another instance of a large raid this year was on October 30, when 88 wild animals were rescued and two persons were arrested from an apartment in Lalbaug by the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/strategies-planned-to-fight-illegal-wildlife-trade-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-AftSDEjzrBXE5RCJKyQrJP.html
11-12-2020||Chandigarh||No time consuming electrical inspections of solar plants of up to 250 kWp: Chandigarh admin||For quick and trouble-free installation of roof top solar power plants here,the Chandigarh administration has scrapped time consuming electrical inspections for setting up plants of up to 250 kilowatts peak (kWp, the rate at which the system generates energy at peak performance). The relief has been extended to residential category and government plants. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida with the heads of different departments, including UT electricity department, Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), municipal corporation, urban planning department to improve their coordination.Parida also directed that UT electricity department to give a technical feasibility report within seven days, which is expected to also speed up the process to install the plants.The department currently takes around four months to give a report. The administration has achieved a target of 37.5 MW against a target of 69 megawatt (MW) solar power generation that the ministry of new and renewable energy has set for 2022 after enhancing it from 50MW. Even though the government recently notified the new subsidy scheme for rooftop solar units, the response from households remains low because of several bureaucratic bottlenecks. The subsidy amount has been raised from 30% to 40% for panels of up to 3 kWp capacity. For solar units from 4 kWp to 10 kWp, the subsidy will be 20%. There will be no subsidy for plants above 10kWp. Earlier, 30% subsidy was given to all applicants irrespective of the capacity of the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-time-consuming-electrical-inspections-of-solar-plants-of-up-to-250-kwp-chandigarh-admin/story-4FyeJoBhGbQ4GrujUXT45M.html
11-12-2020||Mumbai||Realty, hospitality sectors in Maharashtra yet to feel full force of migrant workers||May 14 and 15 will forever be etched in Mukesh Mali’s mind. Six years after moving to Mumbai in the hope of bettering the quality of life of his three school-going siblings and farmer parents, 27-year-old Mali returned to his village, Kosalao — a five-hour drive from Jaipur — on foot. At the time, the nationwide lockdown had just been extended for the third time, and while the Centre and states allowed shramik special trains and buses to ply from April-end, thousands of stranded workers, like Mali, walked back to their home states. “We tried very hard to get tickets, but trains were always full. But walking back was the most difficult thing we’ve ever done,” Mali said. “Some of us fainted, we stopped multiple times.”Now, Mali is in two minds about returning to Mumbai, where he worked as a manager in a three-star hotel in Parel, overlooking waiters, food quality, and attending to complaints. With his savings nearly over, Mali is frustrated — “Our area faces acute scarcity of water. The income is based on rains. Both a shortage as well as an excess of rainfall would mean that our crop is destroyed,” said Mali, who also taught in a private school before migrating to Mumbai in 2014. At the hotel, he earned ₹24,000, most of which he sent home to his parents. His employer wants him to return but his parents want him to return only after a vaccine programme is in sight. “They are afraid, since I am the main earning member [that I will fall ill]. They want me to do menial jobs in my village till the vaccine is introduced. But my employer has assured me that he is following all the rules and that I would be safe,” Mali said.He is not alone in facing this dilemma. Two major industries of Mumbai — hospitality and real estate — stare at a bleak future as several migrant workers haven’t returned due to the high number of active coronavirus cases in Mumbai. According to the state government, at least 1.2 million workers from states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha, left Maharashtra after the lockdown was announced on March 24. Estimates by industry bodies like the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI) and the Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR) reveal the current shortfall to be approximately 210,000 workers in the real estate sector and around 300,000 workers in the hospitality sector, which comprises everything from small roadside dhabas to boutique hotels and includes a host of subsidiary businesses. “There is still fear as Mumbai continues to be a hot spot of Covid-19 and rumours of another lockdown are always rife,” said Sukesh Shetty, secretary, AHAR.On April 2, Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) extended the registration validity of projects by three months, and on May 18, by another three more months invoking the ‘force majeure’ (unprecedented event) clause and stating that the Covid-19 outbreak was a calamity that was adversely affecting the development of real estate projects.However, real estate research firm Liases Foras warned that delays in execution of projects has a negative impact. “The builders get money based on the stage of construction, and today banks have become very cautious in disbursal of money. If the builders delay their work, it will only result in making projects unviable,” said managing director Pankaj Kapoor.According to Kapoor, there are 4,500 projects ongoing in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region of which 80% are likely to be delayed by 12-14 months; 80 projects of the top five builders will likely face a delay of 6 months to a year, he said.Omkar Realtors and Developers Private limited (ORDPL), a leading firm specialising in slum revamp projects, is doing everything it can to woo workers, said its director. “We used all available modes of transport such as arranging buses, booking train tickets as well as making flight reservations to bring our workers back,” said Rajendra Varma of ORDPL. In the past four months, they have brought back approximately 1,300 workers to resume work in seven construction sites. But their workforce is still falling short by at least 30%, Varma said.He felt optimistic as the panic around Covid-19 had subsided and the wages offered in Mumbai were more than what workers earned in their home states, these would be incentive enough for them to return.“We don’t have any work opportunity in our villages,” said Malashri, 25, a resident of Bidar, Karnataka and mother of four. “Due to Covid-19, villagers did not allow anyone inside their houses for work. Even they had less money because hardly any economic activity was taking place,” said Malashri, who returned to Mumbai in November with her husband Srinappa Kamble in a luxury bus, tickets paid for by the builder. The two work at a construction site in Dronagiri in Navi Mumbai for ₹1,000 a day — Malashri earns ₹300 while Srinappa is paid ₹700 for their labour.Many like Mali are not keen to return to the city which has a population density of 20,000 people per square kilometre. And for many restaurant owners, this has meant that they remain shut.VIE Hospitality, which runs Revival Restaurant at Girgaum Chowpatty famous for its thalis, has remained shut for the past eight months. Though restaurants were allowed to open in Mumbai in October, it has kept its restaurant shut due to labour shortage. “I employ workers from Uttarakand and Jharkhand, scattered across the states. It was not possible to arrange buses or other vehicles, and even if I had, I doubt the workers would have been ready to travel by road for a week to reach Mumbai,” said Kamlesh Barot, director, VIE Hospitality, justifying his decision to not arrange for transportation for workers.Mirah Hospitality, which runs 10 hotels including Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Mumbai, is operating with 700 staff members — less than 50% of their pre-lockdown numbers. “We are operating our hotel with just 50% capacity due to the government’s guidelines and hence are managing it with the current depleted number of staff,” said Aji Nair, COO (food and beverages division).“Hoteliers are not sure of their business as patrons are still reluctant to frequent their place due to the fear of Covid-19. In addition, the hotels need some trained staff which has been with them for years. Hence it makes sense to wait for the staff and open properly,” said Savio D’sa, a hospitality consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/realty-hospitality-sectors-in-maharashtra-yet-to-feel-full-force-of-migrant-workers/story-X60z2PQrDBAzXIti02BHcP.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Protesters barge into Sisodia’s house, act caught on camera||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday alleged that “BJP goons” illegally entered deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s official residence at Mathura Road “to attack his family members” while he was not there, and blamed the police for allowing the breach of security. The Bharatiya Janata Party denied the charge, saying its workers were peacefully protesting against alleged comments by an AAP leader the previous day against municipal corporation mayors. CCTV footage from a camera installed near the entry gate to Sisodia’s residence showed a group of people first rushing towards it and then aggressively pushing their way through into the house. The video, recorded around noon on Thursday, also showed police personnel apparently unable to control the mob and running after them into the premises.Delhi Police registered an FIR under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 427( Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 447 (Punishment for criminal trespass), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and section 3 of Defacement of Public Property Act. Six people have been detained, police said. The incident comes two days after the AAP alleged that the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was put under a virtual house arrest, allegedly at the behest of the Union government to keep him from supporting the ongoing farmers’ agitation — a contention the police denied. The mayors of the BJP-ruled municipalities have been on a sit-in protest outside the CM’s residence since Monday. Hours after the security breach, Sisodia tweeted: “Today, BJP’s goons broke the open the doors of my house and barged in and tried to attack my family. Amit Shahji, since you have lost in Delhi’s politics, will you confront us like this?” Addressing a press conference on Thursday, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj and MLA Atishi also blamed the Union home ministry. The home ministry did not respond to a query seeking comment.During the press conference, the AAP leaders showed the CCTV video. “The most surprising part is that the police deployed outside for safety purposes were already aware of the fact that BJP workers will be attacking. The barricades were removed, these attackers were given way, and allowed to enter the residential premises. This incident today happened under the superintendence of Delhi Police,” Bhardwaj alleged.Later, the Delhi Police tweeted a photograph of the main gate of Sisodia’s residence and said that “...allegations of the gate being damaged/broken are incorrect”. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said one Delhi BJP leader Hukum Singh had given a written application on Wednesday seeking permission to hold a protest outside Sisodia’s house on Thursday. The permission was denied, citing Covid-19 guidelines, he said. “On Thursday, around 11.30am, nearly 150 people reached Mathura Road, where an adequate deployment of security personnel was made and iron barricades were placed to stop the crowd from proceeding towards the deputy CM’s residence. Some of them jumped the barricades and entered the deputy CM’s residence,” DCP Singhal said.Singhal that C Arvind, secretary to the deputy CM, lodged a police complaint. “Accordingly, a case under appropriate sections of law has been registered at the Tilak Marg police station. The investigation is on,” he said.Atishi, however, alleged that if the police wanted, the mob could have been stopped. “But Delhi Police personnel chose to stand on the sidelines. These protesters were stopped only by the officers at the deputy CM’s camp office, and the civil defence staff present there. The police did nothing,” she said. “First they put Delhi’s CM under house arrest and then an attack is planned on the deputy CM’s family. The people of Delhi are well aware of the cheap tactics that the BJP used in the 2020 elections, from abuses to attacks. It is evident from today’s incident that all the earlier ones too would have been orchestrated. In the coming MCD elections, I am sure that the Delhiites will teach BJP ministers a tough lesson as they did in the 2020 [assembly] elections,” she added. When contacted, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta confirmed there was a protest outside Sisodia’s house.“Our workers went to deputy CM’s house to protest against the threats made by AAP leader Durgesh Pathak to kill BJP leaders who are protesting outside the CM’s residence. Pathak said this at Sisodia’s presence and the latter didn’t even object to it,” Gupta said.Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, however, said that the video circulated by the AAP was from July 12, 2020. “The AAP made a video of July 12, 2020 of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s residence viral, accusing karyakartas (workers) of forcibly entering Deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s residence, whereas during the demonstration today, not a single BJP worker entered the Deputy CM’s residence,” said Malhotra. The AAP rejected the allegation, and Delhi Police confirmed the incident took place on Thursday.Late on Thursday, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) headed by Swati Maliwal issued a notice to Delhi Police to explain the reason for the lapse in security arrangements at the deputy CM’s residence, and sought a report by December 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/protesters-barge-into-sisodia-s-house-act-caught-on-camera/story-LIEYdmGhACQfzpgaDwhSqM.html
11-12-2020||Chandigarh||Dushyant rules out snapping ties with BJP govt over farmers’ agitation||Firmly ruling out snapping ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three agriculture laws, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Thursday said the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) will pull the rug from under the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government if the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is stopped. Chautala has been under pressure from the opposition as well as a powerful section of the farming community to withdraw support to the BJP-led state government ever since the farmers’ protests began. His comments are in sync with chief minister Khattar, who had said that he will quit politics if the MSP is discontinued. Breaking his silence on the farmers’ protest and expressing optimism over resolution of the deadlock, the deputy CM said farmers should understand that it is their victory as the Centre has agreed to give written assurances to address their issues. Hitting out at Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for what he said “systematic harassment of Punjab farmers”, Chautala said Punjab farmers were angry as they got neither seeds nor fertilisers during the wheat sowing season. “The first and foremost demand of farmers pertained to MSP assurance in writing...When the Centre is ready to give a written assurance about the MSP, I don’t think the issue should be dragged further,” Chautala told reporters after an informal meeting of the cabinet at his residence here. Stating that he will hold the post of deputy CM till the time farmers produce is procured under the MSP, he said: “I will resign and walk out of the state government the moment I am unable to assure MSP to the farmers.” He said: “We have been firmly taking up the farmers’ issues with the state and the Union government. It is a matter of happiness that the Centre has agreed to give in writing after Ajay Singh Chautala recently had said a written assurance about the MSP should be given by the government.” During the informal meeting headed by Khattar, discussions were held regarding the upcoming panchayat elections, purchase of Rabi crop among others. It was decided that the panchayat polls will be held in time and that the government has written to the election commission in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dushyant-rules-out-snapping-ties-with-bjp-govt-over-farmers-agitation/story-lw2nDRAOlhnhUlY4Xx8qSP.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain’s brother||A Delhi court has granted bail to Shah Alam, the younger brother of former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain, in one of the cases of the northeast Delhi riots, while questioning the credibility of the witnesses in the case.The police had arrested Alam on April 21 for his alleged role in rioting, arson, mischief with fire along with destruction to public property.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav granted bail to Alam at a bond of ₹20,000 while seeking to know from the police as to what was stopping the two beat constables (also prosecution witnesses), from reporting the matter to the higher officials on the same day as the incident (February 25) and why they waited till March 6 to report the matter.The judge also said that the prosecution has not been able to point out the difference between the role of the accused and that of the other co-accused who have been released on bail, except for the fact that he is the younger brother of principal accused Tahir Hussain.“…. I am of the considered opinion that applicant is also entitled for grant of bail in the matter on the ground of parity. He cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that he is younger brother of principal accused Tahir Hussain,” the court said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-former-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-s-brother/story-hdR0ZOZH2xKho3U6mly3ZO.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||MCDs hiked 11 taxes in past 3 days, says AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday alleged that the three municipal corporations (MCDs) ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have increased around 11 different taxes over the past three days. The north corporation mayor, on behalf of all three corporations, said the civic bodies have not hiked any taxes in this year’s budget owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and even those proposed in the budget will not be approved.Senior AAP leader and municipal affairs in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the AAP will soon start a campaign to apprise people about these “inhumane acts” of the BJP and organise a mass movement against “arbitrary tax hikes”. “The taxation system of an authority decides how that authority is. In Delhi, on the one hand, you have the Arvind Kejriwal government,which has not increased a single tax in the past six years but still managed to double the budget. On the other hand, you have the BJP-ruled MCDs, which are continuously increasing taxes. In the past three days, the north, east and south corporations have presented their budgets and all of them have increased taxes arbitrarily,” he said. The AAP said the civic bodies have increased professional tax, which means now all professionals will have to pay more depending on their profession. “In addition, now the people of Delhi are being asked to pay a betterment tax. They have also increased the property transfer tax. If any person in Delhi wants to open a factory, then the person will need to pay double the money for a factory licence. The BJP-ruled MCDs have hiked the rate of trade licences as well that of health licences. They have also hiked the commercial house tax, residential house tax and the charge for cleaning garbage. The MCDs have also hiked education tax and tax on vacant land,” Pathak said. North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, on behalf of all three corporations, said the civic bodies have not hiked any taxes in this year’s budget owing to the pandemic and the economic slowdown. “The new taxes that have been proposed by the east corporation will not be approved by the House, as we don’t want to burden on the people of Delhi during a pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcds-hiked-11-taxes-in-past-three-days-says-aap-mayor-says-no-hike-will-be-approved/story-5ttNFNBInWaJRTbnAk35FL.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||BJP says party workers angry over AAP threats||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday said that party workers had gone to Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s house to protest against the alleged AAP threats to “kill mayors of Delhi”, a charge rejected by the AAP leaders. Even though CCTV footage shows BJP workers opening the doors and barging into Sisodia’s Mathura Road residence and police confirming the incident took place on Thursday, the BJP said it was an old video clip. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “Our workers went to deputy CM’s house to protest against the threatening statement made by AAP leader Durgesh Pathak to kill BJP’s leaders who are protesting outside the CM’s residence. Pathak said this in Sisodia’s presence and the latter didn’t even object to it.”Gupta was referring to a video clip circulating on social media which purportedly shows AAP leader Durgesh Pathak making the threat in the presence of Sisodia. The BJP had lodged a police complaint in the matter on Wednesday. Pathak, in a statement, had rubbished the allegation and said the BJP has a habit of mixing random audio clips with random video clips to “defame and malign” the image of the people.Delhi BJP vice-president Ashok Goel Devraha said BJP workers are angry over AAP leaders “threatening to kill BJP leaders”. “We had gone there to protest against the threatening remarks. AAP has become a party of goons who work under the patronage of CM Arvind Kejriwal. The Kejriwal government furiously promotes the criminal activities of its leaders. This is why, Durgesh Pathak dared to threaten to kill the mayors, who are sitting on a dharna outside CM residence. Instead of taking action against such leaders, the AAP is giving them an important position,” said Devraha, who led the protest.Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said the video circulated by AAP is from July 12, 2020. “AAP made a video of July 12, 2020 video of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s residence viral, accusing BJP karyakartas of forcibly entering deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s residence, whereas during the demonstration today, not a single BJP worker entered the deputy CM residence,” said Malhotra. Naveen Kumar, Delhi BJP media head, said Arvind Kejriwal should expel leaders like Pathak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-says-party-workers-angry-over-aap-threats/story-765YFhHk2YFfX5xfo0R3oM.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Govt not giving dues to create anarchy: BJP||Mayors of the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations, who continued their sit-in protest outside the CM’s house for the fourth day, said on Thursday that by not releasing the pending funds to the civic bodies, the Delhi government wants to create an atmosphere of “anarchy”.The AAP, however, said the protest is only an excuse by the BJP to harass chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and distract attention from the nationwide farmers protests. The BJP has decided to hold protests outside residences of all AAP ministers on Friday. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of the opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri will meet Delhi L-G Anil Baijal regarding the protest by mayors. In a joint press conference, North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh and East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said they have been sitting “under an open sky in the cold” to demand the dues of the over two lakh employees engaged by the three civic bodies.“If we will not be able to pay salaries to our staff, they will be forced to come out on the streets. This is what the Kejriwal government wants. They want to create an atmosphere of anarchy, as elections to the civic bodies are just a year away,” said Prakash.The AAP said the Delhi government doesn’t owe MCDs. “Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCDs know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests. The mayors are well aware that Delhi government has given all the funds due and it is because of their corruption and inefficiency that the MCDs are facing financial ruin. Since they have decided to only protest rather then govern, it is best that they resign and let AAP run the MCDs. We will run the MCDs efficiently, within the same budget,” the AAP said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayors-say-govt-wants-to-create-anarchy-in-delhi-aap-hits-back/story-9LVufdlC8Xu5E3TAjK9ScM.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||80% street trees in Vasant Vihar concretised||While south Delhi’s upscale neighbourhood of Vasant Vihar may seem to have preserved its green cover, a tree census conducted by its residents showed that of the total 4,993 trees on its streets, 3,859 trees were heavily concretised. The census also showed that over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires etc. in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off and at least 793 trees were infested with termites. Vallari Sheel, an environmental scientist and urban ecologist, who spearheaded the tree census in Vasant Vihar, said that she was encouraged to conduct this elaborate survey after a few trees went missing overnight from the plot near her house, where a new building was being constructed a few years ago. “The idea behind conducting this survey was to provide data to the neighbourhood and the authorities. Unless there is a record of trees, we will never be able to know how many are felled discreetly,” Sheel said. While highlighting the condition of trees in the neighbourhood, Sheel said that while the loss of trees due to construction and encroachment was an issue, over 80% of the street trees here were victims of heavy concretisation. She said trees that were located outside people’s houses were the worst-affected. Most of them were choked with concrete and tiles, leaving no space for their roots to breathe or absorb water and nutrients, she added. In this census, Sheel and her team surveyed only street trees and not those planted in parks and inside houses. Hindustan Times visited the neighbourhood on Tuesday, and found that several residents had cemented the soil around the trees outside their gates to make driveways and guardrooms. Many had also constricted trees with cemented platforms (chabootras), potted plants, garbage piles and even barbed wires, violating National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) 2013 ban on the concretisation of the base of trees. HT also found that many trees had been lopped off and their branches cut off in the name of pruning. In 2013, the NGT had not just banned the concretisation of the base of trees within a radius of one metre but had even asked the authorities not to dig the road within one metre of a tree. Environmentalists working to remove this heavy concretisation around trees in the neighbourhood said South Delhi Municipal Council (SDMC) and the Public Works Department (PWD) are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of trees in Vasant Vihar. However, while officials have removed concrete to make space for soil around trees located on walkways and public spaces, they have failed to remove encroachments from outside people’s houses. Environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari filed a complaint with the SDMC commissioner and the PWD engineer-in-chief, requesting action against such violation of court directions, on December 8. “...These activities are also in violation of section-8 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. Several trees have been felled for the purpose of construction and have not been replaced. Section-10 of the DPTA has placed an obligation on the party that has cut trees to plant such number and kind of trees,” the complaint read. A senior PWD official said that internal roads of the colony were under the jurisdiction of SDMC. “On the main roads, we ensure that concrete around trees is regularly removed,” the official said. A senior official of the horticulture department of SDMC, on the condition of anonymity, said a successful drive to remove concretisation around trees can only take place if an anti-encroachment drive is initiated in such upscale neighbourhoods. However, it would require manpower and resources that the department does not have at present.“In such colonies, the problem is that residents have encroached upon kerbs where these trees are planted. So technically, these trees are not coming in your way, you have encroached upon public land where the tree was planted. But now you are conveniently saying that the trees are blocking your driveways and gates,” the official said. Manish Aggarwal, SDMC councillor from Vasant Vihar, said that before the Covid-19 lockdown, many residents were issued notices to remove encroachment outside their houses, but because of the pandemic, several people did not take action.“We had stuck notices outside many houses asking them to clear the encroachment and many complied with the directions. SDMC will take action in the area that falls under our jurisdiction,” Aggarwal said. Padmavati Dwivedi, an environmentalist who had spearheaded Delhi’s first tree census in Sarvodaya Enclave in 2012, said without a tree census there was no way to know the condition of trees around us. “The only interaction of citizens with trees cannot be limited to pruning their branches. They must get involved in their care and protection too. Conducting a tree census is not a one-day photo opportunity, it takes persistence to complete it and to record data, which can be referred to at any time,” Dwivedi said. Aditya Prasad, an environment lawyer, based on whose petition the NGT had issued the order in 2013, said that apart from ecological damage such largescale concretisation of trees is also a violation of judicial orders. “Years after the high court and the NGT issued clear directions to prevent concretisation, agencies have not acted on-ground. This is a violation of judicial orders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-of-street-trees-in-vasant-vihar-concretised-census/story-tJUEVUyBIZZmQHKMp4t9jI.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Protest continues, farmers threaten to block railway tracks across India||The farmers union leading the protests at the borders of Delhi on Thursday threatened to block railway tracks across the country if the Centre does not agree to their demands and repeal the three new farm laws.Addressing a press conference on Singhu border on Thursday evening, farmer leader Boota Singh said the farmers had decided to intensify their ongoing agitation. “We will block railway tracks across the country if the Centre does not revoke the three farm laws.A date for the same will be announced soon,” he said.Agriculture minister Narendra Tomar on Thursday urged farmer leaders to come in for another round of talks, which was however, rejected by farmer leaders.On Thursday, the protests continued across Delhi borders with more farmers joining the stir at Singhu border — the biggest protest site. “We are expecting more people to join the protest at Delhi borders ahead of the all India protest that will be observed on Monday,” said farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu.At Singhu border, protesters on Thursday were seen shouting slogans against the government, singing songs of resilience, taking out marches with posters and banners, and attending speeches delivered from the stage. Besides food, free books and sanitary napkins were also distributed among protesters. Inderjeet Singh, the member of Guru Nanak Mission Society Nawashahr Punjab, arrived on Thursday morning with a stack of books that weighed ‘three quintal’ to distribute among the protesting farmers. “Most of these books are based on the holy book Guru Granth Sahib. We wanted to distribute these so that they can read in their free time. We have got books in Punjabi, Hindi, and English,” he said.Some popular faces, including Bollywood actor Gul Panag and Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit were also spotted at Singhu border on Thursday. At the Ghazipur border, the situation continued to remain peaceful on Thursday with some farmers from Hapur and Bulandshahar in Uttar Pradesh going back to collect more ration and supplies. In the evening, during a press briefing, the national spokesperson for Bhartiya Kisan Union and farmer leader, Rakesh Tikait said, “Our stand is firm and until the laws are repealed, we will stay put.”At Tikri border, one of the sites of the ongoing farmers’ agitation, some protesters were seen holding posters demanding the release of arrested activists and intellectuals including Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imaam, Sudha Bhardwaj, and Anand Teltumbde, among others, to mark the International Human Rights Day on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/protest-continues-at-delhi-borders-farmers-threaten-to-block-railway-tracks-across-india/story-fKAIrHHnhmBG2Nv8a7ZyiP.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Survey identifies most vulnerable for Covid shot||Data collected during the currently underway door-to-door survey in hot spots and containment zones will be used to identify those above the age of 50 years and those with comorbidities as both categories of people will be next in line, after the health care and front-line workers, to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, sources in the health department said. The government has already asked all hospitals, nursing homes, and stand-alone clinics in the city to get their employees registered for the vaccine shots. “More than 2 lakh registrations have come for the first trial of the Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi. The priority is health care and front-line workers. After which the focus will be on the aged, and subsequently, the entire population of Delhi, said health minister Satyendar Jain. According to the recommendations of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), 10 million health care workers, 20 million front-line workers, and 270 million people over the age of 50 years and those with comorbidities will be the priority groups to receive the vaccine. The vaccination drives could be conducted simultaneously for all three priority groups, depending on availability of the shots.Currently, India’s regulator is looking at emergency use authorisation for three vaccines – one, developed by Pfizer and BioNtech; second, by Oxford and AstraZeneca which will be manufactured and distributed in India by the Serum Institute of India; and the third, the indigenously developed Covaxin by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research A line list – with details like name, address, phone numbers – of those in line for the vaccine will be uploaded to the national digital CoWIN platform to help the government in tracking the vaccine drives. “The aged and those with comorbidities are at the highest risk of developing severe Covid-19, so most of the government’s initiatives have been targeted towards them. The door-to-door survey that was conducted in November already ensured that we have a list of such vulnerable people and now our surveyors are working on updating it,” said a senior official from New Delhi district. In November third week, the Delhi government had initiated a massive survey, covering 5.73 million people, to identify those with symptoms of Covid or a history of contact with a Covid patient.Over 13,500 people were found to be symptomatic of Covid among those surveyed. The officials were asked to continue the survey till at least December 31 as new containment zones and hot spots are constantly being identified. “The database created during the survey will also be compared and merged with the voter rolls and the data with dispensaries to create a list of people who will receive the vaccine when it becomes available,” said an official from the west district. Once the Delhi government issues an order, the collection of data from outside the hot spots and containment zones will begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/survey-identifies-most-vulnerable-for-covid-shot-lists-those-50-and-with-comorbidities/story-tPfwReDnfXyGAwf4Rou0AP.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Farm to Facebook: Stir at borders gets online push||Village-wise WhatsApp groups for mass sharing of photos and videos, numerous Facebook live sessions, Instagram posts and creative Twitter hashtags -- the farmers’ protesting at Delhi’s borders are making optimum use of social media to connect with people back home and to spread the “correct” message about their ongoing movement against the new farm laws.At Singhu border, connecting Delhi with Haryana, where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the past 15 days demanding revocation of the three farm laws, every second person can be spotted doing a Facebook live of either a speech being delivered from the stage or the distribution of food at the langar (community kitchen). Many youngsters from Haryana and Punjab, who have accompanied their families to the protest site, have also created WhatsApp groups to update people back home about the ongoing protest.Kawaljeet Singh, 28, a farmer from Mohali in Punjab, said he keeps his selfie stick handy for regular Facebook lives. “You can’t hold the smartphone for so long and a selfie stick helps get a wider shot. I do at least five to six Facebook live sessions, of 30 minutes each, every day. It’s very important to show people what’s happening here. Otherwise, there is so much misinformation about the farmers’ protests on social media. We are not Khalistani or terrorists who are trying to disrupt the peace of the nation; we are farmers who work hard to feed the nation and we are here to fight for our rights,” he said.Standing next to the stage set up at Singhu border, a group of youngsters from Moga was trying to upload some pictures on Instagram on Thursday. Balwinder Sandhu, 32, said many Instagram accounts have come up in support of farmers in the last few days. “We click pictures of the protest site and upload them as our stories on Instagram by tagging these accounts. They pick up the pictures and post from their official accounts to further spread them,” he said.By Thursday evening, there were around 972,000 posts with the hashtag #farmersprotest on Instagram. Some of the accounts popularising the movement are ‘farmersprotest’, ‘supportfarmers’, and ‘farmbillprotests’, among others. Youngsters are also using Twitter to garner more support. Navkiran Natt, 29, a protester at Tikri border and the daughter of a farmer family from Mansa district in Punjab, said farmer leaders made a “conscious decision” to promote the movement on social media. “Many of our leaders have language limitations. So they send their messages to youngsters associated with the protest and we translate them into multiple languages and then post them on different social networking sites. We have also made several videos in Punjabi instructing people on how to make accounts on Twitter and how to use it,” she said.Using hashtags such as #farmersprotests, #Istandwithfarmerprotest, and #tractortotwitter, at least 100 tweets were posted per hour on Thursday. “We have many WhatsApp and Twitter groups where we discuss and decide which hashtags to use on a particular day. Many of our Punjabi brothers and sisters living abroad also help us in translating the content,” she said.Through WhatsApp groups, the protesters said they share videos and pictures with people who could not join the agitation at the Delhi borders. “We also make regular video calls to show our family members what’s happening here. Their hearts and minds are here with us and the movement. Besides, these WhatsApp groups help keep the spirits high. We send the videos of speeches being delivered here to our fellow villagers to keep them motivated and interested in the movement. It’s a long fight,” said Harinder Singh, 26, a farmer from Rajpura in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farm-to-facebook-stir-at-borders-gets-online-push-protesting-farmers-make-most-of-social-media-to-spread-their-message/story-1106HpQ4Y93xtCyyrGGr7J.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Kala Kunj: Delhi Archives set to get a new cultural centre||The Delhi government is going to construct a cultural centre, named Kala Kunj, to create a dedicated infrastructure for better conservation of the city’s archives, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday. To start construction of the building, Sisodia, who is also the art and culture minister, on Tuesday laid the foundation stone of Kala Kunj - Delhi Archives Annexe & Cultural Hub at department of Delhi archives. “Kala Kunj, the proposed building, will have a state-of-the-art auditorium with a capacity of 500 and excellent audio-visual facilities. It will also host art exhibitions, archives, libraries, a café, and offer a mix of cultural activities. It will be an important and dedicated centre for cultural and intellectual activities,” he said. Senior government officials said this building will be in addition to the existing office building of the Delhi archives department in Qutub Institutional Area. The Kala Kunj building is expected to be ready in 24 months and cost Rs 50 crore. The Delhi archives department was established in 1972, but it has been functioning in its current office since 1986. An additional annexation was under consideration since 2013 due to the continued expansion of records. It was finally on Thursday that the foundation stone was laid after the Delhi government gave its administrative approval this year. “One of the main objectives of the construction of this annexe is to also provide South Delhi a cultural centre where people can come and connect with art, culture, heritage and history. The new building will ensure a dedicated space in conserving this country’s rich archival heritage, and history so the future generations can stay connected to their culture. The annexation of Delhi Archives will be very useful in the direction of cherishing and continuously advancing the cultural heritage of the country,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kala-kunj-delhi-archives-set-to-get-a-new-cultural-centre/story-vI9xn732UZBDf8nkeBxtCJ.html
11-12-2020||Delhi||Total cases cross 600k mark, positivity rate drops to 2.46%||Delhi reported 1,575 new Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the city’s tally to over 600,000. This comes on a day when Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital reached the milestone of treating 10,000 Covid-19 patients. “Congratulations to the team of LNJP Hospital for successfully treating over 10000 Covid +ve patients. This is the highest number of people to whom any Indian hospital has been able to provide service to. Kudos to the team and staff and we are eternally grateful for their services,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. Of the 64,069 tests conducted, 29,441 (45.9%) were done using the RT-PCR method — the gold standard for coronavirus diagnosis. Experts have warned that if the RT-PCR tests slacken, it could catch the Capital off guard if the outbreak begins resurging.The number of tests was lower than the average the average 73,705 during the seven previous days. The positivity rate in the city also dropped to 2.46%, which is the lowest since April 30 when a positivity rate of 2.08% was recorded. Positivity rate, the proportion of samples that test positive, indicates whether enough tests are being conducted and whether the spread of the infection in under control. Experts believe the transmission is under control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for two weeks in a row. Delhi’s positivity rate has remained at 5% or less for nine days so far. This has never happened since the Delhi government started releasing data on daily number of cases reported and number of samples tested. “The positivity rate in Delhi today is 2.46%. Since November 7, positivity rate is decreasing. In last 14 days, active case reduced to 18,753. The third wave is fading,” said Jain in a tweet. The city also reported 61 deaths due to Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of people who died among those who tested positive – to 2.33%. It had been 1.55% on November 18 when Delhi reported its highest toll of 131 deaths in a day. “Earlier, we saw a sudden increase in deaths because of the hazardous pollution levels in Delhi. Still, a lot of people are admitted in the hospitals. This has a lagging effect, which means that we see changes after a gap of 2-3 weeks. Now that the cases have decreased, the death rate too will eventually fall,” said Jain .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/total-cases-cross-600k-mark-positivity-rate-drops-to-2-46/story-bef2T2fsQLyaEm7D9eZnJK.html

11-12-2020||Pune||PMC to decide on reopening schools on Dec 11||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not yet taken a conclusive decision to reopen schools from December 13. A high-level meeting regarding the same will be conducted on December 11 to decide if schools will be reopened or not. Vikram Kumar, PMC commissioner said that the meeting will be conducted on December 11 and a concrete decision will be taken then. “We will be assessing the situation of Covid cases and other factors. Based on that, we will take the decision to reopen schools,” said Kumar.Shivaji Daundkar, head of PMC’s secondary education department, said that there are as of now no orders to restart schools.“As soon as there is a decision to reopen schools, we will begin with the process. However, the order has to come first,” said Daundkar.Meenakshi Raut, education officer with the PMC, said that once there is a nod to restart schools, the relevant actions will be taken. “We will follow all the standard operating procedures outlined by the state government and accordingly, the schools will reopen,” said Raut.Sagar Kondhalkar, a parent, said, “The Covid pandemic has not ended. The cases are rising and reopening schools does not seem like a good idea. I am very anxious sending my children to school. Though online teaching comes with its own challenges, I feel that at least, the kids are safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-decide-on-reopening-schools-on-dec-11/story-bPumbwemLzk8y2wx7XrVGM.html
11-12-2020||Pune||CM Uddhav Thackeray inspects tunnel work on Pune-Mumbai expressway||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday reviewed the progress of the ‘Missing link’ project in the ghat section on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, which will help reduce the travel distance between the two cities by six kilometres and save 20 minutes of travelling time.Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) is executing the Rs 4,797 crore project to build a bypass road between Khopoli and Kusgaon on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Thackeray along with public works minister Eknath Shinde; energy minister Nitin Raut; transport minister Anil Parab and MSRDC director Radheshyam Mopalwar and other officials visited the site and inspected the progress of the missing link work between Khopoli and Kusgaon. “The length of existing Pune-Mumbai expressway section from Khopoli exit to Sinhgad Institute is presently 19km. This distance will be reduced to 13.3km after construction of the new missing link. So, the total length of the expressway from Mumbai to Pune will be reduced by six kilometres. Travel time will be reduced by 20-25 minutes,” said Mopalwar during his briefing to the chief minister.MSRDC officials claimed that once the project is complete, the section would be accident-free. “Mumbai-Pune expressway and NH-4 meet near Khalapur toll plaza and separate near the Khandala exit. The section from Adoshi tunnel to Khandala exit is a six-lane road but the traffic of 10-lane road (six-lane of Mumbai-Pune Expressway + four-lane of NH-4) ply in thw section. Heavy amounts of traffic and landslides cause congestion in this stretch. Due to decrease in speed and increase in time of travel in this section and in order to save time, vehicles move at a faster speed on the rest of the expressway which has resulted in an increase in the number of accidents,” said an MSRDC official.Officials briefed that the project is divided in two packages - package-I consists of two eight-lane tunnels of length 1.75km and 8.92km respectively and package-II consist of two eight-lane viaducts of length 790m and 650m respectively and capacity augmentation (six-lane to eight-lane) of the existing Pune-Mumbai expressway from Khalapur toll plaza to Khopoli exit (6.5 km).Meanwhile, the Chief Minister also visited the trauma care centre at Ozurde. Earlier in the day, the CM inspected the progress of the work at Koyna hydroelectric power plant in Pophali, Ratnagiri and later inspected Koyna dam area in Satara district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-inspects-tunnel-work-on-pune-mumbai-expressway/story-NMy1QfFY5fLY7OeBbm3uEK.html
11-12-2020||Pune||Pumta proposes Neo Metro service for Pune||The Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (Pumta), at a meeting held on Thursday, has proposed running a “Neo Metro” service on the city’s existing bus rapid transport system (BRTS) roads, mainly from Katraj to Swargate and Hadapsar. Pumta is preparing a feasibility report for the same after the meeting held under the leadership of divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited’s (PMPML) managing director Rajendra Jagtap said, “We suggested introducing the Neo Metro on BRTS corridors mainly on a priority section between Katraj-Swargate-Hadapsar.” Neo Metro is cost effective and can be executed in a short period on existing corridors.Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation’s director Ramnath Subramaniam said, “The Neo Metro proposal got discussed at the meeting. PMPML suggested it. At the meeting it was decided to prepare a feasibility report.” Neo Metro is the a concept introduced by Maha Metro in Nashik city and Pimpri-Chinchwad. It is a hybrid concept between a bus service and the metro rail.The Neo Metro buses can be operated on the ground level like a tram, as well as on elevated corridors.The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has already approved the Neo Metro buses on its proposed High Capacity Mass Transit Route.Recently, Pune district guardian minister, Ajit Pawar, also suggested using the Neo Metro on Pune’s proposed HCMTR corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pumta-proposes-neo-metro-service-for-pune/story-ViZmLiATHzUK7NG7cFwOZK.html
11-12-2020||Pune||PMPML files proposal to promote sustainable mobility||The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has sent a proposal to the Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (Pumta) promoting sustainable mobility in Pune. Several topics were included in the proposal like extension of services and requirement of infrastructure in the metropolitan region, expansion of BRTS and completion of planned network. “It is essential to focus on public transport now more than ever. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to change the travel behaviour of commuters as the surge in private vehicle ownership is visible in the past few months. While PMPML strives to provide a quality, safe and affordable public transportation and for that we have sent a proposal to PUMTA requesting to help in resolving some of our issues,” said PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap. Jagtap said, “PMPML is keen to extend its services to larger PMRDA areas and request PMRDA to process the transfer of reserved land for bus depots and terminals as suggested in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan. Along with that, prioritising the BRTS and bus lanes are essential to promote use of public transport, as it enables buses to move. The incomplete network and permitting private vehicles on BRT lanes has affected PMPML’s performance.” “PMPML runs an 150-electric bus fleet – the highest in the country - and the plan is to add another 500 electric buses in next few years.” PMPML, in its proposal, demanded support required from Pune Metro for multi-modal integration and the restriction to entry of heavy goods’ vehicles inside the city from 7am and 10 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-files-proposal-to-promote-sustainable-mobility/story-HftNugFTeJYkxIJAq4vYmI.html
11-12-2020||World||UK cuts quarantine time to 10 days for foreign arrivals||UK health officials on Friday announced that the mandatory period of Covid-19-related quarantine for arrivals from India and other countries not on the ‘travel corridor list’ will be cut from 14 days to 10 days from Monday.Chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland the Northern Ireland said in a statement that after reviewing evidence, they were now confident that the number of days can be reduced to 10 days. The ‘travel corridor list’ includes countries from where people need not self-isolate after arriving in England.The reduced quarantine period also applies to those in the UK who come in contact with any person who has tested positive. People who test positive should continue to self-isolate for 10 days from onset of symptoms or 10 days from point of taking a positive test if asymptomatic, they added.The reduced quarantine is the latest relaxation for arrivals announced in recent days in moves welcomed by the travel and tourism industries.From December 5, the quarantine period has been removed for individuals arriving in England for business activity that delivers significant benefit to the UK economy. From December 15, the quarantine period will be further reduced to five days if a test taken five days after arrival proves negative.Scheduled international flights are currently suspended, but a limited number of flights are operating between the UK and India under a bilateral agreement. Such flights are subject to eligibility criteria and details may change at short notice, the Foreign Office said.Individuals are only exempt from quarantine requirements when undertaking the specific business activity and will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity, the announcement said.Exemptions also came into force on December 5 for domestic and international performing arts professionals, TV production staff, journalists, and recently signed elite sportspersons, to ensure that industries which require high-talent individuals who rely on international connections can continue to complete their work.Health officials at Public Health England do not anticipate that the exemptions will raise the risk of domestic transmission, due to the protocols being put in place around these exemptions, but add that all exemptions will remain under review.From December 15, under the plan called ‘Test to Release’, passengers arriving in England by plane, ferry or train should book their test before they travel; must complete a passenger locator form; and will still need to self-isolate for five days before taking the test.The test will need to booked at the traveller’s expense from an approved list of providers. Those choosing not to take a test when arriving from a non-exempt country must continue to follow the current self-isolation requirements.The plan has been put in place based on advice from a consortium of expert representatives from the aviation, maritime, international rail, tourism and hospitality industries to boost international travel for all modes, whilst safeguarding public health in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cuts-quarantine-time-to-10-days-for-foreign-arrivals/story-xtDDlqFGrsQjsyZsta0i1H.html

Tehran appeared concerned his remarks could fan separatist tendencies among Iran’s Azeri minority.“The Turkish ambassador was informed that the era of territorial claims and expansionist empires is over,” the Foreign Ministry said on its website. “Iran does not allow anyone to meddle in its territorial integrity.”Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted earlier: “President Erdogan was not informed that what he ill-recited in Baku refers to the forcible separation of areas...from (the) Iranian motherland.” “NO ONE can talk about OUR beloved Azerbaijan,” Zarif said, referring to the northwest region of Iran where many of its ethnic Azeris live.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-protests-to-turkey-over-alleged-meddling-by-erdogan/story-5vQiD7PmR6zK3YjiPs4UOM.html
11-12-2020||World||US FDA ‘working rapidly’ on Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine decision||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday it was working rapidly to issue an emergency use authorization for Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine, setting the stage for the first Americans to be immunized as soon as Monday or Tuesday.The FDA’s decision making follows one of the last steps of its regulatory process: a panel of outside advisers on Thursday evening endorsed emergency use of the vaccine to help stem a pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 US residents.US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, which oversees the FDA, told ABC News that regulatory authorization should come within days and the federal government would work with the company to get the vaccine shipped out.Pfizer has asked that the two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, be approved for use in people aged 16 to 85.The companies last month said that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from Covid-19, and detailed data released in the FDA’s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose.The vaccine is already approved in Britain, and people there began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Bahrain and Canada have also authorized the vaccine, and Canada expects to start inoculations next week.The FDA has notified the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed so that they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution, it said in a statement. (https://bit.ly/2W47i9l)Healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents are expected to receive the first doses, but a wider rollout faces significant logistical challenges.Another 2,902 US deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months until the vaccine can be widely distributed.For months, US President Donald Trump had pressured the FDA in tweets and press conferences to move more quickly, accusing staff and Pfizer of dragging their feet.Shortly after the FDA’s statement, the outgoing president criticized the agency for what he said was its slow handling of the vaccines and criticized FDA Commissioner Steven Hahn.Trump said his “pushing” the agency had speed up new vaccine approval, but that the FDA was “still a big, old, slow turtle. Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA. Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!”Pfizer shares rose 1% before the opening bell, while BioNTech US shares were flat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-working-rapidly-on-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-decision/story-9NSAtx0w6Zs0gBlNchq3yL.html
11-12-2020||World||No deal on Brexit trade ‘very very likely’, British PM Johnson says||Britain is likely to complete its journey out of the European Union in three weeks without a trade deal, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.Both sides say they want to agree arrangements to cover nearly $1 trillion in annual trade but negotiations are at an impasse, with Britain standing to lose zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the huge European single market.“It’s looking very, very likely we’ll have to go for a solution that I think will be wonderful for the UK, we’ll be able to do exactly what we want from January 1, it will obviously be different from what we set out to achieve,” Johnson told reporters.“If there’s a big offer, a big change in what they’re saying then I must say that I’m yet to see it,” said Johnson, the face of the “leave” campaign in Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum.Von Der Leyen was quoted by an EU official as telling leaders of the bloc’s 27 member states attending a summit in Brussels on Friday that prospects for a deal had worsened.“The probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Johnson and von der Leyen have given negotiators until Sunday evening to break the deadlock over fishing rights and EU demands for Britain to face consequences if in the future it diverges from the bloc’s rules.Johnson must decide whether the deal on offer is worth taking or the future freedom and domestic political benefits afforded by leaving without one outweigh the economic costs.A Brexit without a trade deal would damage the economies of Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.No deal?As EU leaders lined up to warn of the failure of talks, investors started to price in the risk of a chaotic finale to the five-year Brexit crisis. British stocks fell, euro zone government bond yields fell and sterling fell about 1% against the dollar and euro. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said there were still fundamental issues unresolved in the trade talks. “Time is running out and we need to prepare for a hard Brexit,” he said, referring to an abrupt rupture in trade arrangements.EU leaders rejected a proposal from Johnson for a Brexit call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, EU officials said.Johnson is under pressure from Brexit supporters in Britain not to cave to any EU demands that they say could undermine his promises to regain Britain’s sovereignty.Macron also faces domestic pressure, with French fishermen urging him to ensure the EU defends their fishing rights. Asked by a reporter about an EU proposal for a one-year contingency plan, under which EU fishermen would keep access to Britain’s fishing waters, he said: “I’m not asking to have my cake and eat it, no. All I want is a cake that’s worth its weight. Because I won’t give up my share of it either.”The Bank of England said it had taken steps to keep banks lending through 2021 as Britain prepares for any market disruption from a big change in the trading relationship with the EU, while also dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-deal-on-brexit-trade-very-very-likely-british-pm-johnson-says/story-dfzodpeCQYzKuT1vdvVyeK.html
11-12-2020||World||US Covid-19 vaccine near, but deaths rising by 9/11 proportions each day||A mounting US death toll has tempered enthusiasm about a coming Covid-19 vaccine with 9/11-like fatalities projected every day for the months ahead, even with a rapid rollout of inoculations, which could start as soon as Monday.Another 2,902 U.S. deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months until the vaccine can be widely distributed.Those daily tolls are roughly equivalent to the 2,996 killed in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and greater than the 2,403 killed in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor - traumatic events that reshaped the United States for years.“Probably for the next 60 to 90 days, we’re going to have more deaths per day than we had on 9/11 or we had at Pearl Harbor,” Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday.“The reality is the vaccine approval this week is not going to really impact that, I think, to any degree for the next 60 days,” Redfield said.Moving with unprecedented speed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday was on the cusp of approving emergency use of the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc with its German partner BioNTech.“The FDA informed Pfizer that they do intend to proceed towards an authorization for their vaccine,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC News on Friday.“We will work with Pfizer to get that shipped out so we could be seeing people getting vaccinated Monday or Tuesday,” Azar said.Britain, Bahrain and Canada have already approved the Pfizer vaccine, and the U.S. advisory panel is due to review a second vaccine, from Moderna Inc, next week. Other vaccine candidates are in the works.While most vaccines take years to develop, the Pfizer vaccine arrives less than a year after the illness was traced to a market in Wuhan, China, in December of last year.Chinese officials shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the World Health Organization on Jan. 12, triggering the international race toward a vaccine. A US rollout faces significant logistical challenges to meet President-elect Joe Biden’s goal of inoculating 100 million people within 100 days of his inauguration on Jan. 20.“It’s not going to be like a light switch on and off. It’s going to be more like a dimmer switch,” said Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Health Vaccine Center and a lead investigator for the Pfizer trials.But any American who wants a vaccine should be able to get one by May or June, Assistant US Health Secretary Brett Giroir told Fox News on Friday.States will determine who gets the vaccine first and were likely to focus on healthcare workers and people in long-term care facilities, followed by the elderly, people with chronic conditions and first responders, Giroir said.Then there is the American skepticism about vaccines, with only 61% saying they are open to getting vaccinated, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.In the meantime, grim statistics continue to pile up as the United States recorded more than 200,000 cases per day for four straight days with another 220,815 cases on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally of official data.The United States has so far reported about 15.6 million cases and 292,642 deaths by Thursday.Deaths are projected to reach 502,000 by April 1, according to an influential model by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The institute revised that number down by about 37,000 on Thursday with the release of more detailed information about the vaccine and other factors.By comparison, heart disease killed 655,381 people in the United States and cancer 599,274 in 2018, according to CDC data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-vaccine-near-but-deaths-rising-by-9-11-proportions-each-day/story-Te9OiNE0tbIqa3YrXqqAPM.html
11-12-2020||World||Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?||Britain became the first country to roll out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech on Dec. 8 after final late-stage trial results showed it was 95% effective in preventing the disease.The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 1.6 million people worldwide:Who is furthest along?US drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech are the vaccine trailblazers. They were the first in the world to release full late-stage trial data on Nov. 18 and Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9.Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed its emergency use on Dec. 10, paving the way for the agency to authorize the vaccine in days. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due to complete its review by Dec. 29 and India is accelerating its review.Who will be next?US pharmaceutical company Moderna is ahead of the pack at this point. It was next to release full data analysis for a late-stage trial on Nov. 30, with its vaccine showing a 94.1% efficacy rate. FDA advisers are due to review it on Dec. 17 and the EMA will do so by Jan. 12.Who else is in the running?Britain’s AstraZeneca is seeking approval for its vaccine in Britain after announcing interim late-stage trial data on Nov. 23. It had an average efficacy rate of 70% and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose first, followed by a full dose.However, it is not clear how the regulator will deal with the different dosages in the efficacy data in its assessment. While India is conducting an accelerated review, it has asked for more data. AstraZeneca is also in discussions with the EMA, which is conducting a rolling review of the vaccine.US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver trial data this year, or early in 2021, teeing it up for US authorization in February if its shot is effective. It reduced the enrolment target for its clinical trial to 40,000 volunteers from 60,000 on Dec. 9, potentially speeding results which are tied to how quickly participants become infected.US firm Novavax is running a late-stage trial in Britain with data due in the first quarter of 2021. It expects to start a large-scale trial in the United States this month.France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline , however, announced a setback on Dec. 11 in their attempts to develop a vaccine. The drugmakers said it showed an insufficient immune response in older people in mid-stage trials and that they would start a new study in February.What happens in the trials?The companies typically test their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of Covid-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.How are volunteers infected?The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with Covid-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.How well are the vaccines supposed to work?The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy. The FDA wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The EMA has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.What about Russia and China?While Pfizer’s shot was the first to be rolled out following the publication of full Phase III trial data, Russia and China have been inoculating their citizens for months with several different vaccines still undergoing late-stage trials.Russia said on Nov. 24 that its Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Institute, was 91.4% effective based on interim late-stage trial results. It started vaccinations in August and has inoculated more than 100,000 people so far.AstraZeneca said on Dec. 11 that it would test a combination of its vaccine with one of Sputnik V’s two components to try to boost the efficacy of the shot it is developing with Oxford University.China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection. It has vaccinated about one million people as of mid-November using at least three shots - two developed by the state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one by Sinovac Biotech.Sinovac said on Nov. 18 that mid-stage trial results showed its CoronaVac shot triggered a quick immune response and interim data from its late stage trial could come this year.The Butantan Institute, a Brazilian biomedical centre, is producing CoronaVac and aims to make 1 million doses a day ahead of a vaccine campaign to be launched late January.The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said on Dec. 9 that one of the CNBG vaccines was 86% effective based on interim results from a late-stage trial in the Gulf Arab state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-are-we-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/story-r6NITq3XWzo4wIggIxa3EO.html
11-12-2020||World||Putin orders public officials to declare digital assets||Russian public officials will have to declare any cryptocurrency holdings and digital assets from Jan. 1, 2021, according to an order signed by President Vladimir Putin, published on Friday.Lawmakers this year approved a bill giving cryptocurrencies legal status, but banned them from being used as a means of payment. The central bank is considering issuing a digital rouble it says would eventually make Russia’s payment systems more robust.Any public official or person seeking to hold public office must disclose their digital assets, as well as those of their spouse and children, before June 30, 2021, the order said.Failure to declare digital currency transactions above 600,000 roubles ($8,211) in one year could result in a fine, according to draft proposals for changes to Russia’s tax code by the finance ministry. A jail term of up to three years is also under consideration, the RBC daily newspaper has reported.The central bank first floated the idea of a digital rouble in October, saying it may issue it on top of existing cash and non-cash roubles to facilitate payments for individuals and businesses.Russia had initially declared cryptocurrencies illegal on the grounds that they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-orders-public-officials-to-declare-digital-assets/story-acbhlwog6nh4e5rhxQkEsL.html
11-12-2020||World||What are the concerns for people involved in now-abandoned Australia’s Covid vaccine trials?||Australia has hit a major roadblock in its attempt to secure millions of doses of a promising vaccine candidate against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after trial participants returned false HIV positive results. The Australian government had agreed to buy 51 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine developed by biotech firm CSL Ltd and the University of Queensland (UQ).The government had struck a deal with CSL Ltd to manufacture two potential coronavirus vaccines - one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by CSL’s own labs in collaboration with the UQ. However, CSL will not progress the vaccine candidate to Phase 2/3 clinical trials as the Phase 1 data showed the generation of antibodies that interfered with “certain HIV tests.”What are the concerns for people involved in the trial?CSL and the University of Columbia said in a joint statement that there is no possibility the vaccine causes infection, adding that the routine tests confirmed there is no HIV virus present. CSL stated that the generation of antibodies was directed towards fragments of a protein (gp41), which is a component used to stabilise the vaccine.“Trial participants were fully informed of the possibility of a partial immune response to this component, but it was unexpected that the levels induced would interfere with certain HIV tests,” it added.Also Read | Adverse effects of Covid vaccines to be reviewed by national agencies: WHOWhat are the implications for vaccine rollout?Australia had ordered 51 million dosed of the UQ/CSL vaccine and the firm was working towards Phase 2/3 clinical trial and large-scale manufacture of the vaccine. CSL and the Australian government have agreed to not proceed to Phase 2/3 trials. The government is increasing the purchase of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from 33.8 million doses to 53.8 million doses. The doses of the Novavax vaccine have also been increased from 40 million to 51 million.How the researchers reacted?Professor Paul Young, UQ vaccine co-lead, said that though there were no guarantees, the core technology approach used in the development of the vaccine has passed the major clinical test. Young added that it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, but the team did not have the luxury of time needed.“Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone’s priority,” he stated.Dr Andrew Nash, chief scientific officer for CSL, said that the outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development. He also informed that CSL has agreed at the request of the Australian government to manufacture an additional 20 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-the-concerns-for-people-involved-in-now-abandoned-australia-s-covid-vaccine-trials/story-KMbD1G51FmTuqHcdn1KtVJ.html

Borrrell was asked to submit the report to the leaders by the time they hold a summit in March.Turkey’s Foreign Ministry slammed the EU decision, saying Ankara rejects the 27-member group’s “biased and unlawful attitude.” It added that the decision was approved out of solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.But Erdogan, speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, suggested that the decision was less severe than what Greece and Cyprus had hoped for.”(The decision) did not meet the expectations of some countries, because their demand was not just,” Erdogan said. “Some reasonable countries within the EU asserted their positive stance and spoiled their game.”EU countries are split over how best to handle Turkey. France and Cyprus have pushed for tougher measures such as economic sanctions, but other countries are concerned about further undermining the country’s already ravaged economy and destabilizing the region.French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in Brussels after the EU summit said Europe “remains obviously always open to dialogue but won’t accept a policy destabilizing its member states as well as its regional environment.”He praised the EU decision and the prospect of US sanctions as a response to “Turkey’s inconsistencies within NATO.”“It shows we are right, sometimes, to be clear and vocal when attitudes are unacceptable.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the EU took a strong step warning Turkey to “change behavior.”He said that, for Greece, sanctions were not a goal in and of themselves.“But the threat of sanctions in case Turkey continues its provocative action is the best tool we have at our disposal,” he said. “We don’t want Turkey to be a provocative and aggressive neighbor. And I don’t believe this is to the benefit of Turkey or of Greece or of Europe.”Tensions between NATO allies Turkey and Greece escalated over the summer with a military build-up after Turkey sent its seismic survey vessel Oruc Reis, escorted by navy frigates, into disputed waters. The move prompted Greece to also send its warships, and both countries conducted military exercises to assert their claims.Late last month, Oruc Reis returned to port, as it had done before October’s EU meeting. However, another research ship, the Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa, remains off Cyprus’ southwestern coast.Turkey says it is standing up for its energy rights, as well as those of breakaway Turkish Cypriots, while Athens and Nicosia call Turkey’s actions an illegal incursion into areas where they have exclusive offshore exploitation rights.Last year, the EU set up a system for imposing travel bans and asset freezes on people, companies or organizations linked to contested drilling activities. Two Turkish Petroleum Corporation officials are already on the list, and the leaders say those sanctions should be broadened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faced-with-us-eu-sanctions-erdogan-calls-for-dialogue/story-MfQPQgdUeUS2aFPduJ0WKO.html
11-12-2020||World||How a homeless high school dropout became CEO of a $1 billion company||Taihei Kobayashi has gone from sleeping on the streets of Tokyo to heading a technology startup whose market value topped $1 billion.His rags-to-riches story is among the most remarkable to emerge from a small-cap stock boom that’s minting fortunes in Japan. Kobayashi’s company, which helps startups and other firms to design and create new businesses and products, went public in July and its shares have since more than tripled.It’s an outcome that few could have imagined two decades ago. As Kobayashi tells it, his parents kicked him out at 17 when he quit a prestigious high school to focus on his band. He played music during the day and mostly slept outdoors, using cardboard boxes to keep warm during freezing winter nights. He was homeless for a year and a half.A series of encounters got him off the streets and eventually into a job as a software engineer. He was one of the core members in establishing the predecessor to the company now known as Sun* Inc., pronounced Sun Asterisk, in Vietnam in 2012. He’s now Sun*’s chief executive officer.“The winters were cold,” Kobayashi, 37, said of his experience on the streets. “There may have been times when things felt like hell. But I’ve overcome those times.”According to Kobayashi, his parents wouldn’t accept his decision to drop out of high school. They had made financial plans to allow him to get a university education, he said. Attempts to contact Kobayashi’s parents were unsuccessful.“They told me to leave, so I left, and that was that,” he said. “I wanted to live my life doing what I enjoyed.”Kobayashi ended up spending two winters on the streets of the Shinjuku and Shibuya districts of Tokyo.Mostly Outdoors“I might have died,” he said. “I slept anywhere I could,” he said. “About 80% of the time it was somewhere outside.”Yushi Fukagawa, a close friend since Kobayashi’s school days who currently works at Sun*, recalls the time the entrepreneur became homeless.“I didn’t think too much of it,” Fukagawa said. But “my parents seemed worried.”At 19, a manager of a live-music club took pity on Kobayashi, offering him a job and saying he could crash at the club. He did so for about six years.Eventually, Kobayashi decided it was time to move on. First, he made some money trading music records online. Then he came across a job advertisement that didn’t require any qualifications or experience. All you had to do was take a test, it said.The six-hour examination tested applicants on areas including mathematical skills, logical thinking and IQ. Koyabashi passed and started working at the firm, which trained him to become a software engineer.Start CompanyThat’s how he met Makoto Hirai, one of the founders of Sun*. The two agreed there were many software engineers who excelled in programming, but few who could use those skills to come up with working business models. They decided to start a company to bridge the gap.Kobayashi moved to Vietnam in 2012 to hire staff from the country’s pool of young engineers. In March 2013 the founding members incorporated Framgia Inc. in Japan, which changed its name to Sun* in 2019. The idea was to deploy the engineers to help Japanese startups that were struggling to build a viable business.“Our stance was to commit ourselves to the growth of those startups, regardless of whether it left us mired in losses,” Kobayashi said.Over the years, Sun* grew its business, and now has more than 70 clients. The company listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Mothers market for startup firms in July. Its shares rose almost sixfold to a high in September, taking its market value above $1.4 billion. They’ve since dropped 37%, with the company’s market capitalization dipping back below $1 billion. Kobayashi’s 7.9% stake is worth about $74 million.Sun* posted net income of 649 million yen ($6.2 million) on revenue of 3.97 billion yen for the nine months ended September.Stiff CompetitionMitsushige Akino, a senior executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co., said there’s good demand for the firm’s services but sales and profit are still low and competition could be stiff.“Things could be difficult,” Akino said. “You have to see whether the company is able to sustain its pace of growth. This is especially so for its revenue, which isn’t much right now.”Kobayashi, who returned to Japan from Vietnam in 2019, said the company is winning business from bigger firms, including those in the blue-chip Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Its customers include Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Corp., according to the Sun* website.“We want to be aggressive in offering our services to big corporations,” he said. “That’s why we went public.”Sun* is seeking to increase earnings by at least 20% to 30% a year, and doubled staff in its Tokyo office to about 130 people this year, he said. Vietnam continues to be the firm’s biggest office with about 1,300 employees.Sun* is one of many companies in the TSE Mothers Index whose shares surged this year as investors bet on technology companies amid the pandemic. The startup gauge hit a 14-year high in October before paring some of its gains. Despite more than tripling, Sun* isn’t even in the index’s top 10 performers this year. The company’s shares trade at about 200 times earnings and about 20 times book value.“It’s what you’d call a momentum stock,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a senior market analyst at Matsui Securities Co. in Tokyo, noting its “extremely high” price-to-earnings ratio. “It’ll be impacted by how long the positive trend for the startup Mothers gauge will persist.”Kobayashi said he’s aware of the risks but not daunted by them. He said he’s faced more difficult challenges before. He has since reconnected with his parents, and his time on the streets is a distant memory.“What I want to do now is keep working to realize our company’s vision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-a-homeless-high-school-dropout-became-ceo-of-a-1-billion-company/story-cnOsHqgAfWiOysutcCWuqM.html
11-12-2020||World||EU drug regulator endorses changes to remdesivir marketing for Covid-19 use||Europe’s drugs regulator on Friday recommended changing some terms of the conditional approval given to antiviral drug remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment, to make clear the conditions under which it can be used.Doubts over remdesivir’s effectiveness were raised after the World Health Organization (WHO) last month said the drug should not be used for Covid-19 patients, regardless of how ill they are, just months after Europe and the United States approved the treatment.The new terms of the conditional marketing authorisation in Europe add that a patient could need “low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment,” according to the European Medicines Agency. The drug, made by US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc , is already indicated for use in Europe in patients aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg, who are also suffering from pneumonia and require oxygen support.The European Union (EU) in October agreed to pay more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to Gilead for a six-month supply.Research by British scientists showed remdesivir’s benefits, but a WHO-lead trial found there was no evidence the drug improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a claim Gilead has questioned.The top U.S. infectious disease medical association had backed remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment days after the WHO warning.A EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year in the 27-nation bloc before all necessary data on its efficacy and side-effects are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-endorses-changes-to-remdesivir-marketing-for-covid-19-use/story-DmVSWcSiIiwpgoJZjtuISP.html

Remember there are a number of vaccine candidates coming online at the same time,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva.“One vaccine may not be suitable for particular individuals, but you may well find another vaccine is.”On Tuesday, Britain became the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Its medicine regulator subsequently said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the shot, after two reported incidents of the reaction.A panel of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of the vaccine, paving the way for the agency to authorize the shot for a nation that has lost more than 285,000 lives to Covid-19.The WHO is reviewing data from phase 3 trials of many Covid-19 vaccine candidates, Harris said. The agency has not yet issued emergency use authorisation for any vaccines, but “the primary thing we look at is safety”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adverse-effects-of-covid-vaccines-to-be-reviewed-by-national-agencies-who/story-fA1dvhaIISFCHGbNShsTsN.html
11-12-2020||World||World in denial on climate action 5 years after Paris accord: Thunberg||Five years on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world remains in denial over the actions needed to prevent catastrophic warming, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said on Friday.The deal was adopted on December 12, 2015 by 196 countries but, so far, global leaders have failed to deliver on its promises, she said in a video that urged her 10.5 million Instagram followers to #FightFor1point5.That w as a reference to the ambition set out in the accord to hold the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The video showed images of politicians and bureaucrats hugging and cheering when the Paris Agreement was signed.Yet the five years subsequent years have been the hottest years ever recorded, Thunberg said in the video, which mixed her sober address to camera with dystopian images of fire and flooding.Pledges so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions put the world on track for a dire 3C or more of warming this century, with countries planning to produce double the amount of fossil fuels needed to hit the 1.5C target in the next decade alone, the United Nations and research groups said last week.“Hypothetical targets are being set and big speeches are being given, yet when it comes to the immediate action we need, we are still in state of complete denial,” Thunberg said.“We are still speeding in the wrong direction.”Now 17, Thunberg rose to fame in 2018 when her school strike for climate change campaign became a viral sensation online, turning her lone protest into a global movement. Since then she has become a thorn in the side of the world’s political elite.She ended Friday’s video on an optimistic note, saying the solution was in making people - rather than simply policymakers - aware of the extent of the climate crisis.“Let’s make this our main priority. Let’s unite and spread awareness... We are the hope. We the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-in-denial-on-climate-action-5-years-after-paris-accord-thunberg/story-BFpwIgEXcV3e5KxqT0RZVL.html
11-12-2020||World||Leading pro-China news channel in Taiwan ends broadcasts||A leading pro-China cable news channel prepared to halt its broadcast operations at midnight Friday after Taiwan’s government refused to renew its license, citing accuracy issues.The National Communications Commission cited repeated violations of rules on accurate reporting in rejecting CTiTV’s license renewal. The station has been fined 25 times in the past six years for spreading inaccurate information.The station is owned by the Want Want China Times media group, which also publishes one of Taiwan’s main newspapers. It has long been associated with a Beijing-friendly political view, attributed partly to its extensive business interests in China. It tried unsuccessfully to appeal the denial and accused the Taiwanese government of endangering media freedom.In its ruling in November, NCC Chairperson Chen Yaw-shyang made no specific allegations of a pro-China bias, but said the channel appeared susceptible to outside influence.“The biggest problem is external interference into the TV station’s news production and broadcasts,” Chen said in announcing the denial of the license renewal.Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog group, said in a statement that the decision did not go against press freedom, but expressed regret over its impact on the station’s staff.While it will stop its broadcast operations, the company is expected to focus on mobile and web operations, where it already has a sizable following.“We must have limitless support for media freedom,” a banner on the news channel’s home page said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-pro-china-news-channel-in-taiwan-ends-broadcasts/story-33f4lJOPOOBOpnaZ3YEhhI.html
11-12-2020||World||Donald Trump has raised $20S7.5 million since election day to fight lawsuits||President Donald Trump and his party raised $207.5 million in a less than three-week stretch after the US election, fueled by outrage-filled solicitations to donors as he waged an unsuccessful challenge of the results.Money flooded into Trump’s coffers at a much higher rate after he began to seek contributions to fight widespread voter fraud and election rigging, despite no evidence of either, after his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).The bulk of the cash -- $121.7 million -- came to the Trump Make America Great Again (TMAGA) Committee via WinRed, the Republican platform for gathering smaller donations online. In the 20 days leading up to and including Election Day, those donors gave $44.8 million.The TMAGA fundraising was spurred in part by an endless stream of text messages and emails insisting that the vote was marred and asking for help contesting the results of elections in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin among other states.“I trust you know that I’m fighting every second of every day to Make America Great Again and DEFEND the integrity of this Election,” began one recent pitch from the president to his supporters, despite a dismal record in the courts for his lawsuits.The fine print in those solicitations says that 75% of money given to TMAGA will go to Save America, a political action committee (PAC) Trump set up that allows him to spend the money on political activity, including holding rallies, advertising, fundraising, travel, and supporting other candidates. The balance goes to the Republican National Committee (RNC).The PAC is an alternative to raising money for the campaign directly, which is limited in what it can do with the cash in its coffers. Unless he officially files as a candidate running for president in 2024, Trump’s campaign can only raise money to pay down debts, fund his legal challenges or pay for modest wind-down expenses, said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the FEC.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s campaign reported owing $11.3 million to vendors, but had $18.4 million cash on hand, more than enough to pay its bills.Very little of the money raised by TMAGA will cover Trump’s legal expenses. Trump is funding those through the campaign, which attributed $4.3 million of the $37.5 million it raised after Election Day to its recount fund. The campaign also listed $8.8 million of recount expenses, with the biggest line item the $3 million paid for a partial recount in Wisconsin.“They have a limited number of things they can do with the surplus,” Noble said of the campaign, including donating the money to charity or the RNC, or continuing litigation over the 2020 election.The post-election pitches have not only raised more money than Trump’s closing argument for a second term, they’ve been far more cost effective. TMAGA spent $22.4 million on fundraising expenses after the election, compared to $43.5 million in the weeks leading up to and including Election Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-has-raised-20s7-5-million-since-election-day-to-fight-lawsuits/story-309DxDsQwKmWwxFu5qflXM.html

The change followed the recent verdict of the Islamabad High Court barring un-elected advisers and special assistants from heading the Cabinet committees.Khan appointed Sheikh Rashid Ahmed as interior minister and Dr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh as finance minister.State-run Radio Pakistan reported that Ahmed was already a part of the Cabinet working as minister for railways, while Hafeez Sheikh was serving as advisor on finance and revenue.Hafeez Sheikh is not an elected member and he could not lead several committees. He was appointed as minister under Article 91 (9) of the Constitution and can serve as a minister for six months. He must be elected as a member of the National Assembly or Senate to continue after that.Brigadier Retired Ijaz Ahmad Shah who was serving the interior minister was appointed as minister for narcotics control, while Azam Khan Swati was appointed as minister for railways.It is believed that Hafeez Sheikh would be made a senator in March when the election for the upper house is scheduled to be held.The most notable elevation in the new Cabinet is that of Ahmed, who despite failing to improve the functioning of the railways, was given the charge of the interior ministry, a key portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-reshuffles-cabinet-on-court-s-directive/story-l9A6afYHo6LsUQJhRMOqaJ.html
11-12-2020||World||One year on, Wuhan market at epicentre of Covid-19 outbreak remains barricaded and empty||For over six years, 38-year-old Wuhan restaurant owner Lai Yun started most days the same way - with a trip to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, just ten minutes walk from his house.“I’d send the kids to school, have breakfast and then walk over to the market. It was very convenient,” he said.That changed on December 31, 2019, after four cases of a mystery pneumonia were linked to the market and it was shuttered overnight. By the end of the month, the city had begun a gruelling 76-day lockdown that came with just hours notice and barred people from leaving their homes.Almost a year since the outbreak began, Covid-19 has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, and the Wuhan wet market where it was initially detected stands empty even as the city around it has come back to life. It’s become a symbol of the fierce political and scientific battle raging around the origin of the virus with Beijing continuing to spar with the United States and other countries, accusing them of bias.A team of World Health Organization (WHO) experts has yet to visit Wuhan, let alone the market. Health authorities in China and abroad have warned that origin tracing efforts could take years and yield inconclusive results.In Wuhan, where the stigma of being the first coronavirus epicentre hangs heavy, over a dozen residents and business owners told Reuters they don’t believe the virus began in the city.“It certainly couldn’t have been Wuhan... surely another person brought it in. Or surely it came from some other product brought from outside. There were just certain conditions for it to appear here,” said a wet market vendor in the city’s centre who gave his name as Chen.In recent months, Chinese diplomats and state media have said they believe the market is not the origin but the victim of the disease, and have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country.Restricted AccessExperts say the market still plays a role in the investigation and is therefore unlikely to be demolished, though much of that research will rely on samples taken immediately after the outbreak began.“The first cluster of cases was there, so at least it would be of interest to find out the origin of those and put forward a few hypotheses, like whether it’s more likely from the wild animals or perhaps points to a human superspreader,” said Jin Dong-Yan, professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong.Access to the area remains heavily restricted. People who visited before the lockdown remember a bustling building with hundreds of stalls divided into sections for red meat, seafood and vegetables.Recently, the local government has added leafy green plants and traditional Chinese paintings to the semi-permanent blue barricades encircling the area. Inside, wooden boards line the stalls and windows.On the second floor above the empty market, shops selling glasses and optometry equipment reopened in June. This week, a guard at the entrance to the eyeware market took temperatures and warned journalists not to take videos or photos from inside the building.“Maybe some people have some bad feelings about it, but now it’s just an empty building, who feels anxious about an empty building?” said a shop assistant selling contact lenses, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.While Wuhan hasn’t reported any new locally transmitted cases of Covid-19 since May, for some who relied on the market making ends meet is still a struggle.Lai, who reopened his Japanese restaurant in June, says the market’s closure and subsequent public panic about the safety of imported seafood has increased the cost of procuring some ingredients five-fold.“Our goal for the next year is to just survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-year-on-wuhan-market-at-epicentre-of-covid-19-outbreak-remains-barricaded-and-empty/story-FlCvn5ugYbGFFxdc5E0RLJ.html

The company was notified that if it wished to carry out work they would need to first obtain the appropriate mitigation and a Natural England European Protected Species licence.All bats within the UK are covered under the European Protected Species (EPS) regulations and receive full protection under the Conservation of Species and Habitats regulations 2010, which makes it an absolute offence to deliberately capture, injure or kill any of the EPS, or to deliberately disturb them, or to damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place.The company had not applied for licence from Natural England and following the police investigation, the company was charged on in November 2019. It pleaded guilty this week of carrying out the construction activity and destroying/damaging the breeding site in March 2018.Inspector David Hawtin of the Greenwich Safer Neighbourhoods Team said: “The success of this case has been the result of diligent investigation…With the expert assistance of colleagues from specialist units within the Metropolitan Police Service, the officers constructed evidence to prove that the company had indeed committed an offence by carrying out work at a site where bats were known to inhabit”.“Bellway Homes has admitted responsibility for this and I hope it reinforces the message that this legislation is there for a reason and should be adhered too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-builder-destroyed-breeding-site-of-bats-fined-600-000/story-a4Nf3wfJz8dP17zuxd3IWM.html

Brandon Bernard, 40, was given the death penalty for his involvement in the murder of a religious couple from Iowa in June 1999.According to the US Department of Justice, Bernard and his accomplices robbed the two ministers, Todd and Stacie Bagley, and forced them into the trunk of their car in Texas. The couple were shot by 19-year-old accomplice Christopher Vialva before Bernard set the car alight.Several high-profile individuals, including Kim Kardashian West, had appealed to Trump to commute the death sentence to life in prison. Five of the nine surviving jurors on the case had also urged Trump to grant clemency to Bernard, who was in his teen when the crime was committed. Bernard received a lethal injection of phenobarbital at a US prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was pronounced dead at 9.27pm local time on Thursday at the penitentiary.Also Read | US carries out rare execution during presidential transitionPresident Donald Trump resumed federal executions in July and four more executions are planned before president-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20, 2021.

Federal minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand echoed that mood in the House of Commons. “This has been a wonderful week for Canadians. We are going to have vaccines in this country on Monday.”The news has been a welcome relief for Canadians, with provinces recording new highs in infections during the second wave of the coronavirus crisis in the country. The death toll has reached 13,109, taking just 11 days to add more than 1,000 fatalities.

Both sides say they want a trade deal but negotiations are deadlocked.After British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday there was “a strong possibility” a deal would not be clinched, von der Leyen said the probability of a no-deal had risen.“The probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the message von der Leyen gave leaders at an EU summit in Brussels.Johnson and von der Leyen have given negotiators until Sunday evening to break the impasse over fishing rights and allowing Britain to be punished if in the future it diverged from the bloc’s rules.“Situation is difficult. Main obstacles remain,” the EU official said of von der Leyen’s message. “To be seen by Sunday whether a deal is possible.”Sterling tumbled, stocks fell and implied volatility surged as investors started to price in the risk of a chaotic finale to the five-year Brexit crisis. The pound fell 0.8% against the dollar to $1.3190 before recovering somewhat.A no-trade deal Brexit would damage the economies of northern Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.Most major investment banks still say a deal is their central prediction, but some investors recall that Wall Street and the City of London were poorly prepared for the 2016 referendum as few believed Britain would vote to leave.Theatrics?While some EU diplomats have cast Johnson’s rhetoric as theatrics intended to wrench out a deal and please his domestic Brexit supporters, British officials say London cannot accept the EU’s demands and caution that a no-deal is on the cards. British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was still a chance of an agreement but added that no British leader could accept the EU’s demands. “Still, I think, there is a significant possibility that we could get that deal,” Dowden, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, told Sky News. “That deal cannot come at any price.”British and EU negotiators seeking a new arrangement on nearly $1 trillion in annual trade have been stuck on two main issues for weeks: how much fish EU boats can take from British waters and how far the EU can tie Britain into its rules in the future. Trucks heading towards the English port of Dover were stacked up for miles on Thursday.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said there was a limit to the central bank’s ability to avoid all disruption or volatility in financial markets after Britain’s Brexit transition period - during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union - ends on Dec. 31.“I don’t want us to be in a situation, were it to occur, where people say ‘well you haven’t done this and you haven’t done that’ but I have to say there is a limit to what we can do,” Bailey told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-trade-deal-brexit-now-more-likely-than-a-deal-eu-chief/story-H4lwDYIpX5oVEPysrmnfyO.html
11-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Here are 10 least affected countries in the world||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has affected 218 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, according to worldometers.info. The United States leads the tally with 16,039,393 cases reported so far. There are some who have reported one or less than 20 cases of the respiratory disease.Here are the top 10 countries with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases:VanuatuVanuatu has reported only one coronavirus disease case till date, a 23-year-old American tourist who tested positive on November 10. Vanuatu imposed domestic and international travel restrictions after the American national tested positive and extended the necessary quarantine period from 14 t0 28 days.According to the island nation’s English newspaper the Daily Post on Wednesday, Vanuatu’s Prime Minister Bob Loughman said the nation has contained its first Covid-19 case after test results from the first Covid-19 patient sent to Australia for further examination came back negative.SamoaThe Pacific nation of Samoa reported its first case of coronavirus disease in November according to The Guardian, after reporting zero cases for 11 months since the pandemic started. The Samoan national who tested positive had been brought back home on a repatriation flight from Australia and the second case was detected within days. It was another sailor who had travelled on a repatriation flight from New Zealand. Both have since recovered, according to worldometer.Wallis and FutunaThe French Polynesian nation of Wallis and Futuna officially reported its first case of Covid-19 in October. Patient zero was reported to be asymptomatic by state media. On November 12 and 24, the second and third cases were reported taking the total to three. Patient zero has since then recovered, according to worldometer. The state authorities moved swiftly and imposed restrictions on travelling. Only travellers who can prove that entry is for urgent family/work reasons were allowed to enter Wallis and Futuna. They were expected to complete a travel certificate, stating that they do not have any coronavirus disease-related symptoms or have been in contact with anyone who has exhibited said symptoms.Marshall IslandsLike most Pacific islands the Marshall Islands too closed its borders in March to protect its population from the coronavirus disease. In October, two cases were detected in a US military base after a man and a woman tested positive. They flew in from Hawaii on a military plane and were asymptomatic, according to the BBC.AnguillaAnguilla reported its first cases of Covid-19 as early as March when an American woman and an Anguillan man who had been in contact with each other tested positive. Since then, 10 coronavirus disease cases have been reported, and seven people have recovered so far, according to worldometer. Anguilla’s health infrastructure is terribly underfunded hence the Caribbean island has been on high alert since March.Western SaharaWestern Sahara has reported 10 cases of Covid-19 so far and one fatality. Eight people have also reportedly recovered, according to worldometer.MontserratThe Caribbean island of Montserrat reported 13 cases of Covid-19, with the first case reported as early as March. So far, 12 cases have witnessed a full recovery and one death, that of a 92-year-old woman, has been recorded in the island, according to worldometer.Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Pierre and Miquelon reported 14 coronavirus disease cases and all 14 have successfully recovered, as per data provided by the worldometer.Solomon IslandsThe Solomon Islands reported 17 cases of coronavirus disease and the first was reported on October 3 after a student repatriated from the Philippines tested positive. The islands have witnessed five recoveries so far and no fatalities, according to worldometer.Falkland IslandsFalkland Island reported 17 cases of Covid-19 and all of them have successfully recovered, as per worldometer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-here-are-10-least-affected-countries-in-the-world/story-POuoRv7L4BDSOgpNdMjY9N.html
11-12-2020||World||EU leaders agree to reduce emissions after night-long discussions||European Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend.Following night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission’s proposal to toughen the bloc’s intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.“Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,” tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. “We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.”Five years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc’s heads of state and government were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.But the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.Large swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30% of the package should be used to support the transition.Still, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s.Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.To win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister’s office, “leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.”In addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.The accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc’s solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states’ rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.According to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU’s Emissions Trading System — a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions — would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.“To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,” the NGO said.Climate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised “net” target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.“As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission’s biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5% of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50%,” the NGO said.EU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc’s borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-leaders-agree-to-reduce-emissions-after-night-long-discussions/story-BIDTREmqAo4ssIkFNvMmxH.html

Using two different vectors for two vaccine shots will result in higher efficacy than using the same vector for two shots,” they said on Nov. 23.Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19In its statement on Friday, AstraZeneca said it was considering how it could assess combinations of different vaccines, and would soon begin exploring with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, whether two common cold virus-based vaccines could be successfully combined.Data published in a journal this week showed that AstraZeneca’s vaccine, being developed along with The University of Oxford, has average efficacy of 70.4%, based on a pooled analysis of interim data from late stage trials.Also Read | US should not wait too long on AstraZeneca vaccine, Oxford’s Hill saysRussia has claimed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results.Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which has funded Sputnik V, said: “This shows the strength of Sputnik V technology and our willingness and desire to partner with other vaccines to fight against Covid together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-and-russia-announce-collaboration-on-vaccine-trials/story-nknyP4In6vPLwLkoNEGGeM.html
11-12-2020||World||South-East Asia Region: WHO, regulators and manufacturers discuss fast-tracking of Covid vaccine roll-out||The World Health Organization (WHO), national regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers in WHO South-East Asia Region on Friday discussed fast tracking of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine rollout in member countries. “The vaccine manufacturing and regulatory sectors have a critical role to play in equitable and efficient deployment of vaccines,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region, at the two-day virtual meeting that ended today. The meeting deliberated processes and timelines to fast-track registration of Covid-19 vaccines in countries using the Emergency Use Listing procedures while comprehending the landscape of Covid-19 vaccine production in the region. Aimed at strengthening collaboration between national programmes, vaccine producers and regulators in the region for Covid-19 vaccine deployment, the meeting provided a platform for interaction and experience sharing for vaccine registration, deployment and regulation. Also read | India’s daily Covid tally falls below 30k for second time in 3 days, recoveries nearing 9.3 millionAmong the vaccine manufacturers, from India Bharat Biotech International Ltd, Biological E Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Wockhardt Limited; from Indonesia Bio Farma Limited, and from Thailand Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Bionet Asia Co.Ltd and Siam Bioscience, participated in the meeting. The regional director said all countries in the region are now developing and finalising national deployment and vaccination plans for Covid-19, of which regulatory preparedness is a core component. Establishing expedited regulatory pathways for vaccine approval and adjusting regulatory pathways to the type of vaccine that is developed and filed for approval remains critical as emergency use authorisation will precede full licensure, Dr Khetrapal Singh said. While vaccine licensure systems may need to be modified, having standard operating procedures and stipulated timelines for emergency use authorisation would be vital, she said. The regional director emphasised on effective coordination, collaboration and information-sharing. From R&D to production, and from information on country readiness to post-marketing surveillance, manufacturers, regulators, policy-makers and planners must continue to work together to optimise and refine vaccine deployment. “Countries in our region are among the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers, and the vaccines produced here are likely to be administered to billions of people globally. I am certain that together, in solidarity with all people of the region and the world, you will effectively contribute to health and well-being of all,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said. Key global and regional partners such as GAVI and UNICEF participated in the meeting. This was the second such meeting with vaccine manufacturers and regulators organised in WHO South East Asia Region, with the first held in April. WHO has been supporting member countries of the region prepare for COVID-19 vaccines. A special session of the WHO South-East Asia Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group was organised in November. The expert group made a series of recommendations, including a fast tracking of the development of national deployment and vaccination plan, the application of guidelines provided by the ‘Values framework for the allocation and prioritisation of Covid-19 vaccines’ and the prioritisation roadmap to identify priority populations and ensuring equity in delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, especially during the early stages when vaccine supply is expected to be limited. The expert group also recommended that all countries should ensure availability of high-quality, complete and timely Covid-19 surveillance data on all risk groups, including migrants and remote or displaced populations, for decision-making related to vaccination. While establishing collaboration with other health programmes and sectors for optimum delivery of vaccine, countries should also leverage their experience in vaccine delivery platforms for adults, including experience with seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination and measles and rubella and Japanese encephalitis vaccination campaigns, to find effective ways to reach eligible adults with Covid-19 vaccines. Adjustments should be made to vaccination strategies in accordance with the Covid-19 prevention measures and plans developed for demand generation, community engagement and risk communication, with special consideration for overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Countries should leverage the use of existing networks, including those for polio, to support the deployment of Covid-19 vaccines where appropriate. The expert group highlighted the need for all countries to assess available cold chain space and meticulously plan cold chain requirement, including necessary improvements in storage, stock management, vaccine delivery strategy and waste management. Earlier, WHO organised a meeting of cold chain managers of countries of the South-East Asia Region to help assess cold chain needs, identify gaps and plan for appropriate measures. At the global level since April, the ACT-Accelerator partnership, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight Covid-19. Its vaccine pillar -- COVAX -- is co-led by WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-national-regulators-and-vaccine-manufacturers-in-south-east-asia-region-discuss-fast-tracking-covid-vaccines/story-thk4e4GMqYLyaj6hUISMVJ.html
11-12-2020||World||US carries out rare execution during presidential transition||The Trump administration Thursday carried out its ninth federal execution of the year in what has been a first series of executions during a presidential lame-duck period in 130 years, putting to death a Texas street-gang member in the slayings of a religious couple from Iowa more than two decades ago.Four more federal executions, including one Friday, are planned in the weeks before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. One was carried out in late November.The case of Brandon Bernard, who received a lethal injection of phenobarbital at a US prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, was a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when his crime was committed.Several high-profile figures, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, had appealed to President Donald Trump to commute Bernard’s sentence to life in prison.With witnesses looking on from behind a glass barrier separating them from a pale-green death chamber, the 40-year-old Bernard was pronounced dead at 9:27pm Eastern time.He directed his last words to the family of the couple he played a role in killing, speaking with striking calm for someone who knew he was about to die.“I’m sorry,” he said, lifting his head and looking at witness-room windows. “That’s the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day.”As he spoke, he showed no outward signs of fear or distress, speaking lucidly and naturally. He spoke for more than three minutes, saying he had been waiting for this chance to say he was sorry — not only to the victims’ family, but also for the pain he caused his own family.Referring to his part in the killing, he said: “I wish I could take it all back, but I can’t.”Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas, during which Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire with their bodies in the back trunk.Federal executions were resumed by Trump in July after a 17-year hiatus despite coronavirus outbreak in US prisons.Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, spoke to reporters within 30 minutes of the execution, saying she wanted to thank Trump, Attorney General William Barr and others at the Justice Department.“Without this process,” she said, reading from a statement, “my family would not have the closure needed to move on in life.” She called the killings a “senseless act of unnecessary evil.”But she stopped reading from the prepared text and became emotional when she spoke about the apologies from Bernard before he died Friday and from an accomplice, Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the group who shot the Bagley’s in the head before the car was burned. He was executed in September.“The apology and remorse ... helped very much heal my heart,” she said, beginning to cry and then recomposing herself. “I can very much say: I forgive them.”Earlier inside the death chamber, Bernard lay on a cross-shaped gurney with IV lines running into both arms. He looked back when a U.S. marshal picked up a phone and asked if there were any reasons not to proceed. Bernard reacted calmly as the marshall put down the phone and said the execution could proceed.Bernard didn’t exhibit the labored breathing and constant twitching of others executed previously had. A minute after the lethal injection, his eyes slowly closed and he barely moved again.About 20 minutes later, faint white blotches appeared on his skin and someone entered from a chamber door, listened to his heart, felt for a pulse, then walked out. Seconds later, an official said Bernard was dead.Alfred Bourgeois, a 56-year-old Louisiana truck driver, is set to die Friday for killing his 2-year-old daughter by repeatedly slamming her head into a truck’s windows and dashboard. Bourgeois’ lawyers alleged he was intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty, but several courts said evidence didn’t support that claim.Before Bernard’s execution, Kardashian West tweeted that she’d spoken to him earlier: “Hardest call I’ve ever had. Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are ok. He told me not to cry because our fight isn’t over.”Just before the execution was scheduled, Bernard’s lawyers filed papers with the Supreme Court seeking to halt the execution, but the high court denied the request, clearing the way for the execution to proceed.Bernard had been crocheting in prison and even launched a death-row crocheting group in which inmates have shared patterns for making sweaters, blankets and hats, said Ashley Kincaid Eve, an anti-death penalty activist.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was when Grover Cleveland was president in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard set the car on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial.The case prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.The teenagers approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva, the oldest of the group at 19, pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-rare-execution-during-presidential-transition/story-PL5NGhQ0flVe1qwoThEFoI.html
11-12-2020||World||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai charged under security law||Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city’s national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday. He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.He is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 12, and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Police said in a statement that they arrested a 73-year-old man under the national security law, but did not name him.Lai was arrested under the national security law in August. He and two executives of Next Digital, the company that operates the Apple Daily newspaper, were later charged with fraud over accusations that they violated lease terms on office space the company. He was denied bail earlier this month.Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong’s internal affairs. In certain cases, those charged under the national security law could also face trial in mainland China, where the legal system is highly opaque.The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when was handed over to China from Britain in 1997. Critics have said the law is also damaging Hong Kong’s status as a business center.Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the “final nail in the coffin” of the territory’s autonomy.Lai has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and last year he traveled to the US to meet with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the proposed extradition bill.He was also arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-charged-under-security-law/story-f09yyXYWTsg4eEUbFNZ17N.html

Over 10,000 servicemen have already been vaccinated and around 100,000 servicemen should receive the vaccine by the end of the year.“Doctors planning to leave for military service, crews of the Navy’s vessels, flight personnel of the Russian Aerospace Forces, combat crews of the Strategic Missile Forces and command posts of all levels, and commanders of the armed forces’ units are the first in line to receive the vaccine,” Konashenkov said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-navy-aerospace-forces-to-be-vaccinated-first-says-defence-ministry/story-ZtJNSEiF2r6oVPgqkWTUaO.html
11-12-2020||World||US plans to sanction Turkey for purchasing Russian S-400 missiles||The US plans to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of S-400 missiles after years of drama that began with the NATO ally’s decision to buy the air-defense system from Russia in 2017.President Donald Trump has signed off on a package of measures recommended by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, according to two people familiar with the matter. The people didn’t say what the sanctions would include.The sanctions would be imposed under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, known as CAATSA. Trump, who has long highlighted his personal rapport with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had resisted bipartisan calls from Congress to punish Turkey for the deal with Russia.The White House National Security Council didn’t respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Treasury Department and State Department also didn’t respond.The lira fell after Reuters earlier reported that the sanctions would likely target Turkey’s defense officials, including the chief of the top defense procurement agency. The currency was trading 0.2% lower at 7.9011 per dollar at 9:33 a.m. in Istanbul.Ankara has argued that the air defense system is an urgent need given the military conflicts surrounding the country, and said allies including the US failed to offer it any alternatives -- such as the Patriot missile defense system -- on terms acceptable to Turkey.Turkey’s decision to buy the S-400 did have one cost: the country was essentially expelled from the US-led F-35 program. The country, a member of NATO, had planned to buy about 100 of the next-generation fighters built by Lockheed Martin Corp., and while Turkey continues to manufacture some key components for the fighter jet, that is expected to wind down in 2022.A chief US concern is that the S-400 could be used to collect intelligence on the stealth capabilities of the F-35.The relationship between Washington and Ankara has been fraught over a number of problems that go well beyond Turkey’s decision to buy advanced military hardware from Russia. The two nations are also at odds over US support for Syrian Kurdish militants who Turkey considers to be terrorists. Turkey has also clashed with the US in its conflict with Cyprus and Greece over maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-to-sanction-turkey-for-purchasing-russian-s-400-missiles/story-vTXO6r45DhsqINZXw6HtUL.html
11-12-2020||World||Australia ends Covid-19 vaccine trials due to HIV antibody positives||Australia on Friday stopped the further development of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate as several participants in the early-stage trials generated antibodies for HIV after receiving the potential therapeutic. There were no serious adverse events or safety concerns reported in the 216 participants of the phase 1 trial of the v451 Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by the University of Queensland (UQ) in collaboration with biotech company CSL, according to a statement. However, data showed that some patients developed antibodies towards fragments of a HIV protein (gp41), which was used to stabilise the vaccine, it said. Following consultation with the Australian Government, UQ and CSL decided not to progress the vaccine candidate to phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The vaccine was one of four candidates that Australia had committed to buy and accordingly agreements were made to secure 51 million doses of the experimental vaccine. UQ said the trial participants were fully informed of the possibility of a partial immune response to this protein component, however, it was unexpected that the antibody levels induced would interfere with certain HIV tests. The university said there is no possibility the vaccine causes infection, and routine follow up tests confirmed there is no HIV virus present. The decision was taken after the makers consulted experts who worked out the “implications” that this issue presents to rolling out the vaccine into broad populations, it said. Reacting to the announcement, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said abandoning the trial should show Australians the Government and researchers were proceeding carefully. “What happened today is not a surprise to the Government. We are moving swiftly but not with any undue haste,” he said, adding the system’s working as it should and Australians are protected, as always. The University of Queensland commenced the phase 1 trial of v451 in July 2020, to assess its safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. It said the vaccine candidate has shown that it elicits a robust response towards the novel coronavirus and has a strong safety profile. However, significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing procedures in the healthcare setting to accommodate rollout of this vaccine, according to the statement. Although the makers have abandoned further trials, the university said the phase 1 trial will continue to assess how long the HIV antibodies persist, adding studies so far show that the levels are already falling. The University of Queensland also plans to submit the full data for peer review publication. UQ vaccine co-lead, Professor Paul Young, said that although it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, the team did not have the luxury of time needed. “Doing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone’s priority,” Young said. “I said at the start of vaccine development that there were no guarantees, but what is really encouraging is that the core technology approach we used has passed the major clinical test. It is a safe and well-tolerated vaccine, producing the strong virus-neutralising effect that we were hoping to see,” he said. Andrew Nash, Chief Scientific Officer for CSL noted that this outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development, and the rigorous assessment involved in making decisions as to what discoveries advance. Reacting to the announcement, Sanjaya Senanayake, a specialist in Infectious Diseases and Associate Professor of Medicine at The Australian National University, said while it is disappointing that an Australian vaccine candidate has been taken off the table, it is not surprising that one of the many COVID-19 vaccines has failed. “In general, about 90 per cent of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of COVID-19 vaccines have taken place,” Senannayake said. Diego Silva from Sydney Health Ethics in the University of Sydney School of Public Health noted that although the development might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success. “Science cannot be all about producing positive results; negative results will and must occur. Negative results are also as important as success in science, since they, too, form part of the evidence base for future research,” said Silva. “The researchers at UQ did the right thing by prioritising the safety of participants and the soundness of science by stopping when they did,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-ends-covid-19-vaccine-trials-due-to-hiv-antibody-positives/story-zpxw50w41tFvZmetL2bawM.html
11-12-2020||World||Sanofi, GSK Covid-19 vaccine to be ready only at the end of 2021||France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said Friday their Covid-19 vaccines will not be ready until the end of 2021, after interim results showed a low immune response in older adults.The announcement is a huge setback in efforts to fight the pandemic, which first emerged in China last December and has killed over 1.5 million people worldwide.Sanofi and GSK said the delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based Covid-19 vaccine programme was to “improve immune response in older adults.” The vaccine’s potential availability had been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” they said in a statement.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.US experts voted Thursday to recommend granting emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for America to become the next country to move ahead with mass immunisation after the UK. Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved it.The Sanofi-GSK candidate is based on technology that Sanofi has used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines and on immunological agents developed by GSK.“Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from Covid-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen,” the statement said.It said a recent study in non-human primates using an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the candidate could “protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days.” “These results increase the companies’ confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults,” it said.The hunt for a vaccine brings up questions like whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.‘More than one vaccine needed’ Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.“We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccine,” he said.“There is no question of abandoning the vaccine,” he told AFP.Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines despite far less vetting, while several other vaccines are being developed in the West.Japan has formalised a deal with UK drugmaker AstraZeneca to receive 120 million doses of its coronavirus vaccines, the health ministry said Friday. Tokyo has also secured Covid-19 vaccines for 60 million people from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and for a further 25 million people from biotech firm Moderna. Vaccination could start as early as March 2021, Kyodo News agency reported this week.“No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic,” Triomphe said.Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a Covid-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response.”The companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February. If the data is positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of next year.“Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-gsk-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-ready-only-at-the-end-of-2021/story-L0UN1IqKMWcn3noBkjT1KN.html
11-12-2020||World||Boris Johnson asks UK to prepare for no EU trade deal after Brexit||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned business and the public to prepare to leave the European Union’s (EU) single market without a trade deal as negotiations with the bloc falter.Speaking a day after crisis talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ended without a breakthrough, Johnson said Britain will continue to seek a deal. But he also warned that the bloc’s demand that the UK follow future changes in the EU’s rules is a major obstacle.“There’s now the strong possibility we will have a solution that’s much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview Thursday.“Looking at where we are, I do think it’s vital that everybody now gets ready for that Australian option,” he said. Under that option, the UK would fall back on the rules of the World Trade Organization and face tariffs as well as quotas when the transition ends on December 31.Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull later told the BBC’s “Question Time” program that his country doesn’t have a “satisfactory” trade relationship with the EU.“Be careful what you wish for: Australia’s relationship with the EU is not one, from a trade point of view, that Britain I think would want,” he said. “There are very big barriers to Australian exports, agricultural products in particular. There’s a lot of friction in the system in terms of services. So there’s a lot to aim for.”The pound extended its decline after Johnson’s intervention. His remarks couldn’t come at a more delicate time as EU leaders meet in Brussels after seeing off a threat by Hungary and Poland to block a $2.2 trillion stimulus package. At the same time, a much-touted UK trade deal with Canada has hit delays.Atmosphere SouredWith the mood in the Brexit negotiating room suddenly turning pessimistic, any deal with the UK is now likely to depend on a last-minute intervention by either German Chancellor Angela Merkel or France’s Emmanuel Macron. Both are in the middle of an EU summit in Brussels and are in a position to make a difference as the two major powerbrokers in the bloc.One EU official close to the Brexit discussions said that Johnson’s words are more conciliatory than they might look at first glance: the Prime Minister could have chosen to end the negotiations, but he didn’t. Another official in Brussels brushed off the Prime Minister’s statement, saying it wasn’t a surprise and leaders have other things to talk about.And another European diplomat who’s following the negotiations closely said gloomy warnings are to be expected at this point in the process. He said that while the outcome is clearly hanging in the balance, he’s still predicting a deal either on Sunday or in the following days.It’s been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the EU, and both sides have dealt with their fair share of drama and brinkmanship. This time, it feels different and they’ve had almost a year to settle the same old stubborn sticking points.Moving On?One EU diplomat said the bloc had mentally moved on. It is possible that the two sides could agree on a “friendly no-deal,” allowing trade talks to resume later in 2021, another EU official said.Indeed, the bloc unveiled its contingency plans, first reported by Bloomberg, that show in actions that there is very much a Plan B in place. They include keeping flights in the air and trucks on the road, with the idea that the talks will resume.The negotiations have long been dogged by the disagreements over the EU’s right to fish in British waters and the so-called level playing field rules for fair competition for business. There is still no sign of how the differences over the fair competition issue can be bridged, an EU official said earlier in the day.Johnson argues that, for reasons of sovereignty, Britain must not be forced to follow the EU’s competition rules as they evolve in future years.Johnson’s Red LineThe EU’s demand “basically means that whatever new laws they brought in, we would have to follow or else face punishment,” Johnson said. “Clearly that’s not a sensible way to proceed.”The EU says the UK must keep up with its changing regulations to protect the integrity of the bloc’s single market. Johnson likened that to treating the UK and the bloc like twins, with Britain “locked into the EU’s regulatory penumbra.”“If the EU decides to have a haircut, then the UK has got to have a haircut or else face punishment,” he said. “Or the EU decides to buy an expensive handbag, then the UK has to buy an expensive handbag too or else face tariffs and punishment.”He also rejected EU proposals on fisheries that would mean the UK still wouldn’t have control of its waters, many years after people voted to leave the EU.Both sides appear to be coming to terms with the fact that it may be impossible to reach a compromise. Failure to do so would deliver a major blow to pandemic-struck economies and disrupt supply chains for businesses.In another Brexit development, the UK published a document Thursday outlining how trade will work in Northern Ireland, and committed to covering the paperwork costs for businesses moving food into the province from Great Britain. Supermarkets had previously warned they may withdraw from Northern Ireland if they had to pay the costs.Johnson emphasized the UK hasn’t stopped trying.“What I’ve said to our negotiators is that we’ve got to keep going,” Johnson said. “And we’ll go the extra mile. And we will, and I will go to Brussels, I’ll go to Paris or go to Berlin, or wherever, to try to get this home and get to a deal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-asks-uk-to-prepare-for-no-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit/story-BhxTDIIsQw1eSMDrDuLzeL.html
11-12-2020||World||UN backs Afghan peace talks in resolution, Russia votes ‘no’||The UN General Assembly (UNGA) approved a resolution over Russian objections Thursday commending progress in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban while urging stepped-up efforts to tackle terrorist attacks by the Taliban, al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates.The vote in the 193-member world body was 130 in favour, Russia against, and China, Pakistan, and Belarus abstaining. Fifty-nine countries did not vote.The 15-page resolution titled “The Situation in Afghanistan” covers a wide range of issues including peace and reconciliation, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, counter-narcotics, social and economic development and regional cooperation.While welcoming progress in the intra-Afghan talks, including the December 2 agreement on rules of procedure for negotiations, the resolution “condemns the high rate of continued violence.” It says this “is contributing to an unacceptable number of casualties” and calls for an immediate cessation of violence and strongly encourages the Afghan government and the Taliban “to pursue confidence-building measures and to reduce violence.”,The resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s “serious concern” about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the country’s stability from violence committed by the Taliban, including the Haqqani Network, as well as al-Qaida, Islamic State, their affiliates “and other terrorist and criminal groups.”Afghanistan’s UN ambassador, Adela Raz, expressed regret that despite her government’s strong support for the resolution it wasn’t adopted by consensus, saying the measure reflects “developments that are taking place on the ground and particularly the progress in the peace process.”Raz said the goal of the government, Afghanistan’s neighbours and the General Assembly is to incorporate the Taliban as a political party. “It is our utmost aim to see the Taliban as a constructive political party in the country, without the relationship with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, working for prosperity and peace in Afghanistan,” she said.Noting that UN experts monitoring sanctions against the Taliban say it “maintains ties to terrorist groups such as al-Qaida,” Raz said the resolution is balanced regarding “the Taliban’s willingness to take firm steps towards peace and reconciliation” and its continuing attacks and terrorist ties.German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, whose country led negotiations on the resolution, said that “out of all the `special years’ for Afghanistan declared in the past two decades, 2020 was indeed singular.” Most important was the start of Afghan peace negotiations in September, he said after detailing all the events leading to the talks, starting with the US-Taliban agreement in February.Heusgen also pointed to pledges of more than $13 billion in foreign aid and stabilization for Afghanistan at a donors conference in Geneva just over two weeks ago as evidence that “the international community stands firmly behind the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its ongoing quest to achieve self-reliance.”He said the resolution is “constructive and forward-looking” and the vote signals that the General Assembly “stands behind the Afghan people in a very difficult period of the country.”Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, sharply criticized Germany’s role in the negotiations, saying there was “blatant disregard” for Moscow’s concerns. She also said it is “an attempt to conceal the true scope” of threats from the Islamic State extremist group and drug issues threatening the country’s security.She accused Germany of having “a pre-established biased position favouring one group of states,” which she didn’t name, and said it should no longer facilitate negotiations on the Afghanistan resolution in the General Assembly.Nonetheless, Evstigneeva said, “we continue to support Afghanistan during this crucial period.”Germany’s Heusgen responded by saying Russia’s “no” vote sends the message that “Russia today let down the Afghan people.”“All of us should have voted in favor and should have sent a strong signal to the Afghan people: In these difficult times, we stand behind you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-backs-afghan-peace-talks-in-resolution-russia-votes-no/story-fKuXBuAVw1m0U564AskMyK.html

Time’s magazine cover has a picture of Biden, 78, and Harris, 56, with the subtitle “Changing America’s story.”Biden beat Trump by 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232 to end the real estate tycoon-turned-politician’s presidency after one term.Biden received roughly seven million more votes than his Republican adversary, who is yet to concede, claiming widespread fraud of which there is no evidence. Time magazine’s award -- handed out annually since 1927 -- honors the person or people who most impacted the news, for better or worse, during the calendar year.Earlier Thursday, Time named basketball superstar LeBron James Athlete of the Year for his achievements on and off the court.The 35-year-old Los Angeles Lakers player was honored for battling voter suppression among Black citizens in a year when he won his fourth NBA title.

11-12-2020||World||US closer to Covid-19 vaccine as cases surge again||The US regulator of food and drug safety could grant emergency authorisation for Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine within hours or days now, after its advisers voted on Thursday to recommend its use for people over the age of 16, bringing hope to a country hit the hardest by the pandemic.The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory board voted after a day-long meeting that was streamed live to address concerns and scepticism about this vaccine and inoculation generally. “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?” was the question put before the board for a vote.Seventeen members voted yes, four voted against and one abstained.The advisory team will take a similar vote on pharmaceutical company Moderna’s vaccine next week.Pfizer has said its vaccines, which have to be stored and transported at extremely low temperatures, will be ready to ship from storage facilities with 24 hours of getting the formal approval. They will be administered first to those at the highest risk: frontline healthcare workers and residents of nursing homes, and the elderly, who have borne the brunt of the deadly virus.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved already for use by the United Kingdom, which started administrating it Tuesday — with a man called William Shakespeare among the first recipients, and Canada. The US will be the third, but probably the most relieved given the scale of the devastation.The United States accounts for 15.5 million of the 69 million infections worldwide and more than 291,000 of the 1.5 million fatalities. With the onset of winter, it is experiencing a new surge in cases and deaths as people spend more time indoors. Over 221,000 new cases and 3,000 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned it will get worse: more people will die every day of Covid-19 than the toll of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 — a 9/11 every day, is how commentators are reporting his warning — for the next two or three months.President-elect Joe Biden welcomed the FDA development as “a bright light in a needlessly dark time” but pointed to the challenges ahead. “Vaccines don’t equal vaccinations,” he said. “Our challenge now is to scale up manufacturing and distribution to distribute 100 million shots in the first 100 days of my administration.”There had been no word from President Donald Trump on the development. From the string of his tweets, he appeared more focused on his efforts to overturn his election defeat and rallying Republican elected officials behind around his efforts, that include a long shot lawsuit in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-closer-to-covid-19-vaccine-as-cases-surge-again/story-sJ91PabxxOmmFRBZO8QAbM.html
11-12-2020||World||Australia halts local Covid vaccine development due to HIV false positives||Australia abruptly halted the production of a home-made vaccine against Covid-19 after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis, the developers said, with its makers instead agreeing to produce additional doses of a rival vaccine.The inoculation being developed by the University of Queensland and vaccine maker CSL, one of four candidates contracted by the Australian government, was halted after “certain HIV diagnostic assays” returned false positives.While there were no serious adverse effects seen in the Phase 1 trial of 216 participants, data showed antibodies that had developed interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.Given the results, CSL said it had come to a decision with the Australian government to stop Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of the vaccine.“This outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development, and the rigorous assessment involved in making decisions as to what discoveries advance,” said Andrew Nash, CSL’s chief scientific officer.The government had made a final decision “that the University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia’s vaccine plan,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday.CSL will instead produce an extra 20 million doses of a vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc, on top of the 30 million it is already producing, while the government has also secured more doses of Novavax vaccines, with whom it already has supply contracts.Australia also has an agreement with Pfizer for 10 million dozes of its Covid-19 vaccine, with the country’s regulator expected to approve it by January 2021.All up, Australia has secured 140 million vaccine units to inoculate its 25 million people, one of the highest ratios of vaccine purchases to population in the world, officials said.Morrison said the government had not expected all four of the vaccine candidates it had chosen to come into production.“If that had occurred that would have been truly extraordinary,” he said. “So that’s why we spread our risk.”Australia is on track to start vaccinations in March and expects to have its whole population inoculated by the end of the year.Its tally of 28,000 Covid-19 infections is far fewer than many other developed countries, and until Thursday Australia had gone nearly three weeks without any local transmission of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-halts-local-covid-vaccine-development-due-to-hiv-false-positives/story-nEHq30COwHmXrU09s35uDM.html
11-12-2020||World||‘Concerning’ rise in Covid-19 cases puts London on the brink||The number of new Covid-19 cases are dropping in most of the UK, but there is a “concerning” rise in London, which is likely to place the capital in the highest Level 3 of alert with the toughest restrictions next week, when a review is conducted on December 16.London mayor Sadiq Khan and health secretary Matt Hancock sounded the caution on Thursday, asking people “not to blow it now”, as tens of thousands of people received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine across the country, with many more set to be inoculated soon.London is currently in Level 2 of the three-tier system of alerts with varying degrees of allowances and restrictions, but cases have been rising in 25 boroughs.Hancock said: “I’m particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Kent and Essex. Cases are rising – and in many areas, already high…We must not wait until the review which will take place on the 16 December. We need to take targeted action immediately”.There were 20,964 new cases across the UK as of Thursday evening, and 516 deaths. London recorded 4,144 new cases and 40 deaths, some of the highest figures in recent days. The first phase of vaccination in 73 hospitals across the UK includes those over 80 and healthcare professionals. It will be expanded to 10 more centres from Friday, with more due to be opened before Christmas.Hancock said: “The fall in the number of cases has flattened off – and is rising in some parts of the country...It shows us this fight is far from over and how we must all play our part and stay on our guard, now and through Christmas”.“We’ve got help on the horizon and we can all see that with the vaccine – so don’t blow it now…As more vaccines come on stream, we will open vaccination centres in larger venues, like sports stadia and conference halls next year and that’s when most people can expect to get their jabs”, he added.Urging Londoners to follow rules, Khan said: “None of us want our city to move into Tier 3. Please continue to follow the rules - lives and livelihoods truly are dependent on it”.Health officials are bracing for a spike in new cases over the Christmas period, when the government said rules will be relaxed for families to meet between December 23 and 28.Hancock said: “We’ve got to remember, in this battle, that we’re all on the same side. And, especially with Christmas coming, there’s something we all can do which is to respect the rules, and all of us, at all times, do all that we can to stop the spread of the virus”.“This is a marathon, not a sprint. We’ve got to keep going. The finish line is in sight”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerning-rise-in-covid-19-cases-puts-london-on-the-brink/story-akzTxkwmuYyJIHQwGxfbsL.html

Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca among many others have developed vaccines to combat the disease and governments are opting for emergency approvals to administer shots to frontline workers, senior citizens and those most vulnerable to Covid-19. Pfizer’s vaccine is already approved for use in the United Kingdom, Bahrain and Canada while Moderna has started a study of its vaccine in adolescents as the United States begins to distribute the first shots among adults.Here are the latest updates on the coronavirus vaccine:1. An advisory panel of the United States government has endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s vaccine, which puts the country just one step away from launching a vaccination drive to combat Covid-19. Shots might be administered within days, depending on how quickly the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signs off on the panel’s recommendation. The country remains to be worst affected by the pandemic with over 16 million cases and nearly 300,000 deaths.2. Egypt on Thursday received its first shipment of a vaccine from China’s Sinopharm, which was tested in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is said to be 86 per cent effective. Khaled Megahed, the health ministry spokesperson, stated that the government would first vaccinate health care workers, particularly those who are dealing with coronavirus cases adding they would receive two doses of the vaccine over a period of 21 days.Also Read: Survey identifies most vulnerable for Covid shot3. Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, India’s largest hospital chain, said that it is ready to administer one million vaccine doses per day but said that the central government is not clear on how vaccines will be distributed and whether the private sector would be involved. The company, through its digital app, has told its clients that a shot should be available in 60-120 days and customers will be the first ones to know about the vaccines. Apollo has held talks with Adar Poonawalla’s Serum Institute of India (SII)- which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer.4. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the government is scheduled to start a mass vaccination campaign on December 27 and added that the country is ready to make 60,000 vaccinations per day. The country has so far made deals with Pfizer, Moderna and other vaccine makers. Netanyahu over several months has faced criticism over his handling of the pandemic with citizens demanding his resignation.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic5. The Japanese government will purchase 10,500 deep freezers for storing vaccines. Japan has agreements to buy a total of 290 million doses of the vaccines from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc. Nearly 169,000 people have been infected and 2,465 have died till now.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-us-inches-towards-approving-pfizer-for-emergency-use-egypt-receives-1st-shipment-of-doses-from-china/story-xDs6pSjv67WDPlGDJwBheJ.html
11-12-2020||World||US set to execute 1st of 5 inmates before Joe Biden’s inauguration||The Trump administration is planning an unprecedented five more federal executions before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, starting with a Texas street-gang member set to be put to death Thursday for his role in the 1999 slayings of an Iowa religious couple whose bodies he burned in the trunk of their car.Brandon Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas. He would be the ninth federal inmate put to death since July, when President Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.If Bernard, now 40, receives a lethal injection as planned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, it would be a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when the crime occurred.But there has been a growing groundswell by celebrities including Kim Kardashian who were pushing for the execution to be halted.Kardashian tweeted that she’d spoken to Bernard earlier. “Hardest call I’ve ever had. Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are ok. He told me not to cry because our fight isn’t over.”And just before the execution was scheduled, Bernard’s lawyers filed papers with the Supreme Court seeking to halt the execution. The legal team expanded to include two very high-profile attorneys: Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard law professor who was part of Donald Trump’s impeachment defense team and whose clients have included O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow and Mike Tyson; and Ken Starr, who also defended Trump during the impeachment and is most famous as an independent counsel who led the investigation into Bill Clinton.Bernard has been crocheting in prison and even launched a death-row crocheting group in which inmates have shared patterns for making sweaters, blankets and hats, said Ashley Kincaid Eve, an anti-death penalty activist.Eve forwarded to The Associated Press Bernard’s latest communication with her on Wednesday, in which wrote, “I feel good today!” Eve, who is an Indianapolis-based lawyer but has not represented Bernard, said he was not as resigned to dying as others executed this year have been.“He desperately wants to live,” she said.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was during the presidency of Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking, subservient member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial. Bernard, they say, has repeatedly expressed remorse.“I can’t imagine how they feel about losing their family,” Bernard said about surviving Bagley relatives in a 2016 video statement from death row. “I wish that we could all go back and change it.” He also described taking part in youth outreach programs and embracing religion, saying, “I have tried to be a better person since that day.”The case has prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.Kardashian is among those who have asked Trump to stop the execution, saying in a series of recent tweets that Bernard’s “role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved.”The Justice Department refused to delay Thursday’s execution of Bernard, another inmate on Friday and three more in January, even after eight officials who participated in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus. The eight federal executions in 2020 already is more than in the previous 56 years combined.One of Bernard’s co-defendants, Christopher Vialva, was executed in September. Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, released a statement after that execution, saying, “I believe when someone deliberately takes the life of another, they suffer the consequences for their actions.”Prosecutors said Vialva, the oldest of the teens at 19, was the ringleader who shot the Bagleys, as they lay in the trunk before Bernard set the car on fire.The teenagers approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men, which critics said seemed calculated to make them less controversial amid summer protests over racial discrimination. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.The federal prosecutor who now wants a life term for Bernard, Angel Moore, says recent research shows people tend to view Blacks as more to blame than their white counterparts when the facts surrounding a crime are the same, and that young Black men are less likely to be given benefits of the doubt by jurors because of their immaturity.One juror whose 2016 written statement was included in the White House petition said he still believes Bernard is responsible for “horrible decisions that had horrendous outcomes” but that “I do not believe that Brandon should be executed for bad choices he made when he was 18.”Bernard’s 16-year-old daughter has said her father constantly warns her to stay away from the wrong crowds and how a single bad decision can ruin your life.She added: “I am hoping and asking the President to spare my dad’s life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-execute-1st-of-5-inmates-before-joe-biden-s-inauguration/story-7UekfYkQXJ43Ahcl5jeweN.html
11-12-2020||World||World carbon dioxide emissions drop 7 per cent in pandemic-hit 2020||A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show.The Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That’s down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data.Scientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, traveling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas.“Of course, lockdown is absolutely no the way to tackle climate change,” said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia.The same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said.Emissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That’s because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China’s emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said.The calculations — based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts — were praised as accurate by outside scientists.Even with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second.Final figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said.“We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,” said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner.Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said “I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.”“For example,” he added, “as people get good at telecommuting a couple of days a week or realize they don’t need quite so many business trips, we might see behavior-related future emissions decreases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-drop-7-per-cent-in-pandemic-hit-2020/story-MDA2aJwcLZgiDFGtfttsTL.html
11-12-2020||World||US panel endorses widespread use of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||A U.S. government advisory panel endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Thursday, putting the country just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.Shots could begin within days, depending on how quickly the Food and Drug Administration signs off, as expected, on the expert committee’s recommendation.“This is a light at the end of the long tunnel of this pandemic,” said Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.In a 17-4 vote with one abstention, the government advisers concluded that the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.That endorsement came despite questions about allergic reactions in two people who received the vaccine earlier this week when Britain became the first country to begin dispensing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.While there are a number of remaining unknowns about the vaccine, in an emergency, “the question is whether you know enough” to press ahead, said panel member Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He concluded that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.The decision came as Covid-19 cases surge to ever-higher levels across the U.S., with deaths setting an all-time, one-day record of more than 3,100 on Wednesday.Pfizer has said it will have about 25 million doses of the two-shot vaccine for the U.S. by the end of December. But the initial supplies will be reserved primarily for health care workers and nursing home residents, with other vulnerable groups next in line until ramped-up production enables shots to become widely available on demand — something that will probably not happen until the spring.Next week, the FDA will review a second vaccine, from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, that appears about as protective as Pfizer-BioNTech’s shot. A third candidate, from Johnson & Johnson, which would require just one dose, is working its way through the pipeline. Behind that is a candidate from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.U.S. health experts are hoping a combination of vaccines will ultimately enable the U.S. to conquer the outbreak.But experts estimate at least 70% of the U.S. population will have to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the point at which the virus can be held in check. That means it could be several months before things start get back to normal and Americans can put away their masks.All eyes now turn to the FDA staff scientists who will make the final decision of whether to press ahead with large-scale immunizations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. FDA’s vaccine director Dr. Peter Marks said ahead of the expert meeting that a decision would come within “days to a week.”The independent review by non-government experts in vaccine development, infectious diseases and medical statistics was considered critical to boosting Americans’ confidence in the safety of the shot, which was developed at breakneck speed less than a year after the virus was identified.Regulators not only in Britain but in Canada have already approved the vaccine for use in their countries, and President Donald Trump and White House officials have complained for weeks about the pace of FDA’s careful review.“Americans want us to do a scientific review, but I think they also want us to make sure we’re not wasting time on paperwork as opposed to going forward with the decision,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said before the meeting.A positive vote for the vaccine was virtually assured after FDA scientists issued a glowing review of the vaccine earlier in the week. Agency staffers said data from Pfizer’s ongoing study of 44,000 people showed strong protection across different age groups, races and health conditions with no major, unexpected safety problems.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot remains experimental because that final-stage study isn’t complete. As a result, the expert panel wrestled with a list of questions that have yet to be answered.For example, while the vaccine is more than 90% effective in blocking the symptoms of Covid-19, the FDA’s advisers stressed it is not yet clear whether it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for up to half of all cases.“Even though the individual efficacy of this vaccine is very, very, very high, you really as of right now do not have any evidence” that it will lower transmission, said Dr. Patrick Moore of the University of Pittsburgh. He urged Pfizer to take additional steps to answer that question.Several of the dissenting panel members objected to authorizing the shot for 16- and 17-year-olds, given their small numbers in the study and the low risk they face from Covid-19.Members worried, too, that Pfizer will lose its opportunity to answer critical questions once it begins offering the real vaccine to study participants who had been getting dummy shots up to now.The company proposed gradually moving those patients to the vaccine group, with priority based on age, health conditions and other factors. Under that plan, 70-year-old participants would cross over before healthy 30-year-olds.Pfizer must still show whether the vaccine works in children younger than 16 and in pregnant women.On the safety front, as widespread vaccinations begin, the first recipients will be closely tracked by government health authorities since studies in tens of thousands of people can’t detect rare risks that strike 1 in a million. Hanging over the meeting were the British allergic reactions and a warning from authorities there that people with a history of serious reactions shouldn’t get the vaccine for now.Pfizer representatives said they have seen no signs of allergic reactions in their trial. But some of the FDA advisers fear the British warning will deter millions of Americans with allergies who might benefit from the Covid-19 vaccine from giving it a try, and urged additional studies to try to settle the issue.“This issue is not going to die until we have better data,” Offit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-panel-endorses-widespread-use-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine/story-qgNvZPL58CdqCkfI9PIq1J.html

The state motor vehicles department said the man’s driving licence will be cancelled and his vehicle will be impounded.According to the police, the incident was first noticed by a student who was riding a two-wheeler and tried to stop the car. The student shot a video and alerted an animal care home nearby and others. The incident took place on the Paravoor-Nedumbassery road near Athani, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-in-kochi-arrested-for-tying-dog-to-car-dragging-it-around/story-zilH3h9QyNlYy0j2239A3J.html
11-12-2020||India||India produced 60mn PPEs, 150mn N-95 masks till Oct from zero in March: Smriti Irani||Union textiles minister Smriti Irani on Friday said India produced over 60 million personal protection equipment (PPEs) and around 150 million N-95 masks till October, from zero in March. The country has so far exported over 20 million PPE and over 40 million N-95 masks, she said while speaking at the virtual launch of a study by the Institute for Competitiveness. The study chronicles India’s success in going from being import-dependent for high-quality PPE kits to becoming self-sufficient. She said Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed the industry and government officials who were “adamant” on not diluting international technical standards despite “huge pressure” on the government. “The direction that we took was that if we are to dilute international standards, we expose health workers to tragedies,” Irani said. She also said that in the state of lockdown, 5 lakh sustainable direct jobs have been ensured as part of the PPE and testing swab revolution. According to the study, in 60 days, India developed an indigenous network of PPE fabric and garment manufacturers and by July, it was able to export PPE kits to other countries. It said the government’s ‘Go Local’ initiative turned the crisis of acute shortage into an opportunity to develop an indigenous supply chain for manufacturing Class-3 PPEs and testing swabs. The capacity building stage was dividing into five sets of activities, with each set assigned to a group of officers from the textiles ministry, according to the study. The Institute for Competitiveness is part of the Microeconomics of Competitiveness, affiliate network of Harvard Business School. On January 30 this year, when the first coronavirus case was reported in India, PPE kits including full body coveralls suits for Covid-19 (classified as Class-3 protection level under ISO 16603 Standard) were not manufactured in India. While countries began to limit their export of PPE kits, India was estimated to require more than 20 million PPE kits and 40 million N-95 class masks by July 2020. “Beating all odds, India developed an indigenous network of PPE fabric and garment manufacturers in just 60 days. By mid-May, India had the capacity to manufacture 4.5 lakhs pieces of body coveralls and 2.5 lakhs N-95 masks per day,” it said. So, India also began exporting PPEs to the US, the UK, Senegal, Slovenia, and UAE, it added. The study said the scale of masks manufacturing has increased at such an exponential rate that by October, 60 million PPEs were produced, of which, 20 million were exported. Over 150 million N-95 masks were also produced, of which 40 million were exported. Currently, 200 domestic manufacturers produce 32 lakh N-95 masks per day, making India the largest exporter of masks to the world, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-produces-60-million-ppes-150-million-n-95-masks-till-october-from-zero-in-march-irani/story-dv9NrJZDfwMW0KsX6uxweP.html
11-12-2020||India||India’s first mRNA vaccine candidate gets nod for human clinical trials||India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine candidate, the mRNA one being developed by Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, has received approval from drug regulators to initiate combined Phase 1/2 trials human clinical trial, the government said on Friday. The nod was given on the basis of data from animal studies but the company will have to submit interim results from the first part of the trial before starting the next.The novel mRNA vaccine candidate, HGCO19, has been developed by Gennova and supported with a seed grant under the Ind-CEPI mission of the department of biotechnology of the Union ministry of science and technology. Gennova has worked in collaboration with US’ HDT Biotech Corporation to develop the mRNA vaccine candidate. HGCO19, which is stable at 2-8 degrees Celcius for two months, has already demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, neutralisation antibody activity in animals. Also read | Moderna vaccine confers at least 3 months immunity, study claimsA release from the ministry of science and technology said the mRNA vaccines do not use the conventional model to produce an immune response. “Instead, mRNA vaccine carries the molecular instructions to make the protein in the body through a synthetic RNA of the virus. The host body uses this to produce the viral protein that is recognized and thereby making the body mount an immune response against the disease. The mRNA-based vaccines are scientifically the ideal choice to address a pandemic because of their rapid developmental timeline,” the release said.It also said the mRNA vaccine is considered safe as is non-infectious, non-integrating in nature, and degraded by standard cellular mechanisms. They are expected to be highly efficacious because of their inherent capability of being translatable into the protein structure inside the cell cytoplasm. mRNA vaccines are fully synthetic and do not require a host for growth, for example, eggs or bacteria. They can, therefore, be quickly manufactured in an inexpensive manner under cGMP conditions to ensure their “availability” and “accessibility” for mass vaccination on a sustainable basis.Also read | Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?“The neutralizing antibody response of the vaccine in mice and non-human primates was comparable with the sera from the convalescent patients of COVID-19. Gennova’s vaccine candidate uses the most prominent mutant of spike protein (D614G) and also uses the self-amplifying mRNA platform, which gives the advantage of a low dosing regimen compared with the non-replicating mRNA or traditional vaccines,” the release added. “HGCO19 uses the adsorption chemistry so that the mRNA is attached on the surface of the nano-lipid carrier to enhance the release kinetics of the mRNA within the cells compared to the encapsulation chemistry.”Also read | What to expect when the vaccine rolls outGennova has completed all preliminary work and should be initiating the Phase 1/2 human clinical trial soon since the approval from the DCGI office has been received. The vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are said to have over 90% efficacy, use the mRNA model.Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in India. Serum Institute of India is conducting Phase 3 trial of the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Oxford University-Astrazeneca. The indigenously-developed vaccine by Bharat Biotech International Limited in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started the Phase 3 clinical trial.Another indigenously-developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has also completed Phase 2 clinical trials in the country. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) have also announced the start of adaptive Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India. Biological E Ltd has also started early Phase 1 and Phase 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

11-12-2020||India||On Saturday, Goa to vote in elections that will test CM Sawant’s popularity||Goa will belatedly go to the polls to elect a total of 50 candidates for the zilla (district) parishad constituencies in what is proving to be a challenge for political parties to inspire voters to come out and vote during the pandemic.The ruling BJP, the opposition Congress, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party as well as the Aam Aadmi Party have fielded candidates in the polls that have suffered from a huge gap between the campaigning and the actual polling. Nonetheless, the election will be closely watched by political observers to gauge the mood of the state ahead of the state assembly elections in early 2022. The Goa Forward Party has not fielded any candidates in the polls.More than a poll to elect the district panchayats, the polls are seen as a massive test of Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ongoing protests against coal, the failure to restart mining, among other related issues.The polls were set to be held on March 22 with all preparations in place and campaigning having concluded until the Prime Minister announced the day-long ‘Janta curfew’ which forced the Goa government to postpone polls. Initially, the polls were stalled for two days before getting postponed indefinitely.Also read: Situation at border over last 6 months result of China’s actions - IndiaThe nine-month gap has left political parties and their candidates worried that people will not even remember who they were with campaigning having concluded back in March.While the BJP has fielded 43 candidates in the 48 seats which go to poll on Saturday, the Congress has fielded 38, while the Aam Aadmi Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party have fielded 17 candidates each. There are 79 independent candidates in the fray.The BJP and the Congress have expressed confidence that the voters will vote for their respective parties“We are confident of winning these elections. There is tangible support for the BJP because of the development projects undertaken by our government,” state Bharatiya Janata Party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said.The opposition Congress, on the other hand, said that the people were fed up of the incompetence of the ruling BJP and would use the elections to teach the ruling dispensation a lesson.“Goa is going through a troublesome stage and our economic condition is poor. You can see the number of protests in Goa against the decisions of the government. This will reflect in the election results,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said.Goa has 50 seats up for the polls but one candidate was declared elected unopposed while another polling was countermanded after one of the contesting candidates passed away before the elections could be held.State Election Commissioner Choka Ram Garg has said that the authority has left no stone unturned to ensure a smooth and peaceful conduct of elections including facilities for Covid-19 patients or people under home quarantine to vote.Political analysts have however said that the elections are nothing more than a weather vane for the ruling dispensation ahead of the state assembly elections next year.“For the ruling party, it will send important signals whether the ongoing protests against coal, the protests against the projects in the Mollem sanctuaries and protests for the restarting of mining have really changed the mood of the state or have not had any bearing,” Kishor Naik Gaonkar, editor of a local Marathi daily Goan Varta, said.“The elections have no significance beyond giving political parties important signals for the elections to be held in a year’s time,” he added.The BJP has been trying to prove its mettle on resuming mining as well as making commitments towards reducing the coal handling at the Mormugao Port in a bid to ensure that the protests do not make too much of a dent on the public psyche.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-saturday-goa-to-vote-in-elections-that-will-test-cm-sawant-s-popularity/story-DGt6O3sQrpz1MwkOgvLBoL.html

According to I-T officials, the Chidambarams received the property sale amount through a cash transaction but failed to disclose it in their income tax returns in the assessment year 2014-2015. The court further added that “there must be findings that the statement given by the assessee during the assessment proceeding is false” and it has to be recorded by the concerned officer in the reassessment proceedings. “Without findings recorded, this court is of the view that the prosecution cannot be launched by merely on the basis of some statements said to have been recorded from third parties,” the judge said. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal among a host of other lawyers appeared for Srinidhi and Karti, the son of former union finance minister P Chidambaram.However, the court ruled that reassessment proceedings could be initiated if the concerned authority such as the assessing officer “comes to the conclusion in a proceeding under Section 153 of the Income Tax Act, it is open to the department to initiate penal action as per law”. Earlier, the case was transferred to a special court for offences by MPs and MLAs from the economic offences court. The special court had rejected discharge applications and Karti and Srinidhi Chidambaram challenged it at the high court for its review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-case-against-karti-chidambaram-wife-premature-rules-court/story-nOele1ZgUN7BEMYZxz6g5M.html

Besides one walk-in freezer at Ferozepur, the Government of India has decided to provide one more at Chandigarh. In addition, the state will have one walk-in cooler each at Amritsar, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur, with more to be received from the Centre. In addition, the state has 1165 Ice Lined Refrigerators and 1079 Deep Freezers.In line with the central government’s guidelines, data of about 1.25 lakh Health Care workers (Government and Private) has been compiled by the state government for the first phase vaccination.Other steps being taken as part of the vaccine roll-out preparedness in the state include mapping of vaccinators, digital platform training in districts, trained manpower for vaccine inventory management and coordination at various levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-gears-up-with-cold-chain-points-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-xjuvbaEeOvSpdmw8XdVdyO.html
11-12-2020||India||‘One in every three Indian planning to travel during Christmas, New Year season’: Survey||One in every three Indian is planning to travel and holiday during the upcoming Christmas and New Year season, revealed a survey conducted by a leading online travel organisation. Among the surveyed, more than 70 per cent are hoping to relax and celebrate this winter holiday season with their family, spouse or partner while the rest are looking to end the year travelling with friends and long-not-met colleagues. The findings showed that 60 per cent respondents who are willing to travel during the winter holiday season are planning to spend the year in the hills or on the beaches. According to the survey, only 20 per cent respondents are looking to wrap the year at bars or parties.The survey was conducted among more than 2,000 respondents between November 15 and December 5.The survey revealed that 70 per cent respondents want to spend time outdoors doing adventure activities like rafting, hiking, water sport or sightseeing. As travellers are equally wanting to be safe during their trips, the respondents were seen giving the highest preference to sanitization, hygiene and safety certification while choosing their stay option.Also read: Situation at border over last 6 months result of China’s actions - IndiaCommenting on the travel trends, Rajesh Magow, co-founder and group CEO, MakeMyTrip Limited, goibibo, said, “Over the past few months, we have worked closely and creatively with the entire travel and hospitality value chain to raise safety standards and help customers make the journey from being homebound to being travellers again. Bookings for the winter festive holiday season on goibibo indicate an increase in travel to domestic leisure destinations including Goa, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar, Pondicherry, Coorg, Shimla, Manali and Darjeeling. As we step into 2021, we are confident of a continued upward travel trend that will find more force as the mass vaccine rollout plan materializes.”The survey also suggested that the winter holiday season will witness nearly 60 per cent leisure travellers booking a trip for two or more days and long-distance leisure travel will make a strong comeback.“Fifty per cent travellers across all demographics and cohorts are willing to opt for air travel for the upcoming winter holiday season signalling a strong boost in passenger confidence and trust in hopping on to a flight for a holiday post-pandemic. With flight holidays in equal consideration as drive-through holidays, the preference to air travel can also be attributed to the mini-road trips undertaken by people since Unlock was announced in July,” said the goibibo spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-every-three-indian-planning-to-travel-during-christmas-new-year-season-survey/story-HIfHg7wxrdPLZ6ScSMIMLP.html

However, minor changes have been suggested, which we will incorporate,” said the officer. The tableau will also showcase Ayodhya as a major religious tourism destination in India. The tableau will feature a grand model of the temple, scenes from Ramayan and the new tradition of annual Deepotsav in Ayodhya, the officer added. The information department prepares Republic Day tableaux and the exact title of the 2021’s theme is ‘Uttar Pradesh ki sanskritik dharohar: Ayodhya (Ayodhya: Cultural heritage of Uttar Pradesh)’. “How Lord Ram had embraced Nishadraj, how he ate bers (Indian jujube) that Shabri bit before offering them to him, and how all this presents a culture of non-discrimination among castes and sets an example against untouchability, women emancipation and empowerment. All this will be depicted on the tableau,” he said. It will also display the anvarat (continuous) Ramleela, according to details in the presentation document of the state. The officer said the tableau will showcase Ayodhya’s religious harmony. It will display how five Jain Tirthankars were born in the city, how it is connected to Lord Buddha, who had spent six monsoons there and also how Guru Nanak and nine other Sikh gurus visited Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-upcoming-ram-temple-in-uttar-pradesh-s-tableau-for-republic-day/story-7yFWUpSIKwTh7I2yzEUoQM.html

Pushing back against China’s assertion on Thursday that responsibility for the nearly eight-month border standoff lay “totally” with the Indian side, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the actions of Chinese troops had consistently violated bilateral agreements on maintaining peace and tranquillity on the LAC. The two sides haven’t made headway on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the LAC despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, including eight rounds between senior army commanders, and tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the winter in Ladakh sector. On Wednesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said China has offered “five differing explanations” for deploying thousands of soldiers on the LAC and pushing bilateral ties into their most difficult phase ever. A day later, China’s foreign ministry said responsibility for the situation “totally lies with the Indian side”. Asked about China’s accusation at the weekly news briefing, Srivastava replied: “The situation that we have seen since the last six months has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in status along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. These actions are in violation of bilateral agreements and protocols on ensuring peace and tranquillity along the LAC.” Pointing to the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement that it observes “strictly the agreements between the two sides and is committed to resolving the border issue through dialogue and safeguarding peace and tranquillity”, Srivastava added: “We expect that the Chinese side will match its words with actions.” The “core issues”, Srivastava said, include both sides strictly following bilateral agreements on the border issue “in their entirety, including the 1993 and 1996 agreements on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the LAC”. These agreements require that both sides shouldn’t amass troops on the LAC, should strictly abide by and respect the LAC, and not take any unilateral action to alter the LAC. India and China have maintained communications through diplomatic and military channels, and New Delhi expects “further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible”, Srivastava said. Asked about China’s contention that the joint launch of a stamp marking the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties was cancelled because of lack of feedback from India, Srivastava said the launch of overall celebrations hadn’t been held and there was no question of going ahead with other activities. The joint release of commemorative stamps was one of the activities agreed on with the Chinese side last year to mark the anniversary of diplomatic ties, but there had been no discussion on any launch date with Chinese authorities, he said. The Chinese embassy spokesperson’s tweet suggesting the event was cancelled on account of lack of feedback from the Indian side “is factually incorrect”, Srivastava said. “It may be noted that the launch of the 70th anniversary celebrations itself has not taken place yet, and therefore, the issue of going ahead with joint activities under its ambit does not arise,” he added. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the accusations between India and China regarding the situation on the LAC reflected the lack of progress in talks to push forward disengagement and de-escalation. “The foremost objective for the Indian side now is that the situation on the ground shouldn’t deteriorate. We don’t expect a serious clash because of the harsh weather during winter and the hope is that the two sides can work towards a resolution after the passing of winter,” he said. “The situation is complicated and both sides aren’t budging. With no possibility of a resolution any time soon, probably only the top leadership of the two sides can break the ice and take things forward,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-at-border-over-last-6-months-result-of-china-s-actions-india/story-PoNtzRXy9p0qLlNc3p3O3J.html
11-12-2020||India||Why doctors are holding nationwide strike?||Around a million doctors in the country went on a day-long strike on Friday against the Union home ministry’s decision to allow post-graduate practitioners of Ayurveda to perform surgical procedures. However, the protest did not have much impact on the functioning of hospitals as emergency services were exempted.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), an umbrella organisation for all conventional doctors and surgeons, criticising the legislation said it is a “mixopathy” and said that it “trivialises the medical profession,” as it gave a call for a nationwide strike.“The government’s decision to bring in a rule that allows practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda to be trained to perform surgical procedures trivialises the medical profession,” Reuters quoted Rajan Sharma, the head of IMA, as saying.Last month, the Centre introduced a rule that allowed post-graduate practitioners of Ayurveda, an ancient science of medicine in India, to perform certain surgeries. As per the notification, the post-graduates of Ayurveda can perform 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat.What is the notification?In November this year, the Central Council of Indian Medicine, the regulatory body for the study and practice of Ayurveda in India, amended the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016, as it allowed Ayurveda doctors to be trained and legally perform minor surgical procedures including ENT, ophthalmology, orthopaedic and dental procedures.What IMA says?The practitioners of modern medicine have criticised the government’s notification as they see it as “another step to advancing and legitimising mixopathy.” Demanding withdrawal of CCIM order, IMA says that it does not allow its own members to teach disciplines of modern medicine to students of other systems. “Let every system grow on its own strength and purity,” the doctors’ body said in a statement earlier.In a statement last month, IMA said, “The purity and identity of Ayurveda stand equally challenged. That the council prescribed modern medicine textbooks and Ayurveda institutions practised surgery with the assistance of modern medical doctors cannot be reason enough to legitimise encroachment into the jurisdiction and competencies of modern medicine.”What do Ayurveda practitioners say?The traditional medicine practitioners have described the criticism as “misconception” and say that there is no risk of “crosspathy”. “It is a misconception that Ayurvedic doctors cannot perform surgeries. Apart from performing caesarean sections and hernia surgeries, Ayurveda surgeons have pioneered certain procedures for piles and fissure where modern medicine isn’t of much help,” Dr VN Mishra, medical superintendent at BHU’s Sir Sunderlal Hospital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-doctors-are-holding-nationwide-strike/story-tdiixriDAakL1X9454vWnN.html
11-12-2020||India||Doctors on strike in Bihar over Centre’s Ayurveda surgery move, services hit||The outpatient department (OPD) services in both government and private hospitals in Bihar on Friday were badly hit following a strike called by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to protest against the decision of the Centre to allow Ayurvedic medical practitioners to perform surgery. Reports from the districts said though the patients arrived at the hospitals, but the doctors did not attend to them. At Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) the registration of patients began in the morning, however, the striking doctors forced closure of the registration counter and patients were left high and dry. At IGIMS also the OPD service was closed after 12 noon. State IMA secretary Dr Sunil Kumar claimed the health services, including planned surgeries, were badly affected following the strike called by the IMA. “The next course of action will be decided after a meeting of national level office-bearers in New Delhi on Friday. Our action will depend on the assurance given by the government. The government by taking a unilateral decision to allow Ayurvedic doctors to perform surgery is playing with the health of common people, as they were not properly trained for the job,” he said. Dr Kumar said in the state capital no OPD service besides planned surgeries were performed in the hospitals, including NMCH, PMCH, IGIMS and AIIMS-Patna. “However, the emergency and Covid-19 services remained unaffected in the state,” he said. He requested the doctors to not cooperate in the bridge course being run by the government to train doctors of other streams. Bhojpur district IMA secretary Dr Madhukar Prakash said, “The patients who were in serious condition were attended by the doctors both in government and private hospitals. However, the OPD service at Ara sadar hospital was totally closed.” At Bettiah, headquarters of West Champaran district, the health services were paralysed as the doctors were not present in the OPD of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). However, emergency services remained unaffected. The health services in primary health centres and other health institutions were also badly hit. Dr Gulzar Ahmed, child specialist, called the Centre’s step as “retrograde”. “We respect the individuality of Ayurveda and Unani medicine. The government’s move to integrate all systems of medicines will only lead to mixopathy,” he said. Another doctor of Bettiah Dr Amitabh Choudhary, said integration of all systems of medicine was “unpractical, unviable and unfeasible”. At Darbhanga, IMA office-bearers claimed that all private and government health facilities, excluding Covid-19 treatment and emergency services, were shut from dawn to dusk in protest against the Centre’s move. The OPD service at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital was completely paralysed even as patients from far-flung areas found themselves at the receiving end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-on-strike-in-bihar-over-centre-s-ayurveda-surgery-move-services-hit/story-9hCdsWe7JwG1Qk8FI2fPYL.html

I will resign from my post the day I am unable to fulfil the promise,” said Chautala while addressing the media.He expressed hope that the deadlock between the farmers and the Central government will end soon and said he is constantly in touch with the Union Ministers regarding the issue.“Chaudhary Devi Lal used to say the government only listens to farmers till the time when farmers have a partnership in the government. Today, I and my party are constantly putting the farmers’ views in front of the Centre. I am in touch with Union Minister though telephone and putting my views about the possible solutions of farmers’ problem,” the Deputy Chief Minister stated.He further said the Haryana government has procured a record high amount of millet and other crops except rice this year on MSP and assured that in coming years also the state government will procure all grains and seed on MSP from farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-resign-if-unable-to-ensure-msp-for-farmers-says-dushyant-chautala/story-VfvddPgGtr09wWJ9A3wuSP.html
11-12-2020||India||Amit Shah skeds Bengal visit next week to amp up offensive over Nadda attack||Concerned about the law and order situation in the state following Thursday’s stone attack on BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy at Diamond Harbour, home minister Amit Shah is set to visit the state for a two-day visit from December 19, said BJP leaders aware of developments. Shah had visited Bengal last month - on November 4 - to formulate campaign strategy for the assembly polls due early next year. He also took part in outreach programmes. The party earlier said he and Nadda would take turns in visiting the state every month. It was Nadda’s turn to visit Bengal in December. Cars of several party leaders, including that of BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh which were part of the convoy, were also damaged in the attack. “Nadda was saved because he was in a bullet-proof car provided by the local police. But the car took some hits,” said Roy. The home minister condemned the incident on Thursday and telephoned Nadda and Roy, said state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. “Shah will be in Bengal on December 19 and 20. The schedule was finalised quickly,” said Basu. “The attack on BJP president JP Nadda is condemnable. No matter how much we condemn, it will not be enough. The Centre is taking this very seriously. The West Bengal government will be answerable to the peace-loving people of the state for this,” Shah tweeted in Hindi on Thursday. The cavalcade was attacked at Serakhol in Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew.The Union home ministry on Thursday asked state governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to submit a report on law and order situation in the state and steps taken by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government to maintain peace. “The law and order situation in the state has been continually worsening for long in spite of my caution to the chief minister, the police and the administration on numerous occasions. I find the situation alarming and I have sent a report to the central government on these extremely disturbing developments. I do not wish to share the content of my report,” Dhankhar told the media on Friday afternoon. Mukul Roy, with whom Shah had a conversation early this morning, said, “I witnessed the attack. I strongly feel that the current situation calls for imposition of President’s rule under Article 356 of the Constitution.” The Union home ministry also asked chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and director general of police Virendra to appear before it in Delhi on December 14. On Friday evening, Bandopadhyay wrote to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla and sought relief from personal appearance. He wrote that action is being taken by the state police and security cover was provided to Nadda. The letter, which has been seen by HT, said three cases have been registered, of which two pertain to vandalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-visit-bengal-next-week-bjp-says-it-s-about-law-and-order/story-958oKWBD7dq49vmQBM8ttM.html

Patel talked about the worsening mental health in society, especially exacerbated by the pandemic.

Dr Patel said there is the need to normalize conversations around mental health. “There is never been a better time to seek help (for mental health),” he told HT’s health editor Sanchita Sharma. He said if someone senses something unusual happening regarding mental health, the best thing would be to talk to someone. Patel added that in India, he recently noticed a huge change when it comes to reporting mental health issues in media. “With carefully designed training programs, frontline workers can deliver very effective psychological and social interventions,” Patel said. “Health is not just a biomedical issue, not just a technical issue but it is a citizen’s movement to demand and expect quality care,” he stated.  The Harvard professor said people should learn ways to mitigate stress. “Stress is not bad but what is bad is when it becomes toxic,” Patel said. Patel co-leads the GlobalMentalHealth@Harvard initiative. His work focuses on the burden of mental health problems, their association with social disadvantage, and the use of community resources for their prevention and treatment.

Most of them are from the private sector,” IMA state unit vice-president Sanjay Londhe said. “We are not against Ayurveda, but giving permission to them to perform general surgeries would lead to wrong practices which will directly affect common patients,” he said.Dentists and junior doctors also supported the IMA call, but doctors providing emergency services did not take part in the strike in view of the coronavirus situation, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-in-mp-protest-in-solidarity-with-the-ima/story-ra31BldA3auyffq2eTUCdL.html

The film has been shot in and around Lucknow and that makes it dearer to me. Whatever I’m today is because of Lucknow, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj,” said the ‘Kumkum: Ek Pyara Sa Bandhan’ actor.Not seeing much of success in his first stint as an actor in Mumbai, he went back to Delhi and started a business. Telling more about his journey, Anand said, “Success is all about destiny and hard work. If either of the two is a miss one cannot be successful in any profession! After much struggle, I decided to quit and got into business but my love for acting brought me back to Mumbai. I started working on certain ideas and wrote a couple of scripts out of which one was liked and locked by ‘Khaali Peeli’ filmmaker Himanshu Mehra. But, due to lockdown, the shoot has been pushed for next year.” It was during the pandemic phase he took a masterclass in film making. “So, to try my newly learnt skills and work on my new script, I decided to make my own film. I discussed it with one of my friends and this way Smita Singh joined me as a director.” Talking about the new project, he said, “Titled ‘Andaman’ the story of is based on a quarantine centre and I am sharing screen space with none other than Sanjay Mishra.

11-12-2020||India||‘My work has heart of Uttar Pradesh’||Scriptwriter and lyricist AM Turaz, who penned songs like ‘Binte Dil…’, ‘Guzarish…’ and ‘Ghoomar’, says all his work has ‘khushboo’ of Uttar Pradesh, his home state. “I find excuses to come back to UP as I want, ‘meri mitti ki khushboo barkarar aur taazi rahe. Wahi mera khajana hai aur sarmaya (wealth) hai. Usi ko mila kar main sab parosta hu’ — be it in my songs, scripts and dialogues. That is my identity,” said the award-winning lyricist during his recent visit to Lucknow. Giving an account of his connection Turaz tells, “I come from Sambalkheda village in Janset tehsil in Muzaffarnagar. I studied there and then completed my intermediate from Meerut but couldn’t complete my graduation. I was fond of poetry and while listening to it I started writing.” Talking about his earlier days, he shared, “A lot was happening in the society and on the personal front I had no medium to express my views. Then I started writing ‘shayari’ and discovered that this was the best language to convey my thoughts, while, the ‘unwaan’ (medium) I chose was ‘mohabbat ki zubaan’ (language of love).” In 2003 Turaz came to Mumbai. “To survive I started writing TV shows and even did ghostwriting. It was in 2005, I wrote songs for ‘Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana’ starring Rekha and then films started. I was set to write for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Saawaria’ but it didn’t happen due to some reasons. Eventually, I went on to write lyrics for ‘Guzaarish’ which gave me big success and many awards, since, then have done all SLB films except ‘Ram Leela’.” In 2013, Turaz started taking part in ‘mushairas’ and got to travel across the world with his work. “I’m glad that my writing is reaching to right people. I have done 42 films including ‘Padmaavat’, ‘Bajirao Mastani’, ‘Guzaarish’, Wazir and ‘Badla’. This year I penned Zubin Nautiyal’s single ‘Dil chahte ho’ and two songs with Amit Trivedi.” He has also written script of ‘Baraat Company’ and ‘Direct Ishq’ both shot in UP and is currently writing OTT-series ‘Mughals’. “I’m writing my own script which I plan to direct and that again is set in UP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/my-work-has-heart-of-uttar-pradesh/story-jE4kKDjt2DpWVyq7x6k6SN.html

TMC lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee pointed out that the state government is accountable to answer to the assembly. “No other person can call for any explanation in respect of law-and-order situation, especially the central government,” news agency ANI quoted Banerjee as saying.Also Read | Are home minister, PM of India outsiders?: Minister hits out at Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee “This is a violation of the Constitution. This is a colourable exercise of power,” he also said while accusing the BJP of violating the Constitution, ANI reported. “Behind the entire thing, there is malice on the part of the central government and there is malafide attitude on the part of central government officials by sending a letter. This is deplorable. No one can violate the Constitution,” Kalyan said.On Thursday, Nadda’s convoy was attacked when it was on its way to Diamond Harbour area in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district from Kolkata. The BJP has alleged that the attackers were workers of the TMC. Television news footage showed stones raining on the convoy and shattering windshields. Vehicles of some media houses were also damaged. Several BJP leaders, including general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, were injured in the attack, a PTI report said.Following the attack, the Union home ministry summoned West Bengal’s chief secretary and police chief on December 14 for an explanation on the law-and-order situation in the state. The Centre has also sought a report from the state government over the alleged security lapses during Nadda’s visit.The attack also drew quick condemnation from the BJP’s leaders. Hitting out at the state chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Nadda said that “anarchy is at its peak in West Bengal” and people of the state will respond to the lawlessness in the upcoming elections. “The central government is taking this attack very seriously. The Bengal government will have to answer to the peace-loving people of the state for this sponsored violence,” Union home minister Amit Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-convoy-attack-tmc-slams-centre-over-summon-to-west-bengal-chief-secretary-police-chief/story-70KQIhqWbpbMpHeiLE7CmN.html
11-12-2020||India||Non-emergency services suspended to protest move allowing Ayurveda doctors to perform surgeries||Non-emergency services in most hospitals did not function on Friday as the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had given a call for a day-long strike to protest against the Centre’s decision to allow post-graduates from Ayurveda to perform general surgeries in select streams, leading to patients being turned away from hospitals in several parts of the country, according to doctor associations and hospital authorities. On November 20, the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), a statutory body under the AYUSH ministry, issued a notification to regulate Indian systems of medicines and listed 39 general and 19 other surgery procedures involving eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016.Also read: Farmers insist on guaranteed MSP for 26 crops, call for intensifying stirThe Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest body of modern medicine doctors, condemned the move, describing it as poaching the disciplines of modern medicine through backdoor means and a retrograde step of mixing the system. Several other bodies supported the IMA and demanded to withdraw the order asking the CCIM to develop their own surgical disciplines from their ancient texts and not claim the surgical disciplines of modern medicine as their own.In a clarification, AYUSH Ministry Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said it does not amount to any policy deviation or any new decision. “This notification is more of the nature of a clarification. It streamlines the existing regulation relating to postgraduate education in Ayurveda with respect to the specified procedures,” he had said in a clarification issued by Press Information Bureau on November 22. The government has maintained that these surgeries were allowed earlier also but now the council has clarified them through a notification.The IMA on Wednesday gave a call for a strike to protest against the government mixing the two systems of medicine and “unscientific” ways of treating people through backdoor. The IMA had said that only Covid or other essential medical interventions such as casualty, labour rooms and emergency surgeries, will be attended by the doctors. Other services were suspended for 12 hours.Impact of the strike could be seen in several states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the non-emergency services remained suspended since Friday morning. The doctors also held protests at several places against the decision.IMA Punjab general secretary Dr Paramjit Singh Mann described the notification as “a step to legitimise mixopathy”. He said allopathic doctors are fighting to “save the honour of the noble profession”.“We have nearly 9,000 doctors as IMA members who have announced to suspend work in protest. Ayurvedic practitioners are not educated to perform modern medicine then how can they be allowed to work in that way. We want the Union government to withdraw the amendment,” said Dr Mann.Dr Satyajit Borah, president of Assam unit of IMA, said, “Doctors across government and private hospitals have supported our call. Ayurvedic doctors performing surgeries could lead to serious complications in patients. We hope the public becomes aware of this and the government doesn’t implement the move.” IMA secretary for Rajasthan, Dr Kewal Krishna Dung, said the government should not allow Ayurveda doctors to conduct surgeries without knowledge of the allopathic protocol for conducting surgeries.Also read: New laws will make us vulnerable to corporate greed - Farmers’ union moves SCIn Kerala, where no out-patient services were provided, patients could be seen engaged in wordy duels with medical workers. Many were caught unaware of the strike. “We are doing it for the larger interest of patients and the profession. We have no intention to trouble patients. But if we keep quiet, they will be in trouble tomorrow,” said Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter secretary Dr O Gopakumar.At several places, the Ayurveda doctors performed surgeries for 12 hours instead of normal eight to support the government decision. Dr Nityanand, Rajasthan secretary of Vishwa Ayurved Parishad, said that nearly 6,000 Ayurved doctors worked overtime today to support government decision of allowing Ayurveda doctors for surgeries in the state. “Allopathy arrived in India in last 50 years but Ayurveda has ancient roots in which surgery existed from time immemorial. Ayurveda doctors welcome government decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-emergency-services-suspended-to-protest-move-allowing-ayurveda-doctors-to-perform-surgeries/story-UdfgwO5RU51ELgz0Rr8djN.html
11-12-2020||India||Condemn it, but it’s been going on in Uttar Pradesh: Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on attack on Nadda’s convoy||Senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday condemned the attack on the convoy of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda in West Bengal and took a subtle dig at the law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country.“It is a declaration of the broken-down situation of law and order in West Bengal. We condemn it. But it is going on in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India as well,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On the matter of President’s rule in West Bengal, the Congress leader said it was up to the government to decide. “I think that declaring President’s rule in West Bengal is a matter which is to be decided by Government of India,” he said.Several vehicles in the BJP chief’s convoy were damaged as Nadda was travelling to Diamond Harbour to address a public meeting and some of the party’s leaders and workers were injured by stone-throwing protesters carrying the ruling Trinamool Congress’ (TMC’s) flags at Sirakol.Earlier on Friday, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) sent a summons to West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and director general of police (DGP) Virendra to appear on December 14. The home ministry is likely to seek an explanation from the two regarding the law-and-order situation in the state and the preventions taken so far against political violence and other crimes, according to a report in PTI.The ruling TMC expressed strong disapproval against the summons, accusing the BJP of trying to create tension in West Bengal so the Centre can interfere in the matters related to the state. “What is the central government is doing by sending a letter (seeking report) from the state government is unconstitutional. The MHA summoning the chief secretary and DGP is unacceptable. The BJP and the central government are trying to create a situation where they can interfere with the federal structure,” TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee said at a press conference.On the other hand, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has sent a report to the Centre, stating that the state is covered in a dangerous game of insider and outsider. “Finding the situation alarming, as my constitutional duty, I have sent a report to the central government about the extremely disturbing developments that do not augur well for democratic values, that are antithetical to rule of law, that sound death knell of constitutional parameters,” he told a press conference at the Raj Bhawan. He also cautioned chief minister Mamata Banerjee not to “play with fire”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/condemn-it-but-it-s-been-going-on-in-uttar-pradesh-congress-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-on-attack-on-nadda-s-convoy/story-chL4393nx9QsZzYy2QjH1L.html

In 2018, the two brothers were sentenced to 5 years imprisonment in two different cases for illegal possession and use of firearms.Commissioner of Police of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, Sudhansu Sarangi, said after arms peddler Prakash Behera was arrested on Thursday, the house of the gangster brothers was raided by a special team of Commissionerate Police.On Thursday, police in the Choudwar area of Cuttack had nabbed Behera and seized two firearms from his possession. During interrogation, Prakash revealed to have supplied firearms to one Saroj Sethi who then confessed to having smuggled a lot of arms to the gangster duo before their arrest in 2016.“As part of our campaign, we came to know about extortion activity following which a special team raided the residence of the two gangsters on Thursday. A thorough search of the house led to the discovery of 16 automatic arms including an assault rifle. The arms were kept in wooden frames and looked like wall paintings while bullets were hidden in cans. Searches in other parts of the house led to discovery of knives and swords that were kept in jars. There could be more arms and ammunition hidden inside the house,” said the police commissioner. Eight persons have been arrested in this connection.Sarangi said the arms were mostly procured from Munger in Bihar and kept hidden since 2016.He said the seizure of arms indicated that the Dhal Samanta brothers were in touch with their gang members even though they are behind bars since January 2016. “We would take the brothers on police remand to get more details about the gun running.Police got a clue of the extortion racket run by the two gangsters after Kuna Swain, an associate, was arrested in August, while allegedly involved in an extortion bid for Rs 5 lakh.Also Read: Odisha job scam gets bigger, investigators suspect 100 youths were cheated In January 2016, the gangster brothers were arrested from their house in the Bidanasi area of Cuttack following a directive from a court. The police had then seized around Rs 2.35 crore in cash, two Audi and three Mercedes cars apart from a huge cache of arms and ammunition stashed in hidden locations of the house.In a separate search of their house in Bhubaneswar, the cops had seized Rs 11 lakh in cash, three revolvers, 100 bullets, two double-barrel guns and 27 rounds of double-barrel gun bullets.In 2017, the Enforcement Directorate had attached immovable properties of the brothers worth Rs 16 crore. Before their arrest, the Dhal Samant brothers were on the run after being accused in several murder cases and used several pseudonyms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-arms-over-1000-bullets-seized-from-house-of-odisha-s-infamous-gangster-brothers/story-xTSN7unQ8lv0PPOSBLTWyO.html

He said the protest that is currently on at Delhi’s borders may spread to other parts of the country. “According to my information, a large number of farmers from different areas have joined the protest today with 700 tractors. Since the stand of the Central government is still unclear, the agitation is likely to get prolonged and become intense in the coming days. Further, it is also likely to spread in other parts as currently it is limited to the Delhi border. I request the Centre not to wait for the farmers to lose their patience and take a decision at the earliest,” the NCP chief said.Also read | Farmers insist on guaranteed MSP for 26 crops, call for intensifying stirPawar was talking to reporters at YB Chavan Centre, Nariman Point, in Mumbai.Holding the Centre responsible for the situation, he said, “The Opposition parties had told the government not to clear the bills in haste as farmers would act against the same. But the government chose to pass each of them within 15-20 minutes without holding proper discussion.” Pawar, along with other leaders from United Progressive Alliance (UPA) including Rahul Gandhi, had, on Wednesday, met President Ram Nath Kovind with a demand to repeal the farm laws to end the farmers’ protest.Earlier, he had also observed a one-day fast in solidarity with the eight Rajya Sabha members from the Opposition parties, who were fasting at the Parliament premises against their suspension from the Upper House in September. The Rajya Sabha MPs were opposing the farm bills.Maharashtra BJP unit said that with his stand towards the farmers’ protest, the NCP chief’s stood exposed as he was the one who had been advocating to bring these reforms as the Union agriculture minister. “His (Sharad Pawar) double face was exposed before the people when we shared the copy of his letters as Union agriculture minister to the chief ministers. The Centre has brought the same set of reforms Pawar was advocating since 2005. He is doing politics of protest. Farmers and the people know it very well,” said state BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.He also said that some of the reforms have been implemented in Maharashtra in the past few years and farmers have been reaping their benefits as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-agitation-likely-to-get-prolonged-and-intense-says-ncp-chief-pawar/story-Le9L1T0RCmnEPrDv27Ww9N.html

The night curfew was earlier imposed from December 1 to December 15.Chairing a high-level Covid review meeting, the CM also ordered an end to home quarantine for those above the age of 70 with co-morbidities, unless adequate medical facilities can be made available at home. Health secretary Hussan Lal pointed out during the virtual meeting that a large number of Covid-19 deaths were also being reported from home isolation cases.Captain Amarinder Singh also ordered a thorough inspection of all private hospitals to ensure that only those with adequate Level 3 infrastructure and manpower be allowed to admit coronavirus patients. Hospitals lacking such facilities should refer patients to other hospitals, he said.Though the declining positivity trend in Punjab over the past 3 weeks was welcome, the fatality rate remained a matter of concern, Amarinder pointed out, directing the DGP to ensure strict compliance to Covid safety protocols in the state, including wearing of masks and social distancing. He also asked the health department to maintain the 30000/day RT-PCR sampling/testing limit, with more smart and targeted sampling to include potential super spreaders. “Districts must be encouraged to make full use of the ITIHAAS portal to identify possible hotspots and concentrate their sampling there,” he said, stressing the need to step up testing in containment and micro-containment zones and ensure 100 per cent sampling. The chief minister also asked the health department to monitor the health of the farmers who are returning from Delhi in wake of the virus situation in national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-in-punjab-extended-till-january-1-cm-directs-police-to-ensure-strict-compliance/story-MlfxC6VpRTjjHXiwGIk4QL.html

Based on the socio-economic profiling of PM SVANidhi beneficiaries and their families, various other central schemes will be extended to them according to their eligibility. States and Union territories can also make use of the profiles to facilitate better access to their respective schemes.Quality Council of India (QCI) has been appointed as the implementing partner for the programme. Before the programme is rolled out in all 125 cities a test program will be conducted in six select cities of Gaya, Indore, Kakching, Nizamabad, Rajkot and Varanasi.“The launch has been in the context of the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister that PM SVANidhi scheme should not be seen merely from the perspective of extending loans to street vendors but should also be seen as an instrument for outreach to street vendors and their families for their holistic development and socio-economic upliftment,” the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs said in a press release.The PM SVANidhi scheme was promulgated on June 1, 2020, to empower street vendors who were reeling under losses incurred during the coronavirus pandemic. The ministry in a press release has said that the scheme seeks “to empower street vendors by not only extending loans to them but also for their holistic development and economic upliftment”. It intends to facilitate collateral-free working capital loans of up to Rs 10,000 for one year to approximately 50 lakh street vendors.The PM SVANidhi scheme offers loans at a subsidised rate of interest of 7%, which is applicable only when the borrower repays the loan either early or on a timely basis. The loans can be repaid as monthly instalments over a period of one year.Food delivery app Swiggy has partnered with the housing and urban affairs ministry to on-board street vendors in the cities of Ahmedabad, Varanasi, Chennai, Delhi and Indore with some 300 vendors. On Thursday, Swiggy extended the partnership to 125 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-svanidhi-scheme-gets-a-boost-govt-launches-socio-economic-profiling-program/story-XSa80phCpe1wWQe92nx02L.html

The material placed on record, at least, prima facie, indicates that illegal sand mining has returned with vengeance and the authorities, who, in the past had done commendable work in preventing it, appear to have let down the guard,” the high court noted.“We are constrained to issue notice to the respondents to show cause as to why action under the Contempt of Courts Act be not initiated against them. Though the personal presence of the authorities is dispensed with, for the present, the respondents file their responses on or before January 11, without seeking any extension of time. For any reason, if the responses cannot be filed by January 11 by any of the authorities, then they will personally remain present to submit their say in the matter,” the high court bench of Justice MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar said.In December last year the high court, in a detailed judgment, issued a series of directions to the Goa government to undertake regular patrolling through flying squads at all stretches of rivers.While sand mining stopped for a while, the activists have alleged that it has since resumed and the authorities have again begun to ignore the issue.Sand mining in Goa is banned by the National Green Tribunal which has directed that proper environmental licences be issued to the operators before the extraction can be renewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-sand-mining-back-with-vengeance-court-raps-goa-for-ignoring-orders/story-89DBhkGPAxQ4rQKzLPT6EO.html
11-12-2020||India||Rajasthan rural polls- BJP, Congress join hands to keep regional parties out||The ruling Congress and the party in opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Rajasthan joined hands to keep at bay the candidates of regional parties in election of heads of the rural local bodies-- Panchayat Samities and Zila Parishads.The Congress, which had the backing of two MLAs of Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) during the recent political crisis in the party and during the Rajya Sabha polls, on Thursday, went on to support a BJP member, who filed her nomination as an independent for the post of head of Dungarpur district council (Zila Parishad), to keep the BTP nominee out.Of the total 27 seats in Dungarpur Zila Parishad, 13 seats were won by the BTP supported independent candidates, while BJP and Congress got 8 and 6 seats respectively. Both the Congress and the BJP then decided to back Surya Ahari, who was elected as the Zila Pramukh on Thursday. Similarly, at Khinvsar Panchayat Samiti in Nagaur district, Congress and BJP came together to defeat Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), an ally of BJP, and got an independent elected as district council head. RLP had won 15 of the 31 seats, Congress 8, BJP 5 and independents 3. Independent candidate Seema Choudhary won as she got 16 votes. Miffed with the ‘betrayal’ in elections, BTP president Chhotubhai Vasava announced that the party will withdraw its support to the Congress. “BJP-Congress is one – BTP will withdraw its support,” he tweeted. In another tweet he congratulated workers of Congress and BJP, stating their relation was hidden so far, but has now come out in the front. RLP chief and MP from Nagaur, Hanuman Beniwal, announced that his party was reconsidering its tie with the BJP after the “unholy” alliance between the Congress and the BJP defeated his party nominee. “Fearing RLP, both parties came together in support of an independent candidate. Our party candidates won in nine Zila Parishads. We never made any compromises but to defeat us Congress and BJP came together. We will reconsider our alliance with BJP – RLP stands with farmers and youth,” said Hanuman Beniwal, RLP chief. The BTP, which debuted in the 2018 state elections in Rajasthan and created a buzz by winning two of the eight assembly seats of Banswara and finishing second in two others assembly constituencies. The unprecedented tribal upsurge in the largely bipolar politics of the state has alarmed both the parties. “We spoke to Congress leaders including state party chief Govind Singh, district chief and at the CM’s office – all assured of support, but in the end, they betrayed. We went against BJP and supported Congress, today they are supporting their opposition,” said Rajkumar Roat, BTP MLA. He added that his party will withdraw support from the Congress government. Also Read: BJP retains grip by winning 12 Zila Pramukh posts in Rajasthan Panchayati Raj pollsPolitical analyst Rajan Mahan said the developments reflected that ideology and ethics now seem to have little role in state politics. “It’s shocking that both the national parties came together to keep a tribal party out. This is politics of the most vulgar kind, where ideological differences do not matter to keep an emerging party out, which is raising tribal voice,” he said. Another senior political expert called it a strategic move but added that it is ‘rare’ in politics for two big rivals to come together.“The Congress move speaks for itself, they traditionally had support of tribals but with the BTP’s emergence they feel a threat to their vote bank. The state politics is largely based on a two-party system and none of the two parties want to welcome a strong third player,” he said. Also Read: Rajasthan anti-corruption bureau traps own officer taking bribeOn BTP charges, Congress spokesperson RC Choudhary said BTP is an ally of the BJP in Gujarat and the RLP is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and they needed to decide till when their association will continue on the farmers’ issue with the BJP. “The Congress at both places has supported independent candidates, who expressed faith in Congress,” he said. BJP spokesperson and MLA Ram Lal Sharma said the decision was taken at local level in consensus with the candidates. “The decision was not of the BJP, but the candidates,” he said.BJP won 12 of the 20 Zila pramukh posts in Rajasthan, Congress managed five and three independent’s got elected. Congress and BJP faced cross voting in Barmer and Jailasmer. There was a close contest for the election of Pradhans, with the BJP winning 98 posts, Congress 97 and others 26. Three independent members were also elected as Zila Pramukh in Ajmer, Bundi and Dungarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-rural-polls-bjp-congress-join-hands-to-keep-regional-parties-out/story-jEiTdw0VVQzzMvZ0pxwAwI.html
11-12-2020||India||French, German, EU envoys to visit Kochi to mark 5th anniversary of Paris Agreement||The envoys of France, Germany and the European Union (EU) will mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement by visiting Kochi, which has benefited from several Indo-European partnership projects to tackle challenges arising from climate change. Projects backed by Europe in Kochi, a port city considered the economic capital of Kerala, are supporting low carbon urban development policies that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Several of these projects will be visited by French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, German ambassador Walter Lindner and EU ambassador Ugo Astuto on December 12. These projects include the water metro, financed by German investment bank KfW, and Vytilla, an intermodal transport hub that connects the water metro, bus services and Kochi Metro, which was financed by the French Development Agency (AFD) with a technical assistance grant from EU. The envoys will also visit Cochin Shipyard, where a 100-seat boat is being built, said a joint statement from the embassies of France, Germany and EU. As part of efforts to highlight the importance of the Paris Agreement, the envoys will use green transport during the visit. For instance, they will take e-buses to reach Vytilla, the transport hub. On the last leg of the visit, the envoys will go to Muttom Depot and use e-rickshaws, which provide first and last mile connectivity services in Kochi’s public transport network. They will also be briefed by Kochi Metro Rail officials on gender and social inclusion initiatives, flood mitigation measures, rainwater harvesting and solar power integration. Kochi Metro, partially inaugurated in 2017, is the first building block of an integrated mobility policy being implemented by state and local authorities. This policy, which has benefited from technical and financial support from France, Germany and EU, has resulted in significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. The envoys will also witness an example of Kochi’s comprehensive urban mobility planning at Edapally station, where pedestrian and bicycle traffic is prioritised. This will provide an opportunity to showcase results of the Mobilise Your City (MYC) programme, jointly launched at COP21 by the French and German governments and aimed at reducing urban transport-related emissions. Kochi is among Indian cities pioneering the MYC initiative, with support from AFD and funding worth 3.5 million euros from EU. The envoys will also hold talks with mobility and urban development stakeholders, including Cochin Smart City Development Limited. Kochi is one of 12 cities benefiting from technical and financial support under the Indian government’s City Investments to Innovate, Integrate and Sustain (CITIIS) programme, supported by AFD and EU. Ahead of the visit, Lenain said the close ties between France and Kochi are more than two decades old, and cooperation with the French Development Bank started in 2014, with two loans totalling more than 207 million euros. “Achieving COP21’s agenda of solutions relies on broad partnerships like the one built in Kochi. It is an inspiring example of what we can achieve together with India, illustrating the way to concrete actions that help meet the Paris Agreement’s goals,” he said. Astuto said even as the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, countries mustn’t forget that the fight against climate change is an “existential issue for all of us”. He added, “Tackling the impacts of this global crisis must go hand in hand with fighting climate change and combating biodiversity loss to build a greener future. Post-Covid, we need to build back better and invest in an economic model fit for the 21st century – green, digital and resilient.” Lindner described the Paris Agreement as an important milestone on the way to a greener future. “Covid has shown us that cleaner air and a cleaner environment indeed is possible. What we need now is a greener restart to our economies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-german-eu-envoys-to-visit-kochi-to-mark-5th-anniversary-of-paris-agreement/story-9rpE9N4CSgFNmuaXb37yYJ.html

The launch will take place at about 3.41pm.The mission, which was to take place on December 14, was postponed by a few days owing to adverse weather conditions.This will be the 42nd communications satellite to be launched by the space agency and will provide coverage over the entire country for disaster management and satellite internet connection.The satellite, named CMS-01, will be the first in a new series of communication satellites by India after the INSAT and the GSAT series. The previous satellite launched by Isro also had an altered nomenclature; it was called EOS (Earth Observation Satellite) 01. Previous earth observation satellites were thematically named by the space agency depending on their task or the kind of instrumentation carried. EOS-01 had previously been named RISAT-2BR2, short for Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT).Also Read: Government proposes easy access of satellite-based remote sensing dataThe new satellite will replace the current GSAT-12 in orbit, which was launched in 2011.The next much anticipated mission of the space agency is the maiden flight of the newly developed Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), with the capacity to launch a light 500kg satellite in the lower Earth orbit.The new rocket will cost about Rs30 crore, compared to the Rs120 crore it costs to manufacture the currently used PSLV. It can also be assembled by a team of six within seven days, in comparison to a team of 600 people and a few months it takes to assemble a PSLV.The SSLV has been developed by Isro mainly for commercial launches.Before the pandemic, India was only able to complete one satellite mission—GSAT-30—this year, launched by the international launcher Arianespace from Kourou, French Guiana, in January.The space agency had nearly 20 satellite and launch missions planned for the year, including the big-ticket Aditya L1, India’s first mission to the sun. The purely scientific mission would have seen Isro sending a satellite 1.5 million km away from the Earth to the L1 point. The L1, or Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit.The first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission was also scheduled for December 2020.A third Chandrayaan mission with just a lander and rover was to take place either in late 2020 or early 2021. All the missions were delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-launch-communication-satellite-on-december-17-maiden-sslv-launch-to-follow/story-rmDeMrQpf7YxAMLppIzcYI.html

11-12-2020||India||SC issues notice on plea for e-payment of minimum wages in Kerala||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider an appeal filed by the Kerala government insisting on payment of minimum wages directly into the bank account of the employees.By a decision in July 2015, the state had replaced cash payment of minimum wages with a Wage Payment System to streamline payment of minimum wages to employees. Under this system, all employers had to directly deposit the wages into the bank account of the employees. They also had to maintain a digital record of employees and wages paid with the state department.This system was challenged in the Kerala high court . On January 23 this year, the Kerala high court upheld the maintenance of digital records but held that the state cannot insist on employers to transfer wages through the Wage Payment System. The court was of the view that the state did not have power to make such a rule, particularly when the Kerala Minimum Wages Act specifically provided in Section 11 that the payment should be in cash.Also read | SC to not hear plea to ascertain feasibility of confiscating black moneyThe apex court noticed that along with the appeal by the state, even Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) had approached the court in appeal, challenging the high court direction to maintain digital records. TCS claimed that uploading such information would infringe privacy of employees.Finding both sides aggrieved, the bench of justices SK Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said, “If both sides are unhappy, justice seems to have been done (by high court).” The HC had claimed that maintenance of digital records by companies is mandated under the Information Technology Act and there was no fault if the state insisted on the same. As regards infringement of privacy, the high court had noted that the data could always be protected or encrypted with password.More than 270 companies in the state had adopted the Wage Payment System. The high court did not disturb this arrangement and left it open for companies to voluntarily follow the new system. Interestingly, a similar provision was introduced by the Centre in February 2017 by amending the Minimum Wages Act. By this, minimum wage was to be credited directly into the beneficiary’s bank account or paid by way of cheque. The high court observed that Kerala government could have amended the Act rather than changing the rules accompanying the Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-on-plea-for-e-payment-of-minimum-wages-in-kerala/story-vsvNvWOXyb2pOaIGRDxT6O.html

Lauding his work as “fearless”, PM Modi said that today’s youth can learn so much from Bharati’s work, “especially being courageous.”“He (Subramania Bharati) can’t be linked to a single profession or dimension. He was a poet, writer, editor, journalist, social reformer, freedom fighter, humanist and much more. One can only marvel at his work, poems, philosophy and his life,” said PM Modi.He also said, “Mahakavi Bharathiyar’s definition of progression had a central role for women. One of the most important vision was that of independent and empowered women. He wrote that women should walk with their head held high while looking people in the eye.” “We are inspired by this vision Bharathiyar’s vision of independent and empowered women and we are working to ensure women-led empowerment,” PM Modi added.“Today, over 15 crore entrepreneurs are funded by schemes like Mudra Yojana. They’re telling they’re self-reliant. Women are becoming part of our armed forces with permanent commissioning. They are telling us the country is in safe hands,” PM Modi also said. “This is an era of Nari Shakti. They’re breaking barriers and making an impact.,” PM Modi said, adding “this is new India’s tribute to Bharati.”The event, held via video conferencing due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year, was organised as part of the 138th birth anniversary celebration of Subramania Bharati. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was also present during the event.The Bharati Award was instituted in 1994 by Vanavil Cultural Centre.

11-12-2020||India||Permitting Ayurveda doctors to conduct surgery a compromise with health: IMA||Indian Medical Association (IMA) observed a nationwide no-demonstration strike on Friday to oppose the central government’s move to allow Ayurveda doctors to perform surgery.Demanding withdrawal of the notification allowing Ayurveda postgraduates to perform modern medicine surgery, the IMA called for the withdrawal of all non-essential non-COVID services between 6 am and 6 pm today.Dr Rajan Sharma, national president of IMA, said that allowing Ayurveda postgraduates to perform surgery is a “blatant attempt” to “corrupt” the healthcare system of the country.“It takes years and years to become a doctor. With mixopaths what are we heading for? It’s a failure when nations compromise with health,” said Dr Sharma.He stated that the IMA is not against “any sort of pathy”, but the mixing up of disciplines.“We are not against any sort of pathy be it Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy. We are proud of our national heritage and richness but let it coexist with modern medicine. All we demand is not to mix the disciplines. It will also mean the end of pure Ayurveda,” he added.The IMA reiterated that it has taken 200 years of medical research to reach modern medical capabilities, where medicines are controlled and double controlled and are research-oriented.Doctors across the country are observing the strike by wearing a black ribbon as a mark of protest while on duty.The protesting doctors said that surgery is teamwork where preoperative assessment, intra-op, anaesthetist, post-operative care, and complications are vital aspects.The IMA said the agitation is likely to intensify in the coming weeks if the government doesn’t take back the notification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permitting-ayurveda-doctors-to-conduct-surgery-a-compromise-with-health-ima/story-Xcjk3xd7Jiqf9WTRuJT0bJ.html

He said that now there is no further meeting scheduled with the government and the farmers were waiting for the government to accept the demands raised by them in meetings.“All the farmer union leaders have rejected government’s offer for amendments in the laws and we now want the government to withdraw these laws and also enact a law to ensure the guarantee of procurement for all 26 crops on minimum support price,” Haryana BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni told Hindustan Times.Charuni is the only farmer leader from Haryana to be among farmer leaders who held talks with the government on farmers’ behalf.

11-12-2020||India||Opposition must come together, strengthen UPA, says Sena’s Raut||Amid the buzz that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar could become the chairperson or convenor of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), Shiv Sena on Friday suggested formation of a new front of all Opposition parties, like Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi in the state. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut also rooted for Pawar to head the UPA or be its convenor to get more Opposition parties on board. The Shiv Sena, after snapping ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) but has not formally joined UPA yet.“Considering the current political situation, the country’s Opposition must come together and take some decisions. Congress is a huge party, but it is also a fact that they could not get the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. In this scenario, we all must come together and strengthen the UPA. Can there be a front like there is Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra, and who can lead it? All this can be discussed,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.The Sena parliamentarian is expected to leave for New Delhi during the weekend where the discussions on the new political dynamics could take place.Pawar, meanwhile, had denied that there is a proposal to make him the UPA chairperson, the position currently held by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Raut said that Pawar is a “tall” leader of the country. In the past few weeks, the Sena chief spokesperson has also said that the Maratha strongman has the capabilities to unite the scattered Opposition parties in the country against the BJP.“If Pawar saheb becomes the UPA chairperson, we will be happy. However, we are not seeing any such development happening. Yesterday, Pawar saheb has denied this as well. Sharad Pawar is a tall leader of the country and Maharashtra. We are all working under his guidance, but so far there is no formal proposal to elect him as the UPA chairperson. If there is such a proposal, we will support it,” he added.Meanwhile, Congress leader and former MP Sanjay Nirupam called the political development to “wipe out” the Congress party. “The campaign against Rahul Gandhi from Delhi to Mumbai is a part of the campaign to make Sharad Pawar the UPA’s chairman. The 23-signature-letter was written under the same campaign. The ‘lack of consistency’ of Rahulji’s leadership was a part of the same campaign. This is a big plan to wipe out the Congress,” Nirupam tweeted.Nirupam was referring to the letter written by 23 Congress leaders seeking sweeping changing in the party even as ‘lack of consistency’ referred to a comment made by Pawar about Rahul Gandhi during an interview last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-must-come-together-strengthen-upa-says-sena-s-raut/story-9rjpZzrF8TUHTEO2wppcDP.html

11-12-2020||India||No reply from farmers’ unions on govt’s proposal: Agriculture minister Tomar||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Friday the Centre hasn’t yet received any reply from farmers’ unions on the proposals to consider in place of their demand for a repeal of the three farm laws and that he got to know about their rejection of the suggestions through media. The government had on Wednesday sent a draft proposal of amendments to farmers in order to resolve the dispute over the three agriculture laws. However, the farmers union had rejected the proposal, sticking to their demand to repeal the laws.“Our proposal is with them (farmers). They discussed it but we have not received any reply from them. We came to know through media that they have rejected the proposal. Yesterday, I had said that if they want to, we can definitely talk about the proposal,” Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Tomar’s comment comes as hundreds of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting in and around different borders of Delhi against the new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September.Requesting the farmers to end their agitation, Tomar stressed on the trouble being faced by the people of Delhi due to the protests. “Agitation causes problems for the common people too. People of Delhi are facing troubles. So, they (farmers) should end their agitation in the interest of the common people and try to solve issues with the help of talks,” he said.The agriculture minister again assured the farmers that the new farm laws will prove to be beneficial for them and help them live a better life. “Laws made by the government have been formed after a lot of deliberation - to bring a change in the lives of farmers, to remove the injustice that was being done to them for years. It was done to ensure that farmers could live better lives and indulge in beneficial agriculture,” Tomar said.The minister expressed hope of finding a mutual ground, saying that the Centre was ready to make changes in the farm laws after discussion. “We agree that we are not the over-ruling power and Unions might also have something in their mind. So, the government is ready to make reforms in the laws after talks,” Tomar said. “I think we will find a solution. I am hopeful. I would like to urge the farmers’ unions that they should break the deadlock. The government has sent them a proposal. If there is an objection over the provisions of an act, the discussion will be held over it,” he added.Clearing the confusion over the minimum support price system, Tomar referred to his remarks given in Parliament on the matter, saying that no document can be more powerful to assure that MSP will continue. “PM Modi had spoken about this and I had assured on the floors of both the Houses. If it’s being said in Parliament, it is a recorded document. It expresses the intention of the government. There can be no document more powerful than that. MSP will continue. No one should doubt it,” he further said.Since November 26, thousands of farmers have been protesting the three farm laws - the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-reply-from-farmers-unions-on-govt-s-proposal-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar/story-kdtDlEe3bE0CbSBR9anqnJ.html
11-12-2020||India||New laws will make us vulnerable to corporate greed: Farmers’ union moves SC||The Bhartiya Kisan Union on Friday approached the Supreme Court against the three agriculture laws enacted by the government earlier this year, alleging the legislation will make them vulnerable to corporate greed, according to news agency ANI.The move comes two days after farmers’ unions rejected the Centre’s proposal by saying there was nothing new and that they were going to continue their protest against the agricultural laws that liberalise farm trade. The farmers agitating near the national capital have called for a nationwide protest on December 14 and said that they will block the Delhi-Jaipur national highway by December 12.To end the impasse over the contentious laws, the government had agreed to give a written assurance on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP), one of the main concerns raised by the protesters. It also tried to allay their fears over mandis (marketplace) and taking over of farmlands by big corporates. The farmers, however, have refused to budge and are demanding a complete rollback of the laws.Earlier in the day, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Centre hasn’t yet received any communication from farmers’ unions regarding the proposal and added that he got to know about them rejecting it through the media. “Our proposal is with them (farmers). They discussed it but we have not received any reply from them. We came to know through media that they have rejected the proposal. Yesterday, I had said that if they want to, we can definitely talk about the proposal,” he told ANI.Tomar added that he was hopeful of finding a solution and urged farmers to break the deadlock. “The government has sent them a proposal. If there is an objection over the provisions of an Act, the discussion is held over it,” he said, according to ANI.The minister also highlighted the troubles that the people in and around Delhi are facing due to the thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting along the borders of the national capital since November 26. “Agitation causes problems for the common people too. People of Delhi are facing troubles. So, they (farmers) should end their agitation in the interest of the common people and try to solve issues with the help of talks,” Tomar said.The agriculture minister again assured the farmers that the new farm laws will prove to be beneficial for them and help them live a better life. “Laws made by the government have been formed after a lot of deliberation - to bring a change in the lives of farmers, to remove the injustice that was being done to them for years. It was done to ensure that farmers could live better lives and indulge in beneficial agriculture,” Tomar said.While the Centre maintains the new farm laws will prove to be beneficial for the farmers and help them live a better life, the farmers hold that the legislation will hurt their incomes and leave them at the mercy of large corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-union-moves-supreme-court-says-new-laws-will-make-them-vulnerable-to-corporate-greed/story-3GoAxKtQsGglYalodJIuXI.html

The IMA will continue its agitation till our demands are met,” said Saini.Mona Desai, a senior doctor from the city, said the government must not play with the health of people by allowing Ayurvedic doctors to do surgeries after a three-year course as principles of Ayurveda and modern medicines are different.“The CCIM order says that post-graduate Ayurvedic students will be given some training about modern medicine during their 3-year course after which they can perform 58 different types of surgeries.“Modern medicine doctors spend 8 to 10 years learning the same. So if that can be achieved in just three years, why are we spending so many years learning them?” asked Desai, immediate past president of the Ahmedabad Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-30-000-doctors-in-gujarat-join-ima-call-for-protest/story-dqNrzL8J15rdwOsh1qnkGO.html

She also asked Banerjee if the Union home minister and Prime Minister of India were “outsiders.”“Mamata Banerjee needs to choose her words carefully. Are the home minister and Prime Minister of India outsiders? West Bengal is not her private paternal estate but a part of our country,” Chaudhuri was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The minister’s comments come in the backdrop of an attack on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) convoy, including the party’s national president JP Nadda, in West Bengal’s South 24-Parganas district on Thursday. Following the attack, the Union home ministry on Friday summoned the state’s director general of police and chief secretary on December 14 regarding the law-and-order situation in West Bengal.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also expressed concern over the law-and-order situation in the state saying that it has been continuously worsening and the chief minister has to follow the Constitution. “The chief minister has to follow the Constitution. She cannot depart from its paths. The law-and-order situation in the state has been continuously worsening for long. The events that happened yesterday are most unfortunate. They are a slur on our democratic fabric,” Dhankhar said.He added that he has sent a report to the central government about the “extremely disturbing developments that do not augur well for democratic values.” The governor alleged that violators of law in the state have the protection of police and administration.The BJP convoy was attacked at Shirakol in Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. The BJP alleged that some of the party’s frontline leaders, as well as workers, sustained injuries after being assaulted by the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress. Television news footage showed stones raining on the convoy and shattering windshields. Vehicles of some media houses were also damaged.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, its national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were hit by stones and shards of glass from shattered windows and windshields of their cars, according to the party.Nadda, who visited Diamond Harbour as part of his two-day trip to the state, said West Bengal had plunged into a state of lawlessness and appealed to the BJP’s workers to ensure the party’s win in the assembly elections slated for next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-is-not-mamata-banerjee-s-private-paternal-estate-minister-after-attack-on-nadda-s-convoy/story-FtyfYD2iq37otwPBowBgUP.html

Who else could have invented a crime called ‘love jihad’?” the Congress leader asked in another tweet.Chidambaram alleged that Yogi Adityanath-led state government is misusing the new law.“UP is more creative in the application of the law. Look at three examples: a) an FIR is filed without any complaint; b) an FIR is immediately followed by a non-bailable warrant and a threat to seize the property; and c) an arrest is made without an FIR,” said the senior politician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-chidambaram-takes-a-dig-at-niti-aayog-ceo-says-there-is-too-much-bureaucracy/story-6MnvNKvuKtKHcN35VW8NQO.html

It will also fetch farmers a better price for their produce.”Three farm laws, namely the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, were passed in the Parliament in September this year.Several farmer bodies, especially from Punjab and Haryana claim the laws will negatively impact their livelihoods and are opposing them tooth and nail through protests. The talks with the protesting farmer bodies have not yielded any positive result for the Centre yet.Claiming that the BJP-led government in the state was trying to remove middlemen from farmers’ transactions, Biren uploaded a video on his official FB page, which also said, “Now there will be no agent. There will be no commission, no middle men, directly the farmers can order and directly the farmers can purchase.”Also Read: Centre trying to thrust black laws like it imposed demonetization, GST: Sukhbir BadalOn the raging controversy over the status of minimum support price (MSP) regime, Biren said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had categorically and repeatedly given the assurance that there will be no change in the MSP.Apart from this, Union home minister Amit Shah has also committed that MSP will not be changed or touched, he said, before adding,” Fortunately, farmers of Manipur are in support of the Farm Bills.”He opined that any rollback in reforms and development by the government would turn out to be support for vested interests, which, in future, would hinder other reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-cm-speaks-in-support-of-farm-laws-opposes-any-rollback/story-PKc2YvyuHEdC6UydIsDHWN.html
11-12-2020||India||Delhi HC dismisses plea to transfer Tablighi leader case from police to NIA||The Delhi High Court Friday dismissed a plea seeking direction to transfer from Delhi Police to the NIA, the investigation of a case lodged against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad for holding a congregation in March in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh dismissed the petition after the petitioner sought to withdraw it with liberty to approach the Supreme Court.“Advocate Yash Chaturvedi for the petitioner seeks liberty to withdraw the petition with liberty to further prosecute the petition seeking similar relief instituted by him herein before the Supreme Court. Leave and liberty granted The petition is dismissed a withdrawn,” the bench said while dictating the order.The bench said once the petition has already been filed in the Supreme Court with similar prayers, it cannot keep it pending here.The petition filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay has also sought direction to the NIA to investigate the matter in a time bound manner and the probe be monitored by the high court, alleging that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite lapse of considerable time.It had claimed that the crime branch of Delhi Police has miserably failed in tracing out/ apprehending/ arresting Maulana Saad, despite lapse of considerable time and his photograph being published in electronic media.“It is virtually impossible for Maulana Saad to hide himself for such a long time and that too in the capital of the country. Performance of Delhi Police has been pathetic from the very inception and outset. Failure of the Delhi police is explicit from the fact that despite there being lockdown and curfew like situation, Maulana Saad was able to arrange gathering of thousands of people belonging to Tabiligi Jamaat in the capital of India,” the plea claimed.The plea alleged, that “from media reports and evidence so far collected by Delhi Police Crime Branch, it is now axiomatic that Maulana Saad and his henchmen conspired to spread and transmit coronavirus in different parts of the country, with oblique and ulterior motive of causing massive deaths all over the country and thereby to derail the Government of India in preventing the deadly disease.” The Delhi Police’s crime branch had on March 31 lodged an FIR against seven persons, including the cleric, on a complaint by Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station here for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of coronavirus.The Enforcement Directorate has also filed a money laundering case against Saad, trusts links to the Jamaat and others.The plea alleged that the acts of omission and commission of Saad and his associates / Tabligi Jamaat constitute “terrorist acts/activities” as defined under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and claimed that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite lapse of considerable time.It said people of Tablighi Jamaat have been spreading the deadly virus all over the country not only by defying the national lockdown, also by assaulting corona warriors who have been treating the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-to-transfer-tablighi-leader-case-from-police-to-nia/story-VG5HsSHiDDi7tPwp1fJFwJ.html
11-12-2020||India||Race for strategic places, bases in Indian Ocean region: CDS Gen Bipin Rawat||The presence of more than 120 foreign warships in the Indian Ocean and a race for strategic bases that will gain momentum in future reflects the growing global interest in the region, the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat, said on Friday. Rawat’s remarks, made at a virtual conference, came against the backdrop of key European powers such as Germany and France unveiling strategies for the Indo-Pacific and China’s assertive actions across the region that have triggered concerns around the world. India, he said, will have to build on existing bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, including more training engagements with partner nations, to cope with such challenges while retaining strategic autonomy in decision-making. The country will have to achieve its aspiration of becoming a major global power while living in a “tough neighbourhood” and an “increasingly contested” region, he added. Delivering the keynote address at the Global Dialogue Security Forum, Rawat said, “At present, there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean region in support of various missions. Till now the region, by and large, has remained peaceful albeit under contestation.” He added, “Of late, along with geo-strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific, we are also witnessing a race for strategic places and bases in the Indian Ocean region, which is only going to gain momentum in times to come.” Based on the challenges India faces as a rising regional power, the country requires structured long-term planning for capacity building and capability development of its defence forces, Rawat told the inaugural session of the event with the theme “Contesting the Indo-Pacific for global domination”. “In our quest to build a stronger India, we need a peaceful and stable security environment. We need to maintain strategic autonomy and cooperative relations with extra-regional powers, underscored by strong regional linkages that would provide us with a greater degree of strategic leverage,” he added. Many countries in the region are seeking to gain economic dividends from enhanced connectivity and infrastructure projects and powers within and outside the Indian Ocean region are investing in infrastructure development to “maintain and increase geo-political influence”, Rawat said. “In recent years, China’s economic and political rise, coupled with competition to increase influence in the region, has attracted a great deal of interest,” he pointed out against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. Governance and security too are under threat of being undermined by non-state actors and there is growing naval competition among states, he said, adding, “To protect peace, prosperity and sovereignty, it is important for us to keep sea lines of communication secure at all times with a strong hold on the security dimension of this region.” Rawat called for building on existing mechanisms such as JAI (Japan-Australia-India) and Asean-India to have the “right balance in our strategic autonomy”, and said, “The economic centre of gravity is shifting and will continue to shift in this century, and with the major global supply chains passing through our region, the Indo-Pacific in general and the Indian Ocean region in particular will remain vital for transit and world trade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-gen-rawat-addresses-global-dialogue-security-forum/story-9tSKSd9lmQLOiBQRWhHKzN.html

11-12-2020||India||Don’t think people of Bengal will forgive Mamata Banerjee: BJP’s Kailash Vijayvargiya||The big election in 2021 is in West Bengal where chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s 10-year rule is being challenged by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP made significant inroads during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, winning for the first time, 18 of the 42 seats and reducing the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to 22 seats. The Left, for the first time, won no seats at all. On Thursday, BJP chief JP Nadda’s convoy was attacked which has led to a major crisis between the Centre and the state. HT’s Sunetra Choudhury spoke to the BJP leader in charge of the state, Kailash Vijayvargiya:Can you tell us exactly what happened with you and Mr Nadda (BJP president JP Nadda) on Thursday?The BJP national president had a two-day programme and we wanted to start the peoples’ contact programme at Bhowanipur. This is Mamata Banerjee’s constituency and there itself, TMC workers tried to show us black flags. Our workers were there in large numbers so they retreated. The next day at Diamond Harbour, we had our next programme where a large fishing community had been affected during the cyclone. Those people had been sent relief by the Prime Minister but they had not received that assistance. We had a programme to interact with the them there but were told that we weren’t allowed to go to Diamond Harbour. It’s in Abhishek Banerjee’s constituency who is Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. His two aides, Shaukat Mullah and Jehangir, had organised a dinner for 10,000 people in the area. We got word that they would stop us on the way. So we emailed the West Bengal home secretary at night, spoke to the SP, emailed the Chief Secretary and informed the Governor. We also told the Centre that there is a possibility of something but we thought that since we had informed all, it would be fine. It is unfortunate that despite all this, a life-threatening attack was carried out. Since Nadda ji’s car was bullet-proof, nothing happened to him but my car was behind him, they broke its windows. They broke Rahul (Sinha’s), Mukul da (Mukul Roy’s) , all our cars. Our drivers, our security, they are all injured. We saw this for the first time in our life, and felt that we weren’t in our own country. The way goondas were standing with the police and doing this, it was something new for us to see. To welcome the head of any party in this manner, it’s not Bengal’s culture. It’s brought a bad name to the state in the entire country. I don’t think the people of Bengal will forgive Mamata Banerjee for this.Are you saying that the CM or Abhishek Banerjee are directly involved?100%! The ‘goondas’ were throwing stones in front of the police. We do any protest, they throw tear gas at us, or use pellet guns. But when TMC people do this kind of ‘goondai’, they just stand and watch. It means that it’s all happening with their consent.Amit Shah has asked for a report. What did he say?We have informed him about all that’s happened. He has officially asked for a report from the government. From his tweets, it is evident that the Governor isn’t satisfied with what he’s seen.You have been handling Bengal for some time now. What’s the strategy ahead of elections now?We have a straightforward strategy. To go to the polling booths and speak to voters directly. We have the strength to counter violence but in a democracy, we don’t believe in that. That’s why we hope people of Bengal respond to this violent politics. We will just tell the people the way the state government is workingYou have mentioned a few days ago that CAA will be implemented in Bengal soon. Your critics say that BJP polarises the elections by saying this.CAA is a promise that we made to the people in the 2019 elections. I think the act presented by the PM and the home minister is clear that we have to grant citizenship, so the rules for this are being made. It will be made by the end of January by the ministry of home affairs. This isn’t just an election ploy. Those in our neighbouring countries are persecuted due to their religion, it’s our duty to protect them.The BJP has gained from Left cadres and Mamata’s tallest leader, Mukul Roy, is now with you. Are there going to be more exits from their camp to yours?The way a dynasty is being run in TMC and the way Mamata Banerjee is promoting her nephew, to make him a superpower, many TMC leaders are very upset. They are now feeling cheated. That feeling is there within the ranks of the Trinamool.But you can’t use corruption against Mamata Banerjee who has a clean image? What will you attack them with?It’s not about attacking. As I said, when the cyclone hit Bengal, Rs2,200 crore was sent to the state, but those who were impacted got no relief. People have seen that and that’s made them angry. They also can see how the coal mafia and the gold mafia in the state has got protection. The nephew is the chief of the mafia, the absolute chief. And the people of Bengal can see that.Will BJP also push its pet legislation around cow protection and ‘love jihad’ in Bengal?These issues haven’t come to Bengal so far but it is true that we will bring these laws wherever they are needed. When BJP feels that Bengal needs it, we will not hesitate to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-think-people-of-bengal-will-forgive-mamata-banerjee-bjp-s-kailash-vijayvargiya/story-V3liL0PZUiKLEhlnrSociP.html

Lokesh K Batra on the plea and asked him to file his reply within four weeks. The court also sought to know from the IAF as to how disclosing the number of passengers on the flight would affect the security.“What is the problem in giving the number of passengers? You may not give the names. But how does it affect the sovereignty of the country if the number is given?,” the court said.The court was hearing a plea by the IAF, filed through central government counsel Rahul Sharma, against the CIC’s July 8 direction to the IAF to provide certified copies of available and relevant Special Flight Returns-II to RTI applicant Commodore (retd) Lokesh K Batra.Batra had sought certified copies of SRF-I and SRF-II with regard to each foreign visit made by former PM Manmohan Singh as also Prime Minister Narendera Modi from April 2013 onwards.IAF, in its plea, has claimed that the CIC has “failed to appreciate and consider that the information sought by the respondent (Batra) from the petitioner (Air Force) cannot be disclosed and the application of the respondent for seeking the same ought not to have been allowed as the information sought is extremely sensitive in nature...”During the hearing, Centre’s counsel told the court that IAF has already given the details of the flights. However, they cannot give the second part of the information sought which is the details on the passengers. He said that if such information is given then it would expose how many people are travelling with the PM in his security apparatus.Also Read: Afghanistan peace process must preserve gains of past 20 years, says PM ModiHe said that the information is highly confidential and it would not benefit the petitioner (Batra) in any form.However, the court said that the petitioner has sought the information with regards to the passengers which may also include various ministry officials, journalists etc. It said that the number of passengers can always be given.Appearing for Batra, his counsel Prasanna S told the court that CIC had passed the order in July and directed that the information be given within 15 days. However, the same has not been done and he was informed only on Sep 7 that the order was being challenged. He contended that the IAF had undertaken to supply this information only after which the CIC had passed the order.Also Read: PM Modi to address Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday to mark 5 years of Paris AgreementDuring the proceedings, the court said that it was the job of the CIC to specify the information which has to be disclosed. It also said that at best the numbers of passengers could be given without any other details.The matter would now be heard on April 12.The petition has contended that the SRF copies sought by Batra relate to “official records of functioning and working of the security apparatus of the Prime Minister of India, which cannot be brought in public domain for safety and security reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-stays-order-to-disclose-pm-s-flight-details-but-disagrees-with-iaf-on-1-point/story-B1rBcrC2yHiFpkk2bj6LuN.html

MM Naravane has met Commander of the UAE’s Land Forces and Staff Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri and discussed key issues of mutual interest and defence cooperation, the Indian Army said on Friday.Gen. Naravane is currently on a six-day tour of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, in a first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army to the two strategically important Gulf countries.According to the Indian Army, Gen. Naravane on Wednesday received a Guard of Honour at the headquarters of the UAE’s Land Forces and laid a wreath at the Martyr’s Point.“#COAS also interacted with Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri, Commander #LandForces & Staff and discussed issues of mutual interest & defence cooperation,” the Indian Army’s Additional Directorate General of Public Information said in a tweet on Friday.It said that Gen. Naravane also visited the Land Forces Institute, Infantry School and Armour School on Thursday.The Army chief’s visit to the UAE aims to further strengthen bilateral defence cooperation, it added.His visit is seen as a reflection of India’s growing strategic ties with the two countries and is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere.Gen. Naravane’s visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel’s relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran’s top nuclear weapons scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.Ahead of his visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Army said in a statement in New Delhi that “During the visit, he will be meeting his counterparts and senior military leadership of these countries. The visit is historic in the sense that it will be the first time an Indian Army chief is visiting the UAE and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”.According to the official schedule, the Army chief will visit Saudi Arabia from December 13 to 14.Gen. Naravane’s visit to the Gulf region comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s trips to Bahrain and the UAE.In the last few years, India’s ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE have witnessed a major upswing.Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone.In October, Gen. Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gen-naravane-holds-talks-with-uae-commander-on-defence-cooperation/story-ZEtYfUm5y7AdsPWXuQfQiL.html

While he secured bail in two cases, he sought bail in the Dumka treasury case on the ground that he had completed half (42 months & 28 days) of the seven-year sentence awarded to him in the case.Also read | Storm over bribe phone calls ends Lalu Prasad’s VIP bungalow stayBut, in its reply, the CBI said that Yadav had only completed 34 months and some days in custody in this case, which is still short of about eight months to complete half the sentence.Yadav’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar sought six weeks to furnish a detailed computation of the period served by his client in custody, with certified copies of court’s order sheets.Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh then posted the matter for further hearing after six weeks.This particular fodder scam case against Yadav relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs3.76 crore from Dumka treasury during December 1995 and January 1996.The leader has been undergoing treatment in custody at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for over two years.His lawyer said, “According to our calculation, he has completed 42 months and 28 days in prison. On the next date, we will furnish certified copies of court order sheets in support of our claim. From these order sheets, it can be easily computed how many days he has spent in jail in different periods in this case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fodder-scam-no-relief-for-lalu-this-year-as-bail-hearing-deferred-for-six-weeks/story-FXjBS7kpFRnbEDm8sU7AqL.html

As the apex court refused to hear the plea, the petitioner withdrew the same.The petition, filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, also sought life imprisonment for offences such as bribery, black money, benami property, tax evasion, money laundering, profiteering, grain hoarding, food adulteration, human and drug trafficking, black marketing and cheating.Upadhyay said he filed the plea in view of corruption watchdog ‘Transparency International’ placing India at 80 in the Corruption Perception Index earlier this year.“Due to weak and ineffective anti-corruption laws, India has never been ranked even among top the 50 in the Corruption Perception Index but the Centre has not strengthened the laws to weed-out the menace of corruption, which brazenly offends rule of law as well as the right to life, liberty and dignity guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21,” the plea said.It further said that due to the weak and ineffective anti-corruption laws, none of the welfare schemes and government departments are free from corruption.“Corruption has devastating effects on the right to life, liberty, dignity, and it badly affects social and economic justice, fraternity, the dignity of individual, unity and national integration, thus offends fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21,” the plea said.The plea contended that the corruption hurts economically weaker sections or below poverty line families disproportionately by diverting the funds intended for development, undermines government’s ability to provide basic services, seeds inequality and injustice, and discourages foreign aids and investment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-not-hear-plea-to-ascertain-feasibility-of-confiscating-black-money/story-1WH8RLy9k96yMMcoL27tGP.html
11-12-2020||India||PM Modi to address Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday to mark 5 years of Paris Agreement||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will speak at the Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday which is being hosted by the United Nations and United Kingdom to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change which was adopted by 196 parties at 21st Conference of Parties in Paris, on December 12, 2015, and was enforced on November 4, 2016. The important virtual summit being co-hosted by France in partnership with Chile and Italy will give an opportunity to governments to present their commitment and compliance with the Paris Agreement.Ahead of the conference, India underlined that it has been responsible to the commitments under the Paris Agreement but most of the developed world which is responsible for historical emissions hasn’t shown much progress. Financial commitment by developed countries to the tune of 11 trillion dollars to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change hasn’t come through yet, Prakash Javadekar, Union environment minister said on Friday.Also read | India forms high-level committee to implement Paris Agreement targets“Climate change hasn’t happened in a day. It is the result of historical emissions over one hundred years. US has 25% of historical emission; EU has 22% of historical emissions; China has 13% and India has only 3%. We haven’t caused this problem but as a responsible nation, we will be a part of the solution,” said Javadekar. Presently, India is contributing only 6.8% of global emissions and its per capita emissions are only 1.9 tonnes (per capita) compared to, say, 15.5 tonnes per capita of US or 8.12 tonnes per capita of China.Javadekar added that India’s nationally determined contribution (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are 2 degree compliant. “India is among a handful of countries whose commitments are 2 degree C compliant compared to large parts of the world whose commitments will lead to 4 degree C global temperature rise over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. This has been confirmed by independent reports also,” he added.The national schemes that will help achieve India’s NDCs include National Plan on Climate Change; National Clean Air Programme; Swachch Bharat Mission; Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana; Namami Gange policy etc.Javadekar announced that the installed capacity of renewable energy had increased by 226% in the past five years to over 89 GW now and India has a target of increasing installed renewable energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030.India is projected to meet its pre-2020 climate pledge, also called the Cancun pledge, made in 2010. It is also likely to meet and possibly overachieve its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 had said on Wednesday.India, which emits 7.1% of global emissions (according to the Emissions Gap Report) and has per capita emissions that are 60 % lower than the global average, recorded a fall in emissions growth in 2019. India’s greenhouse gas emissions grew by only 1.4% in 2019, lower than the average of 3.3% per year over the last decade according to the report.This slower-than-expected growth is primarily due to increased hydropower from a record monsoon and weaker economic growth, along with India’s continued growth in renewables, the report said. In comparison, China’s CO2 emissions grew by 3.1% in 2019 to reach a record high compared to growth of 2.4% in GHG emissions on average for the past decade.Several countries including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America are projected to miss their Cancun pledges and Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America are set to fall short of their NDCs under the Paris Agreement.India had pledged in 2010 to reduce its emissions intensity of GDP (excluding the agriculture sector) by 20–25% below 2005 levels by 2020 which it has achieved. Further, under NDCs, India has committed to reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 33 to 35% by 2030 over 2005 levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-climate-ambition-summit-on-saturday-to-mark-5-years-of-paris-agreement/story-tTBwJGhWwyzOc2TAJ6RtxI.html

Residents’ powers and extra-regional power have shown a renewed interest in investing in infrastructure development in these countries to maintain and increase geopolitical influence,” General Rawat said while delivering a keynote address at the Global Dialogue Security Summit.Speaking on the theme of “Contesting the Indo Pacific for Global Domination”, CDS Rawat said that presently there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions. “In recent years, China’s economy and military rise coupled with competition to increase the influence in the region has attracted a great deal of interest. At present, there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions. Till now, the region, by and large, has remained peaceful albeit under contestation,” CDS Rawat said.“In the military field, technology must be a means of deterrence not a source of destruction. Our approach to security hence needs to shift from unilateral to the multilateral mode which mandates increasing training engagements with partner nations in order to fortify future,” he said.He further said governance and security are under constant threat of being undermined by non-state actors and also naval competition among the states. “Governance and security are under constant threat of being undermined by non-state actors and also naval competition among the states. To protect peace, prosperity and sovereignty it is important for us to keep a sea line of communication secure at all times with a stronghold on the security dimension of this region,” General Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-120-warships-deployed-in-indian-ocean-region-cds-bipin-rawat/story-xHcDsHJo4OeXVAoWpEiBAO.html
11-12-2020||India||West Bengal Governor submits report on law and order to Amit Shah, says recent developments extremely disturbing||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday said the law and order situation of the state has been continuously worsening, adding chief minister Mamata Banerjee has to follow the Constitution. Dhankhar was referring to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda’s attack in West Bengal’s South 24-Parganas district that took place on Thursday.“The Chief Minister has to follow the Constitution. She cannot depart for its paths. The law and order situation in the state has been continuously worsening for long. The events that happened yesterday are most unfortunate. They are a slur on our democratic fabric,” Dhankhar said.Dhankhar said he has sent a report to the Central government about the “extremely disturbing developments that do not augur well for democratic values.” He alleged that violators of law in the state have protection of police and administration.The BJP has said some of its frontline leaders as well as workers sustained injuries after being assaulted by the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress at Shirakol in Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, who is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. TV news footage showed stones raining on the convoy and shattering windshields. Vehicles of some media houses were damaged.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, its national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were hit by stones and shards of glass from shattered windows and windshields of their cars, according to the party. Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh condemned the incident.Nadda, who visited Diamond Harbour as part of his two-day trip to the state, said West Bengal had plunged into a state of lawlessness, and appealed to BJP workers to ensure the party’s win in the upcoming assembly elections.The incident took place in the afternoon, when he was on his way to his destination a day after meeting voters in Bhawanipore, the chief minister’s assembly constituency in south Kolkata. “These two constituencies are the fountains of corruption and intolerance,” Nadda said.The BJP leadership alleged that the attack was planned to foil Nadda’s programme and there were no policemen along the highway connecting Kolkata to Diamond Harbour, a distance of 52 km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-governor-submits-report-on-law-and-order-to-amit-shah-says-recent-developments-extremely-disturbing/story-D701kGEpAdGhvD3LukITsO.html
11-12-2020||India||India, Uzbekistan committed to destroying terror safe havens||India and Uzbekistan on Friday called for settling the conflict in Afghanistan through an Afghan-controlled process even as they committed themselves to fighting terror by destroying terrorist safe havens, infrastructure and funding channels. The peace process in Afghanistan must preserve the achievements of the past two decades, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while participating in a virtual summit with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. “We agree that the restoration of peace in Afghanistan requires a process that is led, owned and controlled by Afghanistan itself,” he said, speaking in Hindi. India and Uzbekistan have “similar concerns about extremism, fundamentalism and separatism” and both sides stand together against terrorism, he added in his opening remarks. The two sides signed nine agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) during the summit, including on a dollar credit line between the Export-Import Bank of India and the Uzbek government and another on digital technologies. A joint statement issued after the summit said the two leaders believe peace and stability in Afghanistan is of “great importance to the security and stability of the entire region”. The two sides called for settling the Afghan conflict through an “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process”, and expressed unanimous support for a “united, sovereign and democratic” Afghanistan. Modi and Mirziyoyev strongly condemned all forms of terror and “reaffirmed the determination of their countries to combat this menace by destroying terrorist safe-havens, networks, infrastructure and funding channels”, the joint statement said. In an apparent reference to terrorism emanating from Pakistan, the joint statement added: “They also underlined the need for every country to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks against other countries.” The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation between law enforcement agencies and special services, including through the joint working group on counter-terrorism. Modi said the bilateral security partnership is becoming a strong pillar of the relations and the first joint military exercise was held last year, while joint efforts are also increasing in space and atomic energy. “It is also a matter of satisfaction that during this difficult time of the Covid-19 pandemic, both countries fully supported each other, whether it was supplying medicines or returning each other’s citizens home safely,” he said. The joint statement added that both leaders emphasised the need for bilateral and global cooperation to continue fighting Covid-19, including development and distribution of vaccines and other medicines. Pointing to the target of $1 billion for bilateral trade, the leaders instructed officials to fast track a joint feasibility study to pave the way for negotiations on a preferential trade agreement. They also agreed to work towards the early conclusion of a bilateral investment treaty. The Indian side confirmed approval of lines of credit worth $448 million for four developmental projects in Uzbekistan in road construction, sewage treatment and information technology. India sees Central Asia as part of “extended neighbourhood” and forged a strategic partnership with Uzbekistan in 2011. Shortly after beginning his first term as prime minister, Modi made back-to-back visits to all five Central Asian states in 2015. Bilateral ties now encompass political and strategic issues, defence and security, trade and investment, energy, science and technology and people-to-people contacts. Indian officials, however, say bilateral trade worth $247 million a year is well below the potential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-peace-process-must-preserve-gains-of-past-20-years-says-pm-modi/story-bYir8CzA1DdRuCiksk4r1H.html

It has taken the last 100 years. Historically the USA has 25% of all emissions, Europe has 22% whereas China has 13% and India, only 3%.

11-12-2020||India||Delhi HC stays CIC order directing IAF to provide information about PM’s foreign visits||The Delhi High Court Friday stayed the Central Information Commission (CIC) order directing the Indian Air Force (IAF) to provide information regarding Special Flight Returns (SRF)-II, which contains details of the Prime Minister's entourage on his foreign trips.Justice Navin Chawla said the information sought by the RTI applicant with regard to details of the ministry or department officials who accompanied the PM on a trip cannot be disclosed, but there was no harm in providing details of the number of passengers on flights.The court also issued a notice to the RTI applicant Commodore (retd) Lokesh K Batra and sought his stand on the IAF's appeal against the CIC's July 8 direction.The court listed the matter for further hearing on April 12, 2021, and stayed the operation of the CIC direction till then.It observed that the CIC ought to have been more clear as to what information can be provided and what is exempted under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.IAF, represented by central government senior panel counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate CK Bhatt, contended there was a "dichotomy" in the CIC order as it said the information sought was exempted under the RTI, but then directed that information sought be provided after severing the sensitive details which included names and ranks of the security officials accompanying the PM.CIC had directed IAF to provide certified copies of available and relevant SRF-I and ll to RTI applicant Batra.Batra had sought certified copies of SRF-I and SRF-II with regard to each foreign visit of former PM Manmohan Singh as also Prime Minister Narendera Modi from April 2013 onwards.   IAF told the court that it has provided SRF-I information which contains details of number of crew and others on the PM's flight, but details of SRF-II cannot be provided as it contains names, ranks and organisation of security and other officials on the flight.It said even providing the number of passengers on the flight was detrimental to security of the PM as it would indicate how many people accompanied him on a particular trip and anti-state elements can use it to strategise or plan some action.The court, however, said no harm can be caused to the security of the state if only the number of passengers was provided as certain private individuals, like journalists, would have also accompanied the PM.It made it clear that information regarding names or designation of ministry or security officials on the flight cannot be provided.It also said that CIC had left it to IAF to decide what information from SRF-II can be provided.The IAF, in its plea, has claimed that the "information so sought includes details related to the entire entourage, names of Special Protection Group (SPG) personnel accompanying the Prime Minister of India on foreign tours for his personal safety, and the same, if disclosed, can potentially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State".It has claimed that the CIC has "failed to appreciate and consider that the information sought by the respondent (Batra) from the petitioner (Air Force) cannot be disclosed and the application of the respondent for seeking the same ought not to have been allowed as the information sought is extremely sensitive in nature." It has contended that the SRF-II copies sought relate to "official records of functioning and working of the security apparatus of the Prime Minister of India which cannot be brought in public domain for safety and security reasons."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-stays-cic-order-directing-iaf-to-provide-information-about-pm-s-foreign-visits/story-FvZ49SJ9fhpblnVn1pwQZO.html
11-12-2020||India||Centre left with mere 10% NREGA funds as scheme sees 243% jump in Corona times||In the time of Covid pandemic, the Central government has made a record payment to MG-NREGA workers, the world’s biggest job guarantee scheme, in the financial year 2020-21, resulting in the rural development ministry being left with 10% of the total funds to be spent on the scheme in the remaining four months of the current fiscal year, shows government data. The rural development ministry, which administers Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MG-NREGA) scheme, was provided with Rs 84,900 crore for the current financial year by the finance ministry in two instalments. Of this amount, the ministry data shows, Rs 76, 800 crore has already been spent. In comparison, till November 2019, the ministry had spent about Rs 50,000 crore on the scheme. In fact, the ministry has spent 12 percentage points more than the allocation in the budget and has the highest expenditure rate among all Central government ministries, shows the Controller General of Accounts website. A finance ministry official privy to the matter, said there would be no shortage of funds for MG-NREGA and additional money will be provided as and when needed. A MG-NREGA tracker released on Thursday said the huge expenditure on the scheme was on account of 10 million more households getting work under the MG-NREGA this year (till November), 243% increase in person days (work) generated and higher wage paid to workers as compared to previous years. “The total active job cards this year was 90.2 million and of them, 83.09% sought work,” the tracker prepared by People Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG), a network of NGOs, said. The higher demand for MG-NREGA work was because of close to 20 million workers returning to their villages from cities after the Central government announced nation-wide lockdown on March 24. Although the demand peaked in the month of May, it slowed down in subsequent months as workers from poorer states such as Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand started returning to cities for work.The report said the average work provided to individual households was less than the previous years. Till November end, an average household got 41.59 days of work as compared to 48.4 in 2019-20 and 50.88 in 2018-19 financial years. Only 1.9 million households got work for 100 days as mandated under the NREGA law as compared to 4.06 million last year. Of them, 21,000 were in Rajasthan and 350,000 in Andhra Pradesh, which had to spend money from the state kitty to ensure NREGA workers got money on time. The number of households getting 100 days of work was lowest in Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu among all Indian states.

Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were the two states, where one-fourth of households demanding work, were not engaged even for a single day, the data showed. Rajasthan and West Bengal did well by keeping the unmet demand lower than the national average. Jharkhand rural development secretary Aradhana Patnaik said they were one of the best performing states in creating man days under NREGA. “We have been stagnating around 70 million man days for the past three years. But, we have already achieved 77.7 million man days against the target of 80 million,” she said. A UP government official said that they have provided 87% more employment under NREGA then last year. Also Read: Realty, hospitality sectors in Maharashtra yet to feel full force of migrant workersRajasthan MG-NREGA commissioner, PC Kishan said the scheme implementation in the state is completely demand-driven and right-based, hence unmet demand is less and employment provided is higher than previous years. “People are quite aware about their rights and entitlements and seek unemployment allowance if they do not get work within 15 days,” he said. Nikhil Dey, a former member of MG-NREGA council, said the data clearly showed that the scheme provided a balm to poor and marginalized people during Covid but the governments did not do enough to ensure that all get sufficient work under the scheme.“We would have been happy if more people would have got at least 100 days of work as compared to previous year. That did not happen and it proves government inefficiency,” he said.

This comes a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) chief JP Nadda’s convoy was attacked. On Thursday, Nadda along with BJP leaders Dilip Ghosh and Kailash Vijayvargiya was on his way to the Diamond Harbour to attend the party’s organisational meeting when the convoy in which he was seated was attacked. The video of the assault that went viral on social media showed windshields of the convoy shattered as stones were thrown at it. Union home minister Amit Shah condemned the attack and said that the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-ruled government will be answerable to the peace-loving people of West Bengal. “The attack on BJP president JP Nadda is condemnable. No matter how much we condemn, it will not be enough. The Centre is taking this very seriously. The West Bengal government will be answerable to the peace-loving people of the state for this,” Shah’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.

Dhankar further said that chief minister Mamata Banerjee has to follow the Constitution adding that the law and order situation has been continuously worsening for long.

Congratulating the president on the occasion of the fifth year anniversary of his rule which will be on December 14, PM Modi said he was keen to visit the country this year, but could not do so because of the pandemic situation. “The relationship between India and Uzbekistan goes back to a long time.

Our opinions are same on regional security as well. We agree that Afghanistan needs a peace process led and controlled by Afghanistan. Additionally, the gains of the last two decades must also be preserved,” PM Modi said.

After rejecting the Centre’s proposals to make amendments in the recently enacted farm laws, against which the farmers are protesting, the agitating leaders on Thursday said that they would intensify their agitation by blocking railway tracks to put pressure on the government to repeal the three Acts.Six rounds of talks have taken place between the Centre and farmer leaders regarding the laws.The farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-organise-nationwide-press-conferences-chaupals-on-new-farm-bills/story-qklkcoCgMU1XR3cbKe1z1H.html

You provide central police security to so many people without informing the state,” Banerjee had said.On Thursday, as the BJP leaders including Nadda, Dilip Ghosh and Kailash Vijayvargiya, were going to attend an organisational meeting at Diamond Harbour, stones were pelted on their convoy. The assault was telecast live by several Bengali news channels. Vehicles of some media houses were also damaged.Union home minister Amit Shah called the attack on Nadda “sponsored violence”, and said on Twitter that West Bengal has “descended into an era of tyranny and anarchy” under the rule of Trinamool Congress. The Centre also sought a report from the West Bengal government after the incident, which was sent by the state government on Friday. Since the attack, the BJP upped its ante in the state. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar submitted his report on law and order to Amit Shah who may travel to Kolkata later this month. Questioning the transparency of the report prepared by the Governor, Moitra had earlier tweeted, “BJP’s unelected hatchet-man masquerading as Governor to ‘investigate’ alleged attack on BJP President’s convoy!?

He said the Congress is weak and hence the opposition needs to come together now.“We will be happy if Pawar sir becomes UPA chairman. But I have heard that he’s personally refused it. We will support him if such a proposal comes to the fore officially. Congress is weak now so the opposition needs to come together and strengthen the UPA,” Raut said.This comes after the NCP on Thursday termed as baseless media speculation that Pawar may head the UPA. NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said there are unsubstantiated reports in the media regarding Pawar taking over as the chairperson of the UPA.“The Nationalist Congress Party would like to clarify that there is no discussion within UPA partners regarding any such proposal. The reports appearing in the media seems to be have planted by vested interests to divert the attention from the ongoing farmers’ agitation,” Tapase said.A senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister said he had asked around in the party about this speculation. “Nobody has any inkling about this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-support-sharad-pawar-says-sanjay-raut-after-ncp-junks-speculation-over-upa-chief-post/story-qA3amKtMdpvgUx43K4rKkN.html

11-12-2020||India||Karnataka’s new cow slaughter law to cripple Goa’s beef supply, traders say||The passage of a new stringent ‘Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020’ by the Karnataka Assembly will have a ripple effect in neighbouring Goa and will likely cripple the state’s beef supply, meat traders and sellers have said. Goa relies almost entirely for its supply of beef on Karnataka. Traders either bring in freshly slaughtered beef from the neighbouring Belgaum district in North Karnataka or bring in live cattle to be slaughtered at the Goa Meat Complex, a government run and the state’s only notified slaughterhouse. Locally available cattle are not enough to meet the state’s demand, traders have said. “We have been doing this business for generations. This bill, if assented by the Karnataka government, will bring a complete stop to our business. We will take this up with the Goa government,” Anwar Bepari, a meat trader said. He said that almost 40% of Goa’s population consumes beef, besides the demand is also from the tourism industry and hotels and restaurants, which mainly cater to foreign tourists. The president of the Quraishi meat traders association, Manna Bepari, was even more sceptical of the future of meat trade in Goa. “The new law prohibits even the transport of cattle with a jail term. This will make it near impossible for us to bring live cattle to Goa for slaughter. In Maharashtra, the law was already strict but now in Karnataka, the law has changed too,” he said. “Thousands of families depend on the meat trade besides even Goa’s reputation as a tourism destination especially for foreign tourists is supported by the availability of beef,” Manna Bepari said.Both fresh beef as well as cold cuts sold in the state are sourced from suppliers from Karnataka, and any disruption from the Karnataka side has inevitably caused shortages in Goa in the past.With both Maharashtra and now Karnataka implementing strict laws on the slaughter of cattle, Goa has remained isolated. While the Goa prevention of cow slaughter act prevents the slaughter of cows, the law permits the slaughter of bulls, bullocks, male calves, male and female buffaloes and buffalo calves whose slaughter is allowed subject to an ante-mortem certification by a veterinary surgeon.Also Read: Maharashtra appoints panel to phase out unsustainable fishingOver the years vigilante groups have grown increasingly powerful and have been emboldened in their attempts to disrupt the state’s beef trade by foisting cases against the functioning of the Goa Meat Complex. On two occasions in recent years, the Bombay high court at Goa has dismissed complaints by animal rights NGOs that the complex was being operated in violation of the laws in force as ‘flimsy’. Around 20 tonnes of beef is consumed in Goa every day. It is mostly eaten by its 26% Catholic and 11% Muslim populations, apart from tourists.The Goa BJP has however distanced itself from the act of the BJP government in Karnataka. “What they are doing in the Karnataka assembly, it is their decision. It will not be right for us to comment on it,” ,” said Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade.The Goa BJP including former chief ministers Laxmikant Parsekar and Manohar Parrikar have in the past vehemently defended their government’s stance on the sale of beef.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-s-new-cow-slaughter-law-to-cripple-goa-s-beef-supply-traders-say/story-1xYXm4NciCqrvaOErbp31I.html
11-12-2020||India||Farmers’ protest enters 16th day: Only God knows solution, says farmer leader | 10 points||The ongoing protest of the farmers against the three new agriculture laws enters 16th day with the farmers’ unions now threatening to block railway tracks. According to their earlier plan of blocking Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Agra highway by December 12, more farmers are likely to join the protests on Friday. Police have stepped up vigil on the border areas to ensure the protesters can’t block highways. On Thursday, the Centre said channels for more talks are open. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to the protesters to stop agitation as talks are still going on. However, that led to no breaking of ice as the farmers are unwavering in their demand of a complete withdrawal of the three laws, which the Centre is ready to amend — but won’t withdraw.Here are the latest updates of the protest1. While the Centre urged the farmers to consider the proposal that it sent on Wednesday, which includes a proposal of a written assurance on minimum support price, the unions said the proposals contained nothing new.2. Farmers’ unions have said that the protest will be intensified and a date for railway track blockade across the country will be announced soon. Several trains — either originating from or terminating at Punjab — are regularly being cancelled, diverted, short-terminated because of the ongoing protests.3. The main protest site at Singhu border, meanwhile, is buzzing with activities. Apart from langar, WiFi, reading facilities which have been there from the beginning, now a group of sportspersons, farmers are providing laundry services. Winter clothes are also being sold.4. The farmers have said of the government invites the farmers for another round of talks, then they will decide that in their meeting.5. As farmer leaders said agriculture comes under state list, the Central ministers on Thursday said the Centre has the power under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List to pass laws on contract farming and intra- and inter-state trade, and prohibit states from imposing fees/cess outside APMC areas.6. Asked about a solution to the ongoing standoff as the Centre is not mulling withdrawal of the laws, farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said, “Only God knows.” “We are facing a lot of difficulties due to cold weather and the Covid-19 pandemic, but despite this, we will continue our protest until our demands are met,” Kakka told PTI.7. Talking about forces behind the farmers agitation, if any, Tomar on Thursday said media will have to find out that. Union minister Raosaheb Danve had earlier said China and Pakistan were behind the ongoing protests which evoked sharp reaction from farmers. The protesters, meanwhile, said their agitation has remained apolitical. They did not allow any political leader to use their platform.8. Amid the protests, the ministry of information and broadcasting came out with a booklet highlighting agriculture reforms introduced by the government. Titled ‘Putting Farmers First’, the booklet discusses a great deal about the recent farm laws. 9. Traffic in and around Delhi remains disrupted with the main borders remaining closed.10. On Friday, there will be more congestion in the borders that are open as police is stepping up security checks.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-enters-16th-day-only-god-knows-solution-says-farmer-leader-10-points/story-VBsbHk5syMRDsyISTJUgJL.html

The functionary said Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury were both invited to the function but didn’t attend.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said history would record that when farmers were fighting for their rights by protesting on the streets, Prime Minister Modi was busy laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament. “Dear PM, Parliament is not mortar and stones. It envisions democracy. It imbibes Constitution. It is economic-political-social equality. It is compassion and camaraderie. It is the aspirations of 130 crore Indians. What would a building built upon trampling of these values represent?” he tweeted. Surjewala said in a democracy, power did not mean fulfilling one’s whims and fancies, but serving the people and public interest. “Mr Modi, history will also record that when the ‘Annadata’ (food grower) was fighting for his rights for 16 days on the streets, you were building a palace for yourself in the name of Central Vista. In democracy, power is not a means to fulfil your whims, but is a medium for public service and public welfare,” he said in another tweet in Hindi. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the existing Parliament building “bears a remarkable similarity to the Chausath Yogini Temple in Morena in Madhya Pradesh, while the new Parliament bears a likeness to Pentagon in US”. Former finance minister P Chidambaram said, “The foundation for a new Parliament building was laid on the ruins of a liberal democracy.” Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the decision to build the new building was “heartless, senseless and shameless”. “At a time when the nation is going through economic recession, the BJP instead of giving any concession is taking out an ‘extravaganza procession,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-boycotts-new-parliament-stone-laying-event/story-X4HBodLune16eE548rfBKI.html
11-12-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Rarely do meetings of the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation get as much attention as the one that met on Wednesday did.Some of the details of the proceedings have been reported, but here’s a quick run through — and why it matters. It is important to note that SEC doesn’t approve vaccines, as some have suggested. It just recommends a course of action after looking at the data on hand. If the data is insufficient, it asks for more before deciding what its recommendation should be.On the agenda of the meeting on Wednesday were four items.One was the approval of combined Phase 1/2 trials for one of India’s most promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates, the mRNA one being developed by Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals. This was granted (on the basis of data from animal studies), but with the caveat that the company would submit interim results from the first part of the trial before proceeding to the next.The second was a discussion on Pfizer’s application seeking emergency use approval of it mRNA vaccine, which has been approved in the UK, and which, the US FDA indicated earlier this this week it would approve shortly. The company, however, asked for more time to prepare for its presentation to the committee.The third was Bharat Biotech’s application for emergency use authorisation of its Covaxin Covid-19 vaccine based on data from Phase1/2 trials. Phase 3 trials are currently ongoing, and interim data isn’t expected before the end of the month. As this writer pointed out, Bharat Biotech’s action seemed to be prompted more by the desire to get in on the action — others were applying for approval for their vaccines, after all — than by logic. The results of the company’s Phase 1/2 trials have not been released publicly or published in a peer-reviewed journal, although they must have been satisfactory, because the Phase 3 trials were approved by the regulator. SEC did the right thing on Wednesday by asking the company to present data from its Phase 3 trials before its application could be considered.The fourth was Serum Institute of India’s application for emergency use authorisation of Covishield, the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford which the company is manufacturing. Dispatch 222 wrote in detail about the trial data on the basis of which the company sought approval. In this case, SEC said it would like to see safety and immunogenicity data from the ongoing Phase 3 trials of the vaccine in India, and also wait for the decision of the UK drugs regulator, which is currently evaluating AstraZeneca/Oxford’s application, before taking a call.In all four cases, the committee was not pressured or influenced by the circumstances, and its decisions were based solely on logic, data, and science. This speaks well of the drugs regulator — regular readers of this column know that I rarely have kind words for anyone — and should reassure anyone who is worried that the desire to have its own vaccine could short-circuit India’s approval processes.Postscript: One of the reasons I decided to write this column (back in March) was to try and be the voice of reason in all matters related to the pandemic. I’m not sure I have done that consistently. However, three people who have are Gagandeep Kang, Randeep Guleria, and Chandrakant Lahariya. Kang and Lahariya are active on Twitter, where they do a very good job of being voices of reason. Guleria has done the same on other platforms (he was my first choice as expert for a HT Leadership Summit discussion on Covid-19). The three of them have written a book called Till We Win: India’s Fight Against The Covid-19 Pandemic, which looks at both the macro picture (public health and policy) and the micro one (all your pressing Covid questions answered). One of the authors was kind enough to send me a copy. Not only is it an easy read, it is an important book driven by science, data, and reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-0VxJfTXV0HgtmoN1wcbTKM.html
11-12-2020||India||‘Govt has no ego’: Tomar appeals to farmer leaders to resume talks||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday appealed to farm unions to resume talks with the government, and asked them not to chalk out new plans to ramp up their agitation against three new laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy. Tomar, along with Union railway minister Piyush Goyal, said the government was open to further negotiations with the farm leaders to find a solution. “Any law is never entirely bad or good. Therefore, we have come out with amendments on provisions which during discussions the farmers had apprehensions about,” Tomar said. “The government has no ego. The government was, is and will always be open to dialogue,” Tomar said. He added that if farm unions raise specific issues on the laws, the government can work towards solutions. The government in September deregulated farm markets, giving more space to private traders, to spur investments in a farm sector dependent on subsidies. Thousands of farmers are protesting the changes, saying they will be swallowed up by big corporations. On Wednesday, the government offered in writing concessions it was willing to make. It proposed giving states greater role in so-called free markets and a written assurance to continue the system of minimum support prices (MSP), which offers farmers state-set assured prices for staples. “We have addressed all issues that had come out of the discussions. There is nothing in the laws that can impact procurement at minimum support prices. The laws categorically state that there can be no lease or confiscation or auction of a farmer’s land,” Goyal said. The government has proposed to amend The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 to bring parity between so-called free markets and notified markets controlled by state governments. Another key offer is to bring additional legal safeguards for farmers’ rights engaging in contract farming “if needed”, including a bar on any confiscation of farm land to recover dues, and possible immunity to farmers from penalties for crop-residue burning, which causes pollution. Tomar urged farmers not to call off discussions and said farmers should say if they had any objections to the government’s written proposal. Farmers on Wednesday rejected the proposal of the government to bring amendments, saying they were pretty much based on proposals farm unions had already rejected. “The government has avoided answering farmers opposition that farm laws help only corporates and MNCs, will increase farmers’ input costs, losses, debts and displacement from land,” said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, which is spearheading the agitation under the umbrella platform All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Farm unions on Thursday said they would occupy toll plazas and block the Jaipur-Delhi Highway on December 12 and organise protests from December 14. Tens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, are protesting a set of pro-market agricultural laws by camping on Delhi’s borders. The farmers have stocked up on months of supplies, preparing to dig in for months.Goyal said a large number of farmers in several states have welcomed the laws. “The recent results to [panchayat] elections in Rajasthan make this clear,” Goyal said. The railways minister was referring to wins by the BJP in panchayat polls in Rajasthan, a Congress-ruled state.Goyal also said the new laws made local magistrates the final authority to settle disputes between traders and farmers in 30 days because the government’s view was that farmers may find it cumbersome to fight long-drawn court battles. Farm unions have opposed this provision. “That is why the government’s proposal on this is that amendments will be made to allow farmers to approach civil courts of their choice,” Goyal said. Tomar said the Modi government remains committed to the well-being of the farming community and had brought policies to increase farm incomes and raise the share of agriculture in the country’s gross domestic product. “These proposals do not address most of our concerns. Despite rejecting the government’s offer of amendments, it has rehashed the same proposals,” said Kirankumar Vissa of Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a farmer representative. The new laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new contract-farming rules.Experts said the agitation is the first “sustainted challenge” the government has faced. “These are the first sustained challenge the Modi government is facing at the ground level. An escalation will further put the Bharatiya Janata Party’s political limits to test,” said KK Kailash who teaches in the political science department of the University of Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-no-ego-tomar-appeals-to-farmer-leaders-to-resume-talks/story-RNBanCxvpKtHt3hj6q6ViM.html
11-12-2020||India||New Parliament symbol of self-reliance, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a new Parliament House on Thursday, describing the event as a milestone in India’s democratic history and asserting that the building will become the symbol of a 21st century nation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India. At an event in central Delhi attended by senior ministers, foreign envoys and top industrialists, Modi performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the two-storied building amid vedic chants by 12 priests and an interfaith prayer, 93 years after the iconic circular Parliament House was completed. Addressing a gathering afterwards, Modi hoped India would be soon recognised as the “mother democracy” and asserted that Indian democratic traditions predate the Magna Carta, a 13th century English royal charter often considered the forerunner of modern Constitutions.“It is a very historic day. Today is a milestone in India’s democratic history... We, the people of India, will together build this new building of Parliament,” Modi said, adding that the building will be an inspiration when India celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, the proposed date of completion of construction.The PM expressed confidence for the resurgence of a new, self-reliant India that would not waste “flood of opportunities” and time. Connecting the old and the proposed building, he said, “If the old Parliament House gave direction to post-Independence India, the new building would fulfil the aspirations of India in the 21st century.”The 64,500 square metre building, the showpiece of the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project, is proposed to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. The earthquake resistant structure would involve 2,000 workers directly and another 9,000 indirectly.“I can never forget the moment in my life when I had the opportunity to come to Parliament House for the first time in 2014 as an MP. Before stepping in, I bowed and saluted this temple of democracy,” Modi said.Modi extolled the importance of the current Parliament, which will continue to function in an ancillary capacity. “The first government of an independent India was formed here and the first sitting of Parliament took place here, our Constitution was drafted here, our democracy was re-established here. Babasaheb Ambedkar and others, after deep deliberations in the Central Hall, gave us a Constitution,” the Prime Minister said.“When India got independence, there was a lot of apprehension whether democracy can survive in India given its poverty social condition, literary levels. Predictions were made that democracy would fail in India. Today, we can say with pride that those apprehensions have been proved wrong.” The new building is to have a capacity to house over 1,200 MPs, 55% additional seating capacity from than the current strength. A new office complex for all parliamentarians will also replace the Shram Shakti Bhavan and Transport Bhavan, right next to Parliament. It will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.To be sure, the Supreme Court reserved its judgment in November on a batch of petitions challenging the Central Vista project, which also included 11 buildings for 51 central ministries, an underground Metro station, chambers for MPs, the Prime Minister’s office and residence, and even an arboretum of rare plants behind the Mughal Gardens. On Monday, the apex court directed the Centre to immediately stop all construction and ancillary activities in the Central Vista area but allowed the groundbreaking ceremony to go ahead.The Opposition criticised the ceremony at a time when tens of thousands of farmers are protesting against the Centre’s agricultural laws outside the Capital. “The foundation for a new Parliament building was laid on the ruins of a liberal democracy,” said former finance minister P Chidambaram. The Congress boycotted the event.At the event, Modi invoked Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, to underline the importance of dialogue and discussion. “Debate and discussion must can occur both inside and outside Parliament. Service to the nation must also continue but they must reflect national service and dedication towards national interest,” he said. After the ceremony, messages from President Ram Nath Kovind and vice president Venkaiah Naidu were read out by Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh. “In order to enable the members to realise their constitutional obligations in the near future, the extant Parliament House required restructuring which was not desirable due to the heritage status of the building. As such, a new Parliament Building was required,” said Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, the custodian of the parliament estate.Birla also pointed out that MPs of both Houses had repeatedly expressed the desire for a modern and hi-tech Parliament Building. Businessman Ratan Tata, whose firm has got the contract to construct the new building, was also in attendance.The PM emphasised on the importance of different views and perspectives to empower a vibrant democracy. “Democracy in India has always paved way for resolving differences apart from providing governance…there is always room for differences so long as it is not entirely disconnected from the process.”The Prime Minister described how MPs would get additional facilities in the new building but also added that the representatives of the people would be accountable to the public and the Constitution. “Their dedication, their service, conduct, thought and behaviour will become the life of this temple. Their efforts towards the unity and integrity of India will become the energy that gives life to this temple,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parliament-symbol-of-self-reliance-says-pm-modi/story-bDkK4d4XP2iNGUorZNncWI.html
11-12-2020||India||Older vaccine platforms hold supply edge: Bill Gates||Covid-19 vaccines developed using a new platform of messenger RNA, such as those by Moderna or Pfizer, have showed promise but older platforms that use inactivated or weakened viruses, such as that by Oxford-AstraZeneca, hold the edge for public distribution because of easy scalability, cost and temperature stability, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation co-chair Bill Gates said on Thursday. In an exclusive interview, Gates touched upon the challenge to equitably distribute vaccines between rich and poor countries, and hoped that the world can go back to normal by the first half of 2022. “I think we will raise the money and we’ll have the manufacturing capacity, and so that, you know, for the rich world in 2021 and for the world as a whole... in the first half of 2022, we should be able to get the vaccine coverage that largely brings this pandemic to an end,” he said, hours before the foundation announced a grant of $250 million in the fight against Covid-19, taking its total commitment to fighting the pandemic to $1.75 billion.The comments came days after the United Kingdom, and then Canada, approved the Pfizer-BionTech vaccine for public distribution. Pfizer and Moderna used a new technology to build their vaccines that used a single strand of mRNA, which carries genetic information for protein synthesis and triggers an immune response in the patient’s body.In contrast, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, which Gates hoped the UK would approve by the end of 2020, used a cold-causing virus isolated from chimpanzees that instrued human cells to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and induce an immune response.This vaccine, which is being produced locally by the Serum Institute of India, can be distributed more easily than the mRNA vaccines that require storage at temperatures comparable to that of Antarctica. Gates commended the fact that multiple vaccines were developed less than 12 months into the pandemic. “Now, the mRNA platform is not a fully mature platform...The actual thermostability and cost and scalability of making an mRNA vaccine is not as good as it will be for AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax. Some of the other constructs the world knows how to scale up, and 5-10 years from now, we will get the [mature] mRNA platform, [and it] will get rid of those problems,” he said. With vaccine development in its last lap and many countries gearing up for regulatory approval, the focus has shifted on public immunisation with many reports pointing out that rich countries had an enormous advance in stockpiling. On Tuesday, a global campaign for vaccine distribution said nine out of 10 people in poor nations could miss out on getting vaccinated next year because a few rich countries have hoarded 53% of all doses – far more than they need.Gates, founder of Microsoft Corporation and one of the pioneers of the home computer revolution, admitted that equitable distribution of resources was a challenge but underlined that having a second source of manufacturing locally – such as SII – can blunt the problem. “The rich countries will get somewhat more of the early allocations, but if we really push on getting these factories running, then we can make it so [that] it’s not such a severe problem... So, the only way around this problem is to get a lot of capacity, and that’s why it’s important that we have these vaccines that are cheaper and easier to scale -- they get into the mix,” he said.Currently, the SII is on course to make 1 billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and 2 billion doses of the Novovax vaccine candidate. Johnson & Johnson – which is also developing a vaccine – is talking to other Indian firms to scale up capacity. Gates felt that Covax – a partnership of vaccine developers and countries set up by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), and World Health Organization – was “a little slow” because the United States had not yet shown up to put money into the initiative.Covax – in which rich countries essentially subsidise vaccine distribution in poor countries but which also works as a hedge for rich nations to ensure access to any successful vaccine – aims to source and distribute two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of 2021.“We need to get at least $4 billion in there, for this Gavi vaccine procurement effort. And I am hopeful, you know, but we haven’t got that yet, and there is a question that we get it before January 20th. I can’t prove it, but I think that we will get it at some point in time, and I do think that getting the US to step forward like it has in the past, for things like HIV and malaria, that it has a proud record there… I do think that will start to unlock a lot of other money,” he said. January 20th is when US President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to be sworn in. Gates said there was still a lot about the infection that was still not understood well, such as why it didn’t hurt African nations as badly as the rest of the world, or why models to predict virus behaviour were not very accurate. He felt that other vaccines would get approved by the summer of 2021 and focus will shift to the distribution logistics. But by then, he cautioned, only the rich countries would have had more vaccine coverage than others. “So, the rich countries will be going mostly back to normal. But I still think because the virus will be in the world, we still will be somewhat conservative about large public events, we will still have some mask-wearing...They won’t be totally back to normal but sometime in the first half of 2022, I do think we will be able to say that we’re back to normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/older-vaccine-platforms-hold-supply-edge-bill-gates/story-5OmKvDYkwnr6OKsoutursL.html
11-12-2020||India||Uttarakhand invokes ESMA, bans doctors from going on strike till March 2021||The Uttarakhand government has issued an order prohibiting doctors in the state from going on strike till March 2021, invoking the UP Essential Services Maintenance Act 1966 following a surge in Covid-19 cases.According to the order issued late on Wednesday night by Amit Singh Negi, secretary for health in the state, all services of doctors been declared as essential services under the relevant sections of U.P Essential Services Maintenance Act 1966 and as such all strikes have been prohibited with immediate effect till March 31, 2021. The order mentions that due to the prevailing Covid-19 epidemic, it is required for the state government to take such a step. The order will be applicable to all doctors, officials working for medical health and medical education departments in the state, along with postgraduate students studying in state medical colleges. On Friday, over 2000 private doctors from across the state are scheduled to go on strike protesting against Central government allowing Ayurvedic doctors to perform certain surgeries. The Uttarakhand chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called for the closure of out-patient departments in private hospitals on Friday from 6 am to 6pm. Officials from IMA Uttarakhand alleged that the decision to allow Ayurvedic doctors to perform surgeries would endanger the lives of patients as there can be different side-effects of Ayurveda and allopathy being mixed. DD Choudhury, national vice-president of IMA said, “We will continue with our strike by closing OPDs from 6 am to 6 pm, but all emergency and trauma services will remain functional. We do not want the common public to face any problem due to the protest. It is not that we do not want AYUSH medicine to flourish in the country, but we are against mixing of two different kinds of treatments.” As per a notification, Central Council of Indian Medicines has mandated that ayurvedic postgraduation in Shalyathanthra and Shalakyathanthra are mandated to undergo training to independently perform 58 procedures that include general surgery, urology, surgical gastroenterology, ENT, ophthalmology and dental medicine, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-invokes-esma-bans-doctors-from-going-on-strike-till-march-2021/story-NZEqwwCKOTI59J3heShJsK.html
11-12-2020||India||‘We may be back to normal in 2022’: Bill Gates||Hours before the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a commitment of a further $250 million to “support the research, development, and equitable delivery of lifesaving tools” in the fight against Covid-19, taking its total commitment to fighting the pandemic to $1.75 billion, Bill Gates, co-chair of the foundation, spoke to HT over a Zoom call. The conversation ranged from the development of vaccines to the stuttering progress of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance’s Covax programme, which aims to ensure Covid-19 vaccines are accessible and affordable for poor countries, to the timing of the world’s return to normalcy. Edited excerpts:Let’s start with vaccines. Given the progress made with vaccines over the last 12 months, and the way we have gone about finding a vaccine for Covid -- we now have a handful of vaccines, and there are perhaps going to be even more that work -- do you think we have cracked this? Is it one of those technology problems that we have solved? So the next time there is a big disease, it is not going to take us a long time to get a vaccine and we could probably have one out in 12 months?It’s very impressive that we have a vaccine in 12 months. And, you know, we will actually have vaccines from multiple approaches by the first quarter. The mRNA approach, which our foundation and a branch of the US government called Darpa have been funding for over 10 years, has proved to be the quickest. Now, the mRNA platform is not a fully mature platform. In fact, this is the first vaccine made that way. The actual thermostability and cost and scalability of making an mRNA vaccine is not as good as it will be for AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax. Some of the other constructs the world knows how to scale up, and 5-10 years from now, we will get the [mature] mRNA platform, [and it] will get rid of those problems.Do you think there is some kind of global north-south divide with the vaccine, because many of the vaccines are sort of being snapped up by the global north and countries like India have not struck vaccine deals with too many companies?Yes, there’s a huge challenge when you get into a pandemic, that the normal market mechanism will take the scarce resources and only make them available to the richest countries, and the richest people in those countries. And so, obviously you want governments to step up, both with the resources and with a more equitable allocation of those scarce resources. The good news on this is that if we can get a lot of vaccine factories doing something that has never happened before, which is being a second source -- that is, making like the AstraZeneca vaccine or the Novavax or Johnson & Johnson in factories in India -- then we get the capacity up, and the trade-off of having such short supply won’t be as painful. The rich countries will get somewhat more of the early allocations, but if we really push on getting these factories running, then we can make it so [that] it’s not such a severe problem. So that’s why I was super enthused that Serum (Institute of India), partly from with help from us (the Gates foundation has given $150 million to SII through Gavi) and partly from their own resources, is already manufacturing [the] AstraZeneca vaccine, and there is an arrangement that once Novavax is ready, which it will be in the first or the second quarter, Serum will also make that. And then Johnson & Johnson is talking to other Indian companies for possibly making their vaccine. So, the only way around this problem is to get a lot of capacity, and that’s why it’s important that we have these vaccines that are cheaper and easier to scale -- they get into the mix. [The] AstraZeneca vaccine will get approved in the UK before the end of the year, and then the other two in the first or second quarter. But this is a challenge, and this is the key role that the foundation is playing, to make sure that things like oxygen machines, dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies, and most importantly, vaccines, are getting to the entire world.Do you think Covax (the Gavi, WHO initiative) will make a difference?It’s been a little slow because the United States has not yet shown up to put money into that. I am talking almost every day with the politicians, the Congress, about it. We need to get at least $4 billion in there, for this Gavi vaccine procurement effort. And I am hopeful, you know, but we haven’t got that yet, and there is a question that we get it before January 20th. I can’t prove it, but I think that we will get it at some point in time, and I do think that getting the US to step forward like it has in the past, for things like HIV and malaria, that it has a proud record there… I do think that will start to unlock a lot of other money, so that at least for the Gavi countries that the vaccines, that the financing for the vaccines is not a limitation, and it is clear to the manufacturers that this very low cost price, cost-based price, will be reimbursed so that they should go full speed ahead.By the middle of next year there should be no supply problem, right? We will have enough vaccines.Yes. I believe because these other vaccines will get approved by summer 2021, across all these different constructs; it will be more about the logistics of getting the vaccines out. I think we will raise the money and we’ll have the manufacturing capacity, and so that, you know, for the rich world in 2021 and for the world as a whole… in the first half of 2022, we should be able to get the vaccine coverage that largely brings this pandemic to an end.Do you think things will get back to normal by the end of next year, by summer next year – kids back at school, businesses reopen completely?There will be… By the summer of 2021, the rich countries will have more vaccine coverage than other countries. So, the rich countries will be going mostly back to normal. But I still think because the virus will be in the world, we still will be somewhat conservative about large public events, we will still have some mask-wearing. We really need to get this virus eliminated, almost everywhere or else we have seen even in countries that have done a super good job -- like Australia or Singapore or Hong Kong or South Korea – they always run a risk of reinfection. So they’ve had to restrict tourism and other travel, but by summer that will start to open up. They won’t be totally back to normal but sometime in the first half of 2022, I do think we will be able to say that we’re back to normal.Tell us a little bit about all the interventions that the Gates Foundation has done to, sort of, help countries and companies on the Covid front.Well, you know, we will do a post mortem when it is all over. [There were] a lot of countries that reacted much faster, and a lot of countries where the messaging about mask-wearing was much better. Here in the United States, although the US did the best job of funding the R&D, in almost every other category, I would have expected it to be one of the best in the world, but we certainly were not. We were in some cases as bad as the worst cohort of countries in terms of how we got our testing ramped up, and how we got our agency, the CDC, to be able to be visible and talking about best practices.Covid was, in 2020, the primary focus of the foundation? Well, particularly if you include the idea that Covid has required us to get out bed nets, HIV medicines, it’s required us to take special efforts to maintain those efforts. Now, you know, take an area like TB; the amount of testing for TB in India has gone down quite a bit, and we will see a lot of spread [of the disease] there.This new $250 million contribution that we are announcing today gets us to $1.75 billion, specifically for Covid – and that’s manufacturing capacity, and research and development and procurement money for a number of the tools, including the vaccines. That’s a big number, its more than most governments have done, but we spend about $6 billion a year, and so, we’re maintaining all the other priorities, as a foundation. And adding this on top. So we’ll spend more. We will spend extra money because it’s a unique situation.A few of our efforts have been delayed, like some of the new vaccine trials or new drug trials have been delayed, so that, sadly that was money we couldn’t spend. But overall, most of the Covid stuff is on top of our other spending.One of the interesting things is that while we seem to have seen reasonable success with vaccines, we’ve had fairly poor success rates with drugs. We haven’t managed to find drugs that can treat Covid or any of the other medicines other than the steroids.The therapeutic area has been disappointing. You know, dexamethasone -- we funded a trial in the UK on that – is fairly low cost, that has a death reduction of about 30% at a late-stage intervention. Remdesivir may have a modest benefit but it’s not gigantic and it is fairly expensive. Now we’re trying to reformulate it to make it cheap, but we may not get that done in time to make much difference. So, the therapeutic area that I am the most enthusiastic about, that’s not out there yet, is monoclonal antibodies. We’ve partnered with Eli Lilly, and if we can prove that instead of having to do this through an IV infusion, we can give you two shots which are called subcutaneous or sub-cu shots, with 0.5 gm of the Eli Lilly antibody, we may be able to reduce the hospitalisations and death by over 70%. It’s not done yet. Eli Lilly got the emergency authorisation for the infusion approach in the United States, but now we are doing additional trial work because infusion is hard to scale up. It’s still possible that in a couple of months that could be a significant therapeutic treatment. We reserved factory capacity to make those antibodies, in a factory owned by Fuji Film; we are looking at the Eli Lilly antibody [treatment] for developing countries, and India is one of the countries we are talking about. There is still some work to be done, that may be a very powerful therapeutic.You have been studying what’s happening everywhere around the world. Why is it that the waves are sharp and concentrated in some regions, and spread out in others? We still don’t seem to be able to explain that?We understand some of the factors that go into that, but I have to say, it’s very surprising sometimes. We do know that cold weather allows the virus to multiply more, and it drags people indoors, and areas where you have older people; multigenerational households and more indoor activity we know are associated with a higher disease rate. But our ability to take that and put it into a model and predict here’s what’s going to happen in the countryside or New Delhi or in the US has actually been pretty weak. I fund a group called International Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), great forecasters, and they are willing to forecast four months into the future which other people were not willing to do, and they’ve had some things that they’ve done the best, but even they’ve been surprised. They did call this fall rebound that hit in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and the United States. They did predict that.The epidemic in some poor areas, particularly in Africa, has not been very bad, and yes, that’s partly the young population and the fact that they are outdoors a lot, but even so we are surprised how Covid in a direct sense has not been huge in Africa, although the economic disruption is causing huge problems not just in health, but also in education and jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-may-be-back-to-normal-in-2022-bill-gates/story-eGF2M9sNwHHUQu8Bs4HsOJ.html
11-12-2020||India||HC seeks EC reply on plea for withdrawing BJP’s election symbol||The Allahabad high court has directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to file its reply in a PIL petition on the alleged misuse of election symbols by political parties as their logos and for freezing/withdrawing the lotus — the country’s national flower and visible on several government websites — as the poll symbol of the BJP. A bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Piyush Agrawal passed the order on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by one Kali Shankar of Gorakhpur. The court has fixed January 12 as the next date of hearing in the case.Appearing for the petitioner, advocates Gulab Chandra Tiwari and Kapil Tiwari said, “Lotus is shown as a national flower and is also visible in various government websites. Therefore, no political party can be allowed to use it as its symbol as it will influence the minds of voters and the political party will get undue advantage.”According to the counsel for the petitioner, the life of election symbols is only for a specific election and a political party can’t use the symbol as its logo. As per the petitioner, if the political parties were permitted to use the election symbols perpetually, for purposes other than elections, it would be highly unjust for candidates not affiliated with recognised parties or independent candidates, as they got fresh symbols before each poll. The petitioner’s plea was that in most democratic countries, the concept of election symbols had already been withdrawn on attaining higher levels of literacy, but in our democratic set-up, there was no intention of the government to withdraw election symbols and go for elections by showing names of candidates in the script applicable.Under the Representation of People Act as well as the Election Symbols (Reservation & Allotment) Order, 1968 (Order of 1968), the concept of election symbols is applicable only for the purpose of elections and such symbols cannot be used as a logo of any political party, the petition said.The counsel appearing for the ECI sought some time to examine the issue and file a reply.The court directed the counsel for the petitioner to implead other parties as a respondent in the petition. The petition has raised several important issues pertaining to the allotment of election symbols by the ECI to candidates in accordance with the Representation of People Act, 1951.On April 4, 2019, the ECI rejected an application by the petitioner seeking freezing/withdrawal of the lotus as the election symbol of the BJP. Thereafter, the petitioner filed the PIL petition in the HC seeking quashing of the rejection order and directions to the ECI to issue fresh guidelines for the use of political symbols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-ec-reply-on-plea-for-withdrawing-bjp-s-election-symbol/story-cpjosG3hVllTVgINv4lhvJ.html
11-12-2020||India||Roshni Act: Punish illegal land grabbers, top court tells HC||The Supreme Court on Thursday observed that those who have illegally grabbed government land in Jammu and Kashmir under the 2001 Roshni Act should be punished and that the court will not come in the way of prosecution.“If anybody grabs the land illegally, they should be punished and we won’t come in your way,” remarked the SC bench headed by justice NV Ramana, as it heard a clutch of petitions against the J&K high court order of cancelling all proprietary rights and allotments under the contentious law.At the same time, the proceedings in the top court fetched reprieve for 68 petitioners, including J&K former finance minister Haseeb A Drabu and former chief secretary Mohammed Shafi Pandit, after the administration assured that no adverse steps shall be taken against them till the bench hears the matter again in January.The Supreme Court asked the high court to decide pleas seeking a review of the October 9 verdict that scrapped the Act that conferred proprietary rights on the occupants of the state land.The petitioners before the top court include former power development commissioner Nissar Hussain, former chief conservator of forest RK Mattoo, former judge Khaliq-ul-Zaman, businessmen Bharat Malhotra and Vikas Khanna, and retired commissioner Bashir Ahmed.The Roshni Act provided for transferring proprietary titles to occupants of government land in lieu of a fee, paving way for regularisation of encroachments on public land and simultaneously generating resources to fund power projects in J&K – hence, the name “Roshni”.The petitioners in SC have challenged the October 9 order of the HC, which declared all proprietary rights transferred under the Act as illegal, and directed the UT administration to recover the land. It ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the alleged corruption and unauthorised usurpation of the public land.On Thursday, the J&K administration submitted in the SC that it was committed to protecting landless cultivators and genuine allottees who might have been affected by the HC order of declaring the 2001 Roshni Act null and void.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the administration, also assured the court that there will not be any adverse or coercive action against the petitioners, most of whom, he added, appear to be bonafide allottees.On its part, the bench pointed out that review petitions against the adverse order were yet to be decided by the HC and hence, the apex court would want to wait for their outcome.The bench, however, also took note of the chief grievance by the petitioners that even though there was no finding on any illegality against their lawful occupation of the land, sweeping observations by the HC could lead to cancellation of their leasehold rights apart from making them subjects of CBI investigations. “We are only saying those affected should get a chance to be heard by some forum,” the bench told Mehta.In response, the SG submitted that the J&K administration has itself sought a review of the HC order in its bid to classify between the genuine occupants and fraudulent ones, and the matter will be heard by the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roshni-act-punish-illegal-land-grabbers-top-court-tells-hc/story-WCXvkjrnmGF1Q4bqJ92XiL.html

The fatality rate is 1.45 per cent, well below the global average of 2.29 per cent.” Vardhan informed the audience about the vaccine distribution expertise, production and storage capacity of the country, along with the presence of an experienced and vast network of professionals to streamline Covid vaccination.“India’s world-class research institutes have spearheaded the campaign against Covid-19 and are currently working towards facilitating capacity building for producing, distributing and administering the vaccine. A total of 260 vaccine candidates are in different stages of development globally.“Of these, eight are scheduled to be manufactured in India, including three indigenous ones. We have enthusiastically leveraged the support of international partners like the Oxford University, UK, and the Thomas Jefferson University, USA for vaccine research with Indian entities, both public and private,” he said.The minister concluded his speech by honouring the courage and sacrifice of numerous corona warriors across the globe, who have been at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-min-harsh-vardhan-says-govt-not-compromising-on-scientific-regulatory-norms-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-gzn0eEVDVtRRhLm3jDz9eK.html

We will implement it here (Bengal) too in letter and spirit once the rules are made,” Nadda said at a press conference, hours after his cavalcade was stoned by some people at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganans district. This is the second time the BJP spoke on this issue this month. The party will start campaigning from January for implementation of the new law, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Mukul Roy announced at a public meeting in Kolkata on December 6. The citizenship issue is bound to have an effect on the assembly polls due in about five months as chief minister Mamata Banerjee has declared that she will never enforce it. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act fast tracks citizenship for non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before December 31, 2014. Opponents of the law, among whom Banerjee is a prominent face, insist that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out Muslims and links citizenship to faith in a secular country. Accusing Banerjee of appeasing Muslims, Vijayvargiya said at the BJP programme at Mayo Road in Kolkata that his party will hit the streets next month to campaign for implementation of the law. “The chief minister calls the Prime Minister outsider. She calls the Union home minister outsider. But to her, the Rohingya refugees, who are spreading terror, and the infiltrators from Bangladesh are not outsiders. Mamata Ji is opposed to giving citizenship to Hindus who came to India as refugees. Why should we allow that?” Vijayvargiya had said on December 6. Mukul Roy made it clear that the issue would be raised by the BJP during campaign for elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citizenship-law-to-be-enforced-once-rules-are-made-says-jp-nadda/story-TcmVJ6vHmgqduuNpbc8mrK.html
11-12-2020||India||80% voter turnout in phase 2 of Bodo Territorial Council polls in Assam||Voting for the second and final phase of election to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in Assam concluded on Thursday with nearly 80% polling amid reports of stray incidents of violence. One poll official was injured in Chirang district during a clash between Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL) at a polling booth in Duttapara. Police had to fire in the air to disperse the crowd and ensure resumption of polling. While some allege that the poll official was trying to influence a voter, district officials said it was a case of misunderstanding. “The incident happened after a visually challenged voter entered the polling station unaccompanied by anyone. When the poll official tried to help him cast his ballot, other voters standing outside assumed that he was trying to influence the voter and attacked him (the poll official),” said Gautam Talukdar, deputy commissioner, Chirang. “Police present in the area resorted to blank fire in the air to bring the situation under control. The poll official has sustained injuries but is not critical. Chirang recorded 75% polling till 3:30 pm and the final figure is expected to cross 80%,” he added. A total of 111 candidates are in fray in the 19 constituencies in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts. Voting had taken place in 21 constituencies in Baksa and Udalguri districts the first phase of polling held on Monday. Voting started at 7:30 am and continued past 4:30 pm, the official time limit, as voters who arrived before that time were allowed to cast their ballot. Long queues of voters were seen lined up outside most polling stations since early morning prior to the start of voting. “The final polling percentage in Kokrajhar would be between 75% and 80%. Polling was by and large peaceful and went smoothly. As per Covid-19 protocols, face masks and sanitisers had been given to poll personnel and also for distribution among voters, if needed,” Bhaskar Phukan, deputy commissioner of Kokrajhar, said. Polling for the first phase on Monday had passed peacefully with over 77% voting. This is the first election being held in Assam since Covid-19 pandemic started. The polls were scheduled to be held in April but had to be postponed because of the pandemic and all the four districts under BTC placed under Governor’s rule. Assembly polls in Assam are due in March-April this year and BTC polls are being viewed as a semi-final contest.Since its formation in 2003, the BTC had been governed by Hagrama Mohilary, a former rebel who now heads the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), a partner in the ruling coalition headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as the third partner. But relations between the BJP and BPF started souring after BTC was placed under Governor’s rule. Both parties are now contesting the BTC polls separately. The BPF has fielded candidates in 37 seats while the BJP is contesting 26 and supporting Independent candidates in the other seats. Apart from the BJP and BPF, opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which have a tie-up for the assembly polls, are contesting 20 seats. Counting of votes will take place on December 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80-voter-turnout-in-phase-2-of-bodo-territorial-council-polls-in-assam/story-YBYiJlEg0XgEMTttTC14pI.html
11-12-2020||India||2 more persons hospitalised with symptoms of Eluru’s mysterious disease die||Two more persons who were afflicted with the mysterious disease in Andhra Pradesh’s Eluru died at a hospital in Vijayawada late Wednesday night but doctors said the causes of death were different. The deceased were identified as Subbaravamma (56) and Chandra Rao (50), who were admitted to the Eluru government hospital on Sunday with symptoms of convulsions and giddiness. They were shifted to a government hospital Vijayawada on Monday. Andhra Pradesh health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas alias Nani told reporters after visiting the Vijayawada hospital on Thursday that the two deaths were not because of the “strange disease” that struck Eluru. “They were indeed admitted to the hospital with similar symptoms. However, doctors have confirmed that one of them, Subbaravamma, succumbed to Covid-19 and the other person Chandra Rao died of heart stroke,” the minister said. Eluru government hospital superintendent A V R Mohan said so far, only one person – Sridhar (45) -- died of the symptoms of the mysterious disease. “The other two also had these symptoms but they died of other health complications,” he said.He said the two patients had been admitted to the Eluru hospital first with symptoms of mysterious disease. “But since they had other serious health issues, we shifted them to Vijayawada hospital,” he said. State chief secretary Neelam Sawhney visited the government hospital at Eluru on Thursday and interacted with the patients. She later held a meeting with the experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences and doctors of the hospitals to find out the latest position. The Eluru hospital superintendent said the number of cases of mysterious disease was gradually declining. As on Thursday evening, the total number of patients who suffered from the disease was 599 of which 528 patients were discharged. “Only nine persons got admitted since morning,” he said. Mohan said doctors, with the support of ward secretariat staff, had been observing the condition of the discharged patients. “Experts from various institutes have been probing the cases in all angles. They have also collected blood samples from even animals and food substances like rice, pulses and vegetables in Eluru but also in surrounding villages,” he said. The health minister said results of various tests conducted on blood, water and food samples were expected by Friday evening. “The experts are studying how traces of heavy metals were found in the blood samples of patients. The government is conducting medical camps in the affected areas to give treatment if there are any symptoms of the strange disease,” Nani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-persons-hospitalised-with-symptoms-of-eluru-s-mysterious-disease-die/story-Pqw8UIUyQdC2CcEAHkU1bM.html
11-12-2020||Editorials||Beyond the Paris pact | HT Editorial||The Paris Agreement to battle the climate crisis marks its fifth year with renewed hope and renewed urgency. The hope lies in the knowledge that the world’s largest economy, the United States (US), will rejoin the Paris pact next month. The urgency lies in the recognition that the agreement does not go far enough in keeping the world average temperature increase below the 2 degree Celsius danger mark. India can hold its head up high. The Narendra Modi government’s ambitious renewable energy programme has meant India will easily surpass its carbon emission commitments under the Paris agreement. Equally telling, a consortium of green think tanks recently declared India the only 2C compatible major economy in the world.Despite the agreement, the world experienced its highest temperatures over the past five years. Even a pandemic-induced economic lockdown only reduced carbon emissions by seven per cent. The coming task, as all governments recognise, is how to go beyond Paris. The decision of the US, Brazil and others to ignore their Paris commitments is a reminder that large, cumbersome multilateral agreements are not necessarily the only or even the best way to curb carbon. The return of the US opens the gate for large-scale financial and technological assistance for the renewable goals of countries such as India. And innovative ways to accomplish this bilaterally or otherwise will define global green policy in the coming decade.New Delhi must know the global green transformation will not be all smooth. Green technology will determine future global economic competitiveness. The European Union (EU) plans to introduce carbon tariffs next year and merge climate policy with trade wars. Working out the proper political equations will be as important as setting out market-friendly incentives at home to ensure investment flows down the proper green channels. The largest corporations of the world have already begun putting their money on a green future. Eleven of the Group of 20 countries have declared net zero carbon targets, with China, EU and Japan among the most recent economies to do so. Climate now has far greater public acceptance across the world than it has ever had — and the shock and awe of the Paris accord contributed to this new green consensus. But India must be ready for a new world of climate that will be as much about cooperation as it will be about competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/beyond-the-paris-pact-ht-editorial/story-FB8TqjoROg2fqtCm8Pz1OM.html
11-12-2020||Editorials||In Bengal, preserve democratic space | HT Editorial||There is little doubt that the key political battle of 2021 — and indeed of the next four years till the 2024 general election — will be fought in West Bengal. Ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided to aggressively expand in the east, and put up a formidable challenge in the Lok Sabha elections winning 18 of the 42 seats, the Trinamool Congress has been worried about the rise of a new challenger. This is healthy for democracy, for strong political and electoral competition gives voters choices and introduces checks and balances.But a key tenet of this democratic competition is the need for a peaceful political space — where all actors can exercise their right to mobilise citizens, organise political demonstrations, and campaign actively. West Bengal has had a history of political violence and strong-arm tactics by ruling dispensations. Indeed, the three-decade-plus rule of the Left front was marked not just by its progressive land reforms and welfare schemes, but also coercion and total capture of state institutions, down to the level of panchayats. No one knows this better than Mamata Banerjee, who braved physical assaults and fought a long battle to oust the Left.And that is why the onus is on Ms Banerjee to ensure a climate of peaceful and free political contestation. Repeated reports of attacks and harassment of BJP leaders and activists — based on control of State institutions and a coercive party machinery on the ground — are unacceptable in a democracy. Just as the BJP itself needs to allow this peaceful space for democratic challenges wherever it is dominant, the Trinamool must do so in Bengal. Only then will the 2021 contest be a true expression of popular will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-bengal-preserve-democratic-space-ht-editorial/story-3Urydt0wvAVlaGvxq8EOKN.html
